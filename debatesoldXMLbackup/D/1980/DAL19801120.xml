      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we are entitled to ask the Taoiseach pertinent questions at <Col N="866" /> this time?  There is long-established precedent for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the situation here.  The Standing Orders prescribe the procedure on parliamentary questions for obtaining information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Orders are there and there is also precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision for instant questions on every possible subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing every possible subject.  I am discussing a matter of considerable national importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question for the House to decide any change in these matters.  The Standing Orders are there and I have to deal with the Standing Orders as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for 15 years and I have never seen a precedent for that ruling by a Member occupying the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but we have to deal with matters which relate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow a further curtailment of Members' rights in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to give as much lattitude as possible.  I want to try to keep within the Standing Orders.  When we are dealing with the Order of Business we should be doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Standing Orders are there and all occupants of the Chair are guided by precedent.  There is a firmly established precedent for this type of question on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied precedent and I have not seen in the book <Col N="867" /> provided to me anything in connection with that in relation to precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest to the Chair that you ask your staff to provide you with the book because it is undoubtedly there.  Would the Taoiseach tell me if the H-Block issue has been referred to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy. If every possible question is raised now we will have two sets of questions. We will have parliamentary questions and we will have instant questions and I do not know where we will end up with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not end up anywhere because it has been long established. There is no departure from procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not appear to be that way to me.  Certainly from any documentation I have on this matter, my information and the advice I have got in respect of this is that matters relating to the Order of Business as announced may be raised or the Chair has allowed questions on matters on the Order Paper or on business promised by the Government.  To bring up every sort of question on the Order of Business would create a situation where we will have two systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to come into conflict with the Chair but it is an extremely important departure from the rights of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  If the House wants to change the rules let the House change the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not trying to change the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in touch already with the leader of the Fine Gael Party and I had hoped to be in touch with the leader of the Labour Party today with a view to the three of us having a meeting, <Col N="868" /> perhaps next week, as already suggested in the House, to see if we can come to some new arrangement about those various matters which are causing grave concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly be glad to follow any direction I get from the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime, all I want to do is to continue with normal procedure.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House if the Government support the political status of the people in H-Block?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

I want to ask if it is in order for me to seek time from the Taoiseach for a debate on the two breaches of the national understanding on the part of the Government?  Also will the Taoiseach give time for a debate due to the fact that the promise in relation to the White Paper on education has not been met?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a question. I am asking a question on the subject matter for a debate.  Secondly, the fact that the unemployment figures are 28,000 worse than the Government admitted them to be to the national assembly?  Will time be given for a debate on those two subjects?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £959,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid. </P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to give the House details of the Supplementary Estimate on Vote 3, which is the Vote for my Department and also the Supplementary Estimate on Vote 5 for An Chomhairle Ealaiéon.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for my Department amounts to £959,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first element in this Supplementary Estimate is a provision of £82,000 for the National Economic and Social Council.  The Government have asked NESC to review and report on, as soon as possible, industrial policy in the manufacturing and services sector.  A sum of £30,000 had been allocated by NESC for work in this area during 1980.  Further work was to be undertaken during 1981. In view of the Government's desire to have the council's recommendations at an early date, it was agreed by the council that outside expertise in industrial policy from a national perspective should be used in order to have the project completed by the end of 1980.  The sum now sought, £82,000, arises from the fact that <Col N="874" /> all the cost relating to this work will now be borne during 1890.</P>
    <P>The supplementary amount required by the National Board for Science and Technology in 1980 is £835,000.  This amount will enable the board to meet commitments in such areas as marine research, environmental studies, educational grants and the employment of research worker in the higher education sector.</P>
    <P>The third element in this Supplementary Estimate is the provision of £65,000 towards the cost of a major study which has been commissioned by the Government on the impact of microelectronics in Ireland.  This study will examine the possible effects of this technology on different sectors of the economy.  The Government wish to be fully apprised of all the implications in order to take whatever steps are necessary to meet the challenge which the ongoing development of high technology and its ever-increasing use in all sectors of industrial and commercial life presents.  The National Board for Science and Technology is undertaking the groundwork for the study and State-sponsored bodies, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the trade unions will also be involved.  The study, which will take two years to complete, will cost £130,000.  The cost in 1980 is £65,000 and I will be seeking to provide for the balance in next year's Estimate for my Department.  The European Commission have agreed to contribute 50 per cent of the cost and this is reflected in the printed Supplementary Estimate, which was circulated to Members, as an appropriation-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The final elment in the Supplementary Estimate is a provision of £10,000 in respect of the management and running of the National Concert Hall, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, for the remainder of 1980.  Most Deputies will be familiar with the background to the establishment of the National Concert Hall.  The Government announced in May 1974 a proposal for the conversion of the Great Hall and ancillary accommodation in the old UCD building at Earlsfort Terrace to provide a base for the RTE Symphony Orchrstra <Col N="875" /> and a concert hall suitable for orchestral recitals.</P>
    <P>The board of directors of the company have not yet been appointed, but I expect to be in a position to make an announcement shortly in that regard.</P>
    <P>The financing of the company will be by way of a grant-in-aid from the Vote for my Department and this income will be supplemented by box-office receipts and letting fees.  It is difficult at this stage to estimate the financial assistance which the company will require annually, but the directors will be expected to ensure that the concert hall will be self-financing to the greatest extent that circumstances permit.  The figure of £10,000 for this year should amply cover the initial costs of the company.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the concert hall will be a most welcome and vital addition to our cultural life and I know that members of this House will join with me in wishing the venture every success.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Supplementary Estimate for An Chomhairle Ealaiéon.  This will cover increased salary, overtime and social insurance payments in the Abbey Theatre &mdash; arising mainly from the implementation of recommendations in a report by Senator Dr. T. K. Whitaker on the remuneration level of Abbey actors. It will also meet the financial cost of transferring reasponsibility for funding certain items from Bord Faéilte to the council, with effect from 1 January, 1980.</P>
    <P>As well as the pay element the Supplementary Estimate reflects the fact that, at Bord Faéilte's request, several projects which the board financed, or jointly financed with others, have not been transferred to the Arts Council and it would not be reasonable to expect the council to take over responsibility for assistance to those organisations without an addition to their annual grant.  This I am now doing by way of an increased grant to the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin by taking the item in the Supplementary Estimate relating to the National Board for Science and Technology.  Briefly, the Government made it clear, when the concept of <Col N="876" /> a national science budget was mooted and introduced, that it would be subject to debate in this House.  I hope that the Government have not forgotten that intention and that when the question of debating a national science budget is raised in this House by anybody from these benches or from the Labour Party benches, we shall not be told in the kind of tone we have heard recently that this is a matter for the Whips, as though it were some remote and eccentric whim of the Opposition that they wish to debate such a matter, which, as I say, the Government last year went out of its way to make clear would be the subject of regular debate here.  I do not make any further allegations other than that, because the speech we have just heard made no reference to the science budget, good or bad, or to the intention to debate it.  I hope that it will be brought before this House in a debatable form and not after pushing and shoving by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The second thing I want to say relates to the circulation of the report of the National Economic and Social Council for which a grant-in-aid is provided in this Supplementary Estimate.  I am speaking now about the report which was leaked to and summarised in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.  It is clear, &mdash; and I hope I am not wrong in interpreting it like this &mdash; from the internal evidence of that summary, assuming it is an accurate summary, that that report was completed many weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected, months ago.  It is clear that the unemployment projections in it are so far overhauled by events that they must have been written on paper some time back in the very early autumn and perhaps even at the end of summer.  I cannot put an exact date on it, but it certainly looks like that.  It looks as though those figures were put down at a time when the avalanche of redundancies; closures and short-times which we have seen in the last months had not yet made the appropriate impression on the people who put that report together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> I simply do not believe &mdash; of course, it was not said here by anybody, but in case anybody hereafter should say it &mdash; that that report in substance, if not word for word, has not been available to the Government for many months.  I believe it has been so available.  When the deputy leader of the Labour Party asked across the floor of the House yesterday when he would have the benefit of the Government's reaction to this report he was told that the ordinary procedures were being adhered to, that the NESC had submitted their report, and that it went to various Government Departments for their observations before it would be returned to the Government.  I should like to know the reason for the delay in the circulation of this report which has spread now over at least two months.  Perhaps Deputy Desmond is right when he guessed it is probably more than that.</P>
    <P>What useful observations have the Department of Defence, for example, got to make on the NESC Report that could not be made in ten minutes after finishing perusal of it?  What observations have the Department of Education got that could not be made within a day or two after perusal of the report?  What observations have the Department of the Environment got &mdash; I am working up the scale in terms of strictly economic relevance &mdash; that would not be available, if that Department was interested in getting the report out before it became obsolete and unless, overtaken by the shambles the Government are putting the country into all around us, within a couple of days of perusing that report?  What observations could the Department of Finance, now presided over by Deputy O'Kennedy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a point of order.  I seek the guidance of the Chair. The Supplementary Estimate with which we are concerned deals with a report by the National Economic and Social Council which has not yet been completed or published and which is not the report about which the Deputy is speaking.  I seek the guidance of the Chair as to whether the Deputy is in order or whether his remarks should be confined <Col N="878" /> to the report covered by the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would not kill the Taoiseach to hear a little about a report the Government have been sitting on for the past three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks should be confined to what is covered in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be sorry if the nice things said about the Chair, and sincerely said, a couple of weeks ago would turn sour and I do not wish to be the first to make them do so but I have the distinct recollection in my few years in the House of Cinn Comhairle allowing discussion on Supplementary Estimates to range somewhat beyond the actual matter for which they were presented.  That was done particularly in a case like this where I am dealing not with the general work of the Department but with the specific work of one of the bodies under that Department. If that body had underspent its general allocation, if it had not been necessary, because of savings under other heads, to raise this extra money, this Supplementary Estimate would not be before us. Accordingly, it seems to me to be opposite &mdash; I do not wish to fight with the Chair over this &mdash; to mention this NESC Report which absolutely contradicts everything which the Government, from their leader down, and that is quite far, have said and have been saying over the last months about the way the economy is going and the influences which were at work upon it.  Every single thing is contradicted and I consider it a disgrace that a report of this kind could be sat upon for so long until it is virtually useless, a museum piece, a piece that might as well be a report on the National Museum to take an instance from a former Department headed by the present occupant of the Chair when three years elapsed between the time the report was signed and finally published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say one final thing before I leave the subject of the NESC and I hope it will not be interpreted by anyone as an attack on a public servant.  I hate those mealy-mouthed ripostes to political charges which take the line that one cannot say a certain thing because one is hitting a man who is not here to defend himself.  I am not hitting a man but I am saying that this event points up the appositeness of what was said from this side of the House when the former practice of appointing an outside chairman was departed from and when a chairman was appointed who was the Secretary of the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have said enough about it.  The third thing I wish to say with regard to the Supplementary Estimate &mdash; I hope it will not fall foul of the Chair's good temper &mdash; bears on the operations of An Chomhairle Ealaiéon.  I hope I am in order if I make a modest suggestion for a useful national job, of a kind which once upon a time the leaders of the State did not think it beneath them to take a bit of modest interest in the sense of recognising their own limitations. I should like to suggest a job for An Chomhairle Ealaiéon which is that they should be asked by some Minister &mdash; I do not care which because as far as I can remember they can give advice to any Minister who asks for it &mdash; to look at the situation in regard to the design of our coinage which once was a matter of world pride and now is a matter of shame and disgrace.  I do not wish to say anything which will wound the relations of the people who are responsible for producing the design.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair cannot pretend, I hope, that I am confined only to the items on which this money is to be spent. I wish Deputy Cluskey was here to raise a more eloquent voice than mine on matters of procedure.  The Chair has now introduced an unprecedented limitation, in my short experience, of the way the Daéil works.  The present coinage is a monument to the Taoiseach's taste and pride.  More than once he has attempted to evade responsibility for it by saying, untruly, that a competition was held for it and by saying, again untruly, that the Central Bank was the organ responsible for producing it.  It is shabby, the design is awkward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>The remark just made imputes to me personal venom.  I should like to assure the Deputy who made that remark that as far as I am aware he has never done me any personal harm and, I suppose, has never had any reason to do so.  I harbour no personal venom whatever but I regarded him on 6 December last year as unsuitable for the post which he now holds, I am sorry to say.  I still regard him as unsuitable.</P>

The matters which I feel strongly about I make no secret of and anybody who may do me the compliment of taking an interest in them will recognise that some of the things I have been saying are some old hobby horses of mine, some old chestnuts. I freely admit that, I am not a bit ashamed of it.  At least I feel sorry about some things and I do not think it can be said about me that I do not give a damn, a comment which is at the root of my objection to the present incumbency of the leadership of the Government.</P>

I take that in my stride, as part of the day's work, part of what we <Col N="882" /> are paid to put up with but I believe I am entitled to hand it out as well as take it.</P>
      <P>There are three things arising on the subhead to which I wish to draw the attention of the House.  If you will allow me, Sir, I would like to say something a good deal less contentious and brief about the Department generally taken to have parliamentary responsibility for the way the Daéil works.  I will be very short if you will indulge me.  I will not give the House any rhetoric about this.  I believe there is a strong case for relaxing in two types of instances the six-month rule applied to parliamentary questions.  The first instance is the way in which a reply is given in the form of a tabular statement. Secondly, the form of written replies.</P>

      <P>There are only two occasions in the year on which one can say anything about the way in which the Daéil works.  One would be on an Adjournment Debate or a Budget debate, although I remember a budget debate being cut fairly short by your predecessor. The other is on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.  Do not forget that the Estimate's first sub-title is a supplementary estimate for the amount required for the year ending 31 December 1980 for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.  Surely we will acquiesce in an unprecedented abridgment of the customs of speech here if the general affairs of the Department are not allowed to be mentioned even briefly, even in passing, on this Estimate. The same goes for other Departments.  I do not make a special case for this Department.</P>

      <P>I wish to make four or five points very briefly on this Supplementary Estimate.  I welcome the provision of £82,000 for the National Economic and Social Council.  I welcome the fact that the NESC have been asked to review and report as soon as possible on industrial policy in the manufacturing and services sector.  This will prove to be a particularly useful and valuable exercise. I do not want to sound unduly contentious but I hope when the report is made available to the Government by the NESC it will be published as rapidly as possible and not suffer the fate of the current report which is being hawked around from Department to Department.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I welcome the supplementary estimate of £835,000 for the National Board for Science and Technology.  I was very taken aback when I saw the Book of Estimates for 1980 and the slashing in it.  I put it down to the blood letting after the demise of the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  The Taoiseach not only kicked out the Minister and his Department, but also half of that valuable estimate in the process.  The NBST were equally taken aback to find themselves minus almost £1 million.  Fortunately common sense prevailed in later months and on second thoughts the Taoiseach decided magnanimously to provide those moneys for basic, ongoing and fundamental research by that board.  I am glad that exercise is over now and that the board can get on with their work.  I have no doubt that their contribution will <Col N="885" /> be effective not only in that area but also in the area of micro electronics where they are doing some valuable work and where we need a great deal of expertise at national level.</P>
      <P>I welcome the £10,000 for the national concert hall.  I hope the Taoiseach will nominate a board of directors as soon as possible.  I hope the board will be as broadly based as possible.</P>

      <P>That would be most welcome.  Many people who are involved in cultural and artistic activities in our community would be willing to serve on it.  I welcome the rationalisation of the supplementary Estimate for An Chomhairle Ealaiéon.  Because of the peripheral involvement of Bord Fáilte in certain areas an element of confusion has arisen in some respects, and I am glad it has been sorted out.  The House will have done a useful morning's work in giving the Taoiseach this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>On behalf of this side of the House I welcome the Supplementary Estimate for An Chomhairle Ealaiéon. Unfortunately, down through the years there has been no Government policy on the Arts.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would have a White Paper on the arts prepared to give the Arts their proper place in our society.  Recently on behalf of the Arts Council, Ciaraén Benson published a paper, &ldquo;The Place of Arts in Irish Society&rdquo; and made 119 recommendations.  If they were implemented the place of the arts in our educational system initially and then in society would be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start again.  On behalf of this side of the House I welcome the Supplementary Estimate and especially the figure of £300,000 for An Chomhairle Ealaiéon.  Down through the years the Arts Council have been totally underfinanced and any extra funding is welcome.  Due to the ravages of inflation this increase to £300,000 to the Arts Council will not be the success we might have hoped but it at least shows the goodwill of the Taoiseach and his Department in giving the arts their proper place in our society.  Recently at the behest of the Arts Council Mr. Ciaran Benson produced a very worthwhile document on the place of the arts in our educational system and he made 119 recommendations.  If the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education implemented some of these recommendations the place of arts in our society would be firmly established.</P>
      <P>We commend the input being made by the 17 members of the Arts Council on a voluntary unpaid basis.  The Taoiseach might consider issuing a White Paper on the scope of arts in society as this area has been neglected throughout the years. Unfortunately during recessions things especially in the artistic world are pushed to the side.  That is quite understandable when our first consideration must be employment and so on.  Despite any recession I suggest that the Taoiseach should consider continually funding the Arts Council to enable them to continue their splendid work.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the national concert hall is nearing fruition.  It is amazing that it took so many years for our capital city to have such a hall, but it is better late than never.  When appointing the board of directors I hope the Minister will appoint people with the necessary experience, expertise and artistic background so that we will have a national concert hall worthy of this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the help being given to the actors in the Abbey Theatre.  The Taoiseach has included funds for increases of salary, for overtime and social insurance for actors in the Abbey and he may extend that to include all actors.  I know the Taoiseach recently <Col N="887" /> introduced an amendment order which enables funds for the Arts Council to be used to help dependants of creative workers in the arts.  This is a very welcome trend.  I would refer the Taoiseach to the recent survey carried out on behalf of the Arts Council by Irish Marketing Surveys Limited which is called &ldquo;Living and working conditions of artists&rdquo;.  A small synopsis of that report gives very disturbing figures in respect of creative artists. About two-thirds of artists have made no provision for pensions: the vast majority experience a month of unemployment each year and that period ranges from six to seven months in some cases, 75 per cent of creative and 50 per cent of interpretative artists have jobs in addition to their artistic work.  Some teach in subjects related to their artistic work but 28 per cent of creative artists and one-third of interpretative artists have jobs ranging from community director to waiter, entirely outside of their artistic occupation. I just mention that to bring to the Taoiseach's attention the conditions under which artists have to live.  Surely in a caring community we should ensure that artistic people are not living on the breadline.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I welcome this effort to give support to the actors in the Abbey Theatre and hope that in next year's budget the recommendations of the report on the working and living conditions of artists will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Taoiseach on his continued interest in the arts and I look forward to discussing An Chomhairle Ealaiéon in greater detail on the main Estimate.  I understand that in this debate we are restricted purely to the Supplementary Estimate.  Perhaps when replying the Taoiseach will tell us what functions were transferred from Bord Faéilte to the Arts Council so that we will have a full background to the new workings of An Chomhairle Ealaiéon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last question first.  Generally speaking these are festivals which were funded and subsidised by An Bord Faéilte up to now and <Col N="888" /> they are being transferred to the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>The two main points emerging from this debate was the proposal by Deputy Desmond about the composition of the board of directors and the new concert hall.  I hope to constitute that board very soon and I agree that it should be broadly representative and that the membership will be of considerable importance because a great deal of the potential success or otherwise of the concert hall will depend on the experience and qualifications of the membership of the board.  I hope we will be able to provide a broadly based representative board to operate the new concert hall.</P>
      <P>The other matter raised was about the general scope of the operation of the Arts Council.  The suggestion that a White Paper might be prepared on the future of the arts is interesting and I would certainly consider it.  I have spoken on occasions about some of the problems which confront the Arts Council and the one which is occupying most people's attention at the moment is the problem of individual artists.  In this connection the report published about working conditions of artists is of great interest and value.  I assure Deputies that this problem is under very active consideration at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputies know that a subsidiary aspect of the problem was dealt with in this House and in the Seanad yesterday when we took power to subsidise through the Arts Council the Coiste Colmcille.  That fund is available to help out artists who have fallen on bad times and their dependants. As I explained in the Seanad yesterday that is only one comparatively minor area of the whole problem and one would like to see a situation brought about whereby creative artists would simply, through the practice of their profession, be able to provide for themselves and their dependants.  That is a question to which we are actively addressing our minds at present.  If the Deputy wishes to come and talk to me about it I would be interested to discuss the possibilities and problems with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £39,783,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid. </P>
      <P>The main Estimate for Agriculture for 1980 amounted to £140,041,000 which with this Supplementary Estimate brings the total net provision for the year to £179,824,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1980 has been a difficult year for farmers, the problems on the economic and marketing side being aggravated by unfavourable weather conditions especially during the summer and autumn.  The Government have been very conscious of the adverse situation in the agricultural industry and the severe pressure on farmers' incomes.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I have had several discussions during the year with the main farming organisations, and in recent months the Government have taken a number of measures to help farmers to overcome their difficulties and to ensure the highest possible level of agricultural production.  These measures account for <Col N="890" /> the bulk of the present Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The biggest increase &mdash; £23 million &mdash; is in respect of the farm modernisation scheme at Subhead M1. A sum of £36.5 million was provided in the original Estimate in respect of grants to farmers under the farm modernisation scheme including the western drainage scheme.  This sum has proved to be inadequate because of the unprecedented number of claims being received for payment.  Notwithstanding the difficult situation in agriculture, farmers continue to show a high level of confidence in the future of their industry by investing at an unprecedented rate in land improvement, buildings and so on.  As a result a further sum of £23 million is required to cover payments under these schemes for the remainder of the year, that is £8 million in addition to the £15 million increase announced in September.  This will bring the total to £59.5 million by the end of this year, or 70 per cent more than the £34.5 million paid last year.</P>
    <P>The encouraging level of investment in farm development is an indication that despite their difficulties farmers have confidence in the long-term prospects for agriculture.  Higher productivity is vital to agricultural prosperity and this can be achieved through judicious capital investment. Our agriculture was badly under-capitalised before we joined the European Community, and it was clear that considerable investment would be required if we were to exploit the opportunities which membership of the Community offered.  Much has been done since and many of our farms are now highly developed.  But there is still scope for further improvement, particularly by way of land improvement.  Here, of course, the investment aids under the farm modernisation scheme and the western drainage scheme are of the utmost benefit and by providing as much as £23 million extra in this Supplementary Estimate the Government are showing in a positive way how they are prepared to assist and encourage farmers to make worthwhile investment that will lead to an expansion of production.</P>
    <P>Another important element in the <Col N="891" /> package of measures announced in September was the substantial increase in livestock headage grants payable to farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  An additional £8.432 million is now being sought under Subhead M.3 to finance the increased grants.  In the case of cattle and beef cows, the higher rates payable have been increased from £17 last year to £32 this year, while the lower rates have been increased from £13 to £28.  In the case of sheep, the various rates have been increased by £1 and now stand at £5 per head for mountain hoggets, £4.50 for other hoggets and £4 for mountain lambs. These very substantial increases have been made possible largely as a result of the raising of the level of FEOGA reimbursement from 35 per cent to 50 per cent, which I successfully negotiated in the EEC prices package earlier in the year.  In the case of suckler herds, farmers will also qualify for an EEC premium of £13.18 which will be paid early next year on each suckler cow of a specified meat producing breed and also for an additional national premium of £12 on each cow over and above the number present in the herd at the 1979-80 round test for tuberculosis.  One result of these increases will be to bring to as much as £57.18 the grant for each additional cow that also qualifies for headage payments in the disadvantaged areas.  I hope that the attractive incentives now available will help to reverse the downward trend and boost the size of the beef suckler herd.</P>
    <P>During the year the sheep industry encountered some uncertainty because of the delay in introducing the common organisation of the market for sheepmeat and also because of some curtailment of our exports to France.  In order to help producers I announced in June the reintroduction from 1 September of grants under the mountain lamb extension scheme in respect of exports of mountain wether lambs.  The rate then announced was £1.50 per head but in view of the difficulties affecting hill sheep producers the Government decided in September to double the grant to £3 per lamb.  I am glad to say that this measure has been <Col N="892" /> very successful, and substantial numbers of lambs have come from the mountains either for fattening on the lowlands or for export, mainly to Italy.  The additional expenditure for this scheme and for the lowland hogget ewe subsidy scheme is provided for under subhead D.5.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, agreement was recently reached, after many years of negotiations, on a common organisation of the market for sheepmeat.  Community arrangements will take the place of national measures for the support of the sheep industry.  Sheep producers can now look forward with greater confidence to the future, and I am confident that they will meet the challenge and opportunities of a Community-wide market and expand production of quality lambs.</P>
    <P>A new provision of £600,000 is being included under Subhead D10 for winter fodder schemes.  Because of the severe effect of bad weather on the hay crop this year special schemes were introduced in August to encourage the production of additional winter fodder.  These schemes provided for, firstly, a subsidy of £20 per tonne of calcium ammonium nitrate or equivalent high nitrogen fertiliser purchased and used between 13 August and 6 September and, secondly, a subsidy of £3 per tonne of silage made on farms which had not made silage before, up to a maximum of 50 tonnes per farm.</P>
    <P>I expect that some 17,000 farmers altogether will benefit from these schemes. The success of the schemes is most encouraging, and I am particularly glad that many producers who did not previously make silage have come to realise the advantages of silage as winter fodder. Increased production of silage will put producers in a better position to carry more stock over the winter months, and so help to counteract the traditional heavy disposals of cattle in the autumn, which can only weaken prices at that time.</P>
    <P>As a food producing and exporting country we must be prepared to concentrate more attention on the promotion of a high quality image for Irish food. Mainly because of lack of funds we lag considerably behind our competitors in this field.  Admittedly Coéras Traéctaéla and <Col N="893" /> the various agricultural marketing agencies do a certain amount of promotional work but even their efforts are limited and there is, I feel, a void in adequately promoting Ireland as a food exporter on a general level.  In an effort to make a start in tackling this problem I decided in June last that £75,000 would be made available for suitable projects recommended by the Agricultural Exports Co-Ordinating Group for the promotion of agricultural exports generally.  This sum is accordingly being provided under subhead E3.  It will be matched by an equal contribution from the export agencies represented on the group.  The money will be used for promotional work additional to, and of a more general nature, than that carried out by the agencies for their individual products.  I fully realise that the amount is small for the job I have in mind but at least it is a start.  Already the group have carried out surveys on attitudes of people in France and Germany to Irish food products and they have followed up these studies with general advertising campaigns for Irish food in the countries mentioned as well as some specific store promotions.</P>
    <P>A further element in the September package of measures to assist farmers was the allocation of an Exchequer contribution to maintain the charges to herdowners for the treatment of their cattle for warbles at last year's levels.  Subhead C4 includes a provision of £440,000 to meet the cost of this measure in 1980. Apart altogether from animal welfare considerations, the eradication of the warble fly will enhance the health status of our national herd and will add considerably to the value of livestock output by improving milk yields, by improving the quality and size of beef-cattle, and by eliminating warble-damaged hides. Despite a late start to this season's campaign the number of animals dressed to date has been satisfactory compared with previous years.  I would again urge all herdowners to co-operate fully with the A1 centres which are responsible for the dressing and certification of animals under the scheme.</P>
    <P>A feature of this year's Warble Fly Eradication Scheme is the exemption of <Col N="894" /> herdowners in County Donegal from the requirement of having to treat their cattle. This exemption covers over 200,000 animals and it is envisaged that, in the event of eradication schemes in future years, similar relief could be extended to herdowners in other areas which, like Donegal, achieve a consistently low incidence of warble infestation.</P>
    <P>Under subhead A.1 provision is made for a further £1.4 million to meet the cost of pay increases under the 1980 national understanding, as well as other miscellaneous increases in pay and allowances. The increases under subheads B4, 11, and J amounting to over £1.75 million are also due mainly to the implementation of pay increases, including the national understanding, by An Foras Taluéntais, Coéras Beostoic agus Feola and Bord na gCapall.  An additional £975,000 is being sought under subhead A.3 to meet the cost of increases in travelling and subsistence rates which were sanctioned during the year, and to provide for increased inspection activity, particularly on the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>The excess of £467,000 on subhead B.7 is due principally to the cost of salaries of officers of my Department who transferred to ACOT on 1 July and to the cost of the new national understanding for staff generally in that organisation.  There are a number of savings on several subheads as well as a deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid because of the transfer of staff and functions to ACOT on 1 July. These arise only because the transfer had to be made during the course of the year. In future years, finance for ACOT will be provided in a single subhead.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C2 a sum of £8,397,000 was provided in the main Estimate for bovine tuberculosis eradication measures. This sum was almost £1.4 million more than was provided in 1979 but it is now necessary to seek an additional £2,363,000 to meet the overall cost of these measures in 1980.  The increased expenditure is attributable in the main to three factors: firstly, higher fees for TB testing payable to veterinary practitioners, arising from acceptance of an independent assessment of fee structures; secondly, an increase in travelling and <Col N="895" /> subsistence expenses of Department staff engaged in the operation of the eradication scheme; and thirdly, the disclosure of a higher number of reactors than was anticipated.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made with TB eradication but there is still some way to go. Although the incidence figures from the current round of testing which started in June show an improvement on the last round, it is disquieting to find that more than one in every 40 herds is still turning up reactors.  On top of that we have a few thousand more herds locked up from earlier rounds and from pre-movement tests and lesions discovered at factories.  The southern dairying counties where TB incidence was always highest are now showing a marked improvement.  On the other hand, the position is deteriorating in some midland counties.  My Department are watching these trends carefully and will do everything possible to identify the cause of these outbreaks.  In the last analysis, however, it is the farmer who owns the cattle who can do most to see to it that once his herd is clear it remains so.</P>
    <P>The excess arising on bovine TB is offset by a saving of £1,350,000 in expenditure on brucellosis under subhead C3 and a saving of £999,990 under subhead C5 because the balance in the hardship fund is adequate to meet likely commitments for the rest of the year.  The reduction on brucellosis arises mainly because the number of brucellosis reactors for which grants are payable on slaughter has been less than anticipated. This in itself is a good indication of the progress we are making in reducing the level of the disease in our herds.  I am confident that, with continued herd-owner co-operation, we will move rapidly towards our goal of total eradication of brucellosis within the next five or six years.</P>
    <P>I can report success also in the case of leukosis.  This disease has for all practical purposes now been eliminated from the national herd.  Because it is a very slow-acting disease, those herds which were infected had to be kept under restrictions for up to two years.  This led to overstocking <Col N="896" /> problems which had to be relieved by slaughter of some of the stock and the payment of compensation for the animals slaughtered.  The amount of compensation paid this year is of the order of £110,000 and this is provided for in subhead C4.  Restrictions have now been lifted on most of the herds concerned and any further compensation payments will, therefore, be limited.  This disease came to us in stock imported from Canada.  We were fortunate to get to grips with it before it could spread through our own herd and to have had the utmost co-operation from the herdowners concerned in dealing with it.  It provides a timely reminder, however, of the need for perpetual vigilance to guard against the introduction of those exotic animal diseases which are endemic in many other countries.</P>
    <P>The additional amount of £1.45 million required for subsidies on milk and butter under subhead E1 is made up of £650,000 for liquid milk subsidy and £800,000 for butter subsidy.  The excess in the milk subsidy element is due to an increase in the level of consumption this year and to some carry-over of claims from last year as a result of the postal strike.  The excess on the butter subsidy element arises from an increase of some 7 per cent in the level of butter consumption this year.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector the year has been characterised by very high disposals of cattle.  It is estimated that slaughterings at export premises will total some 1.4 million head as compared with 1.17 million head in 1979.  As a result sales of beef to intervention have been much greater than was anticipated, and it is now expected that total intake will reach 112,000 tonnes by the end of the year. This high level of intake together with heavy interest charges on borrowings for the purchase of intervention beef are the main reasons for the additional amount of £11.3 million being sought under subhead M6.  There will, however, be increased receipts of £8 million from the EEC under subhead N19, and so the net increase on intervention is $3.3 million</P>
    <P>While I have criticised over-reliance on the intervention system, I recognise that intervention provides a valuable support <Col N="897" /> for the market especially at this time of the year.  Because of this I was particularly disturbed at a recent decision of the EEC Commission to suspend intervention for beef forequarters until March next.  In view of the consequences which this might otherwise have for our beef sector, I decided to suspend for the same period our national arrangement which restricted intervention intake to 50 per cent of eligible slaughterings.  At the end of last week the Commission decided to extend the type of beef hindquarter eligible for intervention to include eight-rib pistola hindquarters.  I had sought this extension at the meeting of the Council of Ministers earlier in the week, and the Commission's quick response is welcome and will give increased marketing flexibility to our exporters.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1 million sought under subhead M9 is in respect of payment of the special variable premium on exports of beef to the United Kingdom and will bring total expenditure to £2.5 million in 1980.  However, this expenditure is balanced by a corresponding increase in receipts from the UK Government as shown under subhead N20.</P>
    <P>The balance of the Supplementary Estimate consists of extra provisions for a number of miscellaneous items, including expenses of various advisory councils and committees, residual payments under discontinued schemes, interest on loans by the ACC, pensions to former employees of the Dairy Disposals Company, extra cost of fertiliser aid under an FAO scheme, and consultancy fees.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial increase of £9½ million under Appropriations-in-Aid. This is mainly attributable to the increased recoupments from the EEC for intervention and from the UK Government for the variable beef premium, which I have already mentioned, as well as increased recoupments from the EEC under the disadvantaged areas schemes.</P>
    <P>The gross total of this Supplementary Estimate is just under £54 million and the net total is some £39¾ million.  These are very substantial sums and they will impose a strain on the Exchequer.  However, despite the severe financial constraints at the present time, the Government <Col N="898" /> have decided that these funds should be made available to help the agricultural industry to meet its current difficulties.  The Government are fully conscious of these difficulties, and we have already shown by the measures taken during the past few months that we are prepared to help farmers to maintain their incomes and to expand production.</P>
    <P>We are, of course, keeping the agricultural situation under continuing review and there are continuing discussions with representatives of the farming organisations.  At Community level we shall be seeking substantial price increases in the coming months.  On the domestic scene, too, we shall continue to do what we can to help within the limits imposed on us by the availability of resources.  In the meantime this Supplementary Estimate will provide the funds for the very substantial and comprehensive measures which we have already taken to meet the agricultural situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a 50 per cent drop in the real incomes of the farming community in the last two years, and this Estimate, the thinking and the policies that lie behind it, are a totally inadequate response to the crisis now facing farmers and their families.  I know many farmers who simply do not have enough money to pay the grocery bills, and if the Government and the Minister think that Estimates of this nature, packages of the type they have announced so far, are an adequate response to the situation they are fooling themselves, and worse still they are attempting to fool the Irish people. Indeed, the attempt by the Minister for Agriculture in his Mulrany speech last weekend to defend the adequacy of the measures already adopted to ease the agricultural crisis suggests that he is satisfied with these measures.  No one else in the country is, certainly not the farmers.</P>

      <P>The crisis in agriculture is so profound that the Government's tactics of small concessions for party political <Col N="899" /> rather than agricultural purposes is highly damaging.  It is diverting the energies of the farming community into piecemeal political lobbying and away from positive remedial action.  If the Minister has some long-term answers to offer to the Irish farmers he should come out with them now and stop fooling around with press releases and measures of a largely public relations character.  The famous package for farmers which was announced by the Minister on 12 September last was purely a public relations sham and that can be demonstrated by going through the individual measures, grandly entitled &ldquo;ten individual measures to assist Irish agriculture&rdquo;.  I will go through these measures quickly to show how misleading that description is.</P>
      <P>First of all we had a measure about the restructuring of existing borrowing.  The Government had got the banks to adopt a positive constructive attitude, so called, to the restructuring of existing loans.  The first point to be made about that is that it did not cost the Government a penny. Secondly, it was not anything new because long before the package was announced the banks had said that they were intent on adopting a constructive attitude to the restructuring of loans, as of course any prudent financier would, because there is not any point in putting a man out of business because then he could not pay any of his debts.  To entitle that as part of a package of aid for farmers was grossly misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had a Euro-loan floated of £50 million for the farming community We were told that the Government very generously were to bear the exchange risk arising from the fact that this money was to come in from outside.  But we were not told that the Government were adding 2 per cent to the rate of interest being charged to farmers, which the Government were to put into their pocket to be used as a form of assurance against the Government having to provide money in their guarantee of the exchange rate. Even if there is not a devaluation it is probable the Government will make a profit anyway.  The money is being obtained in Germany at 9 per cent and <Col N="900" /> the Irish farmer is being asked to pay 13½ per cent.  Of that, 2½ per cent will go to the banks and credit institutions to cover their costs, and 2 per cent to the Government against the possibility that they might have to come up with money to guarantee against the devaluation of the puént.  There is not anything there for the Irish farming community, and they can see it.</P>
    <P>Of that £50 million, I understand that not more than £20 million has been taken up by the farming community and that £30 million of it is being lent by the ACC on the Irish money market among the community in general and will not go to the farmers at all.  Anyway, that scheme is completely inadequate because it is to cover five years at a time when farmers had been looking for long-term loans, not loans they had to repay in five years.  It is far less attractive than even existing loans available from the ACC on longer terms.</P>
    <P>Then we had the proposals in regard to the payment of rates.  We were told that the Government were arranging with local authorities to adopt an understanding attitude towards individual farmers. What scope had local authorities to adopt an understanding attitude towards anyone when their finances were so tight that they were having to lay off road workers throughout the country.  Never before have local authorities been in such a difficult financial situation, yet the Government, without giving them an additional penny to do so, told them they must adopt an understanding attitude towards farmers' rates.  This measure did not cost the Government a penny.</P>
    <P>Then we had the Government coming along saying they would relieve farmers in the £40 to £60 PLV bracket of the second moiety or give them the primary allowance on the second moiety of rates. This was described as a concession.  What the Government were doing was giving back half of what they had taken from the farmers in the budget of 1980.  The Government were giving them back only half of what they had taken in the 1980 budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly this measure was a matter of trying to put right what the Government had done wrong in the 1980 Budget.  Then we had the announcement that they would pay the grants they owed to farmers under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  This was supposed to be a gift, a concession, a great example of Government largesse.  The Government had a legal obligation to pay these grants. They were obliged in contract and could have been sued if they did not pay.  To come along and to say they were giving a big concession, that they were going to pay what they owed, was not a concession.</P>
      <P>This was something that should not have been put into a package of aid because it was creating the impression, as this entire package was creating the impression, that the farmers were getting something from the Government.  This was being put across the urban community so that the people in the towns would think farmers were getting something, whereas this was only paying them money already owed to them by the Government and of which they had been refused payment up to three and four months.  There are still farmers in my constituency who are waiting that long for payment, although there may not be so many farmers in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister that there are and I have written to him within the last two weeks telling him about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had the increased headage payments in the disadvantaged areas.  I concede that was an improvement.  The item was the beef suckler scheme.  What the Government were doing in this so-called concession was telling the farming community that, although they were free under EEC law to pay a maximum grant of £28 to farmers who increased their herd numbers by buying more breeding animals, they were not going to do it. They said they would pay only the additional £12 on the additional numbers, not <Col N="902" /> the entire herd.  Although other EEC countries are paying the full £28 the Irish Government will only pay on increased numbers, not existing numbers.</P>
    <P>In practice I am sure everyone is aware that there are few farmers who have confidence enough to start expanding their herds because the situation in agriculture is so difficult and this additional £12 probably will not be paid in many cases.  The inadequacy of this £12 could not be more graphically indicated than by the fact that a similar amount was offered in 1968 under the beef incentive scheme by the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Paddy Smith.  In 1980 the present Minister for Agriculture is offering farmers the same amount.  We all know what has happened to prices and the cost of living since 1968. Never before have we faced such a serious situation in the declining size of our beef cow herd.  Our potential for exports of beef within the next two or three years is being rapidly eroded because our beef cow herd is reducing in size.  All the present Minister can offer them is £12 provided by the EEC which is no more in cash terms than Mr. Paddy Smith offered out of Irish Government funds in 1968, when money was worth a lot more and the situation was far less serious.  As I said, the £12 will only be provided for increased numbers.  Why would the Minister not pay the additional £12 for all beef cows?  That question should be answered.</P>
    <P>If the Government can find £50 or £60 million for an increase in pay for the nursing profession &mdash; I do not deny the need for an increase in their pay &mdash; why can he not find the money for an increase in our beef cow herd at a time when we are literally facing disaster so far as beef exports are concerned?  That question too should be answered.  He says he is too poor and could not get the money.  If that is the extent of his influence in Government, it is not very great in the face of the current crises facing our farmers.</P>
    <P>Next we were told the Government were going to introduce intervention buying for heifers.  That was a total flop because they discovered they had to get EEC consent and the EEC had not given their consent.  That leg of the Government's <Col N="903" /> stool has disappeared completely. Then we had an improvement in the mountain lamb extension scheme.  I grant the Minister that was a good thing.  The Government then said they were going to keep the cost of warble dressings at last year's level.  This was included as one of the big items in a package of aid for farmers in the current crisis.  If that is a measure of the Government's seriousness in approaching this problem and solving the agricultural income crisis, it shows very clearly the total air of unreality that must obtain in Agriculture House under the inspiration of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>We have a grant-in-aid for farm relief services to Macra na Feirme, which is a good thing.  But, in common with the warble fly increase, in normal circumstances it would not be included in a package of aid to farmers.  It would be announced in a routine manner, without very much fanfare, as a normal concession and part of an on-going dialogue which the farming organisations were having with the Government.  However, this Government were so anxious to create a false public impression they were doing something about the agricultural crisis that these measures, most of which were routine, were included in a ten point package of aid for the agricultural community. These measures were designed purely to create a temporary public relations impression without any real value, substance or recognition of the magnitude of the decline in agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>We must remember that this is the Government which, in the budget of 1980, admitted that farmers' incomes were falling by 4 per cent in 1979, then proceeded to extend income tax to a new category of farmers, to dramatically increase rates for smaller farmers, to restrict capital allowances and to bring forward the date of payment of farmers' income tax.  That is the kind of mentality which lies behind this latest package, which is so grotesquely inadequate.</P>
    <P>The crisis in Irish agriculture is so profound that I do not think the Government realise it.  I believe we will face a very <Col N="904" /> serious balance of payments problem unless something is done about agriculture. It is worth recalling that agriculture provides 40 per cent of our total exports. There is no country in Europe which relies on agriculture to anything approaching the extent we do.  Agriculture represents an even higher proportion of our net exports.  If the current crisis in agriculture &mdash; a 50 per cent decline in real incomes of farmers, their consequent inability to provide funds from their own resources for investment in increased production, and the necessity, which is obvious at present, to slaughter animals that should be retained for further breeding simply to get income &mdash; continues, we face the prospect of a very serious balance of payments crisis in the next 18 months.  I say those words with full consciousness of what they mean.</P>
    <P>I also believe that, if the present decline in agriculture continues, this country faces the prospect of the International Monetary Fund coming in to manage our economy and of our Goverenment's sovereignty in economic and social policy being taken from us because of the collapse of exports in agriculture. It is important that, regardless of where people live, they realise that if it were not for agricultural exports we would not have the foreign exchange that is necessary to buy the imported goods that so many of our people enjoy, that we would not have the foreign exchange that so many of the industrialists who have set up here and who give so much employment need to buy machinery.  If the current crisis in agriculture continues, all of our people &mdash; those in the cities as well as those in rural areas &mdash; face the prospect of economic disaster and of the loss of our economic sovereignty as a result of the IMF having to be brought in to manage our economy.  The sooner people realise that the better.  They must realise also that the type of measures we have been talking about so far are grossly inadequate.</P>
    <P>I should like to indicate the extent to which farmers have lost out <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rest of the community.  It has been calculated <Col N="905" /> by Dr. Seamus Sheehy that to restore farmers to the relative income position they enjoyed <i>vis-vis</i> the PAYE sector in 1970, and that was not a particularly good year for farmers, would require a cash transfer of £300 million from the rest of the community to the farmers.  Lest anyone should think that this is an enormous sum I would point out that it represents only 10 per cent of the total Government budget: the Government spend £3,000 million.  The Government must realise that if the incomes of a sector of the community which contributes almost half of our total exports and which, consequently, is of vital importance to our national survival, continue to decline at the present rate, we face a grave balance-of-payments situation. Consequently, they must think in terms of injections of cash of the magnitude I have mentioned into Irish agriculture. That alone will restore confidence and will restore the ability of agriculture to continue to provide us as a community with the exports we need if we are to survive.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the provisions of this Supplementary Estimate it is worth pointing out that of the money which is being provided and which will appear in the Government's accounts as aid to agriculture and which indeed is likely to be portrayed in various political statements as actual assistance to the farmers, somewhere between £5 million and £6 million is for increased salaries for civil servants and various public officials.  The extra money will not reach the farming community in any form.  Under subheads A1 and A2 there is provision for £2,500,000 for additional salaries to people in the Department of Agriculture and, as the Minister has said, subheads B4 and J as well as the provision for CBF relate also to substantial increases in salaries.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that there is not a need for increased salaries but any attempt to pretend that the money being voted here is for the farming community as such would be dishonest when that money is really required for these increases in salaries.</P>
    <P>Another important item relates to the <Col N="906" /> increased provision for disease eradication. One might be inclined to regard this as being very worth while in terms of the farmers being given more money for the fight against disease in their herds but let us consider where the increased money is going.  To be fair to the Minister, he was honest enough to tell us that the increases in this area are due to three factors &mdash; to higher fees in respect of TB testing which will be payable, not to farmers, but to veterinary practitioners as well as to an increase in travelling and subsistence expenses for Departmental staff engaged in the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is worth while drawing attention also to the fact that this Supplementary Estimate discloses that there have been substantial reductions in the amount provided under many subheads compared with the amounts provided in the original Estimate.  There have been substantial reductions in respect of many provisions, particularly for agricultural education. Money that was voted by this House for this purpose was not spent by the Minister. As Dr. Tom Walsh of ACOT emphasised recently, unless there is an improved level of agricultural education for farmers, the various schemes will not be of any significance and will not lead to increased production.  Yet, in this Supplementary Estimate we find that the Government have failed to spend the £740,000 that was sanctioned for Department of Agriculture schools.  We find that the £857,000 which was voted for private agricultural schools has not been spent, that the £184,000 voted for vocational training for farmers has not been spent and that the £132,000 provided for scholarships and training for farmers has not been spent either.  That is a total of nearly £2 million which the Government have failed to spend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should elaborate on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are self-evident. We all realise how much must be done if we are to improve agricultural education facilities.  We realise how difficult it is for any Minister to obtain an additional provision in his Estimate for <Col N="907" /> any subhead, particularly, perhaps, one concerning education.  Therefore, we may take it that it was very difficult for the Minister to have the extra moneys under this head sanctioned for this year but despite all this he admits now that he was unable to spend the money that was voted.  Surely that indicates serious failure in the Department.</P>
      <P>Another important point that must be made concerns the need to make a very strong case to the EEC as well as to the Government for additional money.  I have pointed out already the case that is to be made for an injection of £300 million into the farming sector in order merely to restore the position that they enjoyed <i>vis-aé-vis</i> other sectors in 1970. But there is a case to be made also under that same heading to the EEC for additional moneys.  Possibly it is not realised the extent to which the EEC have a legal responsibility for the situation now obtaining in Irish agriculture.  They have taken on the primary responsibility for agricultural policy in member states and they have laws that preclude member states from taking certain actions in aid of their farmers.  If they will not allow those states to act in certain matters, then they have a clear obligation to act on them.</P>
      <P>Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome imposes on the EEC themselves &mdash; not on member states &mdash; the &ldquo;clear obligation to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that a fair standard of living for the agricultural community is not being obtained now in this country.  The EEC have a clear responsibility to do something about that under the terms of the solemn treaty obligations contained in article 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore there is in the Treaty of Rome authority vested in the Community to act in the situation that obtains in agriculture at the present time.  Article 42 of the treaty states that &ldquo;the council may grant aid for the protection of enterprises handicapped by structural or natural conditions&rdquo;.  We know that at the root of our present difficulties is the fact that we have a higher rate of inflation <Col N="908" /> than almost any other member state.  The inherent vulnerability of Irish agriculture to inflation qualifies Ireland for immediate aid under the structural provision of article 42.</P>
    <P>In my view remoteness from markets qualifies us for aid on the grounds of structural or natural conditions because the distance from where people consume the goods is a natural disadvantage of even greater magnitude than climate. The factors of inflation, remoteness from the market and the dramatic decline in agricultural incomes of 50 per cent in the past two years indicate clearly that our Government in addition to providing a substantial amount of money &mdash; in my view justly requested from the Irish taxpayer to help the farming community &mdash; should go to the EEC and ask them to fulfil their obligations to Irish farmers and Irish agriculture under the Treaty of Rome.  We need a Minister who will present that case forcefully to the Community, pointing out the clear obligations of the Community under the Treaty to assist Irish farmers in the present situation.</P>
    <P>However, this Government are the least fitted and have the least chance of obtaining EEC aid for Irish agriculture. This is so because it is this Government who are primarily responsible for the inflation which is the fundamental cause of the present problems of the farmers. This Government cannot convincingly plead for EEC aid to undo the damage that their own inflationary policies have created, stemming originally from the 1977 manifesto.  On the other hand an alternative Government, a Fine Gael Government, with new policies, with a proven record of fiscal responsibility when in office and a broad base of support would be able to present a far more convincing case to the EEC for funds under the treaty obligations of the Community.</P>
    <P>In this context perhaps one of the most appropriate ways the Community can help Irish agriculture and one that can be strongly argued under the provisions of the treaty is by allowing a devaluation of the Irish Green £, notwithstanding the continued maintenance of parity for the Irish £ itself.  This proposal was made to <Col N="909" /> the Minister by the ICMSA in September 1980 but, to the best of my knowledge, he has not indicated whether he is for or against such a proposition.  As far as I know, he has not even presented it formally to the Community for consideration. Yet it is one immediate way in which the Community could help Irish farmers.  I under the clear treaty obligations which the Community have to Irish farmers.  I have said that this Government, because they have created the conditions which make this necessary, are not the best Government to present this case but in the interests of Irish agriculture it must be presented no matter who is in government. At the moment there is no evidence that this Government are prepared to present it.</P>
    <P>It is worth recollecting that this type of provision is not without precedent because in the period prior to our entry into the EMS the British had a different Green £ rate to our even though the British £ and the Irish £ were at par.  We had a Green £ rate more or less appropriate to the relative level of our £ <i>vis-aé-vis</i> the currencies of the European Community whereas the British had an artificial Green £ rate.  It bore no relation to its currency in relation to EEC currencies but was designed solely for the British purpose of keeping down the price of food in Britain &mdash; the traditional British policy.  If Britain could maintain a different Green £ rate to our Green £ rate at a time when our two currencies were the same solely for the purpose of maintaining their cheap food policy, surely in present agricultural positions we can argue for a different Green £ rate in the light of the most serious situation that obtains here so far as our essential interest is concerned, namely, agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Chair has allowed a considerable degree of latitude on this debate but strictly it should be confined to the headings in the Supplementary Estimate.  I ask speakers to keep closer to those headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Chair has made.  In his speech the Minister for Agriculture said something <Col N="910" /> which I think probably shows better than anything else the extent to which he and his colleagues are out of touch with what is happening in farming.  He said:</P>
      <P>...farmers continue to show a high level of confidence in the future of their industry by investing at an unprecedented rate in land improvements, buildings... </P>
      <P>This was evidenced for him by the fact that there was an increased demand for grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  If the Minister thinks that indicates a high level of confidence by farmers he is fooling himself.  The reality is that farmers, because of the difficult cash situation they are facing, completed work that had not been finished for some time and claimed the money.  There has been a rush of claims for money that was previously allocated.  The second reason was that the provision under the farm modernisation scheme in the 1980 Estimates was grossly inadequate and it was inevitable that farmers would look for more money.  It was inevitable that the £36 million provided in the 1980 Estimates would not be enough and that could have been seen by anyone at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That could have been seen by anyone and was pointed out by me at that time. I said then that the £36,500,000 provided for the farm modernisation scheme was completely inadequate and this has been shown to be the case.  It was inadequate because, even if there was no increase in the volume of claims relative to what had obtained the previous year, that £36,500,000 represented an increase of 6 per cent only on the amount provided in the previous year.  Everybody knows that the cost of farm buildings, drainage, contractors, wages, all of these things being met out of grants under the farm modernisation scheme were at that time increasing somewhere in the region of 15 to 20 or 25 per cent, depending on the type of service and so on.  The Government came along then and provided an additional sum to meet those costs of no more than 6 per cent.  It was patently obvious that that 6 per cent was not going to be enough.  The fact that the Government have to come in now looking for a <Col N="911" /> Supplementary Estimate was a totally predictable event arising from the inadequacy of their original provision for the farm modernisation scheme.  The fact that the Government made a wrong estimation at the beginning of 1980 in no way indicates an unpredecented upsurge in confidence among farmers.  All it indicates is that the Government made a mistake at the beginning of 1980 in their figures and they are now having to correct that mistake.  Furthermore farmers are making claims for money to which they were already entitled but had not made claims because they had not completed the work and were not in urgent need of the money as they are now.</P>
    <P>I believe we are facing a really serious situation in agriculture.  I do not believe the present Government recognise how serious is the situation.  I hope this debate will provide an opportunity for Members on this side of the House to get the message across to people on the other side that, unless something is done urgently, we as a community face a crisis of an unprecedented proportion in our balance of payments and in economic developments generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>At present a real crisis has arisen in the agricultural industry. That goes without saying and I think is appreciated by everybody.  The mickey mouse efforts being made to resolve it by the present administration certainly indicate that they know it exists but that they are not going to do much about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a concession in regard to rates for people with valuations between £60 and £70.  But I would point out that in the last budget the Government removed the subsidy on rates resulting in those people's rates being increased by a substantial amount, half of which they have paid for this year.  Now the Government are saying they will let them away with the second moiety.  Indeed the concession in regard to rates was a very minor one when one bears in mind the increase in this area provided for in the budget, an increase which withdrew a subsidy on those rates.  Now the Government come <Col N="912" /> along and make a great virtue of giving the farmers back half.</P>
    <P>This is peculiar Government thinking At budget time they withdrew the subsidy on these rates and now they are coming back and saying that farmers have not to pay the second moiety.  This is indicative of the kind of Government thinking and planning affecting the whole area of agriculture, our principal industry.  Agriculture, with its off-shoot industries and jobs, employs at least 40 per cent of our people.  Are we serious when we are only mickey-mousing with this industry? There is no plan for agriculture, something which has been pointed out in report after report.  That is indicative of the overall thinking of the Government and Department in the whole area of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Last evening a meeting was held of pea growers in Carlow.  They maintained that the processing of peas in that area must be continued and if anybody in the Government would say to them &ldquo;Here is a factory&rdquo;, they would take it over and run it.  Yet the Government are silent on the closure of this vital industry to farmers and workers in that area.  They will just close it down and that is that.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a deputation recently to a Minister of State about the position of millable wheat and the action of millers.  Apparently the Government had no control over these matters.  The Department were powerless to do anything in the situation, one which I, as a member of a deputation from the committee of agriculture in Kildare, pointed out existed.  The Minister had to admit that the millers were in control and that the Government had no power in regard to the standards to be adhered to.  The millers changed the standard for millable wheat on the day it began to arrive at the mills and the Government were powerless to stop them.  Who is in charge?  I pose this question in all seriousness.  Are we able to deal with those people?</P>
    <P>We also discussed with that junior Minister on that occasion the position of animal feed and of imports arriving here <i>via</i> the EEC but not produced in the EEC, which are being put into our animal feeding to the exclusion of our barley. <Col N="913" /> This means that the bottom falls out of the market for Irish barley.  This is a fact. The Minister knows it, but apparently is powerless to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>Have we really any control over these areas of cereal production in this country? Have we any control over the use of our barley in our animal feed?  Apparently we have not.  It is about time we did something about it, that we stopped these cheap imports of tapioca or whatever going into our animal feeding in a huge way to the exclusion of our barley.  There is not even a minimum amount of Irish barley being put into animal feeding being processed by the compounders. There is no regulation whatever specifying that home produce must be used.</P>
    <P>I make these points because agriculture is our principal industry.  Despite what people may say about oil finds and so on, our soil is our principal natural resource.  It is not being used, we have no plan to use it and a lot of it is not being properly used for one of many reasons but principally for the want of any kind of plan by the Department of Agriculture on the proper use of this land for our people.</P>
    <P>Our processing industry is falling to pieces.  The Minister is well aware of that. I want to say a word now about the marketing of our agricultural produce.  The Minister mentioned this matter.  I am glad that at least he recognises the necessity for proper marketing of our agricultural produce.  I want to point out to the Minister, as I have done to three or four of his colleagues before, that our meat in Europe is not commanding as good a price as European meats.  The Minister is aware of that.  But Ministers do not like to hear that or to admit it.  Nevertheless, it is a fact.  We are commanding a lower price for our meat in Europe.  We boast about our great Irish beef, but when it comes to selling it on the European market we receive a very much lower price than our European competitors.  I believe that is because of lack of proper marketing.</P>
    <P>I have been in Europe and studied the question to a limited extent.  No attempt has been made by our meat producers, exporters or principally by the Department <Col N="914" /> of Agriculture to set up the necessary marketing process for our beef.  We have adopted the practice of putting it into intervention, where we get a price which is not attractive to the meat processing industry.  That happens because we allow ourselves to be put into that position through not marketing our beef and producing it as it should be produced. We are just producing raw sides of beef which are put into intervention because nobody seems to bother to process it properly and sell it on a competitive basis.  European farmers are selling their beef at prices one and a quarter times or more better than ours.  It is time for the Government, meat processors and farmers to get together and work out a plan for selling our beef in Europe.  We could then produce the kind of beef these people want so that we could get the top prices, which are necessary if our farmers are to survive.</P>
    <P>It is now apparent to farmers that a few years back &mdash; not so many &mdash; they were bluffed about what the EEC would do for them.  It did bring a good deal of wealth to this country for a few years, I am not now going to examine that campaign again but my party said at the time that prosperity would be short-lived.  The amount we shall get now from the EEC is limited and we can no longer expect an annual round of increases &mdash; we will not get them, as has become apparent.  It is also apparent that there will be changes in CAP and despite all our efforts we will not be able to maintain it as it has been. It therefore behoves us to market our produce properly.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to Bord Bainne, who market a section of our agricultural produce.  They have done a fine job in regard to our dairy produce.  Practically none of our milk products has gone into intervention.  But the position regarding meat is a disgrace.  We are receiving a lesser price than our European competitors. We are putting most of our beef into intervention, whereas if we had a proper marketing system I believe we could sell our beef against all competitors at top prices in the European market.  The Government have failed to give a lead in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> Proper marketing of processed food and vegetables is also vitally necessary. If we do not now grasp the nettle of marketing our produce properly we can forget about expansion.  This is one of the reasons why our vegetable processing plants are closing down.  As a people, as a Government and as a Daéil we must stand condemned on the ground that we have the best soil in Europe, a good climate for vegetable production but have to close down the vegetable processing industry with resulting loss of employment, loss to producers and so on in my own area serving the Carlow plant. We must stand condemned when the potato processing plant in Tuam has to close.  We are not serious about exporting and marketing products of which we can produce the finest in the world.  The Minister and the Government stand condemned on this issue, because in the Fianna Fail manifesto we had the bald statement: &ldquo;we will process all our food&rdquo;. I was delighted to see that.</P>

      <P>It should not be forgotten, because it was a good ideal to strive for.  The effort does not fit the intention, because even the Minister will have to admit that in the past three and a half years the bottom has fallen out of the processing industry.  Part of the blame must be taken by the Minister and his Department.  As far as I can see as an ordinary observer, little or no effort has been made to improve standards and to advance the processing of food.  The evidence is to the contrary.  Anyone who considers the matter fairly will agree that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we had a march organised by young farmers.  I think this is only the beginning because no trade union or professional man would accept a cut of 20 per cent in income in one year.  The measures announced by the Government to help farmers are inadequate, useless. Part of the reason for the present high unemployment figures, which are frightening, is the lack of money in the agricultural <Col N="916" /> sector.  This also creates depression in the agricultural service industries. The loss of the processing plant in Carlow will mean a loss in the machinery area of that factory and in machinery usage by local people and general loss of employment. It will mean loss to hauliers bringing the produce to the factory.  The loss of the Carlow business goes right through the community.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to blackguard anybody or blame the Government unnecessarily but it is the Government's task to ensure that we make the most of our principal natural resources and principal industry.  They must ensure that everything possible is done to see that food production, our best resource and principal industry, is encouraged and promoted.  Cheddar cheese from England commands a price 12 per cent higher than the same type of Irish cheese.  We should consider why.  It is time that, in consultation with our processors, we combatted that situation so as to get the best possible price for Irish products.  This has not been done.  The problem has not been seriously tackled. It is the task of an imaginative Minister and an active Department of Agriculture. I have pointed out two areas where the prices we get do not compare with those our competitors get, while our products, properly produced, marketed and handled, are better than our competitors. That affects employment in a very substantial way.  If we were finishing the processing of our meat and not putting cattle into intervention we would be doing a great day's work for employment.</P>
    <P>In my constituency efforts are being made by the meat industry to diversify and develop.  Sufficient help or encouragement is not being given by the various Departments to do this.  Farmers in many cases are owners of the meat processing in co-ops.  The farmers, the meat processers and the Department of Agriculture should come together to try to find out what is wrong with our product that it does not come on the European market at the same price as the products from other countries.</P>
    <P>At the moment many meat processing factories are closing.  We know that losses occur in many areas.  I can give examples <Col N="917" /> of many areas outside agriculture where losses are occurring in production.  Meat processing is being done at a profit elsewhere. We are exporting our timber to Sweden and it is being sold back to us as hardboard and wallboard.  Private enterprise has failed to process the timber here.  The same thing applies to agriculture. There are private people who are producing mushrooms, exporting them to London and making a good profit. Despite this there is no plan in the Department of Agriculture to process our food, which is the best in the world.</P>
    <P>Help must be given to maintain small farmers in particular.  I am not talking about the man whose income has dropped by £80,000 or £40,000 but about the small man whose income was barely at survival level before this huge drop in income came.  Is there any person who will say that something should be done for those people?  A small farmer's wife visited me recently and told me how they have been struggling on a small piece of land.  That man is looking for assistance from the health board to keep body and soul together.  Those people have not got a penny.  They owe money to the bank because they were progressive enough to erect buildings which Ministers and advisers advocated they should do.  The bank manager may probably extend the terms of the loan to those people who still owe the money and the interest is increasing on it.  The longer they owe that money the greater the increased interest will be.  I am not talking about a broad spectrum of people but about small farmers who owe money because they try to be progressive.  I am talking about people who had to sell their cow herds for slaughter. They had no option because they had to pay for their groceries.</P>
    <P>A grant can be obtained from the EEC to help farmers to change away from dairying to beef.  If the person is to receive that grant good cows will have to be slaughtered.  Those cows cannot be transferred to somebody else even though they are good beasts.  The person who thought up that scheme needs to have his head examined.  This is the stupid kind of thinking we have by people in the EEC and even people in the Department <Col N="918" /> of Agriculture.  Those people have no thought for the advancement of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The day of the huge price increase is gone and the day of the adjustment every six months is also gone.  Unless we can sell our produce at the highest possible price we are facing a very bleak time. The last speaker pointed out that we are talking here about £39 million.  If an emergency arises and if people keep coming on the dole queues the Government will have to get £50 million or even £100 million to pay them.  The people I am talking about would prefer to be employed.  If we are closing down food processing plants which employ 200 people we must think of what it will cost to pay them redundancy.  Would it not be better, even running at a loss, to keep those plants going and go out to try to sell their produce?</P>
    <P>It will take some person with initiative to grasp the nettle in relation to food processing and go in and do the job. People sitting in Kildare Street browsing over schemes from the EEC will never do it.  We must have somebody in the ministerial seat who is prepared to grasp that nettle and develop our agricultural industry to its full potential.  This industry is already employing 40 per cent of our people and has the best potential for increasing employment.  The offshoots of agriculture are the mainstay of industry in the country.  If we do not get those people working and producing it will be a sorry day not only for our agricultural sector but for all our people.</P>

No man has done more to meet all the organisations <Col N="919" /> and people interested in agriculture than the Minister for Agriculture.  I can assure everybody here that every possible pressure will be exerted by the present Minister when he goes to Brussels to argue next year's prices.  Deputy Bermingham has mentioned marketing and the processing of beef, about which I shall be talking in a moment, although it is not very relevant to the very important Estimates before us.  I shall not delay too long on it, because it is important that we get it passed today.  Payment under the farm modernisation scheme is a very important item.</P>
      <P>We always get a fairly good speech from Deputy Bruton and I like listening to him on farming, but he mentioned an injection into farming of £300 million being necessary.  He did not, however, give any indication of where the injection should be given and where it should be stopped.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we went into the EEC and got three or four good years. Fair enough.  It was the irresponsible working of the EEC which caused the flop in farming, along with other things which caused inflation, high prices and the rest.  We realise on this side of the House how bad is the state of the farmers at present.  Nobody realises that more.  I want to make that quite clear, but what is going to be done about it is the important thing at present.  I have said time and time again here that representatives from the Nine countries went back to Brussels <Col N="920" /> and looked for all that they could get and quite right.  However, to my mind there should be a lot more emphasis on getting the EEC to subsidise the cost of production which has not been done.  By all means, let us look for an increased price but we shall not continue getting it forever. I have met foolish people who actually thought that cattle would go to £100 a cut., but at that price who would want to eat it?  What is everybody's business is nobody's business and everyone tried for the best possible deal for himself and to hell with where the money came from</P>
      <P>The EEC has increased from six to nine and there are a couple more very important directors who are not going to favour these increases.  Britain did not pay her share last year towards CAP and as regards West Germany, we do not know what will happen.  We are very lucky that some of the policies presented to us from the other side of the House, where Members were looking for more power for the European Parliament during the time of the election, were not accepted.  I want to remind them of that. If the European Parliament had power today, what would happen CAP?  The only hope for CAP is that it still depends on the Nine Ministers who are going over there.  I believe that we have one of the best of the Nine going back to do the best he can for this country.  There is no doubt about that and as far as the small farmers are concerned, he comes from the west of Ireland, which is the most neglected area in this country.</P>
      <P>Take the farm modernisation scheme. Payment under this scheme increased from £15 million last year to over £30 million this year.  I would like to inquire at some stage into the spending of the money under Directive 159 and how much of that, as a percentage and in actual figures was paid to the people in the traditional categories who if under 50 years of age got only 30 per cent and if over 55 years of age, 20 per cent.  At some stage I want to know where all the money and the grants went.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the grants should be increased, particularly to the smaller farmer.  I would not expect very <Col N="921" /> elaborate buildings and having almost a dwelling-house for cattle, but it is of absolute importance that the small farmer keep his herd and make silage. The Minister this year has given a grant of £50 for the first acre of silage.  If a farmer wants to keep his cattle, he must take them off the land during the winter and house them.  To get adequate housing there must be adequate grants.  The present grants for the smaller farmer are very inadequate.  The cost of this housing is always a lot higher than the first estimate would indicate and the farmer then gets a lower percentage.  I want to see that directive changed.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, I do not expect the small farmer to get more, but he should get the same grant as the larger farmer.  I hope that the western package will do something in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Minister for Agriculture will do everything in his power to get the best deal.  What I would expect from every side of the House here is a recommendation on what should be done in the present bad situation of our farmers and of those of Europe.  Even if we succeed in getting a price rise every year, does that solve the problem?  I say no.  Price rises are very acceptable but mean nothing when the cost of production overtakes them.  We have had good prices for three years but the cost of production ran up after the prices.  When we got a price reduction, the cost of production still stayed up because of inflation. Subsidies for fertilisers are what I would like to see, as they would bring down the cost of production on the farm.  The EEC at present forbids these subsidies, but there can be a national subsidy and I am hoping for this.  The EEC does not give subsidies, it only allows high prices, which is the wrong policy from the word go.  I may not be popular in saying this but if the cost of production was kept down, the farmer might be better off taking £100 less for his beasts because of the lower cost of production.  The bad position of our farmers today comes from bad, inefficient management within the EEC.  We may discuss agriculture here but all the decisions at the moment come from Brussels.  We get those decisions <Col N="922" /> back from Brussels as directives.  If we got a chance to make recommendations, things would be better.  I see Deputy D'Arcy in the House and I hope he and other Members will suggest to the Minister what they think should be done at present.</P>
    <P>When Macra na Feirme representatives were here yesterday, they suggested 10 per cent of a rise and the rest in subsidies and devaluation of the green £.  I do not know whether it is practical or not.  There are a lot of snags in devaluation, but the suggestions about subsidies and interest rates are good.  Unfortunately, most of those who have loans at high interest rates are the younger generation. Older farmers were too conservative to borrow large sums of money. They were not going to pay any heed to the advertisements on the radio and television encouraging farmers with 80 acres of land to borrow £120,000.  The person who suggested that should have his head examined, because a farmer could not pay that back.  The young people were enthusiastic because they went into farming at a time when prices were good and made their investments on the assumption that the prices would remain good for two or three years.  It was on the basis that prices would improve that they agreed to certain commitments.</P>
    <P>There have always been cycles in farming and almost every five years a slump occurs.  Some farmers lose heart when they run into a depression such as at present because they have not experienced such an occurence before.  I would be worried about a reduction in the cattle herd but I do not believe there should be a restriction on the export of cattle in order to improve cattle numbers.  The farmer engaged in producing young beasts has experienced difficult times before but has always managed to come out of recessions.  I do not understand why cattle have to be exported on the hoof to be slaughtered abroad.  We are supposed to have very good beef and, as a farmer from the west, I approve of such exports; nevertheless I believe factories in Ireland who have the raw materials at their disposal should find it possible to compete with other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> The main cause of the reduction in cow numbers is disease.  It must be remembered that when a cow has to be killed a calf is also lost.  Disease eradication is the biggest problem that has to be faced by farmers.  I do not know how we can tackle it, but it is serious.  Some time ago I suggested that a subsidy be paid to farmers who keep calves.  They were sold for half nothing in 1974, and the price was very bad about eight months ago also, but if a subsidy was available it would be possible to increase the cattle herd.  If our cattle herd decreases much more the country will be facing a serious problem. I would not agree to some of the other suggestions put forward to improve our cattle herd such as the stopping of export of young cattle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton dealt in detail with the question of agricultural education.  It is true that county committees of agriculture did not get sufficient money for this purpose from any Government.  Now ACOT have taken over this matter and programmes have been forwarded to headquarters from the regional committees. We cannot complain to the Minister until we see the budget that will be given to ACOT in next year's Estimate.  It must be remembered that county councils will be asked to subscribe a certain amount of money to ACOT and we must be reasonable about that.  In my county they are looking for more instructors to help in the farm modernisation scheme and in the carrying out of the educational programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been criticised about the premium for sheep.  I do not agree with the suggestion that a premium should be paid on the carcase.  I have always expressed the view that anything given in the form of a subsidy to farmers should be paid directly to them on their ewes.  Inspections should be carried out carefully and quality taken into consideration. The Minister made a right decision in deciding to pay the subsidy direct to the farmers.  Indirect subsidies seldom find their way back to the farming community. The sheep industry needed such a subsidy scheme badly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> This was a disastrous year for tillage, not because of prices but because of the weather.  Farmers, unlike other sections of the community, depend a lot on the weather and this year was a disaster from that point of view.  It was also bad for dairy farmers.  There was plenty of grass but not of the right type.  It resulted in cows producing milk of such a quality that did not produce good butter fat.  The grass was soft and the butter fat yield was low with the result that the income of dairy farmers fell.  It is a pity more beef is not produced in the west and any move to improve that situation would be welcome. Farmers would gain more than they do by just producing them and selling them to be finished elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that this Estimate should be passed today.  The most important thing now is to have a reappraisal of the whole set up within the EEC.  More emphasis is needed on costs of production. If farmers get a price increase each year, that gives the impression to other sections of the community that the farmers are millionaires.  If I get an increase which raises my income from £4,000 to £6,000 and my outlay goes up by £2,000 as well, that is not worth a damn to me.</P>
    <P>Are we on the right lines in the EEC? Have not disastrous decisions been made within the EEC to concentrate on prices without considering where the money comes from?  Money for the CAP is provided by contributions from member states.  It is 1 per cent or something like that.  Pools and mountains are created.  It would be better to give subsidies to help the farmers towards their costs of production instead of emphasising prices. This may be an unpopular thing to say, but does anyone seriously think prices will go up by 20 per cent each year?  If that were the case, what would the price of beef be?  As an ordinary individual I consider that stupid thinking.  Costs of production must be watched to give farmers a reasonable profit, which they are not getting now.  They are losing money because prices are falling and costs of production are going up.</P>
    <P>Let nobody think that is not realised on this side of the House.  It is realised by the Minister.  We have had good Ministers <Col N="925" /> for Agriculture and we had good men going to Brussels.  I wonder were they all looking for what they could get in the line of prices, because others were doing the same.  Deputy Bruton said agriculture needs an injection of £300 million.  I would not disagree, but in what way do you inject it?  The vast majority of it would have to come from the EEC.</P>
    <P>There is unrest among the farming community at present.  I hope the Minister will meet the farmers' leaders, have discussions with them and find out what they would like to have done in the long term.  A short term injection, like an increase in prices for one year with no hope of an increase in the following year, is not on.  An increase in the headage grants is a good thing.  I hope the grant for the disadvantaged areas will be increased shortly.</P>
    <P>A remark was made about the rates and it was said that farmers got back half only.  We got it all back because we are not asked for the second moiety.  My valuation is £43.  I paid what I would pay normally and the second moiety would be the increase.  If you get back the second moiety you are getting back the total increase.</P>

This means you are as you were, apart from whatever the increase in the £ was in your county.  When Deputies give figures they should try to be accurate.  Many Deputies know a great deal about agriculture, but I have been in that industry for a long time.  I would have a debate with anybody on the inefficient running of agriculture by the EEC over the past three or four years, and the type of thinking over <Col N="926" /> there.  Do they ever think about what will happen in ten years' time, how they are running the Community or where the money will come from, or are they prepared to support the CAP by subscribing to it?  If they are why not inject money into keeping down farming costs so that farmers could do with a smaller increase in prices?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am not spokesman for our party on agriculture.  The estimate for the Department of Agriculture is huge and the increases under the different headings are substantial.  In these estimates increases are demanded under different headings.  Deputy Bruton dealt briefly with education.  I have always been interested in education in agriculture.  This area has been neglected and the present administration have done nothing to improve the situation.  Our future lies in the standard of education of our young farmers.  Farmers should not attempt to go into business without first doing at least one year in an agricultural college.  Money has been handed back under the education heading and this is very disappointing.  In our county committees of agriculture there have been demands for scholarships to the agricultural colleges.  In 1979 there were 75 applications for 25 places and the figure is more or less the same for 1980.  This is a disastrous situation.  People who should have this education as a basic right, as they are moving into an industry that is of national importance, cannot obtain the necessary education to get the best use from that industry.  We asked the Minister to take over a certain college in Wexford and start an agricultural college so as to create a number of extra scholarship places.  The Minister said that it was not suitable but he should have come up with an alternative suggestion.  The time to give farmers education is when they are interested.  They are not interested when they have been farming for three or four years, and night classes are not sufficient. People should be able to avail of at least one year in an agricultural college before going into farming.  There has not been any attempt in the last five or six years to increase the number of places available <Col N="928" /> to young farmers but today under this Estimate we are handing back money under the heading of education, research and advisory services.  The Department have sufficient land and if they cannot get suitable buildings they can build some. There should be no obstacle.  There are 1,000 acres attached to Johnstown Castle and we could have an agricultural college there.  I would not deface the castle but we have land three and four miles away from the castle suitable for the building of an agricultural college.</P>
      <P>I objected to Deputy Gibbons as Minister dividing the research and advisory services.  The then Minister insisted that An Foras Taluéntais be made into a virtually autonomous body.  Research and development should go hand in hand in any industry.  This was a retrograde step. The Minister's predecessor Deputy Mark Clinton had gone to great pains to try to co-ordinate the services available.  This was accepted by everyone with a genuine interest in the progress of agriculture although there were certain objectors just as there are in relation to any legislation. The Agricultural Institute should be involved in the education of farmers as they have a wealth of knowledge, the expertise, the equipment and the capacity to do the job.  The amount of money for An Foras Talúntais is in the region of £11 million.  That is completely for research.  I would not reduce the importance of research at every level but there is no point in having research without having a follow-up.  There is a wealth of knowledge in the offices of An Foras Talúntais and in Deputy Mark Clinton's day An Foras Talúntais was brought under the education heading so that it be used for the education of young farmers. There have not been proposals to remedy the deficiency in the number of places available in our agricultural colleges.  It will take time to remedy this because we cannot build colleges overnight.  I appeal to the Minister even at this stage to try to do something about this deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to county committees of agriculture we have a serious problem in our county because the IFA, the most important organisation in the county, are refusing to take their place on the county <Col N="929" /> committees of agriculture.  In the past week a huge meeting was called in Wexford to have a look at the prices in agriculture. The IFA advised farmers to scale down their operations.  This is very serious. The IFA were given an opportunity to take their place in the county committees of agriculture and during the debate the Minister said that he could see no problem in relation to these places for the different rural organisations.  There is a serious situation in the Minister's county when the organisation which have a branch in practically every parish, sits on the sideline and advises people to scale down their operations, when they should be in the county committees of agriculture expressing their views and putting suggestions forward to try to solve the crisis in agriculture.  I contacted the IFA and they informed me that they had discussions with the Minister on this issue and are awaiting a reply.  The Minister is responsible for this serious situation and something should be done quickly to remedy it.</P>
    <P>During the course of that Bill I could see that there would be problems.  The majority of people on the committees represent the smaller organisations but it is vital that the IFA take their place on the committee.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that these people are satisfied with his answer.  Not enough consideration was given to the people who would take their places on the county committees and I was not surprised when I saw a problem with the IFA in my county.</P>
    <P>I have not seen any sign of the great work that should be coming from the new body.  During the fodder crisis they made a statement.  There were three or four fine days at the end of a very long wet period and they stated that during the short period of fine weather 80 per cent of the hay had been put under cover or into sheds on the farms when the truth of the matter was that 80 per cent of the hay was dumped in the ditches.  This type of statement should not be made by a responsible body because it gives the wrong impression.  The people in our town said &ldquo;You got your hay in but you also got grants as a result of losing the hay&rdquo;.  Whom are they to believe?  It is a <Col N="930" /> great mistake to make this kind of inaccurate statement.  Everybody knows what happened.  Eighty per cent of the hay was dumped and that is all it was fit for because there was about six weeks of continuous rain on the hay made in July. This type of statement should not be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that farmers continued to show a high level of confidence in the future of their industry by investing at an unprecedented rate in land improvement, buildings and so on. That is another statement that gives the wrong impression.  I do not know who the Minister is trying to fool by it.  They are not investing in land improvement or buildings.  The reason why there is a huge demand for the grants to be paid is that some of them are due for over four years. They were held up either because the accounts were not in order or the job was not completed.  All of a sudden the bank managers or ACC who funded the work put on pressure for the grants to be paid.</P>
    <P>As regards land reclamation I know of three contractors in Wexford &mdash; it is a county that would not be behind as far as land reclamation and investment in agriculture are concerned &mdash; who have let half their staff go and one has pulled in his machinery and said there is no way he can continue under the present circumstances. We had a situation where grants were held up for 16 weeks.  People applied to the Department for their grants after spending perhaps a year trying to get their accounts in order and cleared at local level.  This was a great mistake at local level.  Not alone did one have to put up a silage pit but a milking parlour, slurry pit and so on, and one could not draw a grant until all this work was completed.  This involved huge expenditure, which was not so bad when one was talking in terms of 10 and 11 per cent interest but when one was talking in terms of 18 and 20 per cent it was very difficult.  When the banks found these accounts could not be paid they put a further penalty interest rate on of 2 per cent.  I have often written to the Minister asking that such-and-such an applicant be given his grant because he was paying a 2 per cent interest rate over and above <Col N="931" /> the normal one.  The banks were very short-sighted to have put on this penalty. In the years ahead there will be a scaling down of investment in agriculture unless something is done about it quickly.</P>
    <P>Some farmers got into serious financial difficulty as the result of doing some of this work and a 16-week delay at Departmental level played havoc with those waiting for the grants.  Some people were waiting for up to two years for the grants to be paid.  I am not sure what the present position is but there should be speedy repayments.  At local level all kinds of problems crop up about these grants. Some of the accounts give considerable problems.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that they are not delayed in the Department for more than four weeks. A farmer could then go to the bank and state that he will have his grant in four weeks.</P>
    <P>Disease eradication is very important. I noted an air of pessimism in the Minister's speech.  Progress is slow and it has been so for the last ten years.  All kinds of restrictions were brought in such as the 30-day test which presented huge problems for farmers.  Brucellosis eradication should be easier than TB eradication. The Department's inspectors should be prepared to supervise the disinfecting of farmers' places where there is a high incidence of TB or brucellosis.  We are spending a lot of money on this and farmers should have to say because they put up £10 million as a contribution towards the cost of eradication of bovine diseases. I am not pleased with the progress made. I have a large herd and have no complaints about the local office.  I have never had an inspection from the Department. I had a breakdown in the herd of both TB and brucellosis.  One gets all the documents but I do not think it is the job of the person who serves the documents to see that the place is disinfected.  We do it ourselves but there is no compulsion on us to do so.</P>
    <P>This costs taxpayers £11 million and the farmers £10 million.  More care should be taken because the Department have a huge expenditure under this heading. The Minister is pessimistic about the <Col N="932" /> progress being made.  Far greater progress could and should be made.  I am glad that leukosis has been wiped out.  It was not a big problem.  It was very near our doorstep in the Wexford and south Wicklow area.  We had sufficient problems with brucellosis and TB without having a third disease.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of praise for the sheep headage payment from the Minister.  I disagree with Deputy Callanan when he said it should be paid to a person with ewes.  It should be the aim of the State to improve the quality of sheep and cattle. Paying the headage grant completely on ewes will not improve the position because there could be a situation where sheep breeders would retain cast ewes in the herd for no other reason than to collect the grant, particularly when cast ewes are at a bad price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in saying that because the Minister knows the problems there would be in inspecting sheep.  Are they going to open the mouth of every sheep in the country?  It would be a physical impossibility.  You have the smart boys who will put cast ewes in with bad elders.  Are you going to examine all of them?  That would be a physical impossibility. They will be traded by people who are more clever than the Department's inspectors.  They will get their £5 or £7 or whatever the grant is.  This is a bad situation.  This grant should have been divided in an attempt to improve the quality of lambs.  Deputy Callanan said that he believed that the grant never got back to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fair amount of competition at the moment for the lambs throughout the various factories in the country.  A big factory in Mayo is buying every day from Wexford because they cannot get sufficient lambs in their own county.  Factories in Waterford are also buying in Wexford. The Minister would do a good job and would improve the quality of our lambs if he gave half of that payment at the slaughter end provided that the animals came up to a certain standard.  We talk about efficiency but the Department <Col N="933" /> of Agriculture are paying for inefficiency, and we get inefficiency in, for example, the suckler herds.  Our bad cows are breeding very poor quality cattle and if we want to make any impression on the European markets we must have good quality sheep and cattle.  We hand out these grants which will be abused by the farmers.  I repeat that half of those grants should be paid at the slaughtering end of the sheep trade.</P>
    <P>I make the same point about the suckler herds as I have made here previously. I would advise people under no circumstances to get involved in suckler herds. Any farmer who believes he can make a good living out of suckler herds, unless he has virtually a ranch, is only fooling himself.  The only way that I know of whereby a farmer can keep himself poor is to have a suckler herd.  It is the costliest way of producing beef.  The grants for the suckler herds also should be given to the people who are not in milk production but who are prepared to enter into a good calf to beef scheme.  Thus the quality of their cattle can be improved because in order to qualify for the suckler herd grant the standard of cow does not matter, at least to my knowledge.  The continued backing up of suckler herds is bad policy and is no foundation for agriculture, and this should have been corrected long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The downward trend in the agricultural industry is completely the responsibility of the present Government because of the policies they have pursued during the past three and a half years.  It is unbelievable that so much damage could be done in such a short time to the industry which had been growing and thriving since we went into the EEC and <Col N="934" /> which should be the cornerstone of the economy of this nation.  Instead, in the past three and a half years we have seen complete demoralisation, lack of confidence and uncertainty on the part of those engaged in the industry.  Even at this late stage it is logical that we try to convince the Government as to where they went wrong in those three and a half years in order that at least in this debate we may ensure that some of the mistakes that have been made will not be repeated in the 1981 budget.</P>
      <P>In the 1979 budget the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, introduced the now famous system as a means of collecting revenue for his Department known as the levy system.  After the meeting of the Minister with the farmers' representatives the impression was given that this 2 per cent levy was about to be dropped.  A short period elapsed and we had a further statement to the effect that it was to be reintroduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we had the PAYE march and headings in the papers saying &ldquo;Surrender&rdquo; on one side and as a result of that the Minister turned around and all was put back on again.  I see a heading here &ldquo;MacSharry favours realistic tax allowances&rdquo;&mdash; this was in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> for week ending 25 September 1979.  This is a farm tax not related to profits or earnings.  If you show a loss you still pay the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1980 budget as far as agriculture is concerned must be described as disastrous, inconsiderate and designed to create hardship, misery and misunderstanding <Col N="935" /> among the farming community.

      <P>The elimination of the rates subsidy for people of over £40 valuation and the introduction of the resource tax bore no relation to profit. The aim of the Government at the time was to extract from the farmers a predetermined sum to cover two-thirds of the expenses of the Department of Agriculture. This has been the rock on which the Government and the farmers have perished.  The failure of the Government to introduce a fair and equitable system of tax collection from farmers, having built into the system a suitable incentive to ensure that in the interests of the economy agriculture would grow and prosper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Deputy D'Arcy please to get away from taxation.  He is completely out of order on taxation.  Whatever about other farming matters that do not arise on the Estimate, when he gets on to taxation the Chair would be wrong to allow it to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's handling of agriculture is pathetic at all levels. Their attempt to resolve the fodder shortage was feeble.  Announcing that they were providing £4 million to remedy the situation demonstrates the incompetence <Col N="936" /> with which they were operating. What could be described as the crumbs are all that can be offered to agriculture. This offer demonstrates that the Government have no conception of the gravity of the situation that exists in agriculture. The problems are serious and require immediate action.</P>
      <P>All farmers were advised to modernise and develop their holdings.  They entered into sizeable commitments to carry out these developments.  With increased interest rates alone the repayments doubled in a two-year period and in the same period profits as far as agriculture was concerned were reduced.  Everybody seems to give his own figure but I found from own accounts that over the past two years the profits were reduced by approximately 40 per cent.  If any other line of business were placed in the same set of conditions, how long could they survive? They would be bankrupt, and if certain measures are not taken a lot of farmers will end up bankrupt.  No farmer who finds now that his repayments, whether to the bank or the ACC, have doubled can have foreseen that situation.  It is most unsatisfactory that farmers find themselves worse off than when we entered the EEC in 1972.  The indications are clear to those who wish to see them. There is a reduction in respect of the application of lime and in the application of artificial manure as we see from the Estimate.  Worst of all, we have to slaughter our cow herd.  It is reasonable to estimate that at least 400,000 cows will be slaughtered in 1980, and that is far too high a rate of culling from the national cow herd.  It is retrograde and such a measure can only be taken for short term gain, to enable farmers to pay off their loans.  It will have serious consequences on our cattle exports and will affect our balance of payments seriously.</P>
      <P>On 29 November last in County Cavan I suggested certain steps that could be taken by the Minister.  I said that positive action is needed immediately.  Today we had some suggestions, not many, and I am disappointed that the Chair has been insisting that we stick closely to the Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister widened the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We must go to the EEC and demand at least a 12 per cent increase in the price of our produce whether by way of a devaluation of the green £ or otherwise.  In the last year all the increase given to agriculture have been eaten up and anything less than 12 per cent will not compensate for the huge increases in production costs.  This would only be a first step to re-establish confidence among farmers.  The Government must give a commitment that all moneys extracted from farmers will be based on profits, whether the extractions be in rates, levies or income tax.  Farming is a business and it must be treated as such. Taxes should be based on profits.  The Government must appreciate the benefit to the State from the agricultural industry. We are facing an Estimate of £179 million, but how much of that will find its way into the farmers' pockets?  Are we satisfied with the way the money will be spent?</P>
      <P>Never before has there been a greater need for investment in agriculture.  The industry is not at the crossroads but at a standstill, and during this year farmers have been asking how many further burdens will be placed on them.  There has been indecision and lack of commitment by the Government.  In the past week we have seen acutely how bad things are in agriculture.  Where did the money come from for the national understanding? Where did the £13 million come from for the Donegal by-election?</P>

      <P>This is the first opportunity we have had to debate the very wide range of activities which come under the Department of Agriculture.  It is a pity that on this occasion the Opposition spokesmen, particularly Deputy Bruton and Deputy D'Arcy, both of whom spoke for almost an hour each, confined themselves almost exclusively to a litany of criticism of the Government without putting forward any solutions the Government can apply to halt the decline in agriculture.  The need to halt this decline is agreed on all sides and was acknowledged by the Minister not just this morning but at a number of meetings held regularly with farming representatives in an effort to see how the Government could do more for the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>The speeches by Deputy Bruton and Deputy Bermingham called the measures taken so far &ldquo;mickey mouse efforts&rdquo;.  I will not say I consider the Government have gone far enough.  Further consultations are taking place to improve the package for agriculture.  But to ridicule these efforts, decided on with the full agreement of the farming organisations, is less than responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is Ireland's major industry. It gainfully employs 23 per cent of the population directly and about 50 per cent in ancillary industries.  It accounts for almost 40 per cent of our total exports and, because of its nature, the inputs to agriculture in import terms are only one-quarter what they are for general industrial jobs.  Looking at those basic figures, we must all realise the extent to which we rely on agriculture.  We should use our collective wisdom to arrest this decline <Col N="941" /> and help our farmers, individually and collectively, out of the present crisis.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to mask the underlying problems that exist.  I do not intend to play down the anxieties experienced by individual farmers.  Farmers have been used to ups and downs.  In his contribution Deputy D'Arcy said he was worried about the number of cows being slaughtered. I agree with him, but he must agree with me that the drop in the cow numbers this year, which is bad, is about two-thirds of the drop which took place when his party were in power during the recession of 1974-75.  At that time calves were taken into the cattle marts and no price was offered for them.  Farmers went home and left them in the sales yard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>But with a difference.  Our Minister is prepared to do more for these people.  He has introduced certain measures. Can the Deputy tell me one measure introduced by the Coalition Minister for Agriculture at a time when about 700,000 cows were slaughtered in less than 12 months and the beef herd had practically disappeared?</P>
      <P>Deputies condemned the suckler scheme.  None of us is claiming that the incentives in it are very dramatic.  However, it is not a question of not agreeing to a suckler scheme, suggesting as you did that you would rather it was paid on a calf-to-beef basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to increase our livestock numbers, but this cannot be done very effectively in the way suggested by Deputy D'Arcy.  We must concentrate on production cows. Not only has the decline in cow numbers to be arrested but we must try to get them to rise anyway we can and any incentives towards that end are to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to move from those few general comments on the failure of the Opposition parties to put forward concrete suggestions on what might be done and to make one or two suggestions myself.  If <Col N="942" /> we look at agriculture on the basis of this Estimate there are a number of areas where an attack has to be made to maximise the potential development of agriculture. Obviously, the first area that needs to be tackled is the area of prices. The real problem in agriculture has been caused by the failure of prices to keep pace with inflation.  Production costs continued to increase while price increases were not possible.  This resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of farm incomes.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the suggestion made earlier, during the past three-and-a-half years, the level of investment in Irish agriculture continued to grow.  If any Deputy has regard to the number of applications for various grants in respect of farm organisations, he will realise that during the past three years the number of such applications has been twice what was the figure between 1973 and 1977.  I am making this point because there was an implication in an earlier contribution that the level of grants paid this year was an indication of the number of farmers who had applied for these grants during a three-and-a-half year period and that the grants were not paid until this year. That is not so.  In my constituency of North Tipperary, in 1978-79 practically 1,000 farmers availed of these grants. Last year the number was 980 and this year I hope it will exceed 1,200.  I admit that the level of investment in farm development is not of the order that we would wish for but the reason for this is that the amount of profits accruing to farmers are not of an order that would enable them to undertake farm development from these resources alone.  Therefore, they must borrow if they are to develop but the levels of interest rates have been such in recent times as to make that prohibitive on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis. There may also have been cases of farmers having borrowed already to an extent that might be described as excessive in an effort to streamline and to modernise for the future.</P>
    <P>Prices are determined in Brussels and on this front, judging from what we have seen so far of the performance of the Minister for Agriculture, we can rest <Col N="943" /> assured that his input and that of his officials will be such as to ensure that price increases to the farming community will be the best that can be got even if that is in a climate which is not conducive, perhaps, to very optimistic trends so far as the possibilities are concerned.  In his efforts, the Minister will have the backing of this House.  His area of responsibility is of paramount importance to the whole country.</P>
    <P>The question of the devaluation of the green £ is an area in which obviously something can be done.  However, price rises in respect of farm produce add to inflation and in that way erode their value to some extent.  Another area to which I should like to draw attention is that area whereby the Government extract money from agriculture.  I do not know how great have been the pressures in this regard but subsidies should be paid wherever possible.  It is not my intention to belittle, for instance, the silage fodder scheme.  Almost 17,000 farmers considered it worth while to avail of that scheme, the lateness of which was due to problems created by bad weather, but that was a situation that the Minister could not have foreseen.  Encouraged by the impact that the scheme has had in the relatively short time of its existence and taking into account that farmers were being urged to do something which was in many ways contrary to what might be regarded as good farming practice, that is, the conservation of winter fodder, I suggest that the scheme be continued.  I am not saying that it should become a permanent feature of departmental activity but perhaps it could be continued for people going into silage for the first time. The scheme has the dual effect of ensuring adequate supplies of fodder, regardless of weather conditions, and of enabling farmers to increase livestock numbers.  Not only must we increase stock numbers but we must ensure that there is adequate winter feed for them. To that extent we encourage first-time silage farmers as much as possible and we follow up that by aggressive marketing, by developing by-products of produce and in ensuring in so far as possible that <Col N="944" /> when extra produce is available there is a viable market for it.  In this way we ensure the continuity of production and the maintenance of employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>There are problems in this whole area. When, for instance, the Government urge farmers to increase cattle stocks, they cannot be aware of problems that may arise later.  In, say, a four-year period from the time of any such decision to the end result in terms of beef, a number of problems could arise which could not have been foreseen originally.  All we can do is to make every effort possible to ensure continued growth in this area.  We must do everything possible to encourage early silage.  It might be worth while considering paying subsidies at the rate of, say, £3 per ton in respect of first-time silage making, £2 per ton in respect of the following year's production and so on to a phasing out stage.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the expansion and development in land improvement and in the provision of winter buildings by way of the farm modernisation scheme.  A good deal remains to be done in that area.  Because of the high interest rates obtaining and because of the pessimism that can be generated through all the talk of doom and gloom in relation to agriculture, the confidence of those farmers who have not borrowed already and who have not developed their holdings can be shaken to a point where they will be afraid to borrow for the purpose of undertaking necessary developments on their lands or for the provision of the buildings that would be necessary in the light of herd expansion.  Perhaps farm modernisation grants could be paid at the half-way stage.  In other words I am asking whether it would be possible to pay half the amount of such a grant at the stage when half or little more than half the work was completed.  This will enable farmers to proceed with the work without undertaking unnecessary borrowing.  I should like the Minister to consider that proposition and to implement it if feasible.</P>
    <P>The scheme relating to disadvantaged areas is covered in the Estimate.  I come from a county that has been totally <Col N="945" /> excluded from the advantages that flow from that scheme although there is a proposal with the Commission to include the Slieve Felim area which comprises seven or eight parishes in the hilly area of Tipperary, in Kilcommon, Rear Cross, Upperchurch and parts of Templederry and Hollyford.  During the general election campaign a serious commitment was given to people in those areas to include them in the scheme.  There had been no progress on the matter by the National Coalition when they were in office.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture for a major breakthrough in the negotiations to cover a wider area in the scheme.  He has been able to get the Commission to accept a wider area for consideration.</P>
    <P>I understand that the original scheme covered the maximum possible at the time and that remained the position until the Minister got a concession to increase the area.  He should intensify his efforts to finalise the matter.  The area I have mentioned is 1,000 feet above sea level and the population has shown a decline since the famine times.  I do not have to mention the poor soil fertility of such hilly areas.  As has been the case in other areas, a group of young farmers came together to play their part in remedying the situation.  About a year ago a farming co-operative was inaugurated and worthwhile work has been done in organising schemes for the area; there has been work on deep ploughing schemes, on contractor availability and so on. Although there are limitations imposed because of the size of farms, the population structure, soil analyses and so on, the young people who have done such good work are to be congratulated.  If the Minister is successful in getting this area included it will be a great moral boost for the people.  It will encourage greater land improvement and development generally and arrest the decline in population.  It will renew confidence in a hinterland in the hills of north and south Tipperary and parts of east Limerick.</P>
    <P>During the debate and at Question Time on occasions in the past few years I have been glad to note a change of attitude on the part of the Opposition <Col N="946" /> Parties with regard to their support for the Government in measures taken to eradicate disease in our herds.  I accept that they may be unpopular and awkward for individual farmers and expensive for the country and the farmers but I was glad to see the support the Minister has been getting from Opposition Deputies in recent times for efforts that began when we came back to office and which has been intensified since then to rid the country of brucellosis and TB.  There is no need to go into detail on what these diseases are costing the country.  About 80,000 calves are lost each year because of brucellosis.  Therefore, any expenditure, whether State grants or individual efforts by farmers, is worth while if we are to increase our exports and provide animals for our meat processing units. The advantages in clearing the disease far outweigh any short-term disadvantages that have to be experienced by individual farmers.</P>
    <P>One other disease that should be mentioned is that of mastitis in dairy herds. Recent figures by An Foras Talúntais show a loss of up to £40 million in milk production.  Research on better management, on post-milking disinfection, on dry cow therapy and so on show that the incidence of this disease can be reduced, thus effecting a considerable saving of money for the economy generally and for individual farmers.  I should like the Minister to give help so that research work may be carried out and also to help ACOT and farmers generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the provision of adequate educational facilities for the farming community.  Proposals have been put forward already for the building of more agricultural schools. Though undoubtedly additional places are necessary, by the time such would come on stream the effective numbers involved would not be sufficiently significant. Therefore we should take a closer look at how the present educational system could be utilised to lay a better educational groundwork for farming generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of scientific advice that would be a very difficult thing to do.  Our whole interest is in the conservation of fishing stocks.  The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and the Scientific and Technical Committee of the European Commission advise that we should continue with the closure of the Celtic Sea in regard to herring fishing in order to enhance and rehabilitate the herring stocks there.  It is very hard to go against that advice in an international sense.  I fully realise the hardships involved but that is the situation.

      <P>I am aware that the killing of foxes has increased in recent years because of the higher value being placed on their skin.  The fox is not a protected animal under the Wildlife Act 1976. However, I am keeping the situation under review.</P>
      <P>Section 44 of the Wildlife Act makes it an offence for any person to enter on lands without the permission of the owner or occupier for the purpose of hunting any wild bird or wild animal.  It is also an offence to carry on the lands any weapon or device capable of being used for hunting and it is an offence to shoot into or over such lands.  Anyone who has reason to believe that such an offence has been committed should report the matter to the local gardaié.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of a growing tendency in recent years to engage, with new devices, in the killing of foxes by night?  If so is he concerned at the dangers that might be associated with that practice in regard to life and limb and indeed also to livestock?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern. Indeed under export regulations which we passed last year, Statutory Instrument 235 of 1979 made under the Wildlife Act, 1976, my permission is required for the export of skins, so that we now have a controlled situation in regard to the export of fox skins.  The order came into operation on 7 August of last year.  We can now control and monitor the situation.  There are a number of options open to us.  If it is necessary to protect fox stock &mdash; although strangely enough the Deputy and House may be <Col N="953" /> aware that years ago it was the reverse situation &mdash; appropriate action will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

Is the Minister aware of any legislation at present on the Statute Book that would permit him to end or discourage this practice?  I should make clear that my worry is that some tragedy might result from this type of activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that fishermen here, as elsewhere, are experiencing difficulties mainly because of restricted fishing for some species of fish and a drop in market prices.  These problems must be solved in an EEC context.</P>
      <P>Despite unfavourable scientific advice I have pressed at EEC level for limited openings of the Celtic Sea and Donegal herring fisheries on social and economic grounds but so far I have been unable to secure the agreement of the Commission or the other member states to such openings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> In order to counteract the drop in market prices I have also taken up at EEC level the question of reducing the level of third country imports, increasing the rates of import duties and increasing the amount of compensation paid to fishermen for fish withdrawn from market.  Following on these representations import duties have been re-imposed on a number of species on which duties had been suspended. Reference prices on imported frozen fish have also been increased.  I am glad to say that for some varieties at least there has been a recent improvement in price trends.</P>
    <P>At the Fisheries Council on 17 and 18 November the Commission put forward comprehensive proposals for revising the EEC marketing regulations including control of third country imports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any realisation that our fishermen at present are on the verge of financial shipwreck? Have the Government and the Minister any positive plans in mind to offset this position and put fishermen in a situation where they can earn a living?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that, as I said in the reply the Commission are also aware of this matter which is of general concern throughout the Community. The Commission at a very recent meeting &mdash; only this week &mdash; of the Fisheries Council put forward comprehensive proposals for revising marketing regulations particularly through the control of third country imports which have tended to depress the market for Community fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure is entirely based on scientific advice.  It is for the rehabilitation of the herring stocks in the Celtic Sea and off the Donegal coast for the benefit of Irish fishermen.  This is so fundamental that the people who will be the greatest gainers by reason of the recovery of stocks will be the fishermen in the adjoining ports like Dunmore in Waterford, Kilmore in Wexford and Burtonport and Killybegs in Donegal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the broader context, I have been urging the EEC Commission for some time past to undertake a review of the overall Community marketing structure for fishery products and I am glad to say that the Commission recently presented a communication to the Council setting down guidelines for such a review.  The communication was a comprehensive document and included provision for a more satisfactory system of controls over imports from third countries.  The Commission have now submitted proposals to the Council for a <Col N="961" /> comprehensive revision of the Community marketing regulation based on the communication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that in his area most of the calls made by tourists would be made through an operator so there would be no necessity to put up notices in other languages.

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of the continued public dissatisfaction with the state of the telephone service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that the service at times and in some aspects may be less than satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The basic reason for this is that the service is being called upon at times to deal with a greater volume of traffic than it is at present capable of dealing with. The importance of improving the service in the shortest time possible has been recognised by the Government in their approval last year of the five year accelerated development programme, estimated to cost £650 million at 1979 prices. Very many major development projects are in progress or in advanced planning stages and all are being pressed ahead as quickly as practicable.  Improvements will come progressively over the five-year period according as individual schemes are completed, and already considerable progress has been made.  It is perhaps relevant to the question of the public's dissatisfaction to say that new applications for the services this year have been higher than ever before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are there such great difficulties especially in new housing estates and in new industrial estates on the outskirts of Dublin?  Surely it would have been a simple matter for the service to have been laid on when the estate was being built.</P>

But in all the new housing estates in Dublin at the moment provision is being made for the cabling of those as they are being built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so in relation to certain areas where the cables are old and badly in need of repair or replacement.

      <P>When the former postmaster at Firhouse resigned earlier this year, the vacancy was advertised and traders in the shopping centre, where the office was located, were canvassed.  No-one from the shopping centre applied for the vacancy and in order to maintain counter services there was no reasonable alternative but to appoint the only suitable applicant.  While the new post office is not as convenient for some people as the former was, it caters reasonably well for the area and in view of the recent appointment of the new postmaster there can be no question of re-locating the office at this stage.</P>

In many cases, people set up industries and businesses and having set them up then look for the telephone service.  I would appeal to the public and to the Deputies to realise that any forward information which can be given to my Department would be only too welcome.

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was asking how we could ensure that those young people who are going into farming have the best possible education. It is recognised that in the past those who entered agriculture did not have such a good standard of education in technical and other areas.  Deputy D'Arcy felt we needed more agricultural colleges but I expressed the view that the existing system at primary and second level should be used to ensure that the standard of agricultural education was enhanced. With the involvement of the advisory services and local agricultural instructors it should be possible to introduce some scheme in the immediate future.  The winter farm schools and the efforts of ACOT are a help but, obviously, more must be done.  The Minister should, as far as possible, make the necessary funds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton belittled the interest <Col N="997" /> subsidy announced earlier this year. While it is clear that more has to be done in that area Deputy Bruton should have suggested a different scheme rather than belittle the one that has been introduced. I should like to categorise the areas where the Government will be giving help because there are essential differences between the categories of farmers who are in financial difficulty.  I regard the farmer who is carrying out essential building and land improvement in the first category of importance.  The scale of that type of development in the last six or seven years has been enormous by any standards.  The amount of money expended in providing winter facilities and in land improvement was such that we can carry greater livestock numbers and house them in the winter.  In spite of the economic climate and other pressures we are poised, because of that phenomenal development, to carry greater stocks.  That will be of enormous benefit to the farming community and the country.</P>
    <P>The second category I should like to refer to are the farmers who purchase land to enlarge their holdings, particularly small and medium sized holdings. Unfortunately, where such land adjoined them farmers paid more than the value for the land.  They got help from the financial institutions, particularly the banks who must share part of the responsibility for the excessive amounts paid for such land and for setting up unnecessary competition.  Help must be given to that area.  In some instances borrowings reached limits of £1,000 per cow in the dairy sector and up to £500 per acre for other farming enterprises.  The repayments on loans of that order are not within the capacity of many farmers. Therefore, farmers welcome the restructuring of loans that is taking place.  Inevitably, there will be a small percentage of farmers, even with the restructuring, who will not be saved from the pressures that exist with the result that the amount of debt will increase.  Special help is needed in such cases because many of those farmers acted on the advice of local instructors and successive Governments in carrying out major developments.  It is because <Col N="998" /> they were the pioneers in such work that any disaster which affects them would have the effect of discouraging others who have not improved their holdings.</P>
    <P>The third category I should like to refer to are those who are big in farming already and who made an effort to enlarge their holdings.  It is not easy to expect any Government in the climate that exists at present to carry the can in such situations.  I am not saying that I would rule out such people completely but they would not be as high on my priority list as the other categories I referred to.  When referring to prices and the efforts being made in Brussels to market our agricultural produce generally I mentioned that it is hard for the public generally to reconcile certain facts about the world scene.  It is hard for the average person to reconcile the fact that there are mountains of this-and-that in Europe with the fact that a quarter of the world's population is hungry and that 17,000,000 children will die of hunger in the next five years, if existing conditions continue.</P>
    <P>The food aid programme for the Commission to be worked out in Brussels must give scope for the transfer of some of those resources to countries who need them although, admittedly, the best solution is for those countries to develop themselves.  In recent times North African countries, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco, have made significant sales. Here I wish to pay tribute to the Purcell brothers of County Tipperary for what they have done this year in establishing markets for store and beef categories in Libya and Tunisia.  They helped very considerably in keeping the price of cattle up all during this year.  While the numbers of exports of live stores are controversial, there are two shades of opinion on it.  In all the experience we have here, it is necessary to safeguard the prices by having a percentage of our cattle exported live.  It is very important that we maintain this in future.  It is important, too, that the sales of those cattle do not reach any more than the necessary levels, in order to maintain healthy competition with the processing units.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome a statement by the Minister although it is not dealt with in <Col N="999" /> the Estimate.  I anticipate the same degree of leniency from the Ceann Comhairle as seemed to be apparent in earlier discussions.  I welcome the statement by the Minister that the White Paper on land policy is about to be circulated. This is an area which comes under the Department of Agriculture and it is awaited with some degree of hope and expectancy by many people.  The existing Land Commission evolved from a series of land Acts at the end of the last century which were updated and strengthened at five or six different periods up to about 1965.  They cover tenant land purchase, compulsory acquisition, land restructuring programmes, controlled sub-division and a farm retirement scheme, to mention a few.  There is no doubt that in many areas the Land Commission have made a significant contribution; equally it is necessary for the future that it be restructured and brought up to date so that it may deal more effectively with the land problems that are there.  The task is formidable.  There are no easy solutions.  Sixty five per cent of our holdings are under 50 acres.  Twenty three per cent of farmers are over 65 years.  About half the holdings in the country are fragmented and are concentrated in the west and north west.  Up to 50,000 farmers have no direct heirs.</P>
    <P>I could give other statistics but those are enough to indicate the task that lies before a rejuvenated Land Commission, which will tackle them in the future.  It is clear that all these problems cannot be solved by a State agency, only a small percentage of land comes on the open market each year.  About 92 per cent of land holdings transfers take place within the family or extended family.  We have to accept that it is extremely difficult to devise a national strategy for land use, for fragmentation, poor farm soil, and to have a policy that will be sensitive to regional needs.  We hope that the discussions which will take place on the White Paper will be helpful in evolving a system which can tackle the problems I have already mentioned.  It is clear that a curb is necessary to prevent bigger farmers from buying more land.  Proposals in this <Col N="1000" /> regard, if they are effective, will be welcome.</P>
    <P>One of the areas that should be tackled more vigorously by the Commission is fragmented holdings, even where there is no land for sale.  We all know of clusters of houses with fragmented holdings and individual farmers with land which is totally mixed.  The Commission should involve itself more in encouraging farmers, wherever possible, to consolidate their holdings.  Macra na Feirme and other interested groups should also help farmers to extract the maximum potential from their land.  Anybody who understands agriculture knows that that is only possible if all the land is together.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a better division of commonages.  They are a prime example of under-productive blocks of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave it at that.  I should like to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your leniency which I half anticipated on the basis of earlier performance.</P>
      <P>I should like to recap on a few of the things I have said.  In spite of the economic climate, enough good work is being done and we have sufficient intelligent farmers to reap the benefits of earlier efforts.  A formidable task faces the Minister, the Government and the European Commission if they are to help the agricultural sector and ensure that it surmounts the present difficulties.</P>
      <P>This is not a time for looking back.  The Government should act quickly and not allow a situation to develop where farmers feel it is necessary to mount a campaign of the kind some individuals in the farming organisations are advocating. The farmers would not win, the Government would not win, and the country would not win.  Any scope in the area of releasing funds extracted from agriculture, or in the battle for price increases, should be availed of with speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that a slowing down in agricultural expansion is not acceptable to the farmers, or the processing units which would be under-utilised <Col N="1001" /> and would become much more expensive to run with a consequent job risk, or to the trade unions who obviously have a direct interest in job security and new job potential.  In spite of the difficulties we can have an orderly and balanced expansion oriented towards the areas where the best advantage lies.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations should not get involved in a debate about the national understanding.  In consultation with the trade unions they should pay what they can afford to the people who work for them and provide services, and not endanger the relationship between the farming and the non-farming sector. The country is too small to play one section against the other.  I appreciate the pressures on the farming leadership and on farmers.  Statistics show that one-third of our farmers earn less than £2,000 a year.  There is no denying that there are problems which have to be sorted out.  I doubt that they will be sorted out by entering into a debate on whether the terms of the national understanding should be implemented.</P>
    <P>I suppose talk of doom and gloom is inevitable in certain circles.  It is fundamental for us to find out where the advantages are and to build on what has been done already.  Farming has known ups and downs before, and we must ensure that the vast bulk of our people engaged in the agricultural industry ride through the storms and are poised to take advantage of the good prospects for the future. Deputies on all sides of the House should be committed to suggesting ways and means for making that possible.  That collective will on the part of Deputies and the Government will be matched by the farming community in the resilience and the resourcefulness which traditionally they have shown in the past, and we will be ready to march forward when the recession is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wonder whether all the repetitious speeches made in this House have any effect on the problems which confront us.  This is a Supplementary Estimate for £39,783,000.  In introducing this Estimate the Minister realises quite clearly the level of the problems <Col N="1002" /> facing the farming community.  My remarks today will be in the context of the western farmer, the smaller farmer who has been neglected down through the years, and who is not of as much concern to the bigger organisations as he should be.</P>
      <P>Yesterday this city witnessed a demonstration by the young farmers of Ireland. Many thousand of them travelled to Dublin from all parts of the country to show their dissatisfaction and discontent about Government inaction in the agricultural sector.  These are the young men and women of the future.  They hold the agricultural reins in their hands, as it were, and from their display yesterday it is obvious that the enthusiasm and fire which they showed when they took over their various holdings of land have been dimmed and deadened by Government inactivity and by the factual situation which confronts them.</P>
      <P>The Government's apparent inability to grapple with the agricultural problems for the benefit of the entire community is weighing very heavily upon their minds. The method by which they displayed their discontent and dissatisfaction yesterday is to be commended.  There was not an ugly incident in it.  If many of these young people were brought to different parts of this city they would see poverty of a different kind and they would probably realise that they are not alone in the scale of problems confronting them.</P>
      <P>If our agricultural problems are to be sorted out political decisions must be taken in co-operation with the different bodies and the farmers themselves.  Political decisions can be taken very quickly, but sometimes they take many years. Last week in the Minister's speech on the intervention problem he said:</P>
      <P>Because of the Community's budgetary situation and financial constraints, this permission was not forthcoming and I felt it necessary to take urgent alternative action to support the market. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very well-written phrase and it is quite common in speeches by various Ministers down through the years.  It is also fair to say that because of this country's <Col N="1003" /> budgetary situation and financial constraints the Taoiseach and the Minister were not very anxious to remove the resource tax or the rates levy over £40 valuation in the early part of the year. Even though the budgetary situation and financial constraints were there, when it became politically necessary to make the decision it was made overnight.  Extra money will have to be borrowed or found somewhere else to cater for the concession given to farmers with valuations between £40 and £60.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly in order to speak about airports and huge industrial development work and other works of that nature, but if we have not got adequate numbers of livestock and if the farmer is not doing what he should be doing, the whole community will suffer.</P>
    <P>A problem facing agriculture is the lack of adequate markets.  It is pointless for a farmer in the west to buy an animal at £42 a hundredweight, keep it for six months and then sell it for £30 a hundredweight.  That is not the way to run a business, and unless there are incentives to the farmer to keep the necessary livestock, including a decent market, we will not have the numbers of livestock that we require nor the resultant spin-offs throughout the community.  It might be in the Minister's interests to call all the interested marketing bodies together, the co-ops, the farmers, the factories, the processors and so on to look at the possibility of forming a semi-State organisation such as Bord Bainne to draw up an intensive marketing programme that will ensure that if a farmer buys an animal there will be an increased price for it when it is resold.  It is disheartening and discouraging for a farmer to have to buy animals with borrowed money, on which he is paying a high rate of interest, and to find having looked after the animal for a considerable time, that because of a slump in the market prices and the lack of a guaranteed market the animal must be sold at the price at which he bought it or at a reduced price.</P>
    <P>Subhead A3 of the Estimate relates to travelling and incidental expenses of <Col N="1004" /> £975,000.  The people in the veterinary offices throughout the country have been waiting for travelling expenses for up to 14 months.  Although these expenses will eventually come, they are operating out of their own pockets.  That is something that the Minister should deal with.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Smith refer to the White Paper on agriculture because the Land Commission are not mentioned in this subhead even though they are of major importance particularly to western farmers who have fragmented holdings.  It is necessary to give a decent level of finance to the Land Commission. In the west all of the estates on hands in the Land Commission have been scheduled for division.  This means that Land Commissioners and inspectors have not got the amount of work to do in division that they could have had, had they been given sufficient money to buy more land.</P>
    <P>Government speakers mentioned that we did not suggest alternative progressive policies.  I will make a few suggestions.  In relation to the sheep subsidy payment the Minister could go back to Brussels and say that all of the disadvantaged areas for this purpose should be classified as being hill areas.  At the moment there are different levels of payment because of the classification of different areas in the one county.  It is ludicrous to have in an area clasified as being totally disadvantaged different rates of payment.  It would be in the interests of sheep farmers and of the Minister if something could be done to ensure that in an area classified as being disadvantaged, sheep subsidy payments will be as for a hill area, thereby enabling farmers there to qualify for the highest level of sheep subsidy payment.</P>
    <P>In relation to cattle headage payments, the Minister announced that there was to be an increase.  An additional £8,432 million is now being sought under this subhead to finance the increased grants.  The cattle headage payments are important to western Ireland.  An area classified as a disadvantaged area for the purpose of this payment is obviously disadvantaged. All of County Mayo is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme, yet people who are unfortunate enough to have a land valuation of over £40 must pay <Col N="1005" /> £17.46 rateable valuation per £, which is very much over the national average and is almost twice what has to be paid in County Meath, taking into account the quality and structure of the land concerned.</P>
    <P>The cost of administering the cattle headage payment scheme in the disadvantaged areas this year is estimated at £1.08 million, a sizeable sum.  The Minister understands the problems associated with cattle headage payments.  In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 405 of 21 October the Minister supplied detailed and interesting information about cattle headage payments.  In County Cavan 1,037 applications were received and the number of inspectors was five; in County Clare there were 6,559 applications and the number of inspectors was 14; in County Cork the number of applications was 4,925 with 12 inspectors.  It varied between 847 applications in County Limerick with three inspectors to 898 applications for Longford with six inspectors, to 15,480 applications for County Mayo with 31 inspectors.</P>
    <P>There are a huge number of applications from County Mayo and this indicates the inherent problems that Mayo farmers face.  With 31 inspectors to cover that number of herds, if one inspector were to inspect ten herds per day, taking into account geographical location and the size of the herd, it would take two months.  I have been informed that many farmers who apply for cattle headage payments are forced to sell their cattle before the inspection takes place.  This was raised with the Minister and his predecessor and some concessions were made in relation to an area date for cattle headage inspections.  If a farmer has his annual herd test in August he would be enabled to sell his cattle for up to 30 days afterwards, he does not have to pay for his annual test and he then waits for his cattle headage inspection.  This may not come for two or two and a half months.  In the meantime if he has no out-buildings his cattle will start to plough up the land to eat the grass and to consume winter fodder whether it is silage or hay.  If there is a drop in the market and if a farmer does <Col N="1006" /> not have enough fodder to tide him over until prices rise he is forced to sell his cattle at the market price.  He runs an enormous risk of losing heavily while waiting for a cattle headage inspection which may not take place for two and a half months.  I know that the Minister brought in inspectors from outside areas to help in disadantaged areas and that was a welcome innovation.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is too long to wait from September for two and a half months if at the end a farmer is forced to sell his cattle at whatever price he can get at the market.</P>
    <P>The farmer must pay for his test and when he calls a vet and if the market price drops the increase given in the cattle headage unit payments will not be of much advantage to him.  The Minister could take up with his counterparts in Europe the fact that the cattle headage payment scheme should be changed to a headage payment scheme and give a decent incentive to a farmer to keep an increased number of animals from his previous year's application.  It is based on a unit idea at present.  If one has to keep calves from birth and rear them it takes care, time and money.  If a proper incentive were given to increase the number of animals not alone would one have the same number of applications for the headage grant but there would be greater encouragement to keep a higher number of animals.  It could be operated on an averaged out basis over the past three years but either way a decent incentive should be given for every animal kept over and above last year's application.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider consulting with the vets and send around inspectors with them at the time of the annual inspection because all the information necessary for headage application is taken down at the annual test by the vet. It would save time from the farmer's point of view in not having to round up herds from fragmented holdings.  It would save administration to some extent.  I am not sure what problems might arise from that but it is a suggestion that bears some consideration in the light of complaints by farmers that no matter what concessions the Minister may give <Col N="1007" /> the headage inspection takes place too late.</P>
    <P>In County Mayo, which has the largest number of applications, this is a constant source of complaint.  Farmers feel the cattle headage inspections should be carried out at an earlier date than they are at present.  It would eliminate the need for having to keep an animal for six months if one were to go on a head basis. The system of cow calving in the west is not as sophisticated as we would like and often calves do not arrive until March or April.  If they are to be kept for six months to qualify for a unit allocation under the scheme they must be kept out until August or September.  I hope the Minister bears my sugestion in mind.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that the Minister mentioned that the EEC were giving permission to allow into intervention the eight-rib cut.  That is a welcome innovation because it allows one to go to the continental market as well as to the British one.  I hope it will benefit the farmers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the winter fodder scheme for £600,000 I have had discussions with people in co-ops from the west in relation to the nitrogen subsidy.  A certain amount of nitrogen was bought but due to the very adverse conditions a lot of it was not spread and is still lodged in barns and sheds on many farms.  It is not the Minister's fault that the weather was as bad as it was.  The initial reaction to the announcement of the scheme was favourable because conditions were so bad at that time that farmers were willing to grasp any straw that came their way.  I do not know if it will be as successful next year if it is re-introduced.  It was a method of moving more nitrogen out of NET than might have been moved in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The decision to abolish the lime subsidy last year was not a favourable one, particularly for western farmers.  It is ironic to think that the nitrogen scheme was introduced to bring about a certain improvement and yet it is well known that the basic inadequacy of all soil in the west is lime.  The Minister should consider re-introducing this subsidy either in conjunction with the winter fodder <Col N="1008" /> scheme or on its own.  The type of soil that comprises many western farms is such that when nitrogen is spread to any significant degree it requires a further dressing of a different fertiliser the following spring.  That will force the farmers to buy extra fertiliser and whether that is good or bad has also to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Another source of complaint from young farmers who inherit or are lucky enough to be able to purchase holdings, or get them from the Land Commission, is that they find it difficult to get sufficient money to reclaim, fertilise, stock their holdings and so on.  The Minister should give serious consideration to that.  Particularly in relation to disadvantaged areas the Minister should look at the situation regarding long-term low interest loans for small farmers who would not have the capacity to borrow that larger farmers would have.  If a young farmer was to buy 20 acres at £1,000 an acre, which he probably would not get, at an interest rate of 20 per cent he would have to make a profit of £200 an acre to pay the interest. That does not take into account the fact that he would have to re-stock, fence and secure that holding in every possible way.</P>
    <P>Low interest, long-term loans for smaller farmers in disadvantaged areas would be a very worthwhile innovation by the Minister.  Deputy Smith mentioned the problem of communal division. I am not going to stray too deeply into it because, a Cheann Comhairle, I know your ruling on this matter, but it could be taken in the context of aids to farmers in certain less favoured areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be stretching it a bit.  However, I will let the Deputy make the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to commonages and certain less favoured areas, it is an accepted fact that the use of commonages at the moment is not at all what it could be were they divided.  The legal complications that arise where objections occur are something else that I trust the Minister <Col N="1009" /> will have looked into in his White Paper on agriculture or in some other context because that tends to slow up for many years potential development by young farmers.  The proven quality of land in many commonages that have been divided speaks for itself, and even though the amount of commonage in some counties might not be great, in my county it is enormous and it merits very serious consideration and swift action from the Minister.</P>
      <P>In the context of the very high loss of sheep in wintertime by hill farmers, at the base of many of the hills or mountains usually there are vast acreages of commonages and it might be in the interest of the Minister to look at the possibility of the creation of some sort of very large paddocks or holding pens that would enable these hill farmers to bring their sheep down in wintertime and feed them with resultant benefit from the decreased mortality rate.  On a western hill the mortality rate among sheep in a severe winter is extremely high.  Had the farmers the facility to bring these sheep down and hold them at much lower level in commonage divided by either the Land Commission or the Department themselves, that would be another innovation that would be to their benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Connacht Farmers Co-Op Society produced a document which I understand they sent to the Minister in relation to County Mayo to which they compared a region in France.  The report speaks for itself and I hope that the Minister will act on it.  In western Ireland we had for the last four or five years a very significant increase in the number of farmers who went into milk production because of the incentives there.  However, due to the enormous costs in farming and the prices they get for their produce, over 200 of them have gone out of production in the last 18 months.  This is a very unwelcome trend and it should be looked at very seriously with a view to encouraging these people to go back into milk production if at all possible.  I know that I am speaking in the context of milk mountains on account of very large production in other parts of the country, but it might be a proper incentive for the <Col N="1010" /> smaller milk producers if all of the levies imposed upon milk production were abolished in disadvantaged areas.  A disadvantaged area must be recognised as such.  With the advent of Greece and Portugal into the EEC the regional fund for development of disadvantaged areas might not be as great for this country in the years ahead as it was in the past.</P>
    <P>Regarding disease eradication, the Minister made his hopeful prediction that TB would be eradicated inside five or six years.  We all have to strive for this and the Minister is confident that with herd-owner co-operation this could be abolished in that time.  With the very stringent regulations being laid down by the EEC and with the urgent necessity for this country to comply with those regulations, it is fair to say that from an effective point of view the 30-day test would be more adequate to bring about that situation. However, in practical terms the many complaints received in relation to the 30-day test would suggest that a 60-day test would be more appropriate, particularly for the western countries.</P>
    <P>The amount of money spent on disease eradication in this country over the last 20 years must be enormous and I fail to understand how disease has not been wiped out.  Somebody must have received that money and what is going on now should have taken place ten years ago or even earlier when money was worth its real value and probably would have had a much greater impact on the disease eradication programme than we have seen up to now.</P>
    <P>Directive 161 on the farm retirement scheme, has caused enormous complications in western Ireland.  If my memory is correct, one of the statements on the farm retirement scheme booklet was that development farmers did not qualify for land under the retirement scheme. Whether it is true or not, this has had the effect that many potential development farmers do not want to be classified as development because they fear that if land is available for allocation and division in their area they might not get it due to this directive.</P>
    <P>Also if land comes on the market for division under the farm retirement <Col N="1011" /> scheme the fact that it must be recommended for division by the agricultural instructors is something else that has caused trouble.  I understand that a list of potential applicants is circulated to the county committee or to the agricultural instructors in question and by the application of various mathematical equations a situation is reached where one or other person acquires or is allocated the portion of land concerned.  Presumably this would be to bring the person into development status.  I find that agricultural instructors are reluctant to do this because the tendency is that many people who use agricultural instructors for advice are the ones who naturally would have the greatest case, whereas if proper incentives were available for others to use the agricultural instructors also the land might go to a person who got advice from an agricultural instructor whereas he might not be the person most eligible to acquire that portion of land.  The Minister should look at the situation again in the context of the allocation of land acquired or made available under the farm retirement scheme on the basis of it being divided by the Land Commission and not on the absolute recommendations made by agricultural instructors just because they are available to do it.  This causes difficulty in rural Ireland.  There should also be some amendment to the directive to allow farmers to acquire a payment for handing the land over to their sons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the suckler scheme.  I cannot see it being a success in the west of Ireland.  It has created an extra structure within the Department.  HEOs and other posts have had to be created for the operation of this scheme.  There is a certain unease among farmers about the operation of the scheme.  They would prefer something simpler with a greater incentive.  Their experience of suckling calves in the west has not lead to a very favourable reaction to this scheme and I cannot see it being a success.</P>
      <P>There is need to do something to encourage small farmers to continue in agriculture.  It is not easy for a person who is forced to draw unemployment assistance to rear a family and make any profit from a small holding in the west of Ireland.  Deputy Smith gave figures in relation to the size of holdings and the social implications of the people who are farming them.  It is important to take a look at the small farmer incentive scheme, for which there is a very small allocation in the Supplementary Estimate. Many of the small farmers who cannot get into the farm modernisation scheme should be given some other incentive.  It might be a good thing to reintroduce a small farmers' incentive scheme so that after a period of a few years they might be able, by decent production and honest effort, to have acquired a comparable income, or to have some other development qualification which would enable them to be classified in the farm modernisation scheme so that they can move on to a higher level of grant assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that under this Supplementary Estimate money will be spent by the Department in conjunction with the £300 million allocated by the EEC for the stimulation of agricultural development in the west.  Many people get carried away by that large sum of money but they do not <Col N="1013" /> realise that it is to be spread over a ten year period over 12 counties, which means an allocation of £2,500,000 per county.  There is not a Member in the House who could not point to where that £2,500,000 could be spent in any area. The money for forestry development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank you for giving it to me.  The demonstration yesterday outside the gates of Leinster House indicates the very serious dissatisfaction of thousands of young farmers all over the country with the agricultural situation.  It behoves the Minister and his advisers in the Department to take the suggestions offered to them to heart and to attempt to offer encouragement and hope to, in particular, the young farmers who are finding it very difficult to take a step forward in agriculture because of the situation which they are presented with every day.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Estimate.  We welcome any additional expenditure allocated to the agricultural sector, particularly in the bad times they are having.  I have never seen such a lack of confidence by the farming community in their future.  As Deputy Kenny stated, the demonstration outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday afternoon is an indication of the despair felt by the young people engaged in agriculture. I have rarely seen such vigour in a demonstration.  We have demonstrations almost every day in the week outside the gates of Leinster House when the Dáil is sitting.  Most of them lack conviction because they are by way-out groups looking for ridiculous if not impossible things.  Yesterday's demonstration showed a very strong feeling of dissatisfaction and it deserves a response. The Minister for Agriculture is expected to show that response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> The state of depression in the agricultural industry has to be rectified.  There has to be an injection of more money into agriculture.  While the money in the Supplementary Estimate is very welcome it is only peanuts compared with what is needed to rectify the grave problem which confronts us.  Agriculture is our main industry and enough people do not face up to that fact.  For far too long we have accepted a bias among the urban population where their rural brethren are concerned.  This bias and lack of understanding must come to an end.  Everybody must realise that there should be complete interdependence between the urban and rural sectors.  All politicians have a duty to educate both sides to realise that one cannot survive without the other.  I am often very annoyed to hear the unfair criticism made of the farming community by people who actually depend on them for their employment and a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Supplementary Estimate, it is not sufficient.  Everybody in the country, urban and rural, should face up to the fact that it is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>At the moment we need a huge injection of finance into agriculture.  If agriculture slides down the slope, so will the general standard of living, and incomes and the numbers of unemployed will dramatically increase.  Everything will suffer. We must make a concerted effort to see that the lack of confidence is removed and a forward-looking plan of campaign is adopted.  This forward-looking plan of campaign has not been adopted by the Government.  So many of their pre-election promises have not been implemented. We have actually seen a 50 per cent decrease in the standard of living of the farming community over the past two years.  This is an unacceptable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Any industry, whether it is agricultural or manufacturing, depends for its future on its raw materials, to latent resources. In recent years, the Government have handled that sector of the farming industry in a most inept manner.  In 1980 when the agricultural industry should be in a state of prosperity, it is in a state of <Col N="1015" /> despair.  For the first time in over ten years the raw material of that industry &mdash; herd numbers &mdash; has dropped to an alarming figure of less than seven million. While this situation continues, the future of agriculture must remain bleak.  Positive steps must be taken by the Minister and the Government to redress that situation immediately.</P>
    <P>We have reached a rather pathetic state where we are exporting our raw material on a massive scale and that deficiency cannot be replenished in the immediate future.  Steps must be taken to have an organised plan of campaign for the future of agriculture.  What we have seen is a completely disorganised plan of campaign.  It is most disturbing to see vast numbers of our cattle herds being exported on the hoof.</P>
    <P>I come from the constituency of Waterford, the main port for the export of live cattle.  In recent months we have seen a most retrograde step, that is, massive numbers of cattle being exported.  Last week something like 10,000 cattle left the port of Waterford.  That is good for the port authorities because they get shipping fees, but that is an insignificant factor. The fact that we are losing as many as 10,000 cattle a week is something that should cause alarm in all sectors of the community, particularly in Government circles and in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Have we a plan?  Are we destined to export this basic raw material?  Are we destined to have tens of thousands of people unemployed because we are not able to harness our resources?  The Minister made play of the fact that he was worried about the decrease in the herd numbers.  We are all worried about this but unless something is done to stop this trend there will be a very bleak future for agriculture and for employment.</P>
    <P>I understand estimates have been drawn up for 1981 and, as a result of the reduction in the herd numbers, there will be 150,000 fewer cattle slaughtered for processing here next year.  I am told that 200 cattle slaughtered represent one job in the meat processing industry.  When we do a simple calculation we see that <Col N="1016" /> that will result in a loss of 1,200 jobs in the meat processing trade in 1981 and if we take into account associated and ancillary industries, the job losses will be considerably greater.</P>
    <P>This is an area where Fianna Fáil promised so much in their 1977 manifesto. They promised to provide many extra jobs in the food processing industry but we have seen the reverse.  The figures I quoted must give cause for alarm not only in the farming community but in every sector of the community.  In particular, this should alarm the Minister.  I would like him to tell us what he intends doing to arrest this decline and to stop the collapse of the meat processing industry and the reduction of jobs.  I do not know why we have to adopt such a short-sighted policy.  The obvious answer is that we have not diverted enough resources within the agricultural industry to meet the existing demands for processing.  We are willing to make the fast buck.  We think that by exporting we will keep our heads above water, but we cannot do that forever.</P>
    <P>I was informed that a subsidy is paid for the export of these cattle.  I would like the Minister to tell us what this subsidy is and why it cannot be diverted to a more productive use, such as financing meat processing plants or grant-aiding farmers who are facing tremendous problems and can barely pay their way.  I was told that a subsidy of £22 to £24 a head is being paid for each beast exported.  In other words, this is an incentive to export cattle. If that is true, I can only say that that type of incentive borders on being criminal because cattle should be processed here and work provided in the State.  I want the Minister to tell us if this is correct. I do not see how there could be any justification, either on moral grounds or for financial reasons, for such a practice at a time when we should be doing all in our power to keep these cattle at home.</P>
    <P>If this foreign market had not been available in the last few years many farmers would be in worse financial difficulties than they are at present, but exporting cattle is not a solution to the problem.  A solution should be found within the State. The cattle should be processed here and <Col N="1017" /> badly needed jobs provided.  What did the Fianna Fáil Party mean in their 1977 election manifesto by saying they were going to increase the number of jobs in the meat processing and allied industries? All I have seen in that sector are closures and reductions in staff and I would like to see that trend reversed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred specifically to the drop in farmers' incomes.  We all know that has taken place.  That drop in real terms amounted to 50 per cent over the past two years while other sectors of the community have seen a real increase in their earnings.  What will the Government do to rectify this position?  Can we continue at this rate?  I say we cannot. There is a need for a huge injection of cash.  There must be a diversion of our financial resources.  Agriculture is our prime industry but if it cannot survive in a proper and organised manner, every other section of the community will suffer. I am very concerned for those farmers who were advised to borrow large sums of money in recent years but who find now that they cannot meet their repayments.  Consequently, some of them are forced to sell off their cattle. They would be selling beef cattle in any event but they are now having to sell off their cows in order to pay their debts and to care for their families.  This situation is not good enough.  Some means must be found of reducing the burden of repayments for those people who borrowed extensively on the advice of the banks and of other parties on the basis that the agricultural boom of the middle-seventies would continue through the eighties and beyond.  The money which these people borrowed at between 9 and 10 per cent some five years ago is now costing up to 18 per cent in interest and has cost up to 21 per cent in recent times especially in respect of loans got from the ACC.  Money that can be raised abroad at reduced interest rates, such as the £50 million that was announced recently to alleviate the farming crises, should be used for the purpose of a restructuring of those loans that were obtained during the past six or seven years rather than for the issuing of new loans.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there will be a <Col N="1018" /> sufficient number of farmers interested in taking up that £50 million.  I say this on the basis of the lack of confidence that exists among the farming community. They are not prepared to invest.  The same applies to business people.  They have been caught in the past so far as interest rates were concerned and are bound to be very cautious about becoming involved in a similar situation again. Money that is being obtained at a rate of about 13½ per cent should be used to restructure the loans that are crippling progressive farmers.  And one of the worst aspects of the present crisis is that many of the best and very young farmers are the ones who are suffering most as a result of these high interest rates.  The situation is very bad for those people who bought land at about £3,000 per acre, for those who bought tractors and other equipment and for those who built extensive outhouses and beef fattening units. Something must be done to help them out.  The measures that have been announced by the Government are insufficient to deal with the problem.  As the people who marched in Kildare Street yesterday said, farmers expect the Minister to make a clear statement of intent on the Government's position in relation to the devaluation of the Green £.  Such devaluation would be one of several possible solutions to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The gist of my argument is that, as stated in the Minister's contribution, there is an alarming trend in <Col N="1019" /> respect of cattle numbers and that that trend is downwards.  Unless the situation is rectified, the whole structure of agriculture is threatened.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the question of milk production and to the fact that there is a capital injection of an extra £1,450,000 under the heading of subsidies for milk and dairy products.  Surely something more than this amount is needed. There has been no increase for dairy farmers for the past two years so far as milk prices are concerned whereas there have been big increases in the cost of inputs.  In some cases these increases were of the order of 100 per cent but I would suggest that the overall average figure was of the order of 40 per cent.  Is there any explanation for the price of 54p per gallon being paid to farmers in respect of milk while in countries such as Belgium and Holland the corresponding price being paid is in excess of 70p per gallon?  This represents a tremendous difference. In addition farmers in these other countries are entitled to avail of support schemes.  For example, they may avail of loans at interest rates of between 5 and 6 per cent.  Is there any reason for similar rates not applying here?  How can our farmers be expected to compete with the farmers in Europe on such unequal terms.  Surely we cannot expect to have the same standard of living or the same output when we are working on such unequal terms.  There should be low interest charges for productive types of farming.  This is the type of incentive that is needed but which is not being provided. Our farmers are having to repay money at twice the rate at which they borrowed it six or seven years ago.  If we are to bring about the increase in milk production that is so necessary we must provide the incentives and these can be in a number of different ways.  One is in the area of prices.  I have illustrated the inequity in this regard so far as our competitors are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The main purpose is to suggest to the House that the manner and content of the announcement of this increase by the PMPA warrants an inquiry, perhaps even a public inquiry. During the years the practice has been that where a company applies to the Government for an increase, particularly where it is obligatory to bring it before the National Prices Commission, the report of the commission has been published and the Government have appended to the report the reasons for allowing such an increase.  To date there has been no such report published and there has been no indication why the increase has been sanctioned.  The only reason I can find is that some directors of the board happen to be prominent supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party but that is not a good reason for sanctioning a price increase.</P>
      <P>The NPC reports for August and September 1980 have not been published and it is indeed outrageous that their publication has been delayed.  It is well known that some of the directors of the board of the PMPA were very busy in December 1979 touring the country campaigning for the election of the Taoiseach rather than looking after their own business.  They were very busy at that time twisting the arms of Ministers of State and Deputies in favour of one person and that is well documented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a public inquiry into this bland announcement by the PMPA. That company got increases from 35 per cent to 50 per cent from 1 March 1978 and by any standard these were massive increases.  Then, back they came and, apparently, they had no great difficulty in convincing the Government that they were entitled to another increase of between 26 per cent and 30 per cent from 1 September 1979.  Again, even taking inflation into account that was an increase of massive proportions.  Back again come the PMPA and, apparently without comment, <Col N="1021" /><i>sub rosa</i>, with no explanation and no NPC report, they are given an increase of 24 per cent from 1 December.</P>
    <P>I notice an interesting comment in relation to this matter in the <i>Evening Press</i> of today's date where it states that in addition to the 24 per cent premium increase motorists who are comprehensively insured with PMPA will have to pay the first £25 of any claim.  Is that true? If it is true, then it is a myth to think that one is comprehensively insured with PMPA.  There are 400,000 motorists, more than half the motor car owners, about six out of every ten, who would like to know now, courtesy of Dáil Éireann, if they are liable for the first £25 if they have an accident.  Apparently they are liable.  We do not know what has been sanctioned by the Government.</P>
    <P>PMPA maintain that other insurance companies have got increases but that is a rather lame excuse when one considers that for practical purposes they have the monopoly of motor vehicle insurance premiums in the Republic.  It would be interesting to see the precise increases granted from 1 March 1978, while comparing the PMPA with the other 12 insurance companies.  However, we do not have that data.  That is why I think we need a short, sharp, vigorous inquiry into the PMPA.</P>
    <P>I do not hold anything against the company as such.  I do not hold it against the company that some of the members of the board have rather obvious political predilections in one direction.  That does not particularly interest me.  It is only when they spend their time more preoccupied in that direction to the detriment of the motorists who are insured with them that I get rather perturbed.</P>

      <P>The company can indulge in property and office speculation and apparently they have got a substantial profit from being so involved.  I should like to quote from a report by John Stanley in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today's date as follows:</P>
      <P>At present the PMPA can only handle about a third of the crash repairs for which it is paying. </P>
      <P>There is efficiency for you.  The company are more preoccupied in running the <i>Leinster Express</i> or buying out <i>The Sunday Journal</i> than in trying to cut the cost of repairs for people insured with them.  Therefore, I take an entirely jaundiced view of the decision of the Government to sanction the increase.  In fact, I think the House should censure in the strongest possible manner the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and his Cabinet colleagues for the way this announcement was brought to the attention of the motoring public.  The Minister disappears on matters of national importance, presumably to Australia, but the fact remains that a report was not issued.  Presumably there was a letter from the Department to the PMPA indicating that sanction was given.  Why was it not published?  Dáil Éireann and 400,000 motorists have a right to know what is going on between a Government Department and one of the major commercial insurance organisations.  I recall well the former Minister, Senator Justin Keating, being savagely berated by the then shadow Minister, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, when he delayed perhaps two or three weeks because of pressure of Government business, trying to get sanction through, in publishing an NPC report.  Yet such were the exigencies of the Donegal by-election and the several thousand voters in the Donegal area who are policy holders with the PMPA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This House is entitled to feel irate about the situation.  It would require a great deal of inquiry on the part of the Government Department really to access in a detailed actuarial manner the true financial state of that company particularly in relation to alleged losses on claims and the extent to which the company have fulfilled what one might call their statutory obligations.  I notice in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today entitled &ldquo;PMPA Profits Rise 28 per cent in First Half&rdquo; a statement to the effect that the latest accounts do not include the trading performance of the PMPA's other activities. Interestingly enough that statement is made.  Yet apparently there is no problem in sanctioning increases of 24 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have tabled a number of motions in this House relating to this matter over the years.   We hold the view strongly that it is time the motorists of this country, who have to pay for motor insurance, demanded of the Government that the whole question of motor insurance should not be left exclusively and entirely in the hands of one virtually monopolist company and about eight or ten other companies who, by and large, cater for motor insurance.  We on this side of the House firmly believe that, just like the VHI or any other aspect of social insurance, motor insurance is as important and of such consequence that an organisation of such efficiency should be set up. The PMPA allege that they are losing so many millions on motor insurance, and here I might quote the precise figures relating to underwriting loss also contained in the same <i>Irish Times</i> article, of £1.985 million in June 1980 and in 1979, £1.456 million.  One must ask the question: if the company are so preoccupied with alleged continual losses on <Col N="1024" /> underwriting why are they so hostile, why do they get into such an enormous political tizzy particularly when individuals like myself speak?  I will probably feature long and earnestly in the next publication of their various magazines.  Why do they get into such a tizzy when we suggest that to relieve them of this great loss-making problem on underwriting there should be established a State-sponsored body like the VHI?  I would even make the managing director of the PMPA chairman of that Motor Insurance State-sponsored body.  That perhaps would fulfil the real purpose for which that body were set up originally &mdash; apparently private motorist protection, how are you.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we think there is a solid case for a total reorganisation of the whole system of motor insurance in this State.  We believe there should be a supervised system of motor insurance to deal with the equitable size of premiums. We believe that the system of processing claims is chaotic.  We would point out that, after some three and a half years in office, the Government have failed to institute any reforms in the present jury system on the level of awards.  That is a clear indication on the part of the Government that they were preoccupied with this matter but they have done absolutely nothing about it.  Therefore I want to lodge my protest this evening.  I am sure Deputy L'Estrange wants a few minutes also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want strongly to lodge my protest about the manner in which this increase has been announced, about the total discourtesy shown to Deputies in that no official departmental comment has yet been made.  It has had to be wrung out of the Government by way of an Adjournment Debate here this afternoon.  Putting it crudely, if the electorate of Donegal and the remainder of the electorate want to vote for that kind of performance &mdash; if I may put it that way &mdash; if they want to pay for it out of their pockets, jolly good luck to them if that is <Col N="1025" /> the way they want to see the country run. If they want to see their motor vehicles insured in that way, that is their privilege. But we feel it should not be that way and that we are entitled to lodge a very strong and vehement protest in relation to this unwarranted, unjustified increase of such magnitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the case made by Deputy Desmond which is in the main a vindictive, personal one.  Being a good friend of mine I was shocked at the little knowledge the Deputy had about how the prices commission work.  I am doubly shocked at his insinuations that that group of people are not conducting their business in a proper manner.  I can assure him that certainly they are.</P>
      <P>I will deal with as many of the points the Deputy raised as I can and also make a general statement.  The fact that the</P>
      <P>Minister has to authorise increases in motor insurance premium rates is a matter which gives him very great concern because of the effect such increases can have on household budgets through the cost of insurance to the motoring public. The Government are, of course, concerned that any increase in this, a compulsory class of insurance, contributes to the rate of inflation.  But the hard fact remains that it is essential that the premiums paid to provide a service must be adequate to meet the costs of providing that same service.  Insurance companies must be allowed to charge premium rates which will enable them to meet the cost of claims which arise on the cover issued and allow a contribution to the reserves which are statutorily necessary for insurers to put aside.  I want to stress very strongly that it is statutory to have reserves which must be put aside by all insurers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crucial point to make in regard to the size of increases granted is the inescapable fact that the justification for the size of the increases rests essentially, as it always has done, on the ever increasing cost of claims.  For most companies claims <Col N="1026" /> costs continue to rise at rates higher than the consumer price index.  Applications for increases made to my Department are examined on the basis of substantiated claims cost figures which each applicant is required to furnish.  These figures are examined on a rigorous basis together with each company's own internal expenses and commission rates.  The claims projections which each company makes for the next few years are analysed in great detail and I can say that in all cases the projections used by the Department are more conservative estimates than those submitted by the companies.</P>
    <P>The premium increases which are granted are designed to cover the full projected cost of claims to final settlement even where this may not be made for several years ahead.  Some allowance must be made on these projections for increasing claims frequency which are a reflection of accident rates.  The purpose in any price increase granted is simply to allow each company to break even on its underwriting account so that the cost of providing motor insurance will pay for itself.</P>
    <P>In the press this morning it was reported that most motor insurance premiums in Ireland have risen by 407 per cent in the last ten years.  What was omitted from such reports was the fact that claims paid by motor insurers have increased almost six-fold from £9 million in 1970 to over £53 million in 1979.  Motor insurance companies themselves have continued to make large underwriting losses on their motor account in the five years to 1978.  The total underwriting losses in this period of five leading insurers representing in excess of 75 per cent of the motor insurance market have totalled £7.3 million.  In 1979 alone the loss made on motor insurance overall was £5.1 million.  These figures speak for themselves.  Losses have been such that some insurers have been forced to abandon motor insurance completely.</P>
    <P>In analysing the PMPA price increase application the Minister was concerned that the proposal was to load the increases sought on to the basic third <Col N="1027" /> party element of the portfolio with corresponding smaller increases on the comprehensive and fire and theft elements. This was despite the fact that the switch-over to comprehensive by a substantial number of PMPA policyholders had given rise to a very increased frequency of claims which followed this change.  For this reason the company were required to bring their comprehensive and fire and theft rates up to more realistic levels and to abate the increases on the basic third party element.  As a result the increases on comprehensive and fire and theft which PMPA are applying from 1 December are higher than those on basic third party.  These increases have, of course, also been subject to the scrutiny of the NPC and as Deputies will be aware the company applied for just under 30 per cent and they were allowed 24 per cent on average.</P>
    <P>Much comment has been made on the PMPA's profits just announced for the first six months of 1980.  These profits, net of tax, amount to £800,000 on a premium income of £27.5 million a profit rate of 3 per cent &mdash; hardly a startling figure.  In the examination of the PMPA price application the projections of the Department, which were more conservative than those of the company, indicated that without a further increase in motor premium rates an underwriting loss of over £10 million could be expected in 1981.  The fact that a company is making profits at a particular point in time does not mean that no increase in prices is justified.  It can very often mean quite the reverse, that unless a price increase is granted these profits will disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any Deputy will disagree that it is necessary for all companies to make profits and it is even more necessary for insurance companies that their income from investments should offset their underwriting losses if the company is to continue to be able to meet the needs of the insurance market <Col N="1028" /> and to meet the statutory solvency margins which all insurers must comply with. As Deputies will be aware, PMPA is a wholly owned Irish enterprise.</P>
      <P>Increases in motor premium rates is not something confined to Ireland.  An article in the <i>Financial Times</i> of the 17 November 1980 complains that the majority of motorists who buy comprehensive cover in the UK are facing continued price increases and that most major insurers are back to two rate increases a year.  The PMPA, it might be noted, who are the dominant motor insurer in this country, have received increases at intervals of a year and a quarter to a year and a half.  The last increase for PMPA was the 1 September 1979.  The article in the <i>Financial Times</i> goes on to mention a recent award of £340,000 to a motor accident victim, stating that this is reckoned to be the largest sum yet awarded for any individual motor injury in the English courts, but it is something that is not uncommon in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Lest I run out of time, the Deputy raised some points to which I would like to reply.  The NPC report for August and September will be published tomorrow. The October report has been signed out and is in print.  It is from that report, which will generally deal with the present insurance case, that the Minister, before the report went to print &mdash; as is usual &mdash; informed the company making application for a price increase whether they were successful or otherwise.  There was nothing unusual in what he did in this case.  There was no undue delay in publication. The insurance matter will be discussed in the October report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asked if the first £25 would be paid by insurance.  The answer is yes.  These excesses, as he called them, are not uncommon with other insurers, many of whom ask first for £50.  I say this for the information of the Deputy and the House.  Being a wholly owned Irish company I think the PMPA should not be pilloried in this House.  Its accounts are examined by the Prices Commission as in the case of every other company. The fact that it has diversified into other <Col N="1029" /> trading activities and provided jobs for Irish people is something we should take into account.  We should not try to wreck it or talk about it or try to wreck individuals as if this was for their own personal gain.  Again, I support the Prices Commission <Col N="1030" /> in the work they have done and I think what I have said should satisfy the Deputy if he is in any way fair-minded.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, three rugby players from Northern Ireland, one of whom was Mr. William Anderson, and a player from England, all members of a team touring Argentina, were arrested in Buenos Aires in the early hours of 11 August 1980 for alleged theft of an Argentine flag, from a flagpole on a Government building, and for showing disrespect to a national symbol.</P>
      <P>When the police questioned Mr. Anderson about the incident, he admitted full responsibility.  The three other players were arrested when they accompanied Mr. Anderson to the police station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Embassy in Buenos Aires became aware of the incident later on 11 August and were in informal contact with the British Embassy, whose consular section was dealing with the matter, since the persons concerned were travelling on British passports and so were under the <Col N="987" /> consular protection of the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The English player was released on 15 August.  The two other players from Northern Ireland arrested with Mr. Anderson were released on 26 August and immediately left the country.  Mr. Anderson was released at the same time on bail to appear again in court at a later date.</P>
    <P>Mr. Anderson did not initiate any contact with the Irish Embassy or seek its assistance.  The Embassy had no formal standing in the matter, since Mr. Anderson was travelling on a British passport. Informal approaches were, however, made to the Argentine authorities, conveying our interest in the case and our hope that the extenuating circumstances involved would be taken into account. An Embassy official paid a number of visits to the players, in case help on an informal basis might be needed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Anderson was eventually given a suspended sentence.  He left Argentina the same day, 18 November 1980.</P>

The service is provided by whole-time public dental officers as well as by dentists in private practice who, by agreement with the boards, make time available to them for the treatment of eligible persons.  The Deputy will be glad to know that, for the first time ever, the number of public dental officers has recently reached 200.</P>
