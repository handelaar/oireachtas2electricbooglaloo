    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1980: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim) Thomas (Jnr.) McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase, from £1,500 million to £2,500 million, the statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund through which the Exchequer loans money to local authorities to finance essential capital services.</P>
      <P>When the Local Loans Fund was established in 1935 a statutory limit of £5 million was set on issues from the fund.  The limit has had to be increased periodically over the years by successive enactments. The present figure of £1,500 million was fixed in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities, including vocational education committees and harbour authorities are heavily dependent on this fund to finance their capital projects.  In 1979 almost 90 per cent of capital expenditure on services partially or wholly financed from the fund was met from the fund.  At 31 October 1980, total issues from the fund were £1,445 million of which £729.5 million was for local authority housing, £360.9 million for house purchase loans and supplementary grants. Sanitary services accounted for a further £247.2 million while the balance of £107.4 million was provided for vocational schools, hospitals, harbour works, libraries, <Col N="768" /> fire stations, itinerant re-settlement and other services.</P>
    <P>Issues from the fund have increased substantially in recent years.  The level of annual issues went up from £141.77 million in 1978 to an estimated £222.42 million in 1980.  This reflects in particular increased provision for local authority housing including the house purchase loan scheme, the loan and income eligibility limits of which were increased by the Government with effect from 1 February 1980, and increases for water and sewerage schemes to service new housing development, to provide infrastructure for new industry and agriculture and to maintain the existing system.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already, the total issues from the fund reached £1,445 million at the end of October.  At the present rate of issues the limit will be reached early in 1981.  It will be necessary to raise the limit substantially to provide for the estimated capital requirements of the local authorities over the next few years. Accordingly, a new limit of £2,500 million is proposed in the Bill which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that this Bill is necessary now that the level of money expended from the fund is coming up to the ceiling of £1,500 million that had obtained up to now.  The Minister says that the increase in this Bill to £2,500 million is necessary if the capital expenditure of local authorities is to be undertaken in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not be under any delusion that the passage of this Bill, of itself, will be of any help to local authorities who are now in a more critical condition as regards finance than at any time since their establishment.  This Bill merely gives the Minister power, if he wishes, to release funds up to that amount of money but does not automatically release funds up to £2,500 million.  Any public representative who holds a clinic, or any Member of this House who is a member of a local authority, will know that at present local authorities were never in a worse state for money.  I had a parliamentary question answered on 3 December about the state of Cork Corporation.  I put that <Col N="769" /> question down because I see almost every consecutive day, certainly every week, in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and <i>Cork Evening Echo</i> reports of Cork Corporation meetings at which the standard answer given by the manager of Cork Corporation seems to be that they cannot undertake something because they have not got the money.  That applies particularly to housing. It applies also to Cork County Council and probably to every local authority in the country at present, that proposals put forward for housing, sewerage, land reclamation or for the building of new roads receive the standard answer from the manager to the effect that they cannot undertake them because they have not got the money.</P>
    <P>It has been customary for as long as I can remember and has certainly been the practice in Cork Corporation, and I presume in other local authorities, that at Christmas time councillors submit lists of names of people who are given what is called Christmas work.  It is a method by which a local authority recognises the less well-off members of their society, giving them a week's work at Christmas and of course, a stamp at the same time.  It has always been the practice that everyone who applied for that work got work. There was a major row at Cork Corporation on Monday evening last&mdash;as reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> yesterday&mdash;because, I think, one-third only of those who had been on the list seeking Christmas work had been employed. There was a motion before Cork Corporation by some members of the council maintaining that additional money should be supplied to employ those who had not got work.  The manager said it was up to the council themselves, if they wanted to pass that motion, but that there was nothing he could do about it because he just had not got the money to employ people.  In my ten or fifteen years in public life I never remember so many people coming to my clinics telling me that they cannot afford to build their own houses, that their names are on the local authority list and that they are being informed by the local authority that it may be two, three or four years before they get housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The attitude of the Minister for Finance, as conveyed by the Minister for the Environment to the local authorities, appears to be that of a poor man aping the policies being pursued on the other side of the Irish Sea of cutting back funds to local authorities which is having the effect of reducing the number of local authority houses available.  At the same time private housing is not going ahead because of the recession in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>This is the same position as the position in which we found ourselves in 1974 when because of a recession there was a drop in the number of private houses being built.  Our answer was to increase the amount of money available through the local authority mortgage schemes and the amount of money given to local authorities to build local authority houses. Therefore the level of activity in the construction industry did not vary.  The number of privately financed houses built in 1973 was almost 14,000.  The following year, because of the recession, that number dropped to 11,000.  We raised the number of houses financed by local authority mortgages from 4,600 to 8,500 and we raised the number of houses built by local authorities from 6,000 to 6,700. That position obtained throughout 1974, 1975 and 1976 and in 1976 we could afford to lower the amount of support given to local authority mortgage scheme houses.</P>
    <P>The conditions in which too many of our citizens are living are a reflection on both sides of this House because we cannot find the courage to raise money to finance very many more local authority houses than are being financed at the moment.  With the escalation in the price of houses over the past five or six years people are trapped between two situations. They are not eligible for SDA loans because they are earning over £3,500 or whatever the figure is now.  They cannot afford the difference between two and a half times their salary and £20,000 for a privately owned house and they cannot put down a deposit of £7,000.  They are not eligible for local authority houses because their income is too high.  They get no support from the State.  People building their own houses get the £1,000 <Col N="771" /> grant and they get income tax relief on their mortgage repayments.  Others get low rise mortgage facilities from the local authorities.  People living in local authority houses have their rent subsidised. There is a whole wedge of people who are renting accommodation at £25, £30 or £40 a week.  They are getting absolutely no support from the State.</P>
    <P>I hope that when he is replying the Minister will tell us what he thinks of the scheme launched by Fine Gael about two months ago to cater for this body of people who cannot put down a deposit and who are not eligible under the SDA scheme or for local authority houses.  Our scheme does not suit everybody.  People who can find a deposit of £6,000, £7,000 or £8,000 will take advantage of building society mortgage schemes and pay roughly the same amount of money throughout the lifetime of the loan.  It may vary according to the interest rates but, by and large, they pay out the same amount of money every week for the 25 or 30 years during which they have the loan.</P>
    <P>We were trying to cater for those who cannot find a deposit of £6,000, £7,000 or £8,000 and who are ineligible for local authority loans or housing.  Our proposal was that a new housing agency should be set up which would make use of the funds available in ever increasing amounts through pension funds and guarantee that inflation would not erode the value of the funds over 20 or 30 years.  The only people who could live up to that guarantee would be the State and, therefore, the housing agency would have to have a State guarantee.  The housing agency would lend money to people in the category I have mentioned.  The repayment method would be that the amount would increase over the period of the mortgage by a percentage increase in their earnings. In other words, they would pay a fixed percentage of their earnings over the period of the mortgage and the percentage would be fixed at 18, 19 or 22 per cent or somewhere on either side of 20 per cent.  As they got increases in wages they would make increased repayments. If their salary doubled or trebled over 20 <Col N="772" /> years their repayments would double or treble.</P>
    <P>Obviously that scheme would not be attractive to somebody who could make a deposit.  Nor would it be attractive to somebody who was eligible for a local authority house or a mortgage loan.  The wealthiest people get some form of subsidy from the State for houses because they can make a claim against their taxes. People who are first time buyers can get the grant of £1,000.  The category of people who pay significant sums of money every week for accommodation get no subsidy from the State.</P>
    <P>We estimate that this scheme could be implemented reasonably quickly.  It would have the benefit of giving a boost to the construction industry, which is in a pretty difficult position at the moment. Many building firms and people working in the industry are not looking forward to the new year with any great joy because they do not feel the position will improve in January or February.  In my own constituency and in Cork county as a whole things are much worse than they have ever been in my memory.  I was interested to find out if my instinct about this was correct and I put down a question asking for the up-to-date unemployment figures for Cork city and county and corresponding figures for the past ten years.  I discovered that I was correct.  On 31 October 1980, the latest date for which figures were available, the unemployment figures for Cork city and county were higher than at any time in the past ten years.  Those are frightening statistics to somebody living in the area.  I am sure they apply to other regions as well.  I cannot speak specifically about other cities or towns or even counties.</P>
    <P>In reply to Question No. 18 on 3 December last the Minister said a further instalment of £170,000 issued to Cork Corporation from the Local Loans Fund and that a further sum will be made available before the end of the year.  A sum of £170,000 is the cost of about eight local authority houses.  When the Minister says that a further sum will be made available before the end of the year, I do not know whether it will be more or less than £170,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> There is a rather anomalous last paragraph to the Minister's reply when he said that available resources do not permit the issue of additional funds from the Local Loans Fund to the corporation but that these amounts, together with the further amounts arising from internal resources, will ensure that payments on maturing loans will not be delayed unreasonably. If a young married man entitled to a loan is building a house he should not have to seek bridging finance from the bank because of delays in the local authority scheme.  A scheme will have to be devised so that a person obtaining a local authority loan can follow the usual practice of paying the builder a deposit and making further payments at various stages of building.  The initial capital cost of such a scheme would be high because payments would be brought forward, but the Department will have to face up to the realities of life for young people.  Very often they start married life facing not only mortgage repayments but a bridging loan as well.  Some way must be found to release funds to people entitled to mortgages as soon as payments are demanded from them by the builder.  They should not be forced to seek bridging finance while waiting for payment of their mortgage.</P>
    <P>I understand the reluctance of the Department of the Environment to expend funds until they have been able to carry out inspections.  They have some justification in their attitude because of some types of building work which have been carried on during the past 30 or 40 years.  They do not want to part with money until they see a finished product which represents value for money.  At the some time we must consider the plight of young people who are, in effect, facing two mortgages.  It would be an enormous relief to them if payments could be made at various stages of building work.  It would also be helpful if the Minister would investigate the scheme announced by Fine Gael about two months ago for an alternative method of financing some people who want to own their own houses.  If it were feasible to put through the necessary legislation early in the new <Col N="774" /> year it would be of great advantage to the construction industry and would increase employment.  It would involve the setting up of an agency and the terms of reference given to its directors would be all important.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure the release of significant amounts of money to local authorities.  The construction industry will certainly grind to a halt if ordinary infrastructural work on roads, harbours and sewerage is not carried on and if local authority housing does not go ahead.  During the mid-seventies, when private house building was falling off because of the recession, we put considerable sums of money into building increased numbers of local authority houses and providing increased mortgages. Such action taken now would help the construction industry and ease the problems of the country during the present recession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The placing of this Bill before the House highlights the very critical situation facing the vast majority of local authorities in financing their housing programme.  Over two-thirds of the money normally spent from the Local Loans Fund goes for local authority housing, house purchase loans and supplementary grants.  I stress that the whole strategy of the Government in availing of the Local Loans Fund and in their housing policy has collapsed and I use the word advisedly.  I want to put some general thoughts before the House to illustrate what I mean by the word &ldquo;collapsed&rdquo; because I believe that the social policy relative to housing is in an appalling state.  This year, in a situation where we have 30,000 people on the local authority waiting lists, we handed out no less than £27 million in home improvement grants to an estimated 8,000 people who already own their houses.  Could there be a greater indictment of the Government's housing policy?  I am all in favour of improving housing stock, yet in 1980 as a matter of deliberate policy the phenomenal sum of £27 million was handed out to about 8,000 people without any income limit or valuation limit and virtually at will on the signature of a <Col N="775" /> peace commissioner.  A person owning a ten-bedroomed house and using, perhaps, only two bedrooms could avail of the full home improvement grant.  Is there any other country in Europe or any part of the world where this could be a matter of deliberate policy when there are 30,000 families who have no houses, the vast majority of whom have little chance of getting housing in the near future?</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, in their mad profligate rush to the 1977 elections, said they would have a new system of home improvement grants and that there would be an unending supply of money available for it.  Yesterday I asked the Minister for the Environment if he could tell me how much money was still remaining to be paid at the end of this year on home improvement grants.  His reply was that it would be such an inordinate problem for the civil servants in O'Connell Bridge House to try to estimate how much was still to be paid out on application made up to the closure of the scheme that they could not tell him how much money was involved.</P>
      <P>Have the Government because of that scheme committed themselves to pay out of the 1981 budget another £4 million, £5 million or £10 million?  Where has it ended?  It appears that during the first quarter of the year every Fianna Fáil Deputy and peace commissioner in the country signed so many house improvement grant applications that the Department are still flooded with them.  I should like to tell the Minister that next week, or even tomorrow afternoon, I intend to raise the matter on the adjournment.  The reply I got was the greatest sidestep of all time, more than equal to the sidestep of a Welsh wing three-quarters on a rugby field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not got a housing policy.  I do not know why we have the Local Loans Fund.  The whole structure of the financial strategy in relation to such a fund is in a total shambles.  I will illustrate this by a few more examples.  Here I may say things that are very unpopular, but I am tired of what I regard as the mendacity of political parties and politicians on matters <Col N="776" /> of social policy and I am compelled to say these things.  At the moment overtime is exempt from differential earnings but the unfortunate old age pensioner who gets an increase in pension and who will get a double week's pension this Christmas will be assessed for differential rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat that two-thirds of the money in the Local Loans Fund relates to housing loans and grants.  Therefore, we are talking about housing policy in a very direct sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the house to the fact that an old age pensioner who gets a double week's payment at Christmas will be liable for assessment on that amount in respect of differential rent whereas the worker who gets an overtime bonus of £50 or £100 will not be liable in respect of that bonus.  This is socially unjust, discriminatory and ridiculous.</P>
      <P>To underline what Deputy Barry said in relation to house purchase loans in County Cork, I will give the situation in relation to County Dublin.  In that county in the first 11 months of 1979 we got from the State a sum of £3.6 million through the Local Loans Fund.  In the first 11 months of 1980 we have got £1.9 million. That is an indictment of the Government. This money is in respect of money for house purchase loans and house improvement loans.  At the moment Dublin County Council have 400 applicants for house purchase loans.  The applications have been approved and the vast majority of the applicants are on bridging finance or are waiting to complete contracts with builders.  The situation is critical but there has been no effort on the part of the Government to clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to protest very strongly at the <Col N="777" /> complete failure of the Government to adjust the whole structure of the Local Loans Fund.  The Minister and the Department of Finance must be convinced that the fund is an integral part of the construction industry and local authorities must have sufficient money to continue with their house-building programmes. There has not been a clear policy with regard to the Local Loans Fund and its contribution towards economic development, and I regret to have to say that.  During the years a number of Ministers for the Environment and Ministers for Finance have made some efforts to try to use the fund in a responsible way.  At the moment the entire housing policy has collapsed.  The differential renting scheme contains inherent injustices.</P>
    <P>The system of tax relief so far as loans are concerned is quite discriminatory and is a penal imposition on the 30,000 families who have no homes but who wish to have dwellings of their own, either by way of local authority houses or by way of house purchase loans.  I should like the Minister to give consideration to these points.</P>
    <P>Naturally every Member of the House approves the new limit of £2,500 million as set out in the Bill.  However, I despair of seeing a politician in the Department of Finance or the Department of the Environment who will be prepared to reconsider the role of the Local Loans Fund and who will give some thought to the question of housing relative to income limits and mortgage interest relief, to the differential rent system, to provisions for itinerant settlements and other services in our local authorities. Perhaps some day some politician will emerge from either of those two Departments who will take these fundamental social issues by the scruff of the neck and put up what I would call socially just criteria for the operation of the Local Loans Fund.  We have regressed very considerably in the past three to four years.  Indeed, right back to 1973 and 1974 we did not make that much progress either, if we want to be totally objective about what, in fact, we were all up to.</P>
    <P>The sale of existing housing schemes in <Col N="778" /> retrospect and as in operation now has an appalling number of anomalies.  I shall not elaborate because to do so might not please some of my colleagues who were in office in terms of some of the decisions taken.  As regards the benefits, we all remember the notorious claw-back problens which arose, the speculation and profiteering in relation to local authority housing under that scheme.  We remember the promise made by the party in office, Fianna Fáil, that if they got back what they would not do&mdash;and just to make a bad situation five times worse they proceeded to do so.</P>
    <P>No matter what scheme you examine, whether it is the sale of existing housing schemes, the differential rent scheme, the mortgage interest relief scheme under income tax, the current income limit of £5,500 for house purchase loans, or the various criteria operated by local authorities, even on terms of some of the housing allocation schemes in operation, in some counties without the points system, you find so many anomalies, so many regressive, unjust, built-in anomalies that I genuinely despair of seeing any Minister for the Environment being prepared to stand up in this House and say: &ldquo;There is a serious anomaly there and an injustice there.  Somebody must pay for it.  It must be amended or changed.&rdquo;  Then, very scarce financial resources under the Local Loans Fund would become available particularly for one group of people at the moment who are being shortchanged by Irish political philosophy in terms of housing policy, namely the 30,000 people without homes&mdash;people who in my constituency are paying £25 and £30 a week for one lousy, miserable room of 12 feet by 8 feet, sharing a toilet with two other families, with no heating in their room, in many cases without even a window.  The vast bulk of the electorate who have houses, including ourselves, could not care less.</P>
    <P>We have a house, we have our interest relief on our mortgage, we have our tenant purchase scheme which gives us a house, originally for £500 or £600, now perhaps for £1,500 or £2,000.  We can buy that house and even sell it for £25,000 or £26,000 three months later&mdash;a local <Col N="779" /> authority house the building of which was subsidised from scarce resources, in the first instance, from the Local Loans Fund.  We can sell it and make a massive capital gain while our brother and sister down the road live in squalid conditions in flatland, paying £20, £25 or £30 a week rent out of a take-home income of £75 or £80 a week.  They will get no local authority house for perhaps four or five years to come, but do we care?</P>
    <P>We are an allegedly Christian society, a society which is supposed to devote scarce resources to the deprived and those without decent accommodation in our society.  The only time we care about things like a Local Loans Fund is when, perhaps, a daughter gets married and we suddenly become socially conscious again, because the couple move in with us and we worry about how they are going to get a house.  As soon as they have a house and have moved out, to either a local authority house or a house of particular benefit, again we do not care.</P>
    <P>I can give other analogies in terms of the uses of this type of fund.  We have an increasing number of single persons who, for tax purposes, are buying three, four, and five-bedroom houses, getting tremendous tax benefits and mortgage interest relief.  I am all in favour of people investing their savings effectively, but a question arises.  Such persons get enormous tax relief while families with three and four children in different counties have no hope of getting accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Chair has been extremely tolerant in this debate relative to housing policy, for which I want to thank him.  Naturally I support this Bill.  It is of major importance. However, I am deeply disturbed by the rapid decline in the past 12 months in local authority house building, in the new starts for local authority houses. Government policy and strategy in relation to loans and home improvement grants has gone completely wrong.  It will take rare political courage&mdash;of which there is little evidence in this country at the moment&mdash;to put the policy back on the rails so that the very scarce national resources will go to those in greatest <Col N="780" /> need, namely the 30,000 on our housing list who have no houses to live in, the elderly and the deprived who are, in many cases, also without decent housing. For them, this Bill holds out some hope, but without the concomitant political courage to face up to the issues involved it is no more than a contra bookkeeping exercise of no real long-term benefit.</P>
    <P>I see no evidence of courage in the present Government either, within the popularity preoccupation of the Taoiseach and the irrelevance of most of his Cabinet members who are scared of their lives of incurring any degree of social controversy or social agitation&mdash;confrontation, one might say&mdash;on those issues.  They sheer away from them like scalded cats, afraid of their lives to talk about anything on that basis.  We will continue to plod along into the eighties, wasting public money in many directions and not giving it to those in greatest need in this critical area of public policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill which we are discussing is the Government instrument through which the house loans scheme of local authorities is financed.  It is also the instrument by which the Government play their part in building local authority houses, in providing sanitary services, vocational schools, hospitals, harbour works, libraries, fire stations and itinerant resettlements. The fund was first introduced, apparently, in 1935.  The limit then placed on them was £5 million and since then it has been altered and adjusted upwards until in 1978 it reached £1,500 million.  It is now proposed to increase the limit to £2,500 million.  In order to appreciate whether the proposed limit is adequate one must look at the cost of some of the schemes financed by this fund.  I am sure it is only a coincidence that in the last few days we have been furnished with the September issue of the quarterly bulletin on housing statistics issued by the Department of the Environment.  We must assume that the statistics are accurate because they are compiled by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> As far as the cost of housing is concerned, and the capacity of those in search of houses to provide their own homes, that bulletin discloses an alarming state of affairs.  It discloses that since 1976 house prices have gone mad and are now far beyond the reach of young married couples and those in search of a home of their own.  The bulletin also discloses that since 1976 there has been a downward trend in the provision of local authority houses erected through this fund by local authorities.  At a time when the price of houses in the private sector has rocketed to an alarming figure the number of houses being built by local authorities has dropped by half.</P>
    <P>In referring to the situation since 1976 I am doing no more than taking the period covered by the bulletin.  At first I should like to deal with house prices in the private sector from 1976 to date.  In 1976 the average price of a house financed by building societies was £12,113 and for the third quarter of this year the price of a similar house had risen to £28,976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am relating my remarks to the price of houses.  The measure we are dealing with concerns housing finance in the private sector as well as in the public sector.  I am anxious to show that in the period in question the price of houses has rocketed.  The average price of houses financed by insurance companies in 1976 was £14,060 while for the third quarter of this year it was £26,746.  The average price of houses financed by local authorities in 1976&mdash;this is perhaps the most striking figure&mdash;was £8,553 and in the last quarter of this year it was £22,161.  The average price of houses financed by the associated banks in 1976 was £14,262 and for the third quarter of this year it had risen to £36,120.  The average price of all houses financed by all agencies mentioned was £12,258 in 1976 and £28,287 for the third quarter of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures I have just quoted show <Col N="782" /> that the price of houses has more than doubled in the period covered by the bulletin.  It should be remembered that I did not choose that period for any political advantage.  The official bulletin chose 1976 as a start and the third quarter of this year as a conclusion.  For the purposes of my argument the most striking figure of all is that related to local authority houses, utility or low cost houses.  The price of those houses has now gone completely beyond the limit such people can afford.  The Minister may say that this year a substantial number of new houses will be completed and I would agree with such a statement but I should like to know the number of new houses started this year.  My information is that the private house building sector programme is grinding to a halt.  The price of cement has fallen dramatically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> My apologies.  If one slips in one's thinking it is good to have good ears.  I was of course referring to the huge drop in the sale of cement.  The sale of damp-proof course material which is put in at an early stage of the construction of houses has also fallen dramatically. Those figures show that more local authority houses are necessary in prevailing conditions.  Again at random I find that these statistics here commence in 1973.  One would think they were prepared by me and not by the Department of the Environment but they are convenient for my purpose.  This is where they begin: in 1963 there were 672 local authority houses built; in 1974 that increased to 6,746; in 1975 it rose to 8,794; in 1976 it was 7,263; in 1977 it was 6,333, a small increase; in 1978 the number was 6,073; in 1979 it was 6,214.  In the first three quarters of this year we find that there are 3,265 houses completed, not even half the number that Deputy Tully, who has just come into the House, built.  I do not know how many are going to be completed in the last quarter of this year but if we have the same number as in the first three quarters it would be <Col N="783" /> about 4,500 houses, a drop of nearly 2,000.  This is at a time when house prices are rocketing.  That is why I say there is a serious housing crisis.  In the last number of years many business people in towns have moved out into bungalows in rural areas adjacent to the towns, vacating second and third storey flats in the business part of the town.  These flats are now being occupied by young married couples, many with children.  Many of these buildings that they have to live in are positively dangerous from a fire point of view.  This is a national disgrace.</P>
      <P>The picture that I have just presented from official publications shows a very alarming state of affairs.  It is necessary that more local authority houses be built. I have given this House figures which show that for this year there will be a substantial drop in local authority house completions.  But I have not got the figures for starts and that is more alarming still because I believe that the number of new house starts this year was negligible. There has been no worthwhile allocation made from this fund for new house starts this year.  I know of one local authority, Cavan County Council, which applied for approximately one and one-third million pounds for new houses this year.  That application was made in the spring of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i>: I cannot think of anything more relevant on this Bill than the amount of money that has been allocated by the Local Loans Fund this year for housing at a time when legislation is being passed through this House to increase the amount of aid for that fund.  Surely the amount of money this fund is making available to local authorities is very relevant. We can only decide that by talking about the amount of money that is required by local authorities.  With the greatest respect to the Chair, that is what I am trying to do.</P>
      <P>I was pointing out that Cavan County Council applied for one and one-third million pounds and did not get any money until 17 or 18 September when they were given £35,000 to a fanfare of trumpets in the local newspaper advising all and sundry that the Minister for the Environment had informed the Minister for Education that £35.000 extra was being made available but they did not say in that epistle that it was in response to an application for one and one-third million pounds for housing schemes in Killeshandra, in Ballyjamesduff, in Kilnaleck and in Bailieboro.  That disclosed an alarming state of affairs, while the number of completions of new houses this year looks like dropping according to the statistics from 6,214 last year to something between 4,000 and 5,000 this year at a time when the cost of houses has doubled, as I said before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle came in, when the cost of houses has jumped dramatically from £12,258 in 1976 to £28,287 in the third quarter of 1980.  That is what I am complaining about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are talking about housing finance let me make a brief and sincere plea on behalf of the small number of people in each county who are living on small bits of land in isolated cottages of a very substandard nature who are unable to house themselves and who cannot get <Col N="785" /> houses built for them by the local authoruties because the Minister for Finance will not release enough money through this Local Loans Fund.  It takes our county up to five years to get one of these houses built.  The figures are there.  I know Donegal County Council have built 140 or 150 houses but in places like Cavan there are about 14 or 15 isolated houses built each year.  It is a public scandal. When these people apply they are told they will be considered on the allocation of a scheme in some neighbouring townland. That is not good enough.  These people have small bits of land, ten or 15 acres and they are rearing families there and they do not want to live anywhere else and because they have a bit of land they cannot live anywhere else and they are being neglected in some counties. Mayo and Donegal have done very well but there are other counties which do very badly.  Unless the Government are prepared to introduce a new system of house loans they will have to release more money through this fund.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael published a new housing loans scheme related to income and inflation. It was welcomed by Deputy O'Donoghue who gave me the impression that he approved of it entirely and had been thinking about it.  It was endorsed by the Minister for the Environment who said it would be churlish of him to say there was nothing good in it. It is an excellent scheme, but will the Government introduce it?  It is a scheme under which no young married couple would be required to pay more than 20 per cent of their income by way of payment of a housing loan.  It is a scheme which can be financed from the pension funds and life insurance funds with the backing of the Government.  It would relieve this housing loan fund over which the Minister is keeping such a tight grip in the last few years.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I want to say in relation to this Bill.  The Minister in his introductory speech has told us that this is one of the measures that finance hospital building.  I do not want to go into the hospital building programme over the whole country, but I do want to say that in my constituency the building of a new <Col N="786" /> hospital has come to a complete standstill because the Minister for Health will not sanction the preparation of further plans necessary to invite tenders because the Minister for Finance, again through this fund, has turned off the tap.  In 1977 the hospital in Cavan town was at the planning stage for an extension of 180 beds, and the hospital in Beaumont in Dublin was at a similar stage.  The same architects and consultants were engaged on both hospitals.  When the new Minister for Health, the present Taoiseach, was appointed he took the consultants off the Cavan hospital and put them on the Beaumont Hospital.  Last year something like £55,000 was spent on the Cavan Hospital and I was told in reply to a supplementary question here one day that £13.4 million has been spent on Beaumont in the last two years and that it is hoped to open Beaumont in 1982.  The Cavan hospital is at a complete standstill although there is a far greater need for a hospital in the Cavan region than there is in the Dublin region.  That is an abuse of this Local Loans Fund.  It is discrimination against rural Ireland, against a part of Ireland that needs a hospital far more than does the city of Dublin which is already well served by existing hospitals. I do not begrudge Dublin another hospital. I do not begrudge Beaumont another hospital.  If the money was spread between the two and we could get on with both of them.  I would be satisfied.  When you bring the building operation and even the planning operation to a complete standstill on one of them it is not good enough and it will have to be rectified.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister for Finance in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment to recognise that there is a major housing crisis here at the moment.  That is a familiar term, but surely to goodness nothing could be of more crisis dimensions than houses jumping in cost in the private sector from £12,000 or thereabouts to £28,000 and at the same time the number of completions in the public sector dropping from over 6,000, and from over 8,000 in 1975 or 1976, to something over 4,000 at present.  Is that not queer management of this Local Loans Fund?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> I could go on talking about sanitary services and sewerage schemes.  I think that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, paid a visit to Cavan &mdash; certainly the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, did &mdash; in connection with pollution and the Minister of State gave a lecture to Cavan County Council about them operating the antipollution laws and providing a lot of staff to monitor certain lakes and rivers.  Since then I have had a question answered here on sewerage, which is covered by this Bill, by the Minister, Deputy Fahey who told me that an application for a sewerage scheme in Dowra, Co. Cavan, which was lodged in his Department at the end of 1975 is still under consideration and that he does not know when it is going to be financed out of this fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I was talking about sewerage for not more than a minute and a half when the Chair ruled me out of order.  I want to go on record as saying that, notwithstanding all the lectures we got about pollution in Cavan, we cannot get a few thousand £s to put a sewerage scheme in Dowra and prevent untreated sewage from flowing into the River Shannon.  We had a similar episode in Cavan town.  It took a major protest to get £70,000 from this fund to provide a filter to make the water of the town drinkable and to have sanitary services provided.  I think that the finances of the local authority are in complete chaos, as some of the things that I have been saying illustrate clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A request for £1½ million was sought and an allocation made of £35,000.  Nothing will solve the problem or do anything <Col N="789" /> to improve it other than a realisation first by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment that the financing of capital programmes of local authorities is in a mess.  There is no use in the Minister saying we gave X pounds last year and we are giving X plus Y pounds this year unless at the same time he tells me how much work that will do. It is the number of houses that the money allocated will build that concerns people waiting for houses.  That is the important thing.  When one sees the increase in the price of houses one realises how little the increase in money means.</P>
    <P>If the things I have been pointing out were not pointed out and the country was told that the fund was being increased from £1,500 million to £2,500 million one would think there would be money to burn, but when you hear that during the same period the price of a house has far more than doubled and that schemes for sewerage, water, hospitals and for every public amenity are at a standstill all over the country you will see how insignificant the sum we are talking about really is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important discussion.  While I propose to stay within the rules of order I should like to comment on some matters mentioned in the Minister's brief because we all believe that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>
      <P>I also feel that the proposed increase from £1,500 million to £2,500 million is not sufficient particularly when we remember that at the present rate of spending it represents five years expenditure. If we take the last two years, in which the increase has been enormous, a Bill would have to come before the House again very much sooner than five years.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the present situation. While Deputy Fitzpatrick rightly dwelt on local authority houses the situation is even worse than he said because the houses being completed this year are houses many of which were started two or three years ago and some which were started last year and this year cannot be completed because the necessary money has not been made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> This is evidenced by the increasing waiting list.  A few days ago a six-house scheme was being allocated a few miles from me and there were 44 eligible applicants. In another area where there were 12 houses there were 42 applicants. Those people have no hope of getting a house for years to come.  This compares very unfavourably with the situation which the Government admitted existed in 1977, when they took over, when 75 per cent of those awaiting housing were, according to them, three-member families. They used that as a reason for cutting down then on additional money which was required by local authorities to house people unable to house themselves.</P>
    <P>I heard somebody whining here the other night about the effect of the average price of a house on inner city houses which were costing so much.  I should like to remind those sitting opposite that if they had built the inner city houses when houses could be built for a very small sum of money instead of listening to their masters outside who owned this property and were waiting to make a kill with it, if they had signed a compulsory purchase order and acquired the sites then and built the houses then, the houses would not now be costing £40,000 per site, which we are told is the current price. The inner city has to be built up.  I contributed in my time to it and I am glad that to a certain extent the present Minister is doing so also, but not as much as I would like.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking about the additional money allocated for local authority housing when the cost per house unit has increased by two or two-and-a-half times what it cost four or five years ago.  This automatically cuts down the number of houses being built, but when the amount of money allocated is also cut down the situation becomes much worse.  I should like the Minister to let us know the comparative figures for money made available to local authorities throughout the country last year and this year because the answers I have got to questions in the House show that there has been a substantial reduction except in certain favoured areas.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in the county in which I live the amount allocated is about half <Col N="791" /> the money sought, but the greatest trouble&mdash;this was referred to very briefly by Deputy Fitzpatrick&mdash;is that the number of starts has dropped through the floor. I do not know if a study has been done on this but listening to the case being made by spokesmen for the Department of the Environment one would get the impression that local authority housing schemes were roaring along, that there was no shortage of money for building, that everybody was happy, that the number of completions this year would be a near record and that the number of starts was well up.  The facts are &mdash; and I am not very far out &mdash; that the number of local authority houses completed this year will be down by well over 2,000 on last year and that the number of local authority houses completed next year, unless there is a quick change of Government and a quick change in the attitude of the Department to local authority housing, will be back where it was two years after Fianna Fáil took over from the previous Coalition Government when it went down to 1,700 or 1,800 from about 6,000.</P>
    <P>I am making the point because I believe that, above all else, not the making available of the money but the permission to allow the Local Loans Fund to have the money with which this crisis can be attacked, is very important.  Therefore the increase from £1,500 million to £2,500 million is not adequate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick did not refer to SDA loans.  Let me give a typical instance of what is happening, which I am sure is well within the rules of the House.  In some cases a local authority will not build a house for people where four or five members of a family are earning.  The badly housed parents will not get a local authority house.  When the members of the family leave the family home the unfortunate parents are left in a hovel for the rest of their lives.  The local authority tell the people they cannot build or allocate a house or cottage to them but ask why they cannot build their own.</P>
    <P>They are told that perhaps they can get a subsidised site and very often this costs £2,000 or £3,000.  That amount of money <Col N="792" /> could have built a good house two or three years ago.  Before they start they must find that money.  They apply for an SDA loan and up to June this year most local authorities were processing loan applications and notifying applicants that they would get £X up to a maximum of £12,000.  With that letter in their hand they went to a bank.  In most cases the bank manager gave them a bridging loan. They started to build the house and when it was completed or almost completed they went to the local authority and asked for some of the loan.  What happened? The local authority had not got the money and this Government refused to give it to them.  The newspapers said they were doing this in order to create a situation in which to have the national wage agreement.  I could not see the sense of that and I do not believe it.  The main reason they did not do so was because the money was not available.  They found the £1,500 million getting smaller and smaller and decided to tighten up on this. They are good at tightening up on important things but if they are not important it is a different matter.</P>
    <P>Such people were unable to finish their house or, if they had finished it, they were repaying enormous sums to banks for bridging loans.  I know people with slightly over £100 a week who are repaying £70 a week on interest.  The Government say there is plenty of money for housing and people should build their own.  They ask why they do not do so.  In June, finding the money was not available, the local authorities either had a discussion among their managers or a circular was sent to them from the Department.  They decided to change the terms of the letter which was sent to applicants to read: &ldquo;you have been allotted a loan of £X which will be made available to you subject to the availability of finance&rdquo;.  One can imagine a bank manager when an ordinary wage earner hands him that note and says that he wants to borrow money to buy a house. A bank manager being a bank manager, and not having got there because he was a fool, decides that that is no use.  Since there is no guarantee of money there is no guarantee of a bridging loan.  I do not <Col N="793" /> know whether I am right or wrong but I feel the person who gets that document and is refused a bridging loan is in a better position than the unfortunate who gets a bridging loan and then finds the local authority has no money to meet it when the time comes.</P>
    <P>This has occurred because the State left the local authorities short of so much money.  There is, however, another aspect to it.  We heard a lot of talk from those in Government that they had increased not only the amount of loan which could be borrowed from £4,500 in my time to £12,000 but also had increased the eligibility limit.  What they did not say was that, having done that, they did not make additional funds available to allow local authorities to pay the money.  The position is that if one pays a loan of £12,000 it costs just three times that amount.  It would have been reasonable to recognise that inflation had increased the cost of a house.  To suggest that it could be done on a loaves and fishes basis, and that without getting any additional money local authorities should be able to make the same number of loans available although the amount of the loan had increased three times, makes it much worse.  If a person is earning £105 a week he may be eligible for a loan of £12,000 but if he has less the loan will be less.  A sum of £12,000 is nothing when it comes to building a house at present.  Unless a person can raise £3,000 or £4,000 somewhere else and has saved as much&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Chair wants us to say &ldquo;This is not good enough&rdquo; and then sit down, that can be done but that is not my way if dealing with matters in the House. If the Government are serious about a housing programme they must make the necessary money available, first of all through the SDA loans, and they must be prepared to subsidise them if the cost of money is too high.  This is where the whole issue arises.  To do that, extra money is needed.  It is ridiculous to suggest that the amount of money which is sought here will meet the problem over the next four or five years which is apparently suggested in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned vocational schools.  We know it is impossible in a country town to get children into a vocational school this year or next year, with very few exceptions, because the necessary money has not been made available to enlarge or to build the schools required.  Even when schools are built, teachers and secretarial staff are not sanctioned to run the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of hospitals, this Government, not the Coalition Government, when the late Deputy Childers, as he then was, was Minister for Health, accepted the FitzGerald Report.  In our turn, we agreed that hospitals should be built in certain areas.  That Government had already made the same decision. What have they done now?  They get all the money that is available, not a lot, and they spend it on one hospital in Dublin. They are not even able to finish that. How can anyone expect that jobs can be <Col N="796" /> done as required when the amount of money made available is not sufficient?</P>
    <P>A very good case was made by a Fianna Fáil Deputy for a couple of harbours in County Dublin which were sadly neglected.  He did not say it was because of his Government that they were sadly neglected.  Money should be made available to have this work done.  Drogheda Harbour is close to me; half of it is in Meath and the other half in Louth, where the Boyne runs into the sea.  Necessary work on the harbour has not been carried out because the money is not available.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of craw-thumping about itinerant settlements and yet the only effort ever made to settle the itinerants properly&mdash;travelling people, as they are now called&mdash;was when we made arrangements to have built, not tigeens which one would not put a dog into, but houses, but the necessary money is not available now.  We have a group of people, whom I can only refer to as fascists, who object to itinerants being housed within a mile of them.  I agree with the Government when they insists that houses should be built for itinerants even though some people object and try to have them chased away.  It is an extraordinary attitude by so-called Christians.</P>
    <P>There is not enough money spent on water and sewerage schemes.  I do not entirely blame the Government, I blame all the Governments down through the years who sadly neglected the water and sewerage schemes.  They did not do what they should have done.  The result is that we have a situation where our towns and village authorities are doing more harm to the environment by allowing effluent into rivers than anything else I know of.  We made efforts to have money made available to remedy the situation.  It has not been remedied.  It is being dealt with very slowly, shortage of money has stopped hundreds of schemes, schemes that were half completed have been left and schemes that were built with a capacity for a very large area are now working on a relatively small area because the necessary money is not available.</P>
    <P>The amount of money being made available is entirely inadequate.  I know people will say on the one hand I am <Col N="797" /> complaining of too much borrowing and on the other that there is not enough being borrowed, but this matter deals with essential services.  The Government will get the support of everyone in the House if they decide to provide money which would be accepted as the best estimate that can be made of what these schemes will cost in the next five or ten years.  Otherwise, we will be coming back to the House in 12 or 18 months time looking for more money.  The amount of money which has been spent and the devaluation of the IR£ has created a situation where £1,000 million will go nowhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which raises the statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund from £1,500 million to £2,500 million, is an enabling Bill.  It enables the Government, through the Local Loans Fund, to finance the various capital expenditure of local authorities. The fact that the £1,500 million limit was established in 1978 and has now to be increased by something of the order of 60 per cent to £2,500 million, is indicative of the rate of inflation which we have experienced under the Government.  The rate of inflation for 1979-80 was about 18 per cent.  This is causing concern to the Government and to all politicians.  It is the inflation rate which is making things so difficult for the Government to tackle the real problems.  It is the utter failure of the Government to bring the rate of inflation under control which has caused such hardship, from the lack of housing, school buildings and sewerage works being carried out by local authorities.  We are complaining about the lack of real investment in these areas.  The word &ldquo;real&rdquo; is an important one to use economically, because it is only by increasing the real investment in the superstructure of the nation that we can ensure that our people will live in comfort and get the necessary services.  We are not now getting the necessary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The damage which inflation is causing to Government funding is exacerbated by the rise in population, which is very welcome. Here we see the real need for more investment in superstructure.  Our population <Col N="798" /> has increased relatively rapidly, which is an unusual phenomenon in developed countries where family planning has, to a certain extent, controlled population rises.  Fifty per cent of the population are below 25 years of age.  At the other end of the scale the percentage of the population aged 65 years and over, the dependent section of the community, is also increasing rapidly.  This population structure is highly significant from the point of view of local authority investment in housing because it is the young population, those between 18 and 25, who make the biggest demand on housing: they get married and they set up their own homes.</P>
    <P>In this area this Government are failing because they have not done anything to ensure that the infrastructure, water and sewerage, as well as the houses will be available.  I will come back to the subject of local authority houses later and refer to the reduced number built in 1980, a serious development from the point of view of our increasing young population.</P>
    <P>This young population also need education and it is the job of the Government to ensure that the schools and the supply of teachers will be adequate.  Peculiarly, it is under the Local Loans Fund that the building of vocational schools is financed. It is the wrong way to do it.  To my mind as Fine Gael spokesman for education, the financing of school building at all levels lies properly with the Department of Education.  That is where all school building should be centred.  That Department have a good building unit and they are to be commended on the very good secondary schools they have built, particularly from the point of view of design. The Board of Works have responsibility for the building of primary schools.</P>
    <P>This is a very fragmented and haphazard approach to school building programmes which, as I have said, should be centralised in the Department of Education where the expertise lies and where proper programming can be done.  This haphazard approach is reflected in the vocational school accommodation being provided.  In 1976 a survey was done on the number of prefab buildings in the vocational education system.  The survey <Col N="799" /> discovered that at the prices then ruling it would take £16 million to replace all the prefab structures in this field.  That is also indicative of the Government's haphazard approach to school building.  Prefabs do not have a long life and they are subject to high maintenance costs, but the policy in the 1960s and 1970s favoured a programme of prefab schools as a long-term solution.  This should never have been.</P>
    <P>Now the nation is faced with a colossal problem in relation to school buildings because of the lack of Fianna Fáil's social commitment.  The 1980 budget cut the provision for the building of schools and colleges by 6 per cent.  Taking inflation into account this meant a real reduction of capital expenditure of the order of 20 per cent, a social disgrace in view of the increasing young population.  It was a retrograde and socially dangerous policy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is disgraceful in its provision for a school building programme.  All Deputies in my party have had representations from throughout the country about the cuts in school extensions and the building of new schools.  People have been told there will not be any money until 1981 or, alternatively, that cost limits already have been exceeded.  Therefore, the whole attitude of the Department of Education and the Government is very objectionable.  It will cause tremendous pressure for politicians in the coming two years.</P>
    <P>I have read the quarterly bulletin on housing in the public sector for the quarter ended 30 September last.  In the 1970s about 25,000 houses were completed year in year out.  The target was set by Deputy Tully during the period of the National Coalition from 1973 to 1977. The target of 25,000 houses per annum was reached up to the end of 1979 and from figures available for the first three quarters of 1980 it looks as if the target will be reached this year.  However, because of expressed Fianna Fáil policy the number of local authority houses has been reduced.  Deputy Lynch said that Fianna Fáil's commitment does not lie with local authority housing but elsewhere. He said that Fianna Fáil's priority <Col N="800" /> was with private sector housing.  Local authority house building was at its highest in the National Coalition years and the figures have been borne out by the report I referred to earlier.  I want to put them on the record of the House.  Local authority dwellings completed, according to Table 3 (a) of the report were: 1973, 6,072; 1974, 6,746; 1975, 8,794; 1976, 7,263; 1977, 6,333.  From 1974 to 1977 the National Coalition were responsible for the extremely high level of local authority houses financed and completed.</P>
    <P>It is indicative of the lack of social conscience by the Fianna Fáil Government that since then the trend has been downward.  In 1978 the number fell from 6,333 in 1977 to 6,273.  In 1979 a total of 6,214 houses were completed by local authorities.  This figure is again substantially below the average for the 1973 to 1976 period.  The most serious downturn can be seen for 1980.  Many Members of the House who are also members of local authorities can see for themselves at local level that the building programme in the public sector has come to a standstill. From January to the end of September 1980 only 3,265 local authority houses have been completed, a reduction of nearly 50 per cent of the total for 1979. If we take into account 1,300 houses completed in the last quarter, that would bring the completions for 1980 in respect of local authority houses to 4,500, a reduction of more than 25 per cent over the 1979 figure.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious state of affairs. It is only too obvious to Members of the House who are also members of local authorities that the house applicant list is increasing daily.  Under the National Coalition Government we were able to house families with two children and in many instances we were able to house families with one child.  We are now back in the situation where a couple will have to have three children before they are recognised as being serious cases for houses.  Once again social problems are arising.  I know of a substantial increase in the number of marriages which are breaking up because of bad housing conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Chair not agree that I am entitled to make political charges based on the lack of commitment by the Government in respect of the Local Loans Fund?  I am only describing the results of this lack of commitment by the Government which is related to the Local Loans Fund policy.  The amount of money being expended under the Local Loans Fund in completely inadequate so far as the house building policy in the private sector is concerned.  I must therefore refute the statement made by the Minister this morning when he referred to the substantial increase in expenditure from the fund.  He stated:</P>
      <P>This reflects in particular increased provision for local authority housing including the house purchase loan scheme...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been an increased provision for local authority housing throughout the country this year.  The number of houses being built by local authorities will have reduced by 25 per cent this year. It is fallacious and is misleading the House when the Minister of State comes in and makes a statement that this reflects, in particular, increased provision <Col N="802" /> for local authority housing, when it is manifestly evident from statistics from the Department of the Environment that the number of houses built by local authorities will decrease by 25 per cent. How dare he come in here, mislead the House and give false information to the House when it patently obvious from Government statistics that that is not the case.  I hope he can deal with this aspect of the matter when he is replying.</P>
    <P>In the sentence I have quoted the Minister said that this reflects increased provision for the house purchase loan scheme.  We are well aware of the house purchase loan scheme, whether it is the low rise mortgage scheme or the SDA loan scheme.  Many local authorities throughout the country have had to stop consideration of loans under the SDA scheme.  In my local authority of Waterford city since 14 July we have not been able to process applications under the SDA scheme because of lack of funds. There is no point in the Minister of State coming in here and pretending to the House that everything in the garden is rosy in regard to the Government's commitment to the house purchase loan scheme.  That is not so.  Another local authority of which I am also a member, Waterford County Council, have only been able to continue processing SDA loan applications by using their own resources pending an allocation, which will probably not come now until 1981, in respect of that scheme.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government are slowly choking local authorities when it comes to the provision of money for SDA loan schemes and other purchase loan schemes.  Since last July many local authorities have had to suspend consideration of applications under the SDA scheme.  The Minister comes in here and pretends to the House that there is increased provision for local authority houses, including the house purchase loan schemes.  Many young married couples come to us and tell us that they have committed themselves to purchasing a house, have put down a deposit and have an application in for an SDA loan.  Those couples are entitled to houses but we cannot explain to them that the Government <Col N="803" /> have no money for the next six months.  Many young couples have been embarrassed by the situation which has arisen because of the failure of Fianna Fáil to provide adequate funds for the purchase of houses.  It is a disgrace that the Government have not been able to meet their obligations in respect of house purchase loans.  The Minister may be very pleased about the increase to £5,500 in respect of loan limits and about the loan increase to £12,000 but these figures could be increased to £10,000 and £20,000 respectively without having any effect because of there not being any money to run the scheme.  Who, then, are the Government codding?</P>
    <P>There arises the other question of the cost of housing.  The Government came into power on the crest of a wave.  They promised to abolish rates and they kept that promise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Fianna Fáil introduced new house grants of £1,000. That scheme is still in operation but the scheme which provided for house improvement grants of £600 went by the board very quickly, the attitude being that once that party were in office, they could ride on the backs of the electorate. The position now is that the provision for house improvement loans cannot be met. About a year ago when we were debating our joining the EMS, we were told that membership of this system would result in lower interest rates such as those which are available in Germany and other European countries.  We were told, too, that the EMS would free us from the stranglehold of the London money market. In addition we were told that inflation would be kept under control.</P>

      <P>In passing, then, I shall merely indicate the real increase which local authorities have been faced with in respect of house prices.  The figures indicate the need for a substantial rise in the limits in respect of the Local Loans Fund. I am merely indicating that the limits being provided for in the Bill are insufficient. Perhaps I might quote the percentage increase in house prices during the past few years in order to prove that the increase being authorised under this Bill is insufficient.  I am sure the Chair will bear with me in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into the matter in depth but shall merely point out that since 1976, house prices have rocketed.  In the local authority sector, houses which were costing on average £8,553 to build in 1976 are now costing £22,161.  In other words, the cost of building a local authority house has almost trebled in that time.  This situation has caused serious problems for those who manage the Local Loans Fund.  The real value of the fund is not increasing.  It is decreasing as one will realise in taking into account the rapid increase in the cost of building local authority houses.  The same applies to the private sector. Houses financed by building societies cost on average £12,113 in 1976 whereas the corresponding figure today is £28,976.  This is an indication of the failure of Fianna Fáil to keep down house <Col N="805" /> prices or to control inflation or to care for the real needs of the people.</P>
      <P>The situation I have outlined is a serious indictment of Fianna Fáil in Government during a period in which they have had a big majority and, consequently, real power in the area of house price control.  However, they have failed miserably and are far more interested in having their pictures in the papers on the opening of supermarkets or of cow byres. That is all very good cosmetic stuff but the people are suffering in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I would say in passing that because of the lack of funds, the local authorities are not able to meet their commitment to build single cottages where sites are provided by the applicants. The number of such cottages being built, especially in Waterford, is so minimal as to be a cause of derision.  I know of many families who have the sites but who cannot get Waterford County Council to build the houses.  There are a number of other matters arising from the Minister's speech which I should like to deal with before the Chair takes a stick to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of concern has been expressed regarding the Government's policy in the area of the building of hospitals.  It is obvious that the amount of money being allocated from the Local Loans Fund to the health authorities is totally inadequate in this <Col N="806" /> respect.  A particular example of this is to be found in my constituency where Ardkeen hospital has been designated a regional hospital.  I understand that plans in that respect have been finalised but that it has been made quite clear that the necessary moneys are not available and that the plans will have to be shelved for the time being.  Surely this is an obvious example of the stop-go policy.  There is a fine site in Waterford for the building of a regional hospital and there is a great need there for such a hospital.  I have seen out-patients standing in corridors for hours while awaiting specialist treatment. The facilities available there are totally inadequate and the staff who are doing very good work are operating in very difficult circumstamces.  Again, this is another example of a lack of commitment on the part of the Government in regard to Ardkeen hospital.  The situation at the hospital is so bad that it has become almost impossible to get a machine in any of the departments there.</P>
      <P>The same applies in relation to harbour works.  The volume of work in this sphere is pathetic.  This is because of the small amounts of money that are committed to this work under the Local Loans Fund. In fairness, though, we were very lucky in so far as Dunmore East was concerned. A very good job of harbour development was completed there about eight years ago but there is a need now for the drawing up of a comprehensive plan for the establishment of a deep-water facility in the Suir Estuary.</P>

The Minister said that in 1935 this fund amounted to £5 million and in 1980 it amounts to £2,500 million.  As big as this might seem, I wonder if it is big enough.  What strikes most public representatives when dealing with constituents is the lack of progress in many fields.  One reason for this lack may be that we are not spending enough money on many of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An unbelievable thing happened in 1980.  At one stroke of the pen this Government took away reconstruction grants and oil central heating grants.  This trend is wrong.  We should be encouraging people to improve and build their own homes.  I could not believe it when the announcement was made taking away the grants for extending homes.  The Minister knows the number of people who ask public representatives if there is any money available to improve dwellings.  In many cases these people are living in very bad dwellings.  I ask the Government to reconsider this trend, where we are encouraging people to sit back and let the State do everything for them.  We should be encouraging them to renovate, improve, and, where possible, build their own homes.  The State should be giving <Col N="809" /> them more money by way of grants, loans and increasing income limits to encourage them to do something worth while.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the £1,000 grant. Many people say it is too much but I do not think it is half enough.  At present everybody looking for a house goes to the local authority hoping they will provide them with houses.  We must stop this trend.  If we increased these grants some of those people would be encouraged to build their own homes.  I would be the first to admit that there may be a big number of people who do not have the initiative &mdash; they probably do not have the capital &mdash; and may not be capable of doing this kind of work.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a very large sum of money, but what value will we get for it?  Every week the number of people looking for local authority accommodation is increasing.  The local authorities are inviting tenders and holding back the housing tenders at some stage because the money is not being made available to build these houses.  There are over 30,000 people who do not have any homes and many of them are living in squalor.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals not alone with hospitals but with old people's homes.  In a rural community what strikes me is the number of old people's who are living on their own, without sanitary services or telephones and often even without electricity.  They live miles from their nearest neighbour. This is another top priority the Government should look at.  We must think about housing our old people who are past working age&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely £2,500 million is a policy matter?  The point I am making is that taking care of old people should be a Government priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last few weeks Supplementary Estimates for £50 million, £30 million and £33 million were discussed.  This is nothing less than a second budget. Today the Minister is asking for a vast amount of money.  I am wondering if this <Col N="810" /> money is being properly spent.  I do not think it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if this Bill means we will have a resumption of the flow of money from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister would spell that out clearly when replying.  Does it mean that local authorities, at present starved of finance, will get an injection of cash for the remainder of this year and obviously also early in the new year?</P>
      <P>As has been stressed by other speakers today, the situation has become chronic, with most, if not all, local authorities at present encountering tremendous financial difficulties because of a shortfall in the injection of cash from central Government funds, in other words, the Local Loans Fund.  Nowhere is this shortfall more evident than in the housing sector. Those of us who serve on local authorities &mdash; I am a member of Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Urban Council &mdash; know very well the chronic situation obtaining.  We want to see money flowing back into the coffers of these local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is the main concern at present because our housing lists have grown out of all proportion in the last couple of years and the number of houses being built, especially local authority houses, has decreased.  Can the Minister give us any hope that the number of houses being built by local authorities will be increased?  Three, four or five years ago a family with one child, and in some cases couples with no children, under the National Coalition Government, at the time when Deputy Tully was Minister for Local Government, had a reasonable hope of being rehoused by local authorities. Nowadays they have no hope at all. I am aware of many two and three children families who are not being rehoused, who have been on the housing list for several years with no immediate prospect of being rehoused.  It is a very sad state of affairs to see young married couples with two or three young children, or in some cases four or five, living in dreadful flats.  The standard of accommodation in which some of these people <Col N="811" /> live is deplorable.  More and more of them are living in mobile homes completely unsuitable and causing many health hazards.</P>
    <P>I have a constant flow of worried parents coming to me wanting to be properly rehoused because their children are suffering grievously from the terrible conditions in which they live, be that in unfit flats or mobile homes not suitable to our climate, particularly in winter.</P>
    <P>The dependence of local authorities on moneys from the Local Loans Fund is greater than ever because of our increased population.  At a time when our population is increasing at such a rate it is imperative that moneys provided for basic essentials &mdash; and here I am referring to housing &mdash; should be increased constantly in a realistic way thereby ensuring that our people live in reasonable comfort. The position in regard to the provision of houses by local authorities is shocking at present, as is the position of people who want to build their own homes, or those who wish to avail of SDA loans.  I do not know of any local authority at present sanctioning SDA loans for new applicants.  I believe there is no local authority at present in a financial position to do so.  That position must be remedied immediately.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible state of affairs that young couples who had assumed they would get an SDA loan from a local authority, who had paid a deposit on a house, now find they will not and are being told that the earliest date at which money will be provided will be some time in 1982.  That is a most unsatisfactory situation.  When replying the Minister might tell us if moneys for SDA loans will be given to local authorities on a scale sufficient to meet their present demands.  I should like to know if such moneys will be provided and, if so, when.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency in recent years also to remove people from local authority housing lists because of the income of the husband or principal earner.  The general practice has been that anybody whose income exceeds £5,500, which is the eligibility limit for an SDA loan, is not considered for local <Col N="812" /> authority rehousing.  Five-and-a-half thousand pounds is not a sufficiently high limit.  For instance, a man earning £6,000, at today's prices, could not reasonably be expected to build&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now going into policy matters which he should properly raise on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall say merely that a man earning £6,000 could not reasonably be expected to build his own home particularly when one considers that the cost of a house nowadays is well in excess of £20,000; in fact I think the figure given today was something of the order of £22,000.  Therefore, such a man is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. He is not eligible for inclusion on a local authority housing list, he is not in a financial position to build a home of his own and has no alternative but to rent a house at an exorbitant rate, anything up to £30 a week, or otherwise live in a flat of inferior quality.  Young married couples especially who are in need of rehousing are not getting a fair crack of the whip at present.  Local authorities will have to accept for rehousing people with an income in excess of £5,500.  In addition the eligibility limit for SDA loans &mdash; when they become available again &mdash; will have to be considerably greater than £5,500.  In today's money values probably that eligibility limit should be closer to £8,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference is made in the Bill to the fact that the Local Loans Fund provides finance for items such as hospitals, harbour works, intinerant resettlement and so on.  I wish to express my concern at the slow flow of cash to finance such projects. The building of hospitals is being delayed all over the country because of a lack of funds from the central Government and from the Local Loans Fund.  A number of instances have been cited.  In my area a hospital which was due for replacement 30 years ago has not yet been started &mdash; and we were told emphatically in 1979 that it would be started in 1980 &mdash; because the money has dried up, we are told, in the Department of Health.  Can the Minister hold out any hope of a fresh flow of <Col N="813" /> cash for projects such as this and other worthy causes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of a lack of financing from the Local Loans Fund no county is suffering more than the county I represent.  I represent the entire county since I serve as a member of Dublin County Council, and I recognise the great hardship inflicted on house purchasers today.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister that there will be some easing of the situation and that there will be a ready flow of cash before Christmas to bring relief to many people who are eagerly awaiting the money which has been approved by the councils in anticipation of a cheque being forwarded by the Minister to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for me to go into the great hardship being suffered by these people because I am sure the Minister is aware of it.  The case has been made for them over and over this morning in this House.  I cannot honestly see how the Minister and his colleagues &mdash; and I include the back benchers in the Fianna Fáil Party in his colleagues &mdash; can be so disinterested that some of them have not come in here this morning to make a similar case for those people.  I am sure the queues are as long at the Fianna Fáil advice centres as they are at the advice centres of the Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>When I arrive at the centre where I meet my constituents on a regular basis, half of them are looking for loans and wondering when they will get money from the local authority.  A great deal of the time of public representatives is being wasted but that is a small matter for us, when you think of the great suffering caused to the many newly married couples and others not so newly married with families.  This is the greatest transaction in their life.  It is probable that many of them hesitated before seeking a loan to purchase a house from a private builder. For many of them there was an easier course.  They could go on the local authority housing list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The slowing up in the flow of money to local authorities is putting more and more people on the local authority housing list, <Col N="814" /> many of whom do not want to go on that list.  This is putting more and more strain on the local authority to obtain the land, get the building under way, and process the ever-increasing housing applications. If the situation were not so serious for these people, I would say it has got to the stage in County Dublin where it is almost laughable.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the demand in County Dublin has been increasing.  The population has been increasing.  The population in County Dublin has increased at a far greater rate than in any other part of the country. Because of this, Dublin County Council were seeking more and more money from the Local Loans Fund.  The county council have on stream approvals to the extent of £4 million.  If the Minister sanctioned £4 million today for Dublin County Council, it could be paid out before Christmas because there are approvals in anticipation of the receipt of that kind of money from the fund.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many people that represents who are awaiting loans.  They have supplied the information to the council and that information has been checked.  They are now entitled to a loan to house themselves and their families. They cannot house themselves because they have not got the loan, and they are forced to go to the bank where they are paying anything from 16 to 18 per cent interest on a short-term loan.  The banks are now hesitant about giving cash because they do not know how long-term the short-term will be.</P>
    <P>During the months of September and October payments from the Local Loans Fund to Dublin County Council were somewhere in the region of £350,000 to £400,000.  In November the payment was £370,000.  In December, when so many people are waiting for their cheques to be sanctioned by the Minister, the county council received a cheque for £74,000 on Monday.  Is that an indication that no further money will be paid until after Christmas?  Where did the figure of £74,000 come from?  Who decided that Dublin County Council, with a backlog of approvals totalling £4 million, were to <Col N="815" /> get £74,000?  That would represent six-and-a-half loan payments.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Irish Rugby Football Union have not yet taken <Col N="817" /> a decision on the 1981 tour.  I have already been in contact with them and I have expressed to them the Government's serious concern on the issue, explaining the reasons why the Government could not approve of such a tour.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy regarding sporting contacts with South Africa is well known.  As I indicated in my reply to Deputy Desmond on 23 October, the Government remain firmly opposed to South Africa's apartheid policies and they consider that the Olympic principle of non-discrimination in sport cannot be satisfactorily observed in a situation in which the local organisation of many sports in South Africa, including rugby football, continues to be largely determined by the organisation of society on a racially segregated basis.  A tour in breach of the Olympic principle would be seen in many quarters, in South Africa and in other countries, as evidence of a lack of concern regarding the continued application of racial segregation in rugby football in South Africa.</P>
      <P>The Government would, of course, be concerned about its potentially serious consequences were the 1981 tour &mdash; the first tour by a representative Irish side in recent years &mdash; to go ahead.  However I do not wish, at this point, to anticipate the IRFU's decision, which I still hope will be against a tour.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister if he will make sure that there is no question of allowing leave of absence to people who are staff of Government Departments or over whom we have authority to go on this tour.  I should like to ask him &mdash; my suggestion is a very distasteful device and I put it forward only with great reluctance &mdash; if he would consider as a last resort withdrawing the passports of those who decide to travel if the tour goes ahead?  I should like to ask the Minister to circulate an excellent speech by our representative to the United Nations in which he outlined in words of one syllable, something which is needed with the kind of people who <Col N="818" /> would go to South Africa, the case against apartheid.

      <P>I share the Deputy's distaste for the apartheid policy in South Africa and the whole aspect of racial discrimination being imposed in a drastic manner by the South African Government. I do not propose in our democracy that we should imitate their methods by withdrawing passports from individual citizens who wish to use them, as they are entitled to do, as free people in a free society, much as I disprove of them going on this organised basis to South Africa. I have expressed that view to the executive committee of their organisation, the IRFU.  Individual Irish citizens are free to travel abroad on Irish passports and I do not propose to interfere with that basic democratic right.  As far as State employees who may be selected are concerned, no special leave facilities will be granted. I will take into account what the Deputy has said with regard to the distribution of the speech by our permanent representative to the UN.</P>

      <P>I have heard the complaints referred to by the Deputy and I have brought them to the attention of the UN and made the point of view put by the Deputy known to the UN.  At the same time, this matter must be approached on a tendering basis.  It is not the first time this has happened.  During the period we were in Cyprus the rotation was carried out on at least three occasions by other airlines.  Naturally, we want to see Aer Lingus doing the job.  I will put the point of view expressed by the Deputy to them.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to my remarks at the Conference on Neutrality organised by the International Affairs Committee of the Royal Irish Academy on 21 November 1980.</P>
      <P>On that occasion I said and I quote: &ldquo;Joining the European Community does not involve us in any military or defence obligations, nor is it likely to do so in the foreseeable future.  However, it has been recognised by successive Governments that in the context of political union in Europe, Ireland, as a member of the Community, would be prepared to participate in arrangements for its defence, if called upon to do so.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ireland is not a member of any military alliance or of any organisation which has military or defence arrangements.</P>
      <P>There is a clear distinction between our participation in European political co-operation &mdash; a process by which the member states of the Community consult with one another on foreign policy issues &mdash; and defence matters &mdash; which are not the subject of consideration by the Nine.  The question of harmonising the national defence policies of the member states simply does not arise.</P>

      <P>In view of the length of the detailed reply to the Deputies' questions in this case, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a statement setting out the position.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> I would like to deal with the Deputies' question under the headings of (a) Cross-Border Studies, (b) Cross-Border Drainage Schemes, (c) Cross-Border Non-Quota Section (ERDF) proposals and (d) ERDF Assistance in the Border Areas.</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>Cross-Border Studies</i></P>
    <P>To date four studies of the Border areas have been carried out jointly by the Irish and British Governments.  In three of these cases the European Commission have also participated and contributed to half of the cost of undertaking the studies. These studies are the Derry-Donegal Communications Study, which cost approximately £75,000 and was completed in November 1977, the Erne Catchment Study, which cost approximately £80,000 and was completed in June 1980 and the Mourne Herring Fishery Study, which cost approximately £130,000 and was completed in March 1980.  Of the total approximate cost incurred of £285,000 an amount of £142,500 has been paid by the European Commission and £71,250 each by the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>The fourth study, which was carried out by the Irish and British Governments of the Newry-Dundalk area, was completed in 1980.  This study was carried out by officials and there was no direct expenditure involved.  A further study of the tourism potential for the Newry-Dundalk area is being carried out by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourism Board.  Again in this case there is no direct public expenditure involved and the costs involved are being borne from the resources of the two tourism boards.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Cross-Border Drainage</i></P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers approved, on 6 February 1979, a drainage programme for catchment areas on both sides of the Border.  The Council agreed to support the programme up to a maximum contribution of 8 million European units of account(IR£5 million approximately) or, if less than this maximum, to provide 50 per cent of the total combined costs to the Irish and British Governments of whatever drainage schemes were undertaken. The grant will be used by the Office of Public Works and the NI <Col N="827" /> Department of Agriculture for work on the Ulster Blackwater and Finn-Lackey (Erne tributary) catchments.  The drainage schemes for the programme are in the course of preparation but the estimated cost is not yet known.  Expenditure incurred by the Irish and British Governments to date in the preparation of the schemes (field surveys, design and so on) is respectively as follows: IR£200,000 approximately and UK sterling £130,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Cross-Border Non-Quota Section (ERDF Proposals)</i></P>
    <P>The regulations for use of the Non-Quota Section of the Regional Fund for, <i>inter alia,</i> Irish cross-Border projects were adopted by the Council on 7 October 1980.  These regulations cover a five-year programme, 1980-85.  The measures for Ireland relate to the development of tourism and craft industries in Border areas North and South and the financial allocation is £16 million comprising £10.7 million for the southern Border areas and £5.30 million for northern Border areas. The Non-Quota Section aid will be matched by aid from the Irish Government making a total of £20.5 million available to the fund.  Similar joint financing will operate on the Northern side of the Border.  The areas eligible for this Non-Quota Section aid are Counties Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth on the Northern side of the Border and the District Council areas of Derry, Strabane, Omagh, Fermanagh, Dungannon, Armagh and Newry and Mourne.  The Irish Government have decided to set up a new and separate fund for the implementation of the programme on this side of the Border.  The creation of the special fund should ensure the speedy implementation of the programme which has already been submitted to the EEC Commission for consideration. The Northern Ireland authorities have not yet announced the manner in which the Non-Quota Section measures will operate on the Northern side of the Border.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>ERDF Assistance in the Border Areas</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> The total investment in industrial and infrastructural development projects in the five Southern Border counties for which ERDF assistance has been received in the period 1975-1979 amounts to approximately £80 million of which approximately £14.6 million has been committed from the ERDF.  I have no details of the equivalent figure for the five Northern Border counties.  The Deputies will appreciate that within the figures I have quoted above it is difficult to isolate specific amounts or projects which may be regarded as contributing to cross-Border economic development. The various joint cross-Border studies have, however, helped to identify projects which contribute to cross-Border economic development.  Most of these studies have only recently been completed and commitment to implementation, particularly in relation to the Erne Catchment Study which covers a substantial part of the Border, has yet to be decided upon.  However the Derry-Donegal Report has been completed since 1977 and progress has been made with EEC assistance towards implementation of the recommendations of that report which were recognised as contributing to cross-Border development in that area.  The Deputies will find details of the financial commitments to these projects in the &ldquo;Reports to Ministers on Economic Co-operation&rdquo; which was published in June 1980.  The only major addition to the information in that report is the provision of an additional £305,000 for cross-Border roads in the Donegal area in 1980.</P>
    <P>There is very reason to believe that further applications from both Governments for projects in the Border areas will also be considered favourably within the resources of the ERDF and that the area as a whole will continue to benefit from Community assistance.  Particularly with the availability of the money under the Non-Quota Section of the ERDF I think the Deputies will appreciate that good progress has been made. We will, of course, take advantage of any other suitable opportunities which present themselves to attract to the Border <Col N="829" /> areas any additional resources that may become available.</P>

Is the Minister aware of the excellent work being carried out by an organisation called Co-operation North who recently indicated that they were convinced that a commitment of adequate funds and resources by both Governments to an intensified programme of co-operation would help to facilitate economic and social progress in relation to Northern Ireland?  Does the Minister accept that is a fair statement of the situation and would he indicate the Government's response?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the statement issued at the conclusion of the European Council on 12 December addresses among other matters the subject of East-West relations. The European Council drew particular attention to the principles of selfdetermination and non-intervention contained in the Helsinki Final Act and called on all Final Act signatory states to abide by these principles with regard to Poland and the Polish people.  The statement emphasised that any other attitude would have very serious consequences for the future of international relations in Europe and throughout the world.  The views of the Nine have thus been publicly and clearly stated and are obviously known to the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolution of the Polish problem is a matter for the Polish people themselves. <Col N="832" /> The situation in Poland is undoubtedly a delicate one and its development is being closely observed by Western Governments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority is actively promoting the further industrial expansion of the towns referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In Clonmel the authority is at present constructing two 3,000 square feet advance factory units; these are expected to be completed by mid-1981 and will be available for suitable small industries. Work has also started on a new 150,000 square feet factory at Clonmel for the digital equipment project where the work force is expected to increase to 450 during the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Carrick-on-Suir and Cashel advance factories of 25,000 square feet and 28,000 square feet respectively have been provided <Col N="839" /> and are being vigorously promoted for suitable projects.</P>
    <P>Atari, a US company, has recently been approved grant assistance to expand its activities in Tipperary town.  It is projected that an additional 63 jobs will be provided, bringing the total employment potential of the project to 151 by 1983. The IDA is also constructing a 10,000 square feet factory in the town which is due for completion in mid-1981.</P>
    <P>The authority also has land available for further industrial development in each of the six towns.</P>
    <P>I am informed that a number of projects are at various stages of negotiation for some of the towns in question but details of these projects must remain confidential for the present.</P>

    <P>It is calculated by the bodies that the total number of first-time grant aided jobs filled in 1978 was 12,100 and in 1979, 16,800.  Figures for 1977 are not available as statistics did not identify first-time jobs filled prior to 1978.  These figures moreover do not include the Shannon Industrial Estate for which the figures are not available.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that total job approvals in any year cannot be directly related to first-time jobs filled in that year as the number of new jobs arising in any particular year is normally attributable more to approvals in preceding years than to approvals in that year. The IDA estimate that about 20 per cent of the jobs approved in any year will actually be filled in that year.  In the case of medium/large projects some 60 per cent of the expected jobs on average are translated into actual jobs within five <Col N="844" /> years.  Small industries bring jobs into being more quickly.  About 15 per cent of job approvals are in projects which do not proceed and for which grants are not paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a primary objective of the Government's industrial development programme to secure the maximum level of new job creation and to maintain existing employment in so far as this is compatible with long-term viability.  The intensification of this programme in the current year is reflected in the increase of 23 per cent in the provisions for the IDA and SFADCo in the 1980 Public Capital Programme over 1979.  As a result both of these bodies have intensified their promotional <Col N="846" /> efforts and I understand that the national job approvals target for the year will be exceeded.  In addition, the IDA expect to create 15,000 first-time grant-aided jobs during the current year.</P>
    <P>SFADCo are continuing their intensive small indigenous industry drive in the Mid-West region and more recently in west/south west Offaly.  SFADCo have introduced a number of new measures, including the establishment earlier this year of an innovation and micro-electronics applications centre which will help to maintain employment by introducing higher technology to small firms to enable them to develop to their full potential.</P>
    <P>Following the success of the SFADCo scheme, a nationwide campaign to encourage the development of small indigenous industries was launched by the IDA earlier this year and is proving very successful.</P>
    <P>Assistance provided by the IDA rescue unit in co-operation with the other relevant bodies has contributed to the maintenance or creation of more than 2,000 jobs in the first nine months of the year.</P>
    <P>A scheme was introduced in recent months by the Industrial Credit Company Ltd. under which loans at concessionary rates of interest are available to small and medium sized manufacturing firms in respect of their additional working capital requirements.  These facilities are in addition to the ICC schemes under which global loans from the European Investment Bank are on-lent at attractive rates of interest to small and medium sized firms for fixed asset investment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer the Deputy to the announcement by the Minister for Finance on 31 October 1980 concerning the implementation of additional measures for the purpose of job maintenance and job creation in manufacturing industry, in pursuance of the Government's commitment under the recent national understanding.</P>
    <P>Figures published by the Central Statistics Office on 8 December 1980 showed that the numbers on the live register as <Col N="847" /> at end November 1979 and November 1980 were 84,680 and 114,970 respectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>After all the rosy language, is it not true that there are almost 35,000 more people unemployed this year than 12 months ago?  Is the Minister aware that Fianna Fáil's failure in this field is reviving the old spectre of emigration because of the stagnation of the economy?  Is he aware that 15 per cent of our industries are on short time, involving 175,000 workers?  He can add them to the 115,000 already unemployed and he will get the serious position of almost 300,000 people unemployed.  What are the Government doing about it?  Is the Minister aware that he spoke about an intensified programme and that the target was being reached?  How can he state that a target is being reached when the Fianna Fáil Government promised that unemployment would be down to 80,000 this year and that they are out by over 35,000? Will he not agree that the non-action of the Taoiseach and the Government, who are sitting idly by, is leading to a very serious crisis?  Do the Government realise what effect this is having at the present time?</P>

Could the Minister give me a reason for that if he is so serious about job creation and job retention?  The increase has been from 5p to 7p per gallon.</P>

    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1980: Second and Subsequent Stages (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I had been making a plea on behalf of loan <Col N="869" /> applicants in my constituency.  I do not know whether the Minister realises the seriousness of the situation, but it might be no harm for me to put before him some of the figures that have been presented to us in recent days as members of the local authority.  For the entire month of November the expenditure on house purchase loans in respect of both new and previously-occupied houses amounted to £127,600.  This represents payment to 13 people.  The corresponding figures for November 1979 were £375,550 and 52 applicants.  In other words, in respect of one month alone in one local authority area there is a reduction of 39 loans compared with the corresponding month in the previous year. Is this supposed to be the progress in the housing programme that we have been hearing about since Fianna Fáil returned to office?</P>
      <P>I do not know whether anything that has been said here today will be strong enough to impress on the Minister how bad the situation is.  The housing department in Dublin County Council have approved loans to the value of £4 million and representing 386 housing applicants. These are mainly new house purchasers though a small number, perhaps 20 at the most, would represent house improvement loans.  In any case, the money cannot be paid except in a few cases which we will be able to meet from the £74,000 we received last Monday from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is becoming involved in great detail and such detail is not relevant to the small Bill before us.  It is totally in order to refer to the lack of finance for housing but the detail is not relevant.  It would be relevant to an Estimate or to some other debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to the 380 people who are awaiting loans in County Dublin and my purpose in raising the matter is to extract from the Minister the information whether there is any hope of these people being paid their loans in the near future.  If there is no such hope, my attitude in respect of my <Col N="870" /> representations to Dublin County Council will have to change and, instead of asking the council to speed up loan approvals.  I shall have to ask them to desist from approving loans.  That is the situation we are in.  By approving loans we are putting the applicants in a very difficult position.  On the basis of the approval, they obtained loans from their banks which must be repaid at interest rates ranging from 15 to 18 per cent.  But they will not know when they will be able to pay off the bank loans because of the non-availability of the local authority loans.</P>
      <P>The situation is difficult enough for house purchasers without having to bear this extra burden.  Very often people are satisfied to pay the interest on bridging loans in order to be able to get their houses but not many are in a position of being able to service such loans indefinitely and that is the position they are being put in.  The situation up to last July was that delays in the payment of the local authority loans ranged from one to three months or, in some instances, six months; but now people may have to depend on bridging finance for a year or two.  The £74,000 that we received a couple of days ago from the Local Loans Fund represents just less than six-and-a-half full loans though the council have approved of loans to the extent of £4 million.  The 380 people who have been approved for loans know that there is no chance of the money being paid before Christmas.  Indeed, they will be lucky if it is paid before the following Christmas. I am dealing with the situation in only one local authority area.</P>

He may have been sent here to pull the wool over our eyes, as has happened to the applicants concerned. I hope that the Minister will be honest with us in relation to the real situation and that he will tell us what the position is likely to be during the next six to 12 months.  These people are entitled to know that.  Last week we were talking about consumer protection and this is one area where the Government can give the consumer some protection by telling him the facts.  It is extremely important that these people should know how long they will be on bridging loans.  I had a case recently where a person sold his house and bought another one, but because he could not get approval from the local authority &mdash; they had stopped approving loans, and rightly so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> I do not know if the policy with regard to releasing money from the Local Loans Fund has changed, but in the past the local authority of which I am a member received a substantial sum &mdash; this year it was £2.1 million &mdash; every six months.  In that way they knew where they were going.  What is happening today?  We got a monthly payment but from what we got last Monday &mdash; £74,000 &mdash; I hope it was a weekly payment.  Are we getting to the stage where local authorities will be paid day by day?  That is how it appears to me. A local authority with approval for £4 million are getting £74,000 &mdash; an insult. That is the only way I can describe it.  It means we can give relief to six or seven people on a list of 386.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at how these payments are being made and to tell local authorities what they are getting.  Even if he does not have the money to pay them now, he could tell them how much they will be getting every month or every six months.  It is very worrying for county managers and principal officers of housing departments to approve loans while not knowing when they can be honoured. These people do not get any pleasure seeing housing applicants getting into difficulties, knowing they have loan approval and cannot get into their homes.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the payment from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities for the resettlement of the itinerant population. The local authorities should be told the amount of money being made available for this purpose.  I have no complaints about payments to Dublin County Council.  I do not know of any hold-up in that area but I know that there are other local authorities who do not know where they stand and this is affecting the settlement of itinerants.  We in the Dublin area have gone some considerable distance to find out what the problem is.  As of two weeks ago, we know there are 310 itinerant famiilies in the greater Dublin area and we have planned for their resettlement. I am sure the Minister will give the money when requested, because he has not yet refused us.</P>
    <P>He should ask the Minister for the Environment to encourage local authorities to apply for money for the scheme <Col N="873" /> to settle itinerants.  He should then make the money available, or say it will be available when it is needed.  Some local authorities are holding back because they cannot afford to go ahead with the schemes in case the finance is not available. This is affecting very important work which many local authorities have embarked on and it will certainly affect the resettlement of itinerants in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>This is a problem that should be tackled on a national basis.  We have come a fair way up the road and many local authorities are interested in settling the travelling people.  What is holding them back is the fact that one local authority knows it will be financed by the Local Loans Fund, while their neighbours do not know if the money will be available and they are not prepared to go ahead with the scheme.  In other words, if we in the Dublin area go ahead with the resettlement of the itinerant population and our neighbours Meath, Wicklow, Kildare, do not go ahead with their plans, there will be an influx of itinerants from those areas into the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to tell the local authorities that money will be available for the resettlement of local itinerants. When this happens we will make greater progress than at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. This figure looks better than it is.  We are making many millions of pounds extra available but the problem is that local authorities find it very hard to get their hands on this money.  The Government control the flow of money from the Local Loans Funds to local authorities.  We must accept that even if ten times as much money was made available the local authorities could not touch it because it is controlled by the Government.  I could make a similar speech to that of Deputy McMahon because the problems that exist in Dublin also exist in Galway &mdash; there is a lack of finance for housing, sewerage, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Galway applies for money from the Local Loans Fund, will the situation be the same as it has been so far, that is, that it is being considered by one Department <Col N="874" /> or another?  This consideration takes a long time; the Department bide their time and hold up this necessary work.  I will have to give a number of cases to point out the problems I am talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Athenry there are 30 local authority houses being allocated this week.  Athenry is a small, rural town. There are 150 applicants for those houses.  We have a programme for local authority housing in Galway but we cannot get it off the ground.  I think I am entitled to speak about this because I see that local authority housing is included in the Minister's introductory remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, because I have practical experience at local level, I may be permitted to sidetrack somewhat and it would be only natural that I would do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore we are in the unusual situation of having 150 applicants for 30 houses.  We have a building programme in Galway which would solve the local authority housing crisis if only we were allowed borrow to the degree we wish from the Local Loans Fund.  We are not allowed to do so.  This programme has been held up by one Department or another on one technicality or another. <Col N="876" /> That is why I have wanted to contribute to this debate.  The Local Loans Fund is there for a purpose.  Indeed, twice as much could be made available and it would not make one whit of difference because this fund is totally controlled by the Government.  It is the Government who control the flow of money.  Why not make the money available which would solve the problem at least in relation to local authority housing?  Something of the order of £1.8 million was allocated to Galway County Council for SDA loans. At this stage they have run short of money.  I welcome the fact that the ceiling of this fund has been increased and as a result of that, I hope the SDA loan applications in County Galway already sanctioned will be met and that their loans will be paid forthwith.  Am I right in that assumption?</P>
      <P>Because the average cost to those who want to build their own homes has increased to such an extent in the past few years were it not for the increased loan they could forget about it altogether. Practically all applications coming into Galway County Council now are in the region of £12,000, and £1.8 million does not go very far in that direction, as the Minister will well appreciate.  At the rate at which the Government are at present feeding out this money to us we have sufficient applications on hand in Galway County Council for the next two to two and a half years, that is, assuming the £12,000 ceiling obtains.  Naturally people feel that ceiling should be raised.  If it should be increased further that would mean that whatever allocation we might be given in the future will not go as far as heretofore.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this fund has been increased from £1,500 million to £2,500 million.  In this respect I assume that application to the relevant authority by Galway County Council in regard to SDA loans, and possibly local authority housing also, will be favourably received so that we can get our plans into operation and solve our problems.  Let us hope that the necessary money will be forthcoming from the appropriate Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the 16 years I have been a Member <Col N="877" /> of this House I have talked at length about rural water supplies, which I see mentioned in the Minister's remarks also. I want to bring to the attention of the House and the Minister that, as bad as the problem may be in relation to local authority housing and SDA loans in County Galway the problem in relation to sanitary services is possibly worse. Rarely, if ever, in regard to sewerage schemes do we get a response from the Department.  It is not that we have been negligent in our duty in preparing schemes, having them investigated and so on.  Here again I want to refer to the total sum of £2,500 million.  If only the necessary moneys would be released we could go someway towards solving our problems in regard to sewerage schemes. This problem obtains in many small towns and villages in County Galway. The same applies to water schemes.  I talked about this problem recently.  We have a particular problem in relation to Galway city, Galway city west and its environs.  Parliamentary questions, expressions of opinion by me and indeed the local authority are getting us nowhere in that direction.  I understand very well what is happening.  The Department of the Environment are holding it up and we cannot get the money.  The same applies to a water scheme in the Gort area.  There is a bit of a local problem, but that suits the Department because if the scheme were ready the money would not be available.</P>
    <P>In this document money is provided for vocational schools.  We in Galway are no different from people anywhere else. Recently we had a problem and the vocational education committee had to make a decision and pick two of our four schools which needed attention urgently. They are in Ballinasloe, Tuam, Portumna and Gort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation for vocational education in County Galway is not what is required.  I mentioned the four venues in which the need to provide additional educational facilities has been established.  To establish it is one thing, and to get the money is another.  With this additional money in the Local Loans Fund, I presume that, on application to the proper authority, the two schools rejected by the VEC in County Galway can look forward with a certain amount of confidence to the money being forthcoming. Perhaps by way of promise their problem may be solved, but when they make the application the case will be somewhat different.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to harbour works and fire stations.  I presume that is an indication that money is available for the development of harbours and the provision of fire stations.  At the moment we have a particular problem in Galway in relation to a harbour and the protection of that harbour from fire.  A recommendation was sent to the Department that a sum of approximately £140,000 should be made available for the provision of fire protection facilities in the event of an accident at Galway docks.  The response we got from the Department was not the type of response for which I would look.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle emphasised that this is a very limited Bill.  It is merely an enabling measure to raise the statutory limit on issues from the fund which provides the mechanism for channelling funds to local authorities.  It has no implication for the amount of funds to be allocated for the various schemes financed from the fund. Those are matters for Government decision.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Bill provides for an increase of £1 billion. This, as Deputy Tully pointed out, would be sufficient for five years at the present rate of issue.  However, since it is likely that the rate of issues will continue to increase, it will almost certainly be necessary to raise the limit again in less than five years.  This does not present any difficulty and Deputies need have no fear that the limit applicable to the fund, has, or will have, implications for programmes financed from the fund.</P>
      <P>As to the statement that I misled the House in the reference in my Second Reading speech to the increased provision for housing, I should like to strongly refute that allegation.  I said, as Deputies will recall, that the increase in issues from the fund in recent years reflects an increased provision for local authority housing, including the house purchase loans.  Issues from the Local Loans Fund for housing in fact increased by 22 per cent in 1979 over 1978, when the limit was last raised, and by a further 30 per cent in 1980.  The amount for house purchase loans actually increased by 123 per cent in 1979 and 50 per cent in 1980.</P>

As regards house completions I should like to point out that Deputy Fitzpatrick was selective in his statistics.  The fact is that the National Coalition could not afford to continue to build 8,800 local authority houses as they did in 1975.  Under their stewardship completions dropped to 6,300 in 1977.  Since then the programme has been maintained at a steady level of 6,000 to 6,200 per year.  About 6,000 houses will be built this year.  Those who level the criticism at us that we are not continuing to build that number of houses annually should bear that statement in mind.</P>

      <P>The number of new house loans approved so far in 1980 does not support the Deputy's view that housing starts and completions will collapse next year.  Regarding housing capital, the allocation for housing in 1980 at £202.53 <Col N="882" /> million represents an increase of 20 per cent on the expenditure of £169.04 million in 1979.  In addition, in real terms the allocation shows an increase of 31 per cent on 1977.  In contrast, capital expenditure decreased by 57 per cent in real terms between 1975 and 1977.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to SDA loans and I should like to point out to him that when he was Minister the SDA loans and the income limits remained unchanged between September 1973 and June 1977 despite the fact that house prices and earnings more than doubled during that period.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell the House that 4,800 loans were advanced in 1977 and that this year more than 7,000 loans will be paid.  Deputies may wish to note that the trends in house prices since 1973 indicate that there is a close correspondence between the increases in house prices and the average earnings of adult male workers, taking into account the general improvement in standards of privately built houses.  In addition, Deputies are aware that the <Col N="883" /> introduction of the £1,000 new house grant and the building society subsidy this year were of considerable help to house purchasers.</P>
      <P>As far as the building industry generally is concerned, the recent decision to provide additional capital for the 1980 Public Capital Programme is an indication of the Government's commitment in this regard.  Of the £97 million provided, £66 million will be related to expenditure affecting the building industry.  The Government are committed to the objective of the maintenance of the December 1979 level of employment up to the end of 1981.  In contrast the building industry was allowed to collapse between 1974 and 1976.  Public capital expenditure affecting the industry declined by 4.5 per cent in 1974.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the subhead which deals with the money required for the hiring of boats for the carrying out of additional surveys of herring in the Celtic Sea and I raised the query as to what aid we are getting from the EEC to carry out such surveys.  It is obvious that people are fishing to a very large extent in the Celtic Sea and, for that matter, in the seas right around our coasts.  What are they putting back into the fishing industry in this country?  Are they contributing to the cost of surveys such as the one referred to in the Estimate before us today?  I seem to have a contradiction in this regard between Mr. Eamonn Gallagher in Brussels and the previous Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Lenihan.  Mr. Gallagher told me that assistance for surveys would be forthcoming if an application were made by the Irish Government, but the previous Minister said that he had never made such an application and had no <Col N="885" /> intention of doing so.  Would the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry tell us if he has sought any EEC aid?  Obviously we know very little about the potential of the fishery grounds within the 200-mile limit, particularly in the outer band of that extensive limit, and we would need very extensive finance to carry out the survey. It would be covering an enormous area.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister also if we have any data from the countries who at present are fishing those waters and who are also members of the EEC, specifically the French and the Dutch.  I can add also the Spaniards who, although not members of the EEC, have traditional rights in our waters and those rights have not been extinguished, although I believe there is some talk that they may be eliminated completely.  Have we been receiving data from the French, Dutch and Spanish as to what stocks we have and where those stocks are situated?  As I have said, these people know more about the fishing grounds within our fishery limits and the species contained therein than we ourselves know because they have been fishing them for decades past, maybe generations past, and we, by our very nature, have been inshore fishermen and are not in a position to be conversant with what is available 50 or 100 miles out, especially off the south and south-west coast where these people operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The state of the herring stocks is a cause for great concern and we must face up to the fact that conversation measures will have to be taken in the Celtic Sea. However, what gripes the Irish fishermen at the moment is that, while there is a ban on herring fishing in the Celtic Sea, it is well known that the Dutch are catching enormous quantities of herring under the pretext of fishing for mackerel.  It is all very well to carry out a survey and to know what stocks are there, but what is the point if these stocks are to be wiped out by Dutch trawlers fishing on a vast scale?  When will a stop be put to this illegal fishing?  This herring fishing is being done illegally not alone in the Celtic Sea but also in the North Sea.  The heading on last Monday's <i>Irish Independent</i> reads. &ldquo;EEC Powerless to Enforce Herring Laws&rdquo;.  That refers to the fact <Col N="886" /> that, while there is a herring ban in the North Sea also, the French fishing fleet are fishing out those stocks indiscriminately at the moment and they are being landed blatantly at French ports and no prosecution has been brought against the large French trawlers doing this fishing at present.  What is the point in allowing this blatant breaking of EEC fishery laws? Why has Ireland not objected when we ourselves have prosecuted our own fishermen for breaking the herring ban in the Celtic Sea?  A number of small boat fishermen on the south coast have been prosecuted within the past two years and those court cases are still pending.  How in justice can we prosecute men who are fishing from boats as small as 15 and 20 feet long when French boats of 120 or 150 feet in length are fishing grounds where there is a herring ban in the North Sea?  How can we justify that type of discrimination against our own fishermen? We were hauled before the European Court very quickly over the conservation measures we introduced in 1976, but now the French are breaking the rules on a much greater scale and no action has been taken.  Why is the law not being enforced in an equitable manner?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there should be a limited amount of herring fishing in the Celtic Sea by the small boat owners, the traditional drift net fishermen who have been doing this type of fishing for generations past, whose fishing effort is so limited that it is not affecting the stocks in any manner.  Stocks of fish need a certain amount of fishing if they are to remain virile and strong and resistant to disease.  They need to be fished to a certain extent.  If you want an ailing, decadent fish stock, the thing to do is leave it there untouched and it will get every type of disease going.  A certain amount of fishing is desirable and necessary and if it can be done without major damage to the fish stocks then it should be allowed. I am advocating that the inshore drift net fishermen on the south coast should be allowed to continue to drift net for herring in the Celtic Sea.  I think that the Minister wants to support that idea but he has not got the assistance of his colleagues in the Council of Ministers.  I ask <Col N="887" /> the Minister to keep on pressing for a limited opening of the Celtic Sea.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I represent about 500 fishermen who are involved in this type of limited fishing, limited because drift netting by its very nature is relatively harmless in that you can catch only a very limited amount of fish.  These people have no other source of income during the winter months.  Their boats are not big enough to go trawling.  I appeal to the Minister to allow them to fish on this scale, particularly as the French and Dutch are doing it on a much larger scale and they are getting away with it.  I feel that these men are quite justified in pursuing the only livelihood they know.  If they are to meet repayments on boats and gear they must fish whether they are breaking the law or not.  Having said that about the survey referred to in the Estimate I should like to go back to the subsection which deals with Bord lascaigh Mhara under the heading administration and current development.</P>
    <P>BIM was set up for a number of specific functions one of which was boat building. That function has been eliminated. Another one was marketing.  In this area they have proved to be a colossal failure. What affects Irish fishing more than anything else at present is the state of the market.  In many cases the market is nonexistent and, at times, fishermen have had to come back to port and dump their catch.  In many cases they were prime species such as plaice and sole.  What are BIM doing to allow fishermen to sell their catch?</P>
    <P>Fishermen are getting as little as they got five or six years ago for their fish whereas the cost of fuel and gear and repayments on boats have soared.  If the price of fish has not remained static it has actually gone down.  In many cases fishermen cannot sell their fish.  What are BIM doing to set up a proper marketing service?  They seem to be failing badly in this regard.  The Government have also failed in that fish imports are allowed into this country.  It is likely that these are from third countries or, if not, they are illegally caught fish in the North Sea. Herring can hardly be sold here because <Col N="888" /> of the glut on the Continent and the reason for that is that fishing is taking place in the North Sea herring fishery illegally.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address himself to the problem of marketing.  It is the whole basis of any industry.  What is the point in producing if one is not able to sell? There is a loss of confidence in the industry particularly where small boats are concerned.  The Minister will say we are catching as much as ever and that the value of the catch went up in 1979 according to the BIM report issued today.  That may be true to an extent but in real terms the value of the catch has not gone up.  In the report we are told that the value of the catch in 1979 was £35.4 million in comparison with £32.8 million in 1978.</P>

      <P>If we remove the actual catch of mackerel from that total the real statistics of the fish catch for 1979 would make pretty miserable reading.  That is due to the fact that BIM and successive Governments must take responsibility for failing in their efforts to develop the fishing industry along the right lines. They have failed in their marketing policies.</P>
      <P>I know a man who set up a processing industry in Dunmore East last year.  He was smoking mackerel and herring and it was just about the best product one ever tasted.

      <P>It is time we had a complete overhaul of the board of BIM.  Why are people appointed to that board?  What qualifications have they got?  Is it a fact that some are appointed on the basis of political patronage?  Is it not time that the Irish fishing industry was the master of its own destiny and had a say in what was happening?  Fishermen tell me they are given a very poor hearing when they go <Col N="890" /> to BIM to discuss a project, the purchase of a boat or a processing industry they wish to set up.  They put this down to lack of acumen in fishery matters within the board.  The fishermen want their representatives to be the main constituents of that board.  The day of putting political hacks on boards should be long gone. Unfortunately this still continues.  I should like to see those who catch fish, process and sell it represented on the the board of BIM.  There should not be anybody else on it except those actively engaged in the industry.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to inland fishery development.  The additional sum required includes £50,000 for the purchase of two fishery patrol boats for use in the Kerry and Waterford fishery districts. I have the greatest sympathy with the staff of the boards of conservators because they have to work in dreadful conditions and under the worst possible terms of employment.  Their jobs are neither pensionable nor permanent.  The expenses they receive for using their own transport are pitiful and they are subject to all kinds of abuse and assaults as we read in the newspapers.  Any assistance that can be given to these people by way of providing better equipment will have my full support.  They are people who deserve a better deal.  They were promised a better deal under the reconstituted boards of conservators, the regional boards as they have been called.  Could the Minister say when these regional boards take effect?   Have the 17 old boards of conservators actually been abolished and have the seven new regional boards been set up?  Headquarters were named in various parts of the country for these new boards.  Is the physical structure now there?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather interesting that the Minister <Col N="891" /> should mention Kerry and Waterford fishery districts because those two areas are places that have been heavily discriminated against in inland fishery matters over the years.  I do not think there is stricter surveillance in any district than in the Waterford district.  One could not attempt to break the law there without being apprehended because the staff are on top of their job with the result that fishermen in that district are the most law-abiding in the state.  If the Minister looks up the number of breaches of law that have have taken place over the years he will find there have been fewer in the Waterford district than in any other.  I am appalled to find that an order made last week by the Minister reduced the number of drift net licences in the Waterford district by 38.  The total over the whole country was reduced by 100 but why did he have to reduce the Waterford number by 38?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not relevant here; it is not covered by any heading in the Supplementary Estimate. There is nothing under inland fisheries except provision for two fishery boats. On a supplementary estimate a Deputy may not raise any matter only that which is provided for in the estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Drift net licences have been reduced by 38 and the number of draft net licences by three.  The loss of these 41 licences would probably mean 100 or more put out of work.  This is not fair.  It obviously deprives that many people of the right to earn a living.  That is disgraceful.  I should like the Minister to re-examine the basis of his order if there is any basis for it.  Licensed fishermen have been a credit to the industry.  They are the people most concerned about conserving stocks and keeping the rules and invariably they do that.  I have always objected to the fact that there is so much unlicensed fishing principally along the west coast by trawlers using five or six miles of net.  This type of fishing is still going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not dwell on the point unduly but I must protest that Waterford has been dealt with unfairly in this matter in that the number of licences taken off is disproportionate to those in other districts.</P>
      <P>We welcome of course any supplementary estimate but I cannot say that I am happy with the state of the fishing industry. There is money there to improve harbours and that is welcome.  There is money for sea fisheries development, money for BIM, money for inland fishery development but overall the state of the fishery industry gives rise to considerable concern.  I hope the Minister will refer to the high incidence of pollution in rivers which is causing so many fish kills and doing untold damage to large stretches of river such as the Funcheon and the Gradogue and the Suir as well as many lakes in the central and northern parts of the country.  It was a great mistake, and I said so at the time in the Seanad, that when the Water Pollution Bill 1976 came into being its administration was left in the hands of local authorities.  I maintain that the fishery boards should control that legislation because they are the natural people to look after our waterways.  My contention at that time has proved correct.</P>
      <P>It is not too late to change.  There will never be proper control of water pollution unless it is connected with matters pertaining to fisheries.  The Minister should give serious consideration to that point.  The pollution of our rivers is continuous and increasing and until somebody with a vested interest gets into this field of operation the position will worsen.  The only people with a vested interest and real concern are those making a living from fishing, those whose raw material are the salmon and trout going up those rivers, people who have representatives on the fishery boards.  Control of waterways and of pollution should be under the aegis of these boards and nobody else.  The local authorities that have been given control in this matter are themselves the greatest polluters.</P>

      <P>They are swearing aloud. They are certainly not praying for the Minister at present and will not be praying for him.  We feel that a little bit of muscle and political clout is necessary in fishery matters in particular at the Council of Ministers in Brussels and we feel that has not been forthcoming, with the result that the Irish fishing industry is going downhill; the small boat fishermen especially are getting a raw deal.  We depend on the Minister for Fisheries to stand up for these people but unfortunately that has not happened.  I am asking the Minister to acquaint himself with the problems, to go down to meet them and help them to solve their problems, to get markets for them, to stop imports from third countries which are ruining their livelihood.  If these problems were tackled properly by the Minister he would ensure a prosperous future for people who work so hard.</P>

      <P>The first point that must be made is that the fishing industry is in chaos.  From a reply by the Minister to a parliamentary question on 26 November last I learned that 65 per cent of trawler owners are in arrears with payments to BIM.  That is a shocking indictment of the way our fishermen are being treated. Everyone knows the enormous cost of diesel oil and the low prices for fish. Things are getting tougher and rougher for our fishermen.  I hope the Minister will use all the muscle he has &mdash; and he has plenty of it &mdash; at Cabinet meetings to arrange for the payment of a subsidy on diesel oil for our fishermen to give them a chance once again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly raise matters here and if this House does not wish to hear me the House can put me out.  It is as simple as that.  I have very strong views on the state of the fishing industry. I have strong views on the fact that the Celtic Sea has been closed for so long.  I have very strong views that Dutch factory ships can catch all the fish they like out there without being monitored in any way by officials of the Department of Fisheries or any other Department.  The personnel of the monitoring staff have not got the clothing to go down into the deep freeze section of those factory ships and inspect the catches.  I am concerned because our fishermen have not the right to land fish at all ports in their own country and I am concerned at the lack of control of imports of fish from third countries. This has caused 65 per cent of our trawler fishermen to be in arrears to BIM.</P>
      <P>Coming from a seafaring county I am concerned that the Inland Fisheries Trust, which is dealt with in Subhead E and which will cost about £415,000, can allow one of the boards, in Galway, to meet and that the press were not allowed to attend the meeting.  I am sure the Minister is concerned, because if decisions are to be taken concerning our inland fisheries it is only right that the press should be present to report the proceedings.  It is very wrong that a board set up by the State can exclude the press from meetings.  I hope this will be corrected immediately.  Some of the board members are elected representatives.</P>
      <P>I tabled a number of questions in recent weeks and I cannot understand how I could have been given so much inaccurate information.  I am so concerned about the whole issue, particularly in relation to the sale of boatyards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £49,350,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet increased expenditure arising from the payment of a double week to recipients of certain social welfare pensions and allowances in December 1980, increases of salaries, wages and allowances, an upward trend in the numbers claiming under various schemes and a shortfall in contribution income from employers and employees under the pay-related social welfare insurance system in <Col N="899" /> the current year.  The increases arise on all three sections of the Social Welfare Vote for the current year, namely, administration, social insurance and social assistance.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate, which was passed by the House in April last, was for the sum of £353,685,000.  A Supplementary Estimate for £90,200,000 was passed by the House in June last.  The reason for taking the Supplementary Estimate at that time was the exceptional cost of continuing the October 1979 rates of payment throughout 1980 and of increasing long-term payments by 25 per cent and short-term payments by 20 per cent from April 1980.  It was apparent that there would not have been sufficient voted moneys available to the Department to meet these costs during the period that the House was in recess.  The sum of £90,200,000 was the estimated cost of the increases in rates of payments and other improvements in social welfare services provided in the 1980 budget.  The present Estimate is for a sum of £49,350,000 which brings total Exchequer spending on the services administered by my Department in the current year to £493,235,000.</P>
    <P>This sum represents an increase of £139,550,000, or almost 40 per cent on the amount provided in the original Estimate for 1980 passed by this House.  Of this amount £65,476,000 is in respect of assistance services and £74,074,000 in respect of insurance services.  In this connection I should point out that so far as insurance services are concerned the Exchequer's contribution to the cost of such services will have increased to 26.4 per cent of the total cost as compared with 20.1 per cent in 1979.  The total cost of the assistance services is borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I think that it will be agreed that an additional provision of this magnitude in 1980 is a clear indication of the Government's concern for the weaker sections of the community.  Even in these times of financial stringency the Government have willingly honoured their commitment to protect social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The increased expenditure of <Col N="900" /> £139,550,000 arises from a number of factors.  There is, for example, a sum of £25,859,000 to cover the cost of continuing throughout 1980 the increased rates of payment granted in October 1979 as part of the 1979 National Understanding. Deputies will recall that these increases were deemed to be of a temporary nature and were due to end at 31 March 1980. The Government decided, however, to continue them on a permanent basis.  Not only were the increased rates continued but further increases of 25 per cent on all long-term payments and 20 per cent on all short-term payments were provided with effect from April 1980 at a cost to the Exchequer of £55,341,000 in 1980.  As a further indication of their concern for the family the Government also provided increases in children's allowances in 1980 at a cost of £9,000,000.  A sum of £880,000 was provided to cover the additional cost of the new national fuel scheme introduced in October 1980 and the cost of increasing the value of fuel vouchers by 33.3 per cent.  This brings the total expenditure on the free fuel schemes to £5 million as compared with £2,900,000 in 1979.</P>
    <P>The Government's concern for the weaker sections of the community is further evidenced by the fact that I have had legislation enacted providing for a Christmas bonus double-week payment for recipients of long-term social welfare payments at a cost of £8,685,000.  A similar bonus payment is being made to recipients of certain health allowances such as disabled persons' maintenance allowances, infectious diseases maintenance allowances, constant care allowances and blind welfare allowances at a cost to the Department of Health of £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the time available to me Deputies will forgive me for not detailing all the items which go to make up the additional sum of £139,550,000 being provided for social welfare in 1980. However, the examples which I have just given should be sufficient to show that the Government, despite the economic difficulties, are doing everything they can to ease the lot of the weaker sections of the community.  I propose, however, to <Col N="901" /> give Deputies particulars of the items which make up the present Supplementary Estimate of £49,350,000 which I am now asking the House to approve.</P>
    <P>Under the sections for administration &mdash; subheads A to D &mdash; the net additional expenditure amounts to £1,721,120.  This derives from increases amounting to £1,235,000 on subhead A.1 in respect of salaries, wages and allowances; £40,000 on subhead A.2 in respect of increased computerisation; £286,000 on subhead B.1 in respect of increased travelling and incidental expenses and £195,000 on subhead C in respect of an increase in the cost of Post Office services.  These increases are offset by a small saving of £34,880 on subhead D in respect of an adjustment in the cost of insured persons' medical certificates.</P>
    <P>The additional expenditure on Social Insurance &mdash; subheads E and F &mdash; amounts to £41,146,000 which is the result of an increase of £41,161,000 on subhead E (Social Insurance Fund) offset by a small saving of £15,000 on subhead F (Investment Return).  The extra amount required for Social Assistance &mdash; subheads G to L &mdash; is £8,063,000.  The overall increase on the three sections comes to £50,930,120.  There is, however, an increase of £1,580,120 in the receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash; subhead M &mdash; which serves to reduce the net additional requirement to £49,350,000.</P>
    <P>The sum of £41,161,000 required for subhead E is the additional amount payable by the Exchequer to the social insurance fund to meet the deficit on the working of the fund.  The gross cost of the extra week's payment in December to receipients of contributory pensions and allowances is £5,282,000.  There is also an increased expenditure of £34,756,000 arising mainly from an upward trend in the numbers claiming during the year. The main constituents of this sum are £18,985,000 in respect of unemployment benefit; £9,495,000 in respect of pay-related benefit; £3,282,000 in respect of old age contributory pensions, and in the case of pay-related benefit there is a further sum of £1,105,000 arising from the raising of the income limit from £5,500 per annum to £7,000 per annum from <Col N="902" /> April, 1980.  Increased provision of £3,560,000 is also being made in respect of disability benefit.  This is due partly to increased numbers claiming disability benefit in the early part of the year and partly due to the fact that the transfer of recipients to invalidity pensions was fewer than expected.  The total of these increases is £36,427,000 but variations from the original estimates in the remaining schemes had the effect of reducing this figure by £1,671,000.</P>
    <P>On the income side there has been a deficiency of £8 million in the receipts from contributions payable by employers and employees while there has been a deficiency of £123,000 in other items of income.  The deficit in contribution income is attributed to the difficulty experienced in making an accurate estimate of the amount of such income which might have been expected in 1980.  Experience of the amount collected in a previous year would normally form the basis of calculation when making such estimates. However, collection in 1979 was affected by the postal dispute in that year. The deficiencies on the income side increased the deficit on the fund by £48,161,000.  Receipt of final cash accounts from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of 1979 showed that there had been an overdraw of £7 million from the Exchequer at 31 December 1979.  After making allowance for this sum the additional amount payable by the Exchequer this year to the Social Insurance Fund is £41,161,000.</P>
    <P>Regarding the overdraw of £7 million, the position is that final draws must be made each year on an estimated basis because actual figures of expenditure and income are not available until after the close of the year.  As already stated, the actual outturn on the fund for the financial year ended 31 December 1979 indicated that the sum of £7 million had been overdrawn from the Exchequer at that date.  Accordingly, the revised Exchequer contribution for the current year, as now estimated under subhead E, is being reduced by that amount.</P>
    <P>The additional expenditure required in the Supplementary Estimate for social assistance amounts to £8,063,000.  This <Col N="903" /> additional expenditure has arisen mainly from the payment of a double week's pension or allowance to recipients in December 1980 at a cost of £3,403,000 and from a carry-over of expenditure on children's allowances from 1979 amounting to £3,100,000 in respect of the payday which fell on 1 January 1980, which was a public holiday.</P>
    <P>It was expected that most of the payments due on that day would be cashed on the previous day and fall into the 1979 year.  However, many recipients deferred cashing their allowance orders until after 1 January resulting in a carry-over of expenditure into 1980.  The balance of £1,560,000 is the net sum required to meet increases of £1,458,000 on supplementary welfare allowances; £800,000 on free electricity; £597,000 on unemployment assistance; £420,000 on widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions and increases under various schemes totalling £406,000.  These increases were offset by savings on certain schemes totalling £2,121,000, which was made up of £1 million on old age non-contributory pensions, due to a fall in numbers claiming; £800,000 on free fuel, due to an over-estimation of the numbers likely to avail of the scheme; £265,000 on free television licences and £56,000 on social assistance allowances.</P>
    <P>The surplus of £1,580,120 in Appropriations-in-Aid arises mainly from the increase in the amount of the administration costs of the Social Insurance and Occupational Injuries Schemes which have to be refunded from the Social Insurance and Occupational Injuries Funds.</P>
    <P>As I have stated already, this Supplementary Estimate, for an additional sum of £49,350,000, is required to meet the cost of the double week's payment in December and to meet other excesses on the original Estimates which could not have been foreseen when they were being prepared.  Deputies may be interested to note that overall expenditure on social insurance and social assistance services will amount to more than £897 million this year, which is an increase of £217 million or 32 per cent on 1979.  Expenditure <Col N="904" /> in a full year at current rates will amount to some £970 million.</P>
    <P>I have now covered the principal matters affecting this Supplementary Estimate. I shall be pleased to furnish any further information which Deputies may require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The occasion of this Supplementary Estimate gives us the opportunity of reviewing what has been happening during the past few months in the Department of Social Welfare.  In conjunction with my remarks I should like to refer also to a document which we received by post this morning from the Minister of State.  I am glad that the Minister of State is here to take note of anything that may be said about that document.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, and also last year on the occasion also of a Supplementary Estimate for this Department, some serious complaints were made about the way in which the Department operate and about the lack of attention that was being paid to that Department by the Minister's predecessor.  However, I am glad to be able to say that the present holder of the office appears to pay more attention to the Department than was the case so far as his predecessor was concerned.  Having said that, I must point out that the majority of those who deal with this Department are very unhappy about the way in which the Department operate.  I do not know whether the document we received this morning was intended to be an attempt to ward off any attack that might otherwise be made on the Department this evening, but if that was the intention it will not have been successful so far as I am concerned.  Though the situation may not be as bad as it was last year, I continue to receive many complaints of delays in payments.  I am not prepared to accept the reasons for such delays as outlined in the document that we have just received from the Minister of State.  However, I shall come back to this matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much publicity has been given to the extra week's payment to certain categories of social welfare recipients for the Christmas period.  This is a very welcome <Col N="905" /> step.  I was one of those who advocated first the making of such extra payment to help these people at Christmas time and I am very glad that the Minister has at least seen the need for such payment. But we should all be happier if this extra week's money could be extended to a number of other categories.  It will not be payable, for instance, to those in receipt of supplementary welfare allowances, allowances that are paid by the health boards.  Many of those in receipt of these allowances are deserted wives, unmarried mothers or unemployed people. There can be much delay on the part of the Department in dealing with cases of deserted wives or of unmarried mothers. In many instances these people are dealt with at a much slower pace than the unemployed.  Many of them can be on supplementary welfare allowance for a considerable time, but despite that, they are not entitled to the extra week's payment at Christmas.</P>
    <P>It is getting very close to Christmas but even today the Minister could extend this payment to those people.  If he does that this year he could deal with the other categories another year.  I realise that when we embark on a new scheme like this it cannot be given right across the board at once, but it is a step in the right direction and I appeal to the Minister at this late stage to extend it to the people I mentioned.  Old age pensioners, deserted wives and unmarried mothers, who are long-term, get the extra week's payment but those on supplementary welfare allowance are excluded.</P>
    <P>I must take this opportunity to refer to the free fuel scheme.  The Minister said there had been a saving of £800,000 because of an over-estimation.  How did this happen?  It is very strange that the sum should have been wrong to the extent of £800,000 because there are many people who could benefit from that scheme.  Even after the improvements were introduced, I can only describe this scheme as a farce.  Many of the anomalies which existed before the Minister interfered with it still exist.  We have been pleading for a number of years for a blanket free fuel scheme for certain categories in all areas.  At present people <Col N="906" /> living in 17 areas do not have to undergo a means test but this does not apply to the rest of the country.  The Minister got a considerable amount of publicity when he introduced the new free fuel scheme. Basically he increased the allowance from £1.50 to £2 per week and vouchers can be used to provide other kinds of heat &mdash; electricity, gas and so on &mdash; besides turf.  That was a slight improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Thousands of extra people were included.  That is how it is national.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was far short of what we expected and what we had been promised by the Minister's predecessor.  As I said, the means test still exists for those outside the 17 areas.  There were bitter complaints by Members from all sides of this House, including Fianna Fáil, about this anomaly.  People living outside those areas are helped by the health boards but it is extremely difficult to get this assistance. Now the Minister made it a little easier for the people outside the 17 areas to benefit from this scheme.</P>
      <P>If a person living outside the 17 areas draws his pension at a post office in one of the 17 areas he is entitled to free fuel, although his neighbour living alone near the boundary and drawing his pension is not entitled to it.  It all depends on where a person draws his pension.  If a person lives outside the area he has to prove that he is in dire straits before he can benefit from this scheme.  I regret the Minister did not remove this anomaly and I ask him to have another look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any benefit expected from the improvement in this scheme has been wiped out by the massive increases in the cost of heating fuel.  When the Minister made his announcement bottled gas cost £3.45; it now costs over £5.  Many people use their fuel vouchers to pay for bottled gas.  I do not have to tell the Minister about the increase in coal prices.  People living on social welfare payments have been hit very hard, particularly in the last month, when we had freezing days and it was impossible to be without heating for even one hour of the day.  People in receipt of the free fuel allowance cannot <Col N="907" /> afford to spend extra money from their meagre incomes to supplement home heating.  For many of them this is a matter of life and death.  I urge the Minister to increase the free fuel allowance to £5.  He should not consider anything less because anything less would not even keep pace with the increase in the price of heating. Again I ask the Minister to look at this before these people die from lack of heat.</P>
    <P>I had a case of an old age pensioner with a small income, besides his pension, of £8 a month.  Because of that he was not entitled to benefit from the free fuel scheme.  In my view that is cutting it very fine.  Perhaps we might hear some words of hope from the Minister that would bring relief to those people shivering at present.</P>
    <P>The other matter with which I wanted to deal was the document we received this morning.  Actually I think it is a laugh.  The Minister went to some lengths to ensure that we had this document in our hands before this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of information, that was totally coincidental.  I will deal with it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I suppose it is just as well we have the document. Otherwise we would have taken it for granted that the Minister was dealing with the complaints we have been making in social welfare debates throughout the year and indeed also this time last year. In a way I am sorry I have got this document because I thought the complaints coming to me were lessening, that the matter was being tackled.  The Minister, through his Minister of State, has indicated to us that he is fairly happy with the situation.  I do not think he has reason to be happy with the situation because there are still delays occurring in the Department of Social Welfare that should not take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>

    <Col N="908" />
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well the Minister of State must have been fairly happy to have given us this three or four-page document this morning.  We know that most Government Departments do not work at high speed.  We accept delays in many instances such as the processing of income tax rebates and so on.  People in those categories can accept a reasonable delay.  But every effort should be made by the Government, the Minister and his Minister of State to ensure that such delays are reduced to a minimum in the Department of Social Welfare, because it is an area that cannot afford them. Indeed we should be ashamed that such delays occur.  Some of the excuses given here by the Minister of State are that the PRSI number or that the insurance number is not included in applications.  With computerisation one or other of those number should immediately provide access to an applicant's file and all the necessary information.  Particularly bearing in mind our postal service it should not be necessary for the Department to write back to an applicant or for an applicant to have to go into the Department with the relevant number.</P>
      <P>There are several other complaints I should like to voice in the limited time at my disposal.  Applicants experience great difficulty sorting out their problem on the telephone.  One person told me recently that it necessitated four telephone calls from a coin box to finish one conversation because of the enormous delays within the Department.  Indeed I still receive complaints that the Department lose certificates, even those handed in to the Department.  I have had several such instances in recent weeks.  Therefore the Minister can be anything but happy with the situation obtaining.  Indeed I see very little improvement in the situation compared with 1979 when we had the excuse of the postal strike, something the Minister cannot resort to today.  There is something seriously wrong in the Department and the sooner it is sorted out the better it will be for public representatives but more particularly those who benefit from their payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary <Col N="909" /> Estimate before the House affords us an opportunity of discussing many aspects of the Department of Social Welfare. Indeed we should look at the Department's activities overall and the social welfare services provided for the less-well-off section of our society.  We would all agree that our social welfare benefits at present are the lowest in Europe.  We are very far down in the league, an area which must be given priority by any Government having the interests of the people at heart.  Our children's allowances are really very bad.  They make no provision for helping families in need, families with large numbers of children.  Belgium provides ten times our amount of children's allowances.  Granted Belgium is at the top of the European league but the others provide at least four times our amount.  That is a terrible indictment of us as a people apart from the Government.</P>
      <P>Overall our services are very circumscribed and need expansion.  We must examine this carefully.  I would hope the Minister for Social Welfare would seek to expand these services in the forthcoming budget.  We have acquired the habit of saying: we provide too great an incentive for people not to work.  But remember we cannot talk about children working; we cannot talk about old age pensioners working nor can we talk about the disabled working.  All too often do we make them the scapegoats in situations such as that obtaining at present. Neither must we forget that 25 per cent of our population live at or below the poverty line and that the gap between the rich and poor is growing, is actually bigger now than it was at the beginning of this century.  This is one point we must make clear, that the gap between the rich and poor is greater than it was even in 1897.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a terrible indictment of the country that we do not face this fact.  I know the present Minister is terribly concerned about this.  I pay tribute to him because I know he is trying very hard to improve the social welfare services.  I would ask him to set up an all-party committee to examine the various facets of our social welfare services, to endeavour to see how <Col N="910" /> we might take them outside the political arena, examining the social welfare services in Europe, seeing how ours operate, making comparisons with those in operation in other European countries and seeing how we could improve them.  That is how we should aim at eliminating poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>Only by means of an expanded social welfare service can one eliminate poverty in our society.  First we should aim at linking the level of social welfare services to the consumer index.  That should be done automatically.  No government should lay claim to credit for linking them to the cost of living index.  In addition we should be seeking to increase our social welfare services by a percentage of the gross national product.  That should be done by the government in power in addition to the normal increase that would take place in line with the cost of living.  That is the basic premise on which our social welfare services should be operated.  That is the only way in which we can eliminate poverty from our society, poverty which affects 25 per cent of our population and that is an indictment of society in general.  We should aim at having a minimum income level for every household, taking into account the normal outgoings for rent, heating, and so on.  The Department should be examining this.  It is the only way to expand the social welfare services.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; service of the Department was intended to help to eliminate poverty.  Unfortunately, it has failed to do so.  The best intentions were expressed when Deputy Cluskey introduced it in this House.  We all agreed that it was badly wanted.  We intended it to work smoothly and efficiently.  Unfortunately, it is not working to the satisfaction of all concerned.  It is left in the hands of people who do not realise that their aim should be to help those in need.  It is operated in an arbitrary fashion.  The public do not know they have a right to appeal and they do not know the means by which they can appeal.  There is an urgent need to examine this whole supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I should like the Department to find out how we could make it operate.  We all <Col N="911" /> want it to work well and in the interests of those in need.  I would ask the Minister to please examine it.</P>
    <P>How soon can we talk seriously about pay-related pensions for our people?  This is the only country in the Community in which a pay-related pension scheme does not operate.  People are entitled to it at the end of their years of service to the country.  They should have a pension which would enable them to live a normal, dignified life.  The present old age pension is humiliating for a man at the end of his years of service.  I hope the Minister will work on this and come forward with clear, concrete proposals for a pay-related pension scheme.  I hope there will be a commitment that in 1981 this will be introduced.  If we do this, we can say we are serious about our social welfare services.</P>
    <P>I have the circular issued by the Minister of State, Deputy Nolan.  I was impressed by it.  It is a clear, honest attempt by a Minister to explain the difficulties and obstacles in the Department and how people can help to expedite claims.  I recognise the problems the Department face.  We should institute a proper publicity campaign explaining these matters to the people.  I know they quote wrong reference numbers but they do not understand.  Surely we should be able to use our national radio and television service to greater effect.</P>
    <P>There are some very worthy programmes on the radio, but greater attempts should be made to utilise the television service to explain these things. Many thousands of people avail of the services of the Department.  We could explain to them how they could make life easier for the officials of the Department. I can imagine their frustration in trying to deal with some people who give their telephone number by mistake.  Everyone in receipt of social welfare should have a special legible, plastic card.  It should be emphasised to them that they will need it any time they have a query.  They have these cards in other countries.  They have them in Europe.  Why have we not got them here?  People should understand that they are valuable and that they <Col N="912" /> should have them with them at all times. This would help to make the lives of the officials easier.  I know the work they do and I know how frustrating these things can be.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare gives us an opportunity to discuss various facets of the Department, and I should like to dwell on a few of them.  One is the deserted wives' allowance.  You cannot have a simple question in black and white with regard to an application for this allowance.  Through various circumstances some people are forced out of their homes.  They have to quit their homes because of harassment or intimidation.  I should like the Department to adopt a lenient attitude towards wives who are forced to leave home.  I have numerous instances of wives who had to leave their households.  Because they left rather than suffer further intimidation, or even serious assault, they have been deprived of the deserted wives' allowance.  Even though the husband has literally and legally deserted the wife, she does not comply with the conditions.</P>
    <P>If a doctor, or a priest, or somebody in authority writes a letter saying that the wife was forced to leave the household, that should be sufficient to provide the wife with an allowance.  I would ask the Department to please exercise a little more latitude in relation to this problem. Many applications for deserted wives' allowances have been rejected because, in the best interests of herself and her children, the wife was compelled to leave the household.  I make a special plea to the Minister and the Department to be a little more tolerant and lenient towards these girls.</P>
    <P>Many old people who qualify for free electricity are unaware of the number of units they are allowed and, indeed, the relevance of the units.  We could make their lives a little easier by explaining the scheme to them in greater detail.  These are old people who have not got the same sharp reaction as younger people.  The whole aim of the Department is to help these people.  If we took a little more trouble we would make life more tolerable for them.  They are afraid of using <Col N="913" /> too many units and having to face big bills.</P>
    <P>There is talk about people claiming social welfare and defrauding the system. We read a lot about that, but it is grossly exaggerated.  I accept that there are people who defraud the system.  I remember that extreme right winger in Britain, Sir Keith Joseph, saying when he was Minister for Health and Social Services that they had to accept that a certain percentage of people will defraud the system.  He said that the number of officials they would have to employ to eliminate that would far exceed the benefits to be gained.  All we can do is say to them in a publicity campaign that they are by their tactics making life a little more difficult for the people in need.  That is the only way we can overcome this problem.  We cannot have a whole police force operating from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of doctors and others who sign certificates is needed.  The position is farcical.  Doctors who sign such certificates are being given between 15p and 20p.  They sign certificates to the effect that they have examined the person concerned but we all know that nobody will examine a patient for 20p.  We must try to eliminate the farcical situation that exists in relation to the signing of social welfare certificates.  That must be done if the system is to operate in the best interests of the public in general and of the Department.  We must ensure that people who are not entitled to the benefits do not draw them.  There is no question of harassing such people but there must be some way of improving the system.</P>
    <P>The Department should have contingency funds available to deal with a situation like that which occurred two years ago when we experienced a very severe winter and quite a few people died of hypothermia.  We should be in a position to provide funds on an emergency basis to health boards so that the necessary requisites are given to such people to prevent those terrible tragedies.  I appeal to the Minister to provide such funds because I have no doubt we will see a repetition of that this coming winter.  The free fuel scheme is far from adequate. <Col N="914" /> The Department must have the funds to act with all haste to prevent such tragedies happening.</P>
    <P>Another area in urgent need of reform is in relation to death grants.  If the minister reads the conditions appertaining to that grant I am sure he will agree that they are totally unrealistic.  With the increase in longevity more people are living into their late seventies and eighties and by virtue of that their dependants do not qualify for the death grant.  It would not cost a lot to re-examine that matter and decide that once a person has a certain number of contributions over the years, not from 1970, that person's dependants are entitled to a death grant. That date should be eliminated because it disqualifies many people.  The Minister should re-examine this matter because of the increase in funeral expenses.  I do not believe a change in the scheme would impose an enormous burden on the State. If he alters the scheme the Minister would win the gratitude of many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention again the unsatisfactory method of endeavouring to discuss a big Department such as the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Health on a Supplementary Estimate where there is a restriction on time.  We do ourselves less than justice when we endeavour to discuss such Departments in this truncated fashion.  It was because of this restriction that I chose on the last occasion I spoke on a Supplementary Estimate to dwell on a specific topic and I shall dwell on one aspect of the Department of Social Welfare on this occasion. Last weekend protests of the staff of the National Committee to Combat Poverty were reported in the national newspapers. The staff were photographed carrying placards seeking the continuation of their jobs.  We were told that the Government did not propose to provide any further funding for that committee from the end of this financial year and that the existing staff had been served with redundancy notices.  That is a regrettable step on the part of the Government and it sits very uneasily with the Minister's profession of concern for the underprivileged. <Col N="915" /> It does not seem to correspond with his oft-repeated claim that the Government were going out of their way to cushion the effects of the ravages of inflation and unemployment on society.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain why there is a need for the staff of that committee to carry placards seeking a continuation of their jobs and complaining about redundancy notices having been served in view of the commitment of the Minister of State.  Deputy Nolan, in the House on 19 November.  The Minister for social Welfare was asked by Deputy O'Connell in the course of a parliamentary question on that date to state the number of advisory bodies set up by his Department.  Deputy Nolan stated that the only advisory body attached to his Department was the advisory committee on the development, operation and monitoring of a programme of pilot schemes to combat poverty.  He said the budgetary provision for this committee for 1980 was £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of a supplementary question on that day I asked the Minister if he would give an indication of the Department's future plans for that committee. The Minister of State said that the budget provision of £500,000 had been provided and that the advisory committee on the pilot scheme to combat poverty would have to make a report the same as any other committee.  That was not really an answer to my question and I asked a further supplementary.  I asked the Minister if there would be a provision in next year's Estimate for an allocation to that committee.  The Minister of State said that a further £80,000 was allocated this year.  The expenditure of the committee, he said, was in excess of £500,000.  He said that the EEC paid a grant of £235,000 towards the cost of the projects, something we were aware of.  The Minister then went on to say: &ldquo;Because of the importance of that type of work some moneys will be provided in the normal way&rdquo;.  I asked the Minister if that was an undertaking and he replied: &ldquo;I have said&rdquo;.  I stated that I considered that an important undertaking and I hoped the Minister realised the significance of it. <Col N="916" /> Deputy Quinn went on to ask whether there was an undertaking to continue the work of the pilot scheme and the Minister of State said he was not the Minister for Finance.  I pointed out to him that he may have an opportunity of being the Minister for Finance next month, and he may still have that opportunity.  The Minister of State went on to say: &ldquo;The Deputy will agree however that the advisory committee's work is important and the work will not be reduced in effectiveness&rdquo;.  I pointed out that that was an important undertaking.  That ended the exchanges.</P>
    <P>I took from those exchanges in the House that the Government intended to continue the combat poverty committee. I am giving the Minister an opportunity now to explain the Government's plans in relation to the continuation of that committee.  I am sure his explanation will be welcomed by all those who have a genuine concern for the long-term eradication of poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>There has been reference also to the operation of the so-called new National Fuel Scheme throughout the country and the additional moneys necessary for that scheme.  I am becoming increasingly concerned at the anomalies that have begun to develop in that so-called national scheme, which implies by its title a standardisation. Under the scheme a voucher of £2 per week for 30 weeks, or £60 in any one year, is given to qualified people. However, the Minister had no sooner announced that scheme than he discovered that certain health boards had been operating fuel schemes of greater value than his.  For instance, the Western Health Board had been supplying people in their area with one ton of coal or two tons of turf, to the value of £90, per winter. The Minister wrote to such authorities telling them they could continue with their scheme.  Immediately an anomaly arises inasmuch as such health boards are permitted to continue with their scheme while other health boards under the Minister's scheme give less benefit to recipients.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult to follow the trend of this.  Apparently the fuel scheme that has operated in the 14 cities and towns throughout the country for the last 30 <Col N="917" /> years or so is to be continued in operation. I would welcome the Minister's clarification on this.  If that is the case it would appear that the people who live in those designated cities and towns are to continue to be given the benefit of the fuel scheme irrespective of income and not on a means-tested basis.  The people who live in the Western Health Board counties are to be given a fuel scheme equivalent to £90 per year and the people who live in the rest of the country outside the designated cities and towns and the Western Health Board designated area are to be given the Minister's national fuel scheme.  At that stage one begins to wonder how many component parts there are to that nationalised fuel scheme.  All the talk in this House over the last three years and the amount of effort made on the part of Deputies here to bring about a standardisation so that every necessitious person would be given the same benefit towards the cost of home heating over the winter months, has been useless if now at least three different types of schemes operate within the country, one of them not means-tested, two of them means-tested but paying out different amounts.  On the eve of Christmas I appeal to this Minister, as we had to do for so very long to his predecessor, to introduce a standardised national fuel scheme whereby everybody who is entitled to benefit gets the same amount of benefit at the same time as everybody else.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the Minister's speech I have a criticism which is an accounting one rather than a criticism of the Government's approach to social welfare. I do not accept that at the end of any financial year a postal strike that has finished five or six months before the end of the financial year can be given as the cause of writing away gaily a £7 million overdraw.  It is a bad reflection upon the Minister responsible at the time and, I regret to say, upon his officials and those they were dealing with in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, that there should have been an overdraw during the last financial year of £7 million which is reflected now in the Estimate here and <Col N="918" /> has to be provided for within the Supplementary Estimate.  To throw up the wellworn excuse that the postal strike which ended six months before the financial year was over is not good enough.  I regret having to make that criticism of the Department.  The Minister referred to this and I think that my criticism is a fair one.  I do not think that I am the only one to feel that way in relation to this accounting effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought today to have a private notice question dealt with by the Minister for Social Welfare.  It was to ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he will take steps to ensure that adequate funds are made available to the National Committee on Private Schemes to Combat Poverty to enable them to continue their work and to withdraw protective notice of their intention to terminate the employment of their staff at the end of this month.  You, Sir, ruled that I could not proceed with the private notice question and one of the reasons you gave was that I could avail of this very limited debate, and that is the course I am taking now.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare is a very wide-ranging Department and one could talk at considerable length of the inadequacies of the ministerial input into that Department, but I will confine myself, as I have only ten minutes, to dealing with the subject matter of the private notice question, the National Committee to Combat Poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this society somewhere between 20 and 25 per cent of our population are in the category of poverty.  It is not relative poverty.  It has been defined as people who have not sufficient food or clothing, who have inadequate housing and who also by virtue of their economic circumstances are deprived of many of the benefits normally available to other citizens who are better fixed economically.  The amount of money relative to the total Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare is infinitesimal, therefore money could not be the reason why the Department are terminating the activities of this committee and have placed them in a position where their staff of some 70 are <Col N="919" /> now under notice and will finish to all intents and purposes the work of that committee.</P>
    <P>Two things are clear and must be made increasingly clear.  First, the national committee were established in their own right to do a specific job within this country with Government funding.  Subsequent to its having been established it was put forward to the EEC who then had an input into the committee.  It was difficult to get it accepted at EEC level but eventually it was accepted and it was funded not only in this country but through the nine member states to deal with the problem of poverty in those States although it was considerably less in most cases than our problem.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came into office it was quite clear that their whole approach towards the committee and the committee's activities was, to say the least of it, one of disapproval.  Every conceivable thing that could be done, short of outright confrontation which would have political repercussions, was done to impede the work of that committee. Approximately 12 months ago on the appointment of the now Taoiseach who was then Minister for Health and Social Welfare I stated in this House that that committee would not last very long, that his record and his attitude towards the activities of that committee indicated clearly that he did not welcome their existence, and that now that he himself had been removed from the direct firing line of having to terminate their activities, his successor in the Department of Social Welfare would be handed that very unpleasant job and that the committee's activities would come to an end.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that prediction that I made 12 months ago has now come true. The committee is being terminated. When this matter was up for discussion at EEC level for an extension of the committee's operations at EEC level as well as national level, it had been indicated clearly to the Ministers of the EEC that the Irish Government no longer had any interest in this committee continuing their activities.  They no longer had any serious commitment towards funding the <Col N="920" /> committee or in seeking their continuance at EEC level.  To indicate clearly that this was the attitude of the Irish Government they have made it known that, at national level, they were bringing the committee's operations to an end.</P>
    <P>This EEC initiative came to be known as an Irish initiative.  This country was clearly identified with thinking up the scheme originally, putting it forward and pursuing it to a successful conclusion at the Council of Ministers against some opposition.  Once this Government indicated as clearly as they did that they were not prepared to continue it at national level, it was the clearest indication to the other eight Ministers sitting around the table that no matter what front might be presented to the media about the gallant attempts of the Minister for Social Welfare to continue it the Government did not want it to continue and were not prepared to put the necessary political pressure and will behind its continuance. One must ask, if the amount of money is relatively small what is motivating the Government's determination to finish the operations of the committee?  Its operations and findings are politically embarrassing.</P>
    <P>We knew when we set it up that if it was to be successful its findings and recommendations would have an element of political embarrassment in them.  Can anyone show me since June 1977, in a country that has between 20 and 25 per cent of its population living in poverty, one sentence, paragraph or speech by the Minister responsible for social welfare recipients that referred to poverty?  Has it been referred to?  Have they made an issue of it?  Have they tried to focus public attention on the plight of those citizens? Have they tried to marshal the will and commitment of those of us in Irish society who are better off towards finding a solution to this?  No. They want to terminate it because the fact that there are 20 to 25 per cent of the people living in poverty is a direct indictment of the Fianna Fáil Party and this Government.</P>
    <P>They do not want it highlighted or mentioned.  They want these people to keep silent.  Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister and the Government <Col N="921" /> to reverse the decision they have taken and provide the necessary very limited funds to allow this committee to continue. The committee was designed to do two things: to carry out schemes to find out the best possible way to combat poverty and, at the end of the schemes, it was the clear intention that their activities would continue and that the findings they had come to would be implemented in order to eradicate poverty from our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the limited time at my disposal I wish to refer to some specific items which are relevant to what we are dealing with.  Some time ago I addressed a question to the Minister asking him to pay allowances, particularly old age pensions, to all those who were entitled to them individually.  I refer specifically to the payment of allowances to married couples.  As we know the allowance is usually payable to the husband.  I have on a number of occasions requested that that be changed.  Why should a wife not get her own allowance independently of her husband?  The Minister told me it could be done but how?  One must give evidence of friction within the family and have a visit from a social welfare officer before a change can be made.  Why should that be?</P>
      <P>A wife should be paid her own allowance and should not have to make representations to Deputies or the Department and have costly visits from a social welfare officer to see what is wrong.  I am sure the Minister has grasped the point I am making.  To illustrate the point the retirement pension is £24.50 and if a wife is under 66 years of age she is entitled to £15.65.  I am asking the Minister to issue separate books.  Unfortunately some women do not get any of this money.  We should pay the money separately to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the death grant if one is too old, despite the number of years one is contributing to social insurance, one does not qualify for this grant.  A person must have 26 paid-in contributions prior to 1 October 1970 so that people who retired from work prior to this date do not qualify. The number of such people is very small and I would ask the Minister to <Col N="922" /> amend the regulation.  Where a person satisfies the conditions the death grant should be paid to his relatives.</P>
    <P>I am a long time in the House and almost from the first day I came in here I have been asking why this Department act independently of other Departments. They pay out money all the time and get little or no return for it.  A return could be got for this money.  A co-ordinating committee could be established between this Department, the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works and so on.  It is shameful that so many people are forced into drawing unemployment benefit and assistance.  It used to be a condition, although it has been relaxed of late, that one had to remain idle if one was to qualify for it.  Why should that money be paid out in that way?  Why should it not go towards supplementing employment schemes?  We have to find money to pay social welfare and pay-related benefits when the employment ceases.  That money must be found but we cannot find money to supplement productive schemes administered by other Departments so that men and women could work instead of going to Garda stations and employment exchanges to sign for benefits.</P>
    <P>I have preached that policy through the years.  Most of our able-bodied men and women would much prefer to be working than drawing social welfare benefits which are for the incapacitated, the elderly, people who are sick or disabled or incapable of earning a living for themselves.  It is unfair and degrading to impose the obligation on able-bodied people of going to exchanges to sign for unemployment assistance or benefit.  My idea is simple: that all the money paid out should be handed over to agencies like county councils, the Office of Public Works and other employing Departments such as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to enable them to employ more people and so add to the wealth of the country by getting a productive return for money paid out of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>At present if I have been working for seven, eight or nine months in west Cork &mdash; or in some cases three months &mdash; and I become redundant, in such circumstances <Col N="923" /> I could get almost as much pay as if I were working.  This is madness.  Instead of paying out social welfare money we should pay for productive employment. A single man who called on me a few weeks ago told me he was on a three-day week and was now getting 20p more than when he was working a five-day week and there was no change in the wage rate.</P>
    <P>I should like to see people in receipt of this money productively occupied.  There are roads to be improved, streams to be cleared and improved, streets to be improved, footpaths to be improved. One could list many works to be done in our towns, villages and rural areas on which we could have able-bodied manpower working advantageously for themselves and for the country.  Cognisance should be taken of this.  There should be some co-ordination between the Department of Social Welfare and bodies such as county councils and Departments to ascertain if such Departments could provide work for people becoming redundant. I emphasise very strongly the desirability of providing employment and reducing the big number now in receipt of benefits, 118,000.  Almost all these, particularly those I am referring to, would prefer to work for the money rather than get it in the form of social welfare.</P>
    <P>The three items I have in mind are independent payments to people entitled to social welfare benefit, a change in the death benefit system and a change in the system by which the Department take no notice of what is happening in other Departments but continue paying out money regardless of what happens elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I should like to make a few points in regard to the means test and its application to old age pensioners, whether contributory or non-contributory.  There is no doubt that there are delays in paying arrears of pension irrespective of the type of pension. The Minister should have some section in his Department dealing exclusively with arrears, particularly in the case of people on a contributory basis <Col N="924" /> who are signing for unemployment benefit. The Department are not delaying deliberately and I should not like to be recorded as saying so.  The Department are always most co-operative when representations are made to them.  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State here that, when there are substantial arrears in the case especially of widows' pensions where hardship is being caused, to have a departmental official visit the applicant within 14 days after receipt of an application.  Too often the health boards have to subsidise payment of some type of benefit to the people concerned until the pension comes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another area of particular concern which arises when an old age pensioner who is non-contributory is in receipt of another pension, whether social security from America or a British pension.  The Department suddenly see that a mistake was made, although the second benefit was declared originally, and seek a substantial repayment from the pensioner.  We do not dispute that the Department are entitled to it but some official of the Department should call to the individual concerned and point out that a deduction of £8 or £9 a week would be acceptable over a period rather than say they would have to get back, £2,500 in a lump sum.  That causes dismay in a household because usually the pensioner and the people living with him or her could not put that much money together. Consideration should be given, especially when the error arises through no fault of the pensioner.  Where there was concealment, of course, I would adopt a different line.  But if there was no concealment and if the mistake was made by the computer and was suddenly discovered, compassion should be shown to the pensioner concerned and he or she should not be asked to repay £2,000 or £2,500.  The sum involved could be deducted from the weekly pension over a period until the amount was paid.  Exercise of a little discretion in such cases would save a lot of anxiety.  This does not arise on a widespread basis but in isolated cases.  Therefore I see no reason why the Minister or the Minister of State should not have the <Col N="925" /> machinery necessary and I know that both are compassionate men.</P>
    <P>Different types of means tests are applied in different parts of County Kerry, particularly as far as unemployment assistance is concerned.  I cannot understand why a youth living with his parents is subject to a means test, assessed at £21 a week, when he applies for unemployment assistance when in another part of my historic county a single farmer with a valuation of £8 or £9 will be assessed at only £7 or £8.  I do not understand why social welfare officers can say that a boy living with his parents should have his board and lodgings assessed at £21 and therefore that he will not get anything.  That is a despicable practice.  If such an individual applied for ordinary unemployment assistance he would have to qualify, if available for work.  I hope the Minister will consider applying the same means test across the board.</P>
    <P>In the budget this year we were told that all those in receipt of farmers' unemployment assistance would benefit if they re-applied under a means test.  All who took the Minister at his word had their assistance savagely cut, by up to £5 a week.  They were conned.  I should like to get from the Minister the statistic on how many of those people had their unemployment assistance cut since that new system began to operate.</P>
    <P>However, I thank the Minister for the Bill passed recently and for which provision is being made in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody will disagree with the Minister's intention to give certain social welfare recipients double payments this week.  It is a welcome trend which will be supported by all.  My first concern tonight is in regard to a problem in County Mayo which I regard as a scandalous carry on.  It relates to the social welfare dental benefit scheme and related problems.  It has been going on for quite some time.  Because of frustration, dental surgeons in the county decided to withdraw their services from the national scheme as it operated up to that point.  They could have had their <Col N="926" /> names replaced on the list operated by the Department but they refused to do so because of frustration and disappointment throughout the years.</P>
      <P>As the scheme is operated at present it means that many social welfare contributors in my part of the country who should be eligible, on contributions, for dental treatment cannot avail of that benefit. At the moment an insured worker over 21 years of age must have more than three years' contributions to benefit, but a worker under 21 qualifies after six months.  Even if an insured worker has contributed for 20 or more years and approaches a dental surgeon for treatment, he or she must apply to the Department to find out whether he or she is considered eligible.  At the earliest, the reply will not be received for six months. I have been told by dental surgeons that acknowledgements that a person was qualified did not come for two years so that the person could get treated.  It is some toothache if one has had it for two years.  The Minister should take positive action on this matter so that patients can be issued with cards to show eligibility so that treatment could be carried out immediately.</P>
      <P>The dental surgeons' request for better fees for extraction and other dental treatment should be given consideration by the Minister because such work at present takes in half of the private practice, meaning that the scheme is subsidised from private practice.  As 68 per cent of the population belong to the less well off group, they are subsidising the service for the much better off group.  This is unacceptable. I think the Minister is well aware of it because as long ago as October 1979 the then Minister promised to improve the scheme, especially in relation to extractions, and the present Minister indicated that something was being done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like clarification on it.  Another point about dental treatment is that it should not be considered to be part of the social welfare scheme. It would be more appropriately dealt with <Col N="927" /> under the health services because prevention is better than cure.  I hope the Minister will consider this.</P>
      <P>In regard to women applicants for unemployment benefit, I get an enormous number of complaints from women who are eligible but for various reasons have been denied benefit because the Department say that they are not available for work in their particular areas.  I agree that for maternity and other reasons certain applicants might not be available for work, but in the majority of cases, when documentation has been supplied to the Department by employers in the districts concerned indicating that employment is not available, sometimes on the basis that the applicants have been made redundant, they should be considered eligible.</P>
      <P>Many widows throughout the country have not got sufficiently clear information in regard to their rights to benefits. I am not only concerned with widows but also with widowers.  The means test in relation to pensions for this group should be reviewed with a view to being more lenient.  I also suggest that the Minister would allow widows free travel, even for part of the year.  Many of them have relatives and friends whom they would like to visit but because of the loss of their husbands they may not be able to drive and anyway financial conditions might not permit them to travel.  Therefore I suggest that the free travel scheme should apply to them, even parttime. Because of the traumatic effects of the death of husbands some women of a nervous disposition should be given special consideration in this respect.  The Minister should look at the free telephone rental system to see if it can be applied to widows, particularly in isolated areas. Although the children's allowance has been increased it leaves a lot to be desired when we consider that many European countries are far more advanced than we are in relation to those particular social welfare benefits.  The same can be said in relation to widows' pensions.  I hope the Minister can do something positive for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of the means test in <Col N="928" /> relation to unemployment assistance for small farmers was raised by Deputy Begley.  His complaints are quite similar to those in my constituency.  Many small farmers were reluctant to avail of the factual assessment by social welfare officers because they did not really believe that if their means were better than was thought, based on a factual assessment, they would not lose what they were already getting.  The delays experienced in western counties, in particular, where this applies for assessments and for appeals are too much for the social welfare officers to cater for.  I hope the Minister will clarify the few small points I have raised in relation to the application of social welfare benefits as they affect people in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for their detailed contributions on this Supplementary Estimate.  I will try, as far as possible, to reply to the general questions which were raised.  Deputy McMahon referred to a letter which was circulated by the Minister of State.  I would like to make it quite clear that the letter had no relationship whatsoever to today's debate.  It was entirely accidental that it reached Deputies on this day.  It is part of the activities of the Minister of State in trying to pursue the delays we knew to be taking place, to try to find causes for them and to see what can be done to improve the situation.  It was purely accidental the Deputy received the letter today.</P>
      <P>I took the criticisms and the questions raised in the House seriously enough to ask the Minister of State to spend a good deal of time at this particular task.  He has done that and has spent time on detail.  He has given a reasonable summary of the points which came to his notice in the course of this investigation. He says in the report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months some delays in payment have occurred because claimants have quoted their revenue or PRSI numbers only on medical certificates and on claim forms although the latter form specifically requires them to <Col N="929" /> quote their insurance number as well as the PRSI number.  Where the situation arises it is possible to trace the relevant insurance record for 75 per cent of the cases by means of cross indexing.</P>
    <P>This was one of the points which was raised during the debate.</P>
    <P>It takes longer and it means it goes off the standard to be investigated separately. In the remaining 25 per cent of cases it is necessary to write to the claimants for their insurance numbers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell congratulated the Minister of State on the work he has been putting into that area and welcomed the letter which he also had received from him.  The delays and the wrong sighting of the number is a very important matter and contributes a lot to the substantial number of delays which occur.  I accept the point made by one Deputy that we should try a little harder to highlight this point by advertising.  Since it has emerged as a very substantial element I will consider that and will see what can be done. It is pointed out on the forms and in various other ways that the insurance number must be quoted.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon referred to the free fuel scheme and said that he regarded it as a farce.  I cannot win here as Minister for Social Welfare and I accept that situation. No matter what I do, no matter how much we give, no matter what we improve, we will have Deputies coming back and saying that things are a farce. A lot of things in the country are a farce. The Deputy must accept that there has been a very considerable increase in the free fuel scheme this year.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy. <Col N="930" /> On the basis of the scheme which I introduced this autumn, it will be £7 million from £2.9 million.  When one goes to look for the money one is talking about a substantial sum.  We would like to see much more and I will certainly press for an improvement of this scheme.  There has never been an improvement of this magnitude either in money terms or the number of people affected.</P>

      <P>There has never been an improvement of this magnitude, including the health boards.  I pay out the money.  I know the money the health boards get and I know the money the other people get.  An additional 29,000 people are now drawing this benefit. These people write to me to thank me for this.  They tell me they never had it before, they saw other people having it. They are brought in on the means test basis.  I accept that more needs to be done and I will certainly do my best to do more with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland referred to anomalies within the scheme.  We know there are and I will try to remove them.  Deputy McMahon referred to telephone calls and said it takes about four calls from a coin box to get an answer.  I have been bothered about this.  I will tell the Deputy what I am doing at the moment although he will probably come back and beat me with a stick over it until it is done.  I know there is a great problem from Cork, Galway and other places.  I know there are problems getting the information in other places.  There are much greater problems getting the information because one has to go through records. I am making arrangements on a pilot basis, first of all, to enlarge the office somewhat in Cork, provide a telex system whereby queries from Deputies or other people can be brought in locally, transmitted on telex, dealt with here and referred back on telex.  Such a system could go a good way towards eliminating <Col N="931" /> some of the delays that are occurring.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal more to be done such as the extension of the telephone service.  This is a matter we are working on but we depend on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to accommodate us in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">

      <P>Deputy O'Connell talked about our rates of assistance being the lowest in Europe.  There is not enough time left for me to go into detail on the various figures but, compared with England, for instance, we are doing quite well in this respect.  We have some additional benefits that do not apply there. However, I accept the general point that for old age pensioners and widows in particular, the base is lower than I would like it to be.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to a national income-related pension scheme. I have done most of my work in this area and hope to have the scheme ready early next year.  There were some queries, too, regarding a review of the death grant.  I shall have such a review undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference, too, to the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty.  I wish to make the Government's position clear in relation to this committee.  There has been some confusion about the nature of statements made but, basically, my position is that the combat poverty committee comes to an end at this stage.  I am not revealing anything new because I have made a number of references to this already. Indeed, I spoke about it as long ago as March last.  Therefore, there is no question of confusing anyone.  But, I have given a guarantee that the work of combatting poverty will continue.  I am committed to such work.  I might point out briefly that I was the person who, in Brussels in June last, prevented the whole scheme from being dropped.  It was my intervention which resulted in a compromise being reached to keep the scheme open and to have a small amount of money provided on an interim basis so <Col N="932" /> that the scheme would not die.  I wish to make my position on this matter clear, especially to Deputy Cluskey.</P>

      <P>The government are awaiting the evaluation report of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty on its various projects.  However, the Government are committed in principle to a programme designed to develop a sound and effective approach to the tackling of poverty in our society including research projects, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>I give the Deputies my personal assurance also on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have enough time to go into any more detail regarding this work but I might mention that in relation to the European programme of the pilot schemes to combat poverty which is under the aegis of the EEC, and which terminated on 30 November last, the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty which directed the projects for this country will terminate on 31 December 1980.  I expect to receive their final report in the very near future.  They had expected that report to be available next week but when it comes to hand I shall have it examined for the purpose of deciding on future action in this area, having regard to the undertaking of the <Col N="933" /> Government in the national understanding. My officials are in communication with the committee at this time.

      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the Departments being provided with moneys to enable them to employ people instead of all the available money being paid out by way of social welfare benefits.  This is a very general question.  The Deputy suggested that there be liaison between the Department of Social Welfare and the other Departments and local government agencies who provide jobs.  We have liaison with Manpower and we are endeavouring to ensure that this arrangement will be comprehensive whereby people will be offered employment where employment is available.</P>
      <P>The same Deputy talked about unemployed persons receiving as much in payment as if they were working.  So far as unemployment benefit is concerned, there is a ceiling of 85 per cent even with the combination of pay-related benefit and the basic flat allowances.  Therefore, to this extent there cannot be the sort of situation that the Deputy has described though, of course, the effects of taxation are a separate matter.</P>

      <Col N="934" /> Deputy Murphy expressed concern also regarding a case that had come to his attention whereby somebody on a three-day week claimed to be earning 20p more than if he were employed full time.  All I can say in reply to that is that I am very glad that we have reached a stage in our development whereby people who are put on short time employment can be maintained at about the same level as applied when they were on full-time work.  Very often this short time is of a short-term duration.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Agricultural Incomes and Production: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by <Col N="936" /> Deputy FitzGerald on Tuesday, 9 December 1980:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises, in view of the decline in agricultural incomes and production, that there is an urgent need for special measures to aid agriculture, resolves that the following measures shall be introduced to that end:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the abolition and refund of the Resource Tax.</P>
    <P>(2)  the repeal of the Bovine Disease Levy,</P>
    <P>(3)  the abolition of rates on agricultural land,</P>
    <P>(4)  the introduction of a capital allowance against income tax for breeding stock,</P>
    <P>(5)  an interest subsidy for certain farmers and</P>
    <P>(6)  the reduction of stamp duty on transfer of agricultural property to young farmers and</P>
    <P>therefore provides that, notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Order 119 (1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business or any decision made thereunder, a second reading shall be given to the Agricultural (Emergency Provisions) Bill, 1980 as presented.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises that farmers generally have been experiencing serious difficulties; welcomes the valuable consultations taking place between the Government and Farm Organisations in regard to these difficulties; applauds the range of financial and other measures already introduced by the Government to relieve the difficulties being experienced by farmers; acknowledges that these measures will encourage investment and improve farm incomes and provide a stimulus to agricultural production and notes that the Government are continuing to explore ways and means of further assisting the farming community and <Col N="937" /> promoting the expansion of agricultural output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night everyone seemed to agree that the farmers are going through a very bad time and I tried to assess why this is so.  In the limited time available to me I will try to deal with this motion.  The first point refers to the abolition and refund of the resource tax. As spokesman for agriculture I opposed the imposition of this tax.  No matter how one looks at this, it is a wealth tax.  My party have always agreed with a wealth tax, but not with a selective wealth tax which deals with only one section of the community.  That is what happened here. Only farmers were asked to pay this wealth tax and in that sense it is unjust. I am not against a wealth tax but it should apply right across the board.</P>
      <P>Some farmers who would never come under a wealth tax have been caught by this resource tax because it does not take into account their ability to pay.  The bovine disease levy was imposed by a former Fianna Fáil Minister.  At that time I spoke against it.  Money is necessary for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis &mdash; nobody denies that &mdash; but this does not take into account a farmer's ability to pay.  For that reason it is an unjust, selective tax.  We encouraged farmers to eradicate these terrible diseases from their herds, and rightly so, but during the past year we have imposed a burden on them for doing that.</P>
      <P>The abolition of rates on agricultural lands is fair.  This Government in their wisdom decided to abolish rates on private houses.  Rates in general are an unjust form of taxation because they do not take into account the ability to pay. I firmly believe a local authority should have their own form of income, otherwise they will lose their independence.  I am a great believer in the independence of local authorities, but rates under the poor law system imposed 100 years ago have today little regard to people's ability to pay.  For that reason I am prepared to support the third point in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said last night that farmers, and small farmers in particular, were encouraged <Col N="938" /> by the Department and by the advisory service to invest and borrow huge sums at 9 per cent and 10 per cent.  They are now paying 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The only way these people can be saved from utter ruin is by subsidising their interest charges.  Interest due is mounting and they will never be able to pay.</P>
    <P>I agree that there should be a reduction of stamp duty on the transfer of agricultural property to young farmers.  Our small farmers should be in a position to compete with the bigger farmers.  The Labour Party have always believed this. The former Fianna Fáil Minister promised to introduce a Land Structure Bill. I believe we are getting a White Paper, although I have not seen it yet.  There was a very good departmental report on land structure.  We should build up our land banks so that people who have proved to be good farmers can be helped. There are many thousands of such people, young and not so young, who cannot get land because they cannot compete with the bigger units.  Land Commission policy has been a fiasco.  Deputies have been inclined to blame the Land Commission, but we never gave them the money to do the job, except what they raised by land bonds, and then we blamed them for not doing the job we wanted them to do.  These are minimum requirements.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Finance said that more money had been paid out of the farm modernisation scheme than ever before and that there was confidence in farming.  I respectfully submit that most of that money had been due by way of grants for over a year.  That money had not been paid out in time.  He said production was being maintained and appealed to farmers not to let their cow herd numbers run down.  They are already run down.  The number of cows is far fewer than last year, milk production has decreased and sheep numbers in the last ten years have dropped by about one million.</P>
    <P>The Government have not done enough.  If farming is not put on a firm basis many other areas of employment will fall.  On behalf of a number of agricultural labourers in my constituency I <Col N="939" /> want to tell the Minister that if farming is not in a good position these unfortunate people, who have always been the worst paid in our society, will not get what is and has been their due under the transfer of resources from Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak in support of the amendment which stands in the names of the Minister for Finance and myself.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister for Finance, I too would like, at the very outset, to emphasise once again that the Government fully recognise the seriousness of the difficulties, economic and otherwise, which are now being experienced by the agricultural industry.  I have acknowledged publicly on several occasions that the problems are there and that the Government are concerned about them.  I am well aware that 1980 has been a particularly difficult year for farmers.  Apart from problems of an economic nature related to prices and costs, the year has been marked by exceptionally bad weather conditions.  The Government are concerned especially about the implications of the present situation for farmer confidence and about the prospects for future development and expansion of the farm industry which is a vital sector of the national economy.</P>
      <P>This is not any late conversion on the part of the Government.  For quite some months now the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself have had several discussions with the farming organisations to see what practical steps could be taken to improve farm incomes.  Very early on in those discussions, the Government responded in a very positive way to the problems facing farmers.  We acted promptly and constructively within the existing financial and other constraints that must always be taken into account. We provide a wide range of measures designed to alleviate the present difficulties and to encourage renewed investment and expansion in the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I introduced a Supplementary Estimate in this House a few weeks ago I outlined the positive measures which <Col N="940" /> had been taken.  Those measures included the winter fodder scheme which has in fact produced a very definite and encouraging response from farmers, especially by first-time silage makers.</P>
    <P>An extra £23 million under the farm modernisation scheme was also provided. We made provision for up to £100 million of foreign borrowing to enable the ACC and the associated banks to make loans to farmers at reduced rates of interest for both working capital and productive investment, as well as making special provision for young farmers.  In addition, the ACC and the banks agreed to take a constructive and positive approach to the restructuring of loans to farmers faced with serious repayment problems.  We had also the introduction of a beef suckler scheme which provided for a national subsidy for additional cows as well as the basic EEC subsidy for existing cows.</P>
    <P>We greatly increased the headage grants under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The new rates of grant of £32 and £28 are about double the 1979 levels. We also implemented an increase in the subsidy under the mountain lamb extension scheme from £1.50 to £3 per head.</P>
    <P>Under the new EEC regime for sheepmeat there will be the payment of a premium on ewes which can be about £7 per head in a full year, depending on market prices.  We also had at that time a subsidy on the cost of the warble fly dressing and special assistance for Macra na Feirme, at their request, to encourage the organisation and operation of farm relief services.</P>
    <P>In addition, we remitted the second moiety of rates for farmers in the £40 to £60 rateable valuation category and also arranged that farmers in temporary financial difficulties should not be pressed for rates this year.</P>
    <P>The measures I have just outlined are largely the list of items put before us by the farming organisations at that time and during those negotiations.  Almost to the final item the Government responded to requests made by the farming organisations then.  Indeed, when I mention rates, I am very surprised to see a request to abolish rates coming from the Fine <Col N="941" /> Gael benches.  I was not aware of the rather sudden change of policy of that party on this important issue.  I recall very clearly a statement made by the party spokesman on agriculture at a public meeting in Ballybofey in County Donegal less than two months ago which was in favour of the retention of rates.  Why the sudden change of heart on this issue? Perhaps Fine Gael would prefer to forget that particular statement, as indeed they would like to forget everything that happened about that time in Donegal.  In any event, this sudden switch clearly underlines Fine Gael's lack of sincerity in putting forward the suggestion that rates should be abolished or, for that matter, any other of the suggestions contained in this motion.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for my Department, some Deputies opposite described these measures in various disparaging terms&mdash;using expressions like paltry, useless and inadequate.  Of course they were nothing of the kind.  They were a genuine effort to help the farming industry in its immediate difficulties.  These measures were brought in quickly and were indeed welcomed by the farming bodies as a practical and urgent response by the Government to the situation.  Furthermore, those measures were designed to bring help to those farmers who were likely to be most in need of assistance.  The £40 million provided for in that Supplementary Estimate reflects the tangible nature of the Government's reaction.  That sum did not, of course, include any provision for the concession on rates for farmers in the £40 to £60 rateable valuation category&mdash;which will involve an extra £6 million or so.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite would give the impression that the outlook for agriculture in this country is bleak.  Of course it is no such thing.  I have every confidence that the farming industry in this country can enjoy a bright future.  While there are difficulties at present&mdash;and there are difficulties also in many of the other member states of the EEC&mdash;we should not under-estimate the inherent strength of the industry and its ability to cope with occasional difficulties.  Both the primary producers <Col N="942" /> and the processing sector have made enoromous advances since we joined the European Community.  There has been massive investment in the industry at farm level.  The total State expenditure on grants under the farm modernisation scheme up to and including this year, reached £160 million.  This represents a small proportion only of the total investment undertaken by farmers during those years.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident therefore, that there have been very widespread and significant improvements on very many farms in this country in recent years.  This leaves the industry better geared to withstand a certain degree of pressure and in a position to take off again as soon as conditions improve, For example, I was particularly interested, to note from the survey conducted by the RTE &ldquo;Landmark&rdquo; programme that the level of investment by farmers in buildings and land improvement in 1980 was as high as it had been in previous years.  Furthermore, there are indications that, while capital investment may be somewhat lower in 1981, a good proportion of farmers still intend to carry out improvements in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Equally there has been very substantial investment in recent years in the processing sector.  As a result we have now in this country some of the most modern plants in Europe especially for the processing of meat and milk.  I made these points not to discount in any way the present problems of the industry but to point to some of the positive aspects we have in our favour.  There is a solid foundation to the farming industry, and I consider that we are entitled to have faith in its powers of recovery.</P>
    <P>Our discussions with the farm organisations are continuing.  It is hardly necessary for me at this stage to reassure farmers at large of the Government's concern about the situation in agriculture. We have already given an earnest of our concern and we are determined to do everything possible to overcome current difficulties.  The prosperity of our agriculture depends nowadays to a great extent on decisions taken under the EEC's common agricultural policy.  The EEC decisions of greatest impact for us <Col N="943" /> are those which establish the prices that farmers receive for their produce.  During the next few months our efforts will be concentrated on the negotiation of the prices package for 1981.  In the course of these negotiations, I shall be stressing in the strongest possible terms that, in the light of the current situation in agriculture, the price increases by the Community must be realistic.</P>
    <P>There are very definite advantages for the Community itself in maintaining a prosperous agricultural sector.  That sector employs nearly 8,000,000 people. Surely it is important to protect that employment at a time when there are over 7,000,000 unemployed in the Community. The CAP guarantees the Community's food supply.  It also creates stability in its balance of payments.  A prosperous and progressive farm industry is a vital stabilising and constructive influence in European society.  Therefore, we do not need to apologise in seeking a fair deal for farmers from the Community.</P>
    <P>Apart from our determination to secure the best possible EEC prices package for 1981, we have been examining various other possibilities of securing further benefits for Irish farmers in an EEC context.  In this respect, I have had Article 39 of the Rome Treaty very much in mind.  That article declares that one of the basic objectives of the CAP shall be to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community.  This aim is certainly not being achieved in this country today.  Neither is it being achieved in some of the other member states.</P>
    <P>It was on that basis that I met with Commissioner Gundelach in Brussels last week, to put to him the serious difficulties facing Irish farmers at present.  I explained fully to him the Government's deep concern about the decline in farm incomes here.  I outlined to him our case for special assistance&mdash;particularly with due regard to Article 39 of the Treaty&mdash;and I discussed with him a range of possible options aimed at improving farm incomes here.  I was delighted to find that the Commissioner was quite receptive and very sympathetic.  He recognised that our agricultural industry <Col N="944" /> here faces particular problems and he undertook to examine forthwith ways and means of relieving our situation.  This is already being done and discussions at high official level are in progress.</P>
    <P>I believe it is quite logical for us to look to the EEC for effective measures.  Most of our trade in farm products is directly affected by the CAP.  Let me emphasise that we do not want to change the basic principles of the CAP.  We have always been staunch defenders of that policy and we must continue to defend it, especially now when it is coming under attack from various sources.  Our aim is to get relief to the maximum extent possible from and within the existing mechanisms of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite appear determined, both in this debate and earlier in their contributions on the Supplementary Estimate, to paint a picture of total gloom and depression in agriculture.  As I have said, nobody is denying that farmers are going through a difficult time, but the preaching of despondency and depression is no help at all.</P>
    <P>I have referred earlier to the very high level of investment that has taken place at all levels throughout the industry.  This leaves the basic infrastructure of the industry in a healthy state and is a very positive factor for expansion in the future.  I know that the high cost of investment is advanced as one of the reasons why some farmers&mdash;a relatively small proportion&mdash;are in serious difficulty.  On this score, as the Minister for Finance has already told the House, the lending agencies, at the Government's instigation, have indicated their readiness to take a constructive and positive approach to restructuring loans in individual cases where the farmer is in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>This was one of the very important points in negotiations and consultations with the farming organisations.  The farming organisations agreed with the banks to participate in special liaison committees between farmers' representatives and the banks on the one hand, and farmers' representatives and the ACC on the other hand.  We asked for and got an assurance that those liaison committees will work effectively towards <Col N="945" /> a resolution of these difficulties.  I asked specifically for complaints if that mechanism is not working.  To date I have not received any complaint.</P>
    <P>Another area where we can look forward to positive results is the disease eradication programme.  This programme has had the full backing of the farm organisations and the general body of farmers over the past few years.  As a result, tremendous strides have been made in getting on with the eradication of brucellosis &mdash; so much so that I am quite confident this disease will be totally eradicated in the next five or six years. We are also making steady progress with getting the incidence of bovine TB reduced.  The eradication of these two diseases over the coming years will remove one of the few remaining threats to the expansion of our export trade in cattle, beef and dairy products.  The State's expenditure on disease eradication is substantial, and the amount contributed by farmers by way of disease levy must be seen as a worthwhile investment by farmers in the livestock industry. We all look forward to the day when these two diseases will have been eradicated and the high costs at present involved can be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>I am completely confident that Irish agriculture will overcome its present temporary difficulties.  We have a considerable number of highly efficient farmers, as good as any farmers elsewhere.  We have many others who have the capacity to be more productive and efficient.  These now have a better range of back-up services to support them than ever before, not only in the various grant schemes but in the advisory and education facilities that are available.  I am certain ACOT will recognise the challenge that the present farming situation poses for the new service and that it will rise to the challenge by providing a more cohesive advisory service to farmers.  Even Deputy FitzGerald chose to ignore any positive elements on the agricultural scene.  He dwelt at length, as other Deputies did, on the level of destocking this year.  He and others could equally have adverted to the substantial increase of up to 22 per cent in the numbers of in-calf heifers as disclosed <Col N="946" /> in recent surveys, but that would not suit their case at all.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, many positive factors which augur well for the expansion of agriculture in the longer term. Taking account of these and looking forward, after my recent approach, to constructive proposals from the EEC Commission, I can assure the House and farmers that the farming industry will be well looked after by the Government in its present difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it does nothing for the industry to be expounding gloom and fear.  Talk in general terms about farming going downhill at break-neck speed is unjustified.  I am not saying that farmers have talked themselves into a decline &mdash; far from it &mdash; but figure-quoting has become something of a disease and there is also a place for positive thinking and we hear too little of that.  It has been said that &ldquo;There is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so&rdquo;.  Certainly bad news seems to be always more welcome than good news.  I was particularly pleased to note in fact that at least some people in leadership positions in the farming organisations have within the last week or so deplored any suggestion of cutting back on agricultural production because of the current difficulties.  I believe there are enough responsible people around who will recognise that the first to be affected by cutting back will be farmers themselves. Such a negative approach could indeed be seriously detrimental also to the well-being of rural areas and to agriculture based industry.  For my part, I have faith in the future of Irish agriculture and will be striving in the weeks and months ahead in the various EEC discussions and negotiations to see that future realised as quickly as possible.  The farming industry is too important in this country's economy.  We must have confidence in its future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last part of the Minister's speech, that we must have confidence.  However as a person who is involved in this industry I do not see any reason for confidence at this time. Gloom is not coming from the Fine Gael benches; it is coming from the farming <Col N="947" /> organisations.  Those who were in Limerick last weekend saw and heard nothing but gloom.  They are aware of the complete and utter lack of confidence in those responsible in the Government for this our major industry.  It has been said by the Minister for Finance that Government action will not solve the problem, that it would also need reference to the CAP and the EEC.  We know all that.  In fairness, the Minister is probably fighting as hard as he can, but the outcome of that will also benefit the farmers of Europe.</P>
      <P>It is as well to note that the farmers of Europe were satisfied last year with their deal and because of the difference in inflation between other European countries and ourselves those farmers are doing very well.  Inflation is the root of the problem.  We have a very high rate of inflation and, more than anything else, it is eroding farm incomes and profits.  I agree with the Minister that we have the same level of investment, but for that level of investment farmers only get about half the value in buildings because of inflation.  We must control inflation first because unless we do any measures will not solve our problem.  We have been told about valuable consultations but we have yet to hear what they were about. What is so mysterious about them that we cannot be told what they were about? What practical results have the Government got from those valuable consultations? What measures will be proposed to get farmers out of the doldrums and off the streets?  We are told that the Minister is continuing to explore but I should like to know where he intends exploring. Does he intend exploring at the North Pole?  Such phrases will not get us anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that instead of bringing in a woolly amendment the Government would have discussed the problem with us.  I had hoped that we would get some measure of commitment from the Government on some of the measures necessary. At our last ACOT meeting in Cork there was unanimity between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and others on the necessity for immediate relief with regard <Col N="948" /> to interest rates and a resolution to that effect was submitted to the Minister.  We were anxious that immediate help be given to those who had over-stretched themselves in their borrowings.  I believe that Fianna Fáil members at that meeting proposed the restoration of transport subsidies on fertilisers and lime.  We have been told that because of our membership of the EEC we cannot do that but we must be the only member state in the EEC concerned to stroke all our t's and dot all our i's.</P>
    <P>We are suggesting a repeal of the bovine disease levy.  Those involved in farming in recent years are aware of the amount of money that disease has cost them.  With a levy we are really penalising somebody who is already hard pressed. Getting rid of disease is a costly business. Disease, apart from anything else, has put many a man to the wall.  I will go further and say that the unpredictable nature of disease gives the farmer no chance at all, be he as careful as he likes. It can appear and has appeared out of the blue.  Here is a case where we could apply for additional EEC aid and cut out that levy once and for all.  We in these benches believe that as a gesture to restore confidence we should get rid of that levy now.</P>
    <P>The second point I would take is the abolition of the resource tax.  This imposition from the very beginning was totally unfair and our Labour colleagues have brought out that point.  It has damaged our competitiveness in a serious way.  It is not at all related to income.  It is already added to your income tax bill and to your rates.  I would compare it with a tax on a man's skill if it is to be related to PAYE. I would welcome its abolition now and, as a gesture of goodwill, a refund of what the Government have collected.</P>
    <P>The Government have been particularly guilty in this field of taxation.  They came along at election time and told the farmers &ldquo;Get rid of these socialists, these red Richies and so on and put in a Government who will ease your tax burden.&rdquo; Very successfully they got 100 per cent of the farming vote in certain areas where taxation was a live issue.  They have been very guilty.  Last year they had a levy, <Col N="949" /> once off they said, it would never happen again.  This year we have a resource tax and we are going to run into a general election, so it has to be once off.  But as soon as those bucks get back&mdash;if they get back&mdash;to power, what will it be?  Twice or three times off?</P>

    <P>With regard to the abolition of rates, the Minister had quite a lot to say about rates and told us that we had no thought at all about rates.  We were the first people who did something about household rates.  I would like you to cast your minds back to that.  Secondly, for those who had very substantial rates to pay we had a little thing called the primary grant, in case you did not hear about it, and it was not the Coalition who took them off.  I have some figures here which I have not time to quote which will show you how rates have jumped since you people took over.  You are the people who jacked up and made a very substantial bill out of rates for those people who had real rates to pay.  If we are serious about the EEC and about being competitive we will have to look to our nearest competitor, that is <Col N="950" /> the UK.  If we are not line ball with these people in our costings, if we are not given a fair chance to compete with the British farmers, then you can forget about the British market.  Fair enough, you took off the second moiety as a gesture of goodwill, again probably coming up to an election. It was a gesture of goodwill much appreciated even though you forgot about quite a lot of it over the £60 valuation and you also forgot about a very important sector under the £40 valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well-known that the capital allowance on breeding stocks is a very important factor for the dairyman and that is another item on our programme.  It is known to dairy people that a cow depreciates from £600 or £700 to nil value over a number of years. Therefore, it is right and proper that we should be allowed to depreciate our dairy herd in this manner.  It is well to stress the importance of dairy herds and cow numbers and the importance of the dairy herd in the context of other farmers such as people like myself who are tillage farmers.  The dairy people really are the heart and soul of Irish farming.  Because of the difficulties of their way of life they are the only people who really have to roll up their sleeves on a Sunday.  They have a full seven-day working week.  In order to instil confidence that they have not got at present we have moved and asked the Government to give them this very small concession.</P>
      <P>The next point is income.  The amount of money involved is not very significant but we know that it applies in the constituency of the Minister of State as well as in mine.  The amount of land in the hands of elderly people is quite substantial and this is due in great measure to the extraordinary legal-tangled difficulty and the high cost of transfer, stamp duty and so on.  This is a gesture towards relieving that situation.  The Minister should go the whole hog and get rid of stamp duty as they have done in the United States where transfers can be easily and readily made.  One would avoid the situation of companies and corporations forming where land would be held and never transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interest subsidy which we propose is probably the most important item in the immediate future.  There is widespread agreement on the necessity for it. <Col N="952" /> The Minister for Finance rightly said he had done a lot and I give him credit for what has been done with regard to low interest loans and a moratorium for people with high borrowing.  However, this is not enough.  Interest at present due to the recession is too high for many people.</P>
    <P>We were told to concentrate on the middle band of farmers and I take ACOT to task for this.  There is no fear for that band of farmers.  They are insulated against all weather conditions at present. It is the front runners who are in trouble now, those who took the advice of agricultural advisers and developed their farms.  The number of people who bought land dearly is minimal.  The vast majority are those who spent money on their existing holdings and bought good, expensive stock.  They are in trouble now.  If the Minister even at this late stage gave us a commitment on this we would have achieved a lot.  The councillors we meet in ACOT from the opposite benches are getting the same message that we are and it is that young farmers are in real trouble because of heavy borrowing.  We should subsidise the interest until such time as they are out of their difficulties and inflation is brought under control.</P>
    <P>In identifying those areas ACOT and agricultural advisers have a big role to play.  Any aid that is given should be paid directly to farmers on the advice of agricultural advisers.  At a recent ACOT meeting all parties were told that we had to do something immediately about the people in financial difficulty.  The advisers know who they are, as they confide in them.  The advisers should be sent out to them, the size of the problem should be measured and the remedy applied.</P>
    <P>The farmers are not cutting back for the sake of being contrary.  Fertilisers are stacked up in co-operative societies and railway stations.  Farm machinery businesses are closing down.  Only last night I met a man who won a prize last year for best salesman and he is being made redundant at the weekend.  Farmers have lost confidence and the Government have a responsibility to restore it.  Nobody asked any questions when nurses and other groups got their few shillings.  This is a primary industry and God knows the <Col N="953" /> Government found money for more foolish things like getting themselves into power and running down the economy. This is like planting seed potatoes. Investment in agriculture is necessary.  In case anyone gets the idea that farm incomes in boom times were high a recent survey has shown that even at the best of times they were not.</P>
    <P>Another point which has come to light is that farmers are at present selling stock on the pretence of disease.  We are not hearing the full story because farmers are a proud race and are ashamed to admit that things are so bad.  I know of a case where a healthy heard of cows were sold. The effects of the slump in agriculture does not confine itself to the farm gate. The Minister mentioned the processing industry.  I am as conversant as anyone in the House with the processing of food and dairy produce but one thing is certain; if the Minister does not wake up and do something about the horticultural processing industry, in other words Erin Foods, he will have another problem on his hands.  Fastnet and Carlow are in trouble already.  Where will the next one be? This is an industry that has survived many a battle and it is only now we are talking of closing it down.  We can say we will put in an alternative industry and that is grand.  I praised a Minister in the House yesterday for doing something about another industry and I will praise this Minister if he does something about Erin Foods.  I appeal to him to save the valuable horticultural processing skills that we have.  It is important to remember that the disaster on Irish farms will spread into every town and city.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned the farm machinery business &mdash; it has gone.  Also affected are the fertiliser business and jobs in the processing factories, jobs in the transport industry, even in land reclamation.  Never before did I see so many machines idle. Jobs in our marts and meat processing factories are affected.  Townspeople will tell you that they are seriously concerned about their farm friends, their customers, and that if something is not done quickly, tomorrow will be too late.  Let the Government not come in with an amendment <Col N="954" /> that talks about exploring, about discussions and discourses.  We want to hear at least one concrete suggestion that will restore farm confidence.  Do not tell us you have succeeded in what has been done because if you had there would not have been 60,000 people out on the streets last Saturday with promises of more to come. Nobody on any side of the House wants that.  What we want and I hope will all try to achieve is that the farm industry will be put back on its feet without further delay. Do not blame the EEC.  I am in the Council of Europe and I know what is happening &mdash; European farmers are doing quite well. This is a national problem, a problem of controlling inflation and of getting the whole economy under control, and, having done that, implementing the steps we suggested.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do all he can in Brussels.  I am sure he will but the proper nuts to crack are those in his own Cabinet.  They are the people he must convince that money must be found now. Nobody will begrudge that money.  It is not, as it were, giving fish to the farmers but giving them the means to do their own fishing.  We do not seek handouts for them but an opportunity to recover.  It is important still &mdash; and it cannot be bought with money &mdash; to restore their confidence. Let the Government make out a five-year plan in regard to taxation &mdash; income tax on accounts with full allowances, set out exactly what they intend to do over a period and get off the farmers' backs.  Do not come along year in year out with new taxes, once-off measures; we are sick of them.  Do what is right by them.  Treat them in the same way as their UK counterparts are treated and give them an opportunity to compete in the market place.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the previous speaker I have grave doubts about the sincerity of this motion.  I think it is another gimmick, a stunt, a timewasting exercise by Fine Gael.  Do we not all know that Fine Gael can make no move if ever they get back to Government without the Labour tail wagging the Fine Gael dog from head to toe?  Let there be no doubt but that the wealth tax <Col N="955" /> will be brought back as it was introduced in the past by the men with superior intelligence who claim to have all the answers to all the problems of agriculture. Those opposite were the people who said that.  Deputy Hegarty said that there was nobody on this side of the House competent to deal with the problems of agriculture.  We are all in the business and know it inside out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the problems of that great industry and no amount of talk in this House will solve them.  Action and co-operation are needed.  I was heartened by the speech of the Minister for Agriculture.  I think Fine Gael speakers will agree that he is in tune with the enormous problems of the industry and if anything can be done to improve farm incomes we must take the Minister's line. Shouting, bawling and belly-aching will solve nothing.  Great talkers are never great doers.  If talk solved problems Fine Gael would have solved them years ago.</P>
      <P>It is time for serious thought and action. I believe action will come through a Fianna Fáil Government and Minister for Agriculture.  We concede that there is a recession in agriculture; we would be stupid not to: the Minister said it a few minutes ago because he realises the difficulties. He has told us he is going back to Brussels to try to ensure that the case for the Irish farmer is properly put and understood.  I do not doubt that he will come back with the best possible deal for our farmers because we all realise the importance of this industry to our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in talking of British agriculture.  You cannot compare it with Irish Agriculture.  There is no point in making a comparison when you have 5 per cent of the British population engaged in agriculture while 28 per cent of our population are in agriculture.  We want to see that industry thrive because we are concerned about the future of the industry.  It is not the first time that farmers have faced economic recession.  They went through recession from 1974 to 1977, despite the fact that the then Minister <Col N="956" /> for Agriculture was pushing an open door in Brussels all the time.  Prices were on the increase all the time while we were approaching par with European prices. In 1974 we had the fodder crisis when thousands of our breeding stock were slaughtered because farmers did not have fodder.  That could not happen in 1980 because the present Minister for Agriculture had the courage and foresight to anticipate such a situation.  I was glad this week to meet farmers who said: &ldquo;We got our grants this morning for the silage subsidy and they were very welcome. Thanks to MacSharry and Company; they are doing a good job&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that Fine Gael speakers were rather reluctant to talk about cattle prices.  It has been proved beyond doubt that some thrifty farmers have made £200 per head on beef production this year; that cannot be contradicted. There is a man in this building at present who sold cattle last week to a factory.  He bought them last March and they yielded a profit of £200 per head.  Is that not something that is being ignored by those who talk about the prices in agriculture?  That is the type of farm community we want, with farmers getting proper advice on the handling and breeding of livestock so as to ensure they will have stocks on their land that will produce the maximum weight gains which will give maximum profit.  This is something the people opposite have conveniently forgotten.  It would not do to mention something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present year was a good year for grass production, one of the best for a long time.  That has contributed to the extraordinary weight gains that have occurred in livestock throughout the country this year.  At the same time, farm costs have increased &mdash; we would be foolish to ignore that &mdash; but in the period 1974 to 1976 the increase was 55 per cent and from 1977 to date the increase has been roughly 40 per cent.  That contradicts the claim made by Deputy Bermingham &mdash; he may be an expert on agriculture and I do not know the extent of his agricultural expertise &mdash; that this <Col N="957" /> Government had failed to control inflation. The figures bear out the fact that the Government have taken positive steps to control inflation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty spoke about the slump in the sales of farm machinery. Surely that had to come sometime.  Millions of pounds have left the country to pay for imports of modern farm machinery. The Deputy should bear in mind that a farmer does not use a tractor every day of the year.  Farmers are well mechanised and, as I said during the budget debate this year, we need more co-operation in the use of farm machinery because of the amount of capital tied up in it.  Take a forage harvester, for instance.  It is used for five weeks each year at the most and it is lying idle for the remainder of the year, depreciating in value all the time. The same goes for every other item of farm machinery.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we need to advise our farmers to ensure that they invest their money wisely.  Most farm machinery is purchased on loan from the ACC or the banks.  Farmers would be advised therefore to do costings in regard to the pooling of farm machinery before they go out and put a millstone round their necks by purchasing expensive farm machinery. That is one of the reasons for farmers indebtedness which is causing such a problem.  Some farmers borrowed heavily and they are now in financial difficulty because of their heavy commitments during the years as a result of not doing their homework properly before investing individually in expensive machinery with a very high depreciation element.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore these facts, no matter how people try to manipulate figures to suit a political situation.  The farming community are determined to play their role in society, to produce adequately in order to earn the maximum for the national economy.  They must be encouraged and that can be best be done by ensuring that markets are organised and guaranteed. We did not have such organised marketing when we depended on Britain to buy our produce.  Britain bought when it suited her, the result being that farmers experienced periods of slumps and great demand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> Today farmers have a market for their produce.  It can be argued that at the moment prices are not adequate to keep pace with inflation.  Farm credit needs to be watched carefully because it will be an important factor in farming activity throughout the years.  Therefore we must ensure it will be made available, and this is the only area in which Deputy Hegarty and I might agree.  The Minister, too, agrees and he is anxious to ensure that farmers get credit at the lowest possible rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government cannot blame the current agricultural problems here on someone else.  They cannot blame it on Europe, or on the oil sheiks. The position of Irish agriculture at the moment is almost unique in Europe.  Let us take one example.  As a united country last year we fought against the super levy on milk because we wanted room for Irish milk production to expand.  We succeeded in that fight.  What has happened since?  In seven countries of the EEC milk production has expanded, but in Ireland, in company with one other country in Europe, milk production has fallen. Therefore, the arguments we all made as a united people against the super levy has been invalidated by our own miserable agricultural performance in the last year.</P>
      <P>The bland and complacent Government contribution to this debate indicates that they do not understand the seriousness of the situation for jobs, for the maintenance of rural Ireland and for our balance of payments.  At the end of this debate Members have a choice, to vote for the six constructive proposals for Irish agriculture being put forward by this party or for a Fianna Fáil amendment which would delete from the records of this House those six proposals without putting anything in their place.  The Fine Gael motion calls for:</P>
      <P>(1)  the abolition and refund of the Resource Tax,</P>
      <P>(2)  the repeal of the Bovine Disease Levy,</P>
      <P>(3)  the abolition of rates on agricultural land,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  the introduction of a capital <Col N="959" /> allowance against income tax for breeding stock,</P>
    <P>(5)  an interest subsidy for certain farmers and</P>
    <P>(6)  the reduction of stamp duty on transfer of agricultural property to young farmers.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil amendment proposes to delete all of these proposals from the resolution finally to be adopted by this House and substitutes only meaningless platitudes.  Those who vote for the amendment will be voting against the abolition of agricultural rates, against the abolition of disease levy, against the interest subsidies for farmers, against the refund of the resource tax and against a tax allowance for breeding stock and reduced stamp duty on land transfers to young farmers.  That is the way Deputies will be voting here tonight, the week before they return to their constituencies for Christmas, if they vote in favour of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Why do the Government want to delete all reference to these proposals? Why does their amendment not even give an undertaking, which would not have cost anything, to consider the proposals? The answer is to be found in the air of bland unreality that pervaded the speech of the Minister of Finance yesterday, who spoke as someone concerned not with the future of Irish agriculture but with justifying his own past record.  The same can be said for the contribution of the Minister for Agriculture.  He was looking back all the time, congratulating himself, patting himself on the back for the efforts he had made, as if he felt rather lonely because no one else was consoling him about how good he had been and he had to do it himself.  In none of the contributions on the Government side was there even a glimmer of a plan for the future of agriculture.  Was there any idea of where agriculture will go in the next five years?  There was not anything but tired self-justification.  Problems of Irish agriculture are serious enough to deserve something better in a debate such as this.</P>
    <P>I will turn to what we on this side propose.  The most important proposal is <Col N="960" /> that for an interest subsidy.  An important minority of farmers are in dire trouble with their banks.  They are among our best farmers, who had forged ahead of their neighbours by increasing their herds, their equipment and their overall efficiency.  They did so on money borrowed at the relatively low interest rates obtaining at that time.  Since then interest rates have gone up, prices have remained static instead of rising, as was generally predicted at the time, and costs have risen.</P>
    <P>The progressive farmer is caught in a three-corner vice of high costs, low prices and increased interest charges.  This progressive farmer set the example for others by expanding his herd and his enterprise. If the Government, by failing to introduce an interest subsidy, allow him to go under they will devalue all the work of the agricultural advisers, the training courses and all the research of the last ten years.  The Government will show by their failure to come to the rescue of farmers who have done all the things they were advised to do on borrowed money that expansion does not pay.  They will again be recreating the conditions in which Irish farming could easily lapse back into the cautious low input, low output rut in which it travelled from the famine until the late sixties.</P>
    <P>It is to prevent this happening that we call for an immediate interest subsidy for farmers so that those who have been giving an example to others, who have been taking risks, will be seen to be justified and will be seen to have the confidence of the Government behind them.  Without that interest subsidy one cannot say that such farmers will have confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>Another measure to which I attach special importance is the elimination of stamp duty on lands transfered to young farmers.  We propose for a two year period that no stamp duty will be levied on such transfers.  This would provide an immediate incentive to transfer lands to young farmers in the next two years.  Tens of thousands of acres of land in the country are underutilised because this land is in the hands of elderly farmers who are unable to work the land properly and <Col N="961" /> many of them have no identifiable successor taking an interest in their holdings. Our proposal on stamp duty, its abolition on transfers to young farmers for two years, combined with a proper farm pension scheme, which we do not have at the moment, could effect a massive transfer of land in a short time to hundreds of young trained farmers all over the country. It is only by harnessing the energies and talents of young people that Irish agriculture will prosper.  Our proposal is a positive step in that direction.  In this amendment the Government propose to delete our proposal.</P>
    <P>Our cattle breeding herd is now at a critically low level.  There were 70,000 more cows slaughtered this year than would have happened in a normal year. This is very damaging to our future ability to produce milk and beef, the staple products of our agricultural industry. Fine Gael propose to introduce a breeding stock allowance in the income tax code to give farmers a strong financial incentive to build up their herds again.  In this amendment the Government propose to delete this measure.  They are against that also.</P>
    <P>We propose to abolish agricultural rates.  This tax is based on our archaic land values.  It takes no account of family circumstances.  A man with ten children pays as much rates as a man with none. It is highly regressive, being paid in full in a bad year by a farmer when he has not got an income but being accepted as an income tax payment in a good year by a farmer when he has an income on which he is paying tax.  Rates cost him hardly anything in a good year and he has to pay the full amount of rates in a bad year when he has not got an income.  We propose to do away with the bovine disease levy and the resource tax, neither of which should ever have been introduced.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy D'Arcy's activities in Wexford are getting so much under the skin of the Minister of State.  Fine Gael are putting forward in this debate positive proposals.  The Government have not put forward any proposals in this debate.  The six measures we are putting forward are the committed policy upon which we will act in Government. They were discussed and agreed upon at a two day meeting of our parliamentary party.  They reflect discussions we have been having in the special agricultural groups we have established in each constituency.  They reflect a response to a detailed discussion paper published by this party in September and circulated to every branch of the IFA, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers.  The proposals we put forward here tonight are consistent with our vigorous parliamentary opposition to the evils we now seek to correct.  They are consistent with our strenuous opposition to the bovine disease levy in 1979 and with our opposition in this House to the various agricultural rates Bills which deprive the smaller farmers of rates relief and with the amendments to the Finance Bill to eliminate resource tax and grant capital allowances for breeding stock.</P>

      <P>This motion is a culmination of months of work.  Therefore, we will not accept its defeat by the whipped Fianna Fáil majority here tonight.  We will fight by every means in our power between now and the next general election for the six proposals we are putting forward here tonight.  We will seek the support of the farming organisations.  We have already had a meeting with one of the most important farming organisations, Macra na Feirme, in this House this evening to discuss those proposals and we will be discussing the six proposals we have put forward with all the other farming organisations in the next ten days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government may think that, by their reluctant, heavy-hearted majority of Deputies coming in here to vote against their conscience in voting against these measures, that they will kill these measures.  They may hope that as a result of the division here tonight they will have heard the end to what we are proposing. I assure them that they will continue to hear about the six proposals we are putting <Col N="964" /> forward for agriculture every day of the week from now until the general election. I assure the Deputies on the far side that their action in voting against those six proposals in the interest of the Irish farmers will be a large nail in the coffin of their Government's loss of their seats in the forthcoming general election.  We have something which we can justly fight for.  We have a policy for agriculture.  The Government have not a policy.  They have nothing to offer.  I am confident that when the election comes and when the people judge the attitude of the two parties and the way they voted on this motion, their verdict will be in favour of us on this side of the House.</P>

This regulation ceased to be operative on 1 January 1980 in respect of new schemes. However, payments totalling £490,808 were made in 1980 in respect of group water schemes previously accepted.</P>
      <P>In July 1980 the EEC Council of Agricultural Ministers adopted a new Regulation 1820/80/EEC which provides for the stimulation of agricultural development in the less-favoured areas of the west of Ireland.  These areas include the Counties of Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo and parts of Counties of Cork and Limerick.  Pursuant to the new regulation, a programme has been submitted to the Commission and, if it is accepted, I hope to be in a position to announce early in 1981 the implementation of an improved grant structure for group water schemes in these areas.</P>

I cannot at present say when I will be in a position to convey approval to the preparation of contract documents for this scheme or to the subsequent seeking of tenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason a reconstruction grant, due since February 1980, has not been paid to a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; when he intends to pay this grant; and the reason no acknowledgement or reply issued to this person's letters of 5 September, 23 October and 15 November 1980.</P>

      <P>A grant could not be paid without a final inspection to establish whether the work had been satisfactorily completed. The applicant wrote to my Department on 5 August 1980 saying that the work had been virtually completed but there is no record, despite an exhaustive search, of any subsequent notification that the work had been fully completed. An inspection will now be arranged with a view to payment of a grant, if in order.</P>
