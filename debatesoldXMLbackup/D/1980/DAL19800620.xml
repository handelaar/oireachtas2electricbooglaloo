      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take the estimates for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual estimates debate has by tradition been the occasion for a review of recent and current Irish activity in the field of foreign policy.  I do not have the opportunity today to give an exhaustive account of all our activities over the past year, but it would be useful to state briefly the basic aims of our policy and <Col N="1335" /> to focus on some major areas of current concern which, in one way or another, affect us all as citizens and are of particular significance at present.</P>
    <P>A basic aim of our foreign policy is to work as far as we can towards a more peaceful, stable and just international order. We also want to protect our sovereignty and independence and to promote the economic well-being of our people.</P>
    <P>If we are to pursue these broader foreign aims as we should, however, we have a particular need to work for peace and reconciliation within the island of Ireland.  I would begin therefore with a reference to the problem of Northern Ireland in so far as it comes within my area of concern as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Taoiseach has already elaborated the overall objectives of the Government, both in regard to Northern Ireland itself and to the broader issues affecting Anglo-Irish relations.  His address to the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis on 16 February and his statement before the Dáil on 29 May set out clearly the Government's continuing preoccupations with Northern Ireland and their commitment to the pursuit of a peaceful, comprehensive and lasting settlement of the problem.  Consequently, there is little need for me to go into detail here on the Government's carefully considered approach to the kind of settlement that we desire.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs I have had a series of meetings with British Government Ministers since I assumed responsibility as Minister for Foreign Affairs. On 15 April, I had discussions in Dublin with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Humphrey Atkins.  Prior to that, I met the Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, in London on 4 March.  These contacts were very useful and constructive, and enabled me to draw attention to the necessity to find a lasting solution to the problem of Northern Ireland on the basis set out by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>On 21 May I accompanied the Taoiseach to London where he met <Col N="1336" /> Prime Minister Thatcher.  As a result of that meeting both the Irish and British Governments are now agreed on the wish to develop closer political co-operation between them.  It is our hope that through heightened political co-operation our two Governments can create a new framework within which it will be possible to find a way of settling the Northern Ireland problem on a basis of peace and reconciliation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The British Government are fully aware of our view that an expression by them of interest in the ultimate achievement of Irish unity, by agreement and in peace, would open the way to an entirely new situation in which lasting peace would become an attainable reality. Such a declaration would in particular modify the negative effect of the existing British guarantee to the Unionist population of Northern Ireland, a guarantee whose constant unqualified repetition we consider to be a barrier to significant political progress.</P>
    <P>A major obstacle to progress towards reconciliation is, however, the continuation of violence.  Recourse to violence over the years has not only added to the legacy of human tragedy on this island, it has also intensified the sentiments of hatred and bigotry and has served to undermine the just and legitimate aspiration to eventual Irish unity.</P>
    <P>In our desire to alleviate economic and social problems in Northern Ireland and to contribute to progress in particularly disadvantaged regions, we attach special importance to cross-Border co-operation.  This is a significant area of my responsibility in respect of which the funds provided for in the Estimates have been maintained at last year's level.</P>
    <P>I can report continuing progress in this area.  Following the completion in 1977 of the Derry-Donegal report and the recent completion of three other cross-Border studies, namely the Erne Catchment Study, the Newry-Dundalk Study and the Mourne Fishery Study, we have now built up a comprehensive profile of the Border areas.  The details and data which are now available as a consequence of these reports will be of <Col N="1337" /> considerable use in pursuing a co-ordinated approach to the development of these areas.  The creation of a special non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund under which Irish Border areas North and South will benefit is of particular significance.  I am hopeful that these proposals will involve a programme of action in the Border counties in the fields of tourism and artisan activities which can be finalised in the next few months and brought into operation as soon as possible.  Aid has also been made available to cross-Border drainage schemes by the EEC specifically in respect of the Ulster Blackwater and the Finn-Lackey.</P>
    <P>The support of the British and Irish Governments for cross-Border economic co-operation was endorsed at my meeting in April with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Mr. Atkins. In the coming months we will be keeping in close liaison with the interested parties in the Border areas and with the authorities in Belfast in the follow-up actions to be taken in the context of these various reports.</P>
    <P>The murder of Lord Mountbatten in August last caused a regrettable anti-Irish reflex in the British popular press. Irish people were rightly offended by this outburst of prejudice.  However the coverage of Irish affairs in most of the serious British press as well as in the international press, in the past year, was of a quite different quality.  It was, on the whole, balanced and fair-minded.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile to remind the House of the distinction between popular news reports of a sensational character which inevitably focus on unfortunate instances of violence, and more serious reporting and editorial comment, which reflects the considered opinions of the newspaper concerned.  Last year, despite the publicity accorded to a few violent incidents, editorial comment in the foreign media was in the main reasonable in tone and sympathetic in content to the views and policies of the Government.  My Department will continue this year their vigorous efforts to <Col N="1338" /> encourage a positive reflection of Irish affairs in the world media.</P>
    <P>In addition to contacts with the foreign media my Department and our embassies keep people abroad aware of developments here and aspects of Irish life about which they might not otherwise learn.</P>
    <P>Our good standing abroad as a stable, progressive country is important for its own sake as well as being crucial to the success of our promotional work in the fields of investment from abroad, exports and tourism.</P>
    <P>A selection of factual material and articles on subjects of interest to people abroad is presented in a monthly publication <i>Ireland Today,</i> which has a foreign circulation of about 17,500, and in <i>Facts about Ireland,</i> an updated edition of which will be available shortly. The publication this year of some further booklets in the <i>Aspects of Ireland</i> series, which gives foreign readers a general introduction to Irish culture, and of other information material is also planned. The lending of films on request by our embassies and the showing of suitable short films on a non-commercial basis to foreign audiences is another useful way of presenting information about Ireland. This year prints of some new films and extra prints of the most popular films already in stock are being purchased.</P>
    <P>Support for Irish cultural activities abroad which enhance our prestige is provided from the grant-in-aid for cultural relations.  Priority is given to the development of relations with other member states of the European Community, for example through cultural agreements.  Agreements already negotiated with Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece and Spain will shortly be signed.  This year's grant-in-aid of £270,000 includes a special provision of £120,000 for the recent <i>Sense of Ireland</i> festival in London.  The impact of that project on the British capital has enhanced the country's stature, North and South, in the eyes of many people there.</P>
    <P>In order to give Members of the Oireachtas and the public generally an <Col N="1339" /> opportunity to see what is being done in this area it has been decided to resume the practice of presenting to the Oireachtas annual reports of the activities of the Cultural Relations Committee, which advises me about the allocation of funds from the grant-in-aid. Copies of the report for 1979 are now in the Library.  I would like to take the opportunity to thank members of the committee for their assistance and in particular to express my appreciation for the excellent work of the outgoing chairman, Dr. Tarlach O'Raifeartaigh, who presided over the committee for seven years.</P>
    <P>In the broader international area the world as we enter the decade of the 1980's is an uncertain and insecure place.  Internationally we face great political instability and economic uncertainty and stagnation.  There is a scarcity of some resources and an insecurity about continuity of supply of some raw materials.  Political distrust threatens a new cycle in the arms race and looks like replacing what could have been an era of co-operation and negotiation internationally with a prolonged period of confrontation and perhaps conflict. Every country in the world is affected by these problems and none can escape their effects.  It is not possible for a small state like our own to be able to influence the external world decisively by its own actions.  But Ireland does not today act in isolation.  We face the world in partnership within the European Community and we seek together to confront common problems.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal briefly with some further areas of particular concern to us at present.  First, there is Afghanistan.  We are all aware that a major crisis has arisen in the south Asian region as a result of the Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan in December last.  We think it vital that this crisis be managed and controlled and that contacts between the major powers be maintained and used to ease tensions. We believe that every possible effort must be made to avoid conflict and to <Col N="1340" /> reduce the dangers of confrontation which could lead to conflict.</P>
    <P>At the same time we must be clear in stating our view of what has happened in Afghanistan.  The Soviet intervention is a breach of basic principles set out in the United Nations Charter and other international documents which require respect for the independence of every state and preclude intervention by one state in an attempt to dominate another. That the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was not in accord with the wishes of the Afghanistan people is clearly evident from their continuing resistance to the Soviet forces against great odds.</P>
    <P>It is our position that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Afghanistan and that there should be an end to all foreign interference in that country so that its people will be free to determine their own future in full independence. Ireland, together with its partners in the Community, has tried for several months now to promote a solution through an arrangement which would allow Afghanistan, by its own decision, to return to its traditional position as a neutral and non-aligned state living in conditions of peace and security with its neighbours.</P>
    <P>A second major problem is that in Iran where American diplomats and other American citizens are still being held hostage after more than seven months.  We fully respect the rights of the people of Iran but we categorically condemn the holding of these hostages. As the Taoiseach put it, &ldquo;We hold this action to be inherently wrong and incapable of being justified by any claim of grievances by Iran against the United States.  The holding of any hostages is wrong and cruel, and the holding of diplomatic hostages destroys the very basis of civilised contact between nations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland, through its embassy in Tehran, has taken an active part from the outset in conjunction with other Community countries in diplomatic efforts to secure the release of the hostages.  More recently we have joined <Col N="1341" /> our partners in a series of measures to apply economic as well as diplomatic pressure on the authorities in Iran.  Our aim is to convince them through the means open to us that the continuing breach of the fundamental principles governing relations between states is a matter of deep concern to the whole international community and not merely to the country most directly affected. We would like to be able to resume normal exchanges with Iran.  But this will be possible only if Iran for its part respects fully the basic principles of international law and diplomatic relations.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a third topic, the broader question of the Middle East. Like many political problems that of the Middle East is a conflict of rights.  In the effort to resolve that conflict of rights we believe that certain basic principles must be accepted&mdash;for example, that of the non-acquisition of territory by force and the self-determination of peoples.  The aim of Ireland and that of the European Community in regard to the Middle East has been the promotion of a negotiated settlement which will guarantee the rights of all states and peoples in the region including that of Israel and of the Palestinian people.  Our policy remains firmly based on these principles which we believe apply equally to all the parties concerned.  Their acceptance of them is essential to a just, durable and comprehensive settlement of a conflict which is now more than 30 years old in an area of great strategic significance where continuing instability and the danger of a wider conflict could have effects far beyond the region and therefore concern the international community as a whole.</P>
    <P>At Venice last week Ireland together with its partners reiterated the two basic principles which I have just enumerated, the right of all states in the region including Israel to security and the need for justice for all the peoples implying recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people.  Deputies will be aware that in their efforts to promote such a settlement the European Council decided that the Nine should undertake a range of contacts with all the parties concerned to <Col N="1342" /> ascertain their positions in regard to the principles which I have mentioned and which were set out in the declaration issued in Venice on 12-13 June.  In the light of these contacts it is the intention of the Nine to decide more specifically on the actions which they can take to contribute in more concrete terms to the achievement of a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>In turning to a fourth area of concern, Africa, I think it right to say that the accession to independence of Zimbabwe provided the international community with an example of a settlement to a long drawn out and bitter conflict which was achieved through patience, persistence and good faith in a comprehensive negotiation.  I personally had the pleasure and honour of attending the independence celebrations in Zimbabwe. In the period before independence Ireland and the Community encouraged and supported Britain's efforts at achieving a negotiated settlement.  We are also ready in whatever way we can to help consolidate independence in Zimbabwe and to help it develop as a stable, just and prosperous multiracial society.  We all hope that Zimbabwe will be an example for the resolution of the major remaining problems in Namibia and South Africa where it is plain that the attempt to guarantee the rights of the white minority by the continued violation of fundamental principles and the abridgement of basic human rights threaten Southern Africa with the horror of a racial war.  Indeed in recent days it is plain that the continued repression which is an inherent product of the apartheid system is already sharpening conflict in South Africa itself.</P>
    <P>I should now like to say something about our activities at the United Nations. Under successive Governments the UN has been a primary forum for the conduct of Irish foreign policy.  Our membership of the United Nations gives us an opportunity to maintain and develop our contacts with the wider international community and particularly with the Third World.  In addition, in recent years we have been consulting <Col N="1343" /> closely with our partners in the European Community on most issues before the UN General Assembly to try to work out common Nine positions with them.  The country holding the presidency of the Nine co-ordinates this work at the United Nations and during the recent 34th session of the Assembly this task fell to Ireland.  The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs in his capacity as President of the Nine addressed the General Assembly on 25 September last giving Nine views on major world issues.  In committee and plenary debates the Irish delegation co-ordinated the Nine in drafting statements and explanations of vote which were then delivered by the Irish delegation. In addition we were frequently required to maintain contact with other groups in the name of the Nine on particular issues.  I believe that our delegation carried out this task effectively.</P>
    <P>I should mention in the context of our UN membership that on Tuesday last the Security Council renewed for a further six months the mandate of the UN Interim Force in the Lebanon&mdash;UNIFIL.  I need hardly remind the House of the sacrifices our soldiers have made earlier this year in the Lebanon in the cause of peace.  In the course of its most recent resolution adopted earlier this week the Security Council strongly condemned all actions contrary to the provisions of the mandate, and, in particular, continued acts of violence that prevent UNIFIL's fulfilment of the mandate.</P>
    <P>The UN Conference on the Law of the Sea is continuing.  The conference was convened, as Deputies will be aware, to review, codify and develop the existing international law relating to the sea, to consider new issues related thereto and to deal with the establishment of an equitable international regime for the area of the deep seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The enormous task which this conference undertook will therefore be appreciated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> It often appears to those who are not following the negotiations closely that nothing is being achieved.  However, in reality considerable progress has been made on most of the wide range of issues under discussion and it is probably true to say that a large proportion of the provisions in the negotiating text is virtually agreed.  Some issues remain which are the subject of intensive negotiation and these issues must be resolved before the conference can be concluded.</P>
    <P>My Department are also actively involved in the negotiations on the delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Ireland and Britain.  When agreement could not be reached on this issue we proposed the establishment of an arbitral tribunal to adjudicate in the matter.  Britain has now agreed that the matter should be resolved by an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration tribunal composed of five members.</P>
    <P>Our Presidency of the Council of the European Communities saw the acceptance of a package of proposals arising out of the six-year long &ldquo;Tokyo&rdquo; round of multilateral trade negotiations.  Internally, the presidency sought to facilitate the establishment of a working relationship with the new directly elected Parliament and, of course, was occupied with seeking a solution to the British budgetary problem.</P>
    <P>The settlement of the British budgetary problem involves a reduction in the net contribution of the United Kingdom to the Community by an average of about £866 million a year for 1980 and 1981.  The Irish contribution to the £866 million will be of the order of £8 million a year.  This additional contribution by us must be looked at in the light of our overall position.  Recent Commission estimates show net receipts to Ireland from the budget as being of the order of £360 million in 1980. Though we have a comparatively small population, we are the second highest net recipients from the budget, and these receipts will increase in 1981 by a figure which is estimated to be up to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Turning now to international co-operation <Col N="1345" /> for development, and in particular, to our official aid for developing countries, the total amount allocated this year is £16.22 million, which represents an increase of approximately 12 per cent over the amount available last year.  This includes large increases in our multilateral aid commitments especially as regards the European Development Fund.</P>
    <P>There is the Grant-in-Aid to the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, which provides a necessary link between the voluntary agencies and my Department and which makes a crucial input into many projects.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant event this year in relation to our development co-operation programme was the establishment of the National Advisory Council, whose 30 members, drawn from a wide spectrum of Irish society, who represent experience and expertise in many fields, will advise me on issues of development co-operation.  It is of crucial importance to involve the many different sectors of society in our development co-operation programme and I am confident that the council will be of invaluable assistance to the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the wider context of international economic co-operation because this is an important year for the North-South dialogue and the growing co-operation between developed and developing countries.</P>
    <P>Global events may at times seem a little remote from our own national concerns, but it would be naïve to imagine that we can ignore them without consequence. We live in an increasingly interdependent world.  The problems all countries face and the opportunities there are for tackling these can be fully appreciated only in a global context. What has become very clear in the past decade is the interlocking nature of the problems and prospects of both developed and developing countries. Neither side can hope to overcome the difficulties it faces on its own.  The next few years may be crucial in determining whether or not the international community is capable of responding adequately <Col N="1346" /> to what will without doubt be one of the major challenges of the eighties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer my condolences and those of my party to the wife and family of Paul Keating who served this country so well during his entire career.</P>
      <P>It is clear that all foreign policy in the past year has been distinguished by monumental blunders and spectacular failures on the part of the present administration. Time does not permit me to go into all the aspects but I have selected a few principal areas on which I will concentrate this morning.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Middle East, on Wednesday the Taoiseach referred to the Middle East declaration of the European Summit as being carefully balanced.  This is in marked contrast to the Bahrein communiqué issued on behalf of the Government by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last February.  That we as a neutral nation with troops in a peace-keeping role in the area should put ourselves so far out on a limb is incomprehensible and raises serious questions as to whether we can afford the luxury of having Deputy Lenihan continue in the Foreign Affairs portfolio speaking on behalf of the nation and causing major damage to our credibility and interests.</P>
      <P>It is indeed interesting that in his remarks this morning, when he referred to the Middle East, he did not refer to the Bahrein communiqué and sheltered behind the Venice declaration.  I do not know if this indicates a back-tracking on his part but it is important that there should be a clear, national policy in regard to the Middle East, in particular, because of our interests there and because of the lives of our 700 citizens serving in a peace-keeping capacity there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a policy would need some time to expound but it is important that the Minister should bear in mind the fact that any recognition of the PLO there should involve a formal renunciation of links with the IRA, should involve nonacceptance on our part of the Palestinian covenant, which calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and should, in fact, include a guarantee to the territorial integrity <Col N="1347" /> and security of the pre-1967 borders of the state of Israel.  It should include a special appreciation of the sensitive situation of the city of Jerusalem and, in particular, it should be aimed at strengthening the moderate elements in the Palestinian movement.  Unfortunately of late there has been a tendency for the radical elements to take over more control in the direction of policy towards terrorist activities as opposed to diplomatic and political initiatives.</P>
    <P>I felt very particularly that the unequivocal recognition by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Bahrein of the PLO gave comfort and support to the radical elements in the Palestinian movement.  A further aspect which has to be borne in mind is our situation with Israel.  We have a lot of problems with Israel particularly in view of their support for the Haddad militia and in view of the fact that they are not helping in carrying out the mandate in Southern Lebanon.  From that point of view I feel very strongly that there is a great need to have an exchange of resident ambassadors between Dublin and Tel Aviv at the present time which would permit the necessary communication to take place between our respective countries.</P>
    <P>Another major failure of the present administration is in regard to the Third World.  The failure of the Government to honour their commitments to the Third World is both short-sighted and reprehensible.  The Minister pleads budgetary constraints and balance of payments problems.  The Minister for Finance both in Opposition and in Government gave clear and specific undertakings that despite such considerations our obligations in this regard would be met.  In providing for a shortfall of £5 million in the current year the Government have quite simply welched on their commitments.  The result will be, apart from the immediate damage caused to various development programmes in developing countries, that the fund of goodwill built up in recent years amongst those nations will be wiped out. We gained considerably in economic <Col N="1348" /> terms from being involved in aid programmes.  There most certainly is a trade spin-off from aid.  Even at this level it is so short-sighted to damage the possibility of progress in that area.</P>
    <P>I noted in the Minister's statement the reference to making available £80,000, which will be announced later in the day for emergency relief in regard to Cambodia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Afghanistan.  Of course, this is only a drop in the ocean and I do not say that this nation can provide a major contribution to the problem.  At the same time we can give the lead, but bearing in mind that the Minister's own Estimates provide for a reduction from £500,000 to £200,000 in the area of disaster relief we can see how the Government and the Minister have tied our hands in regard to giving a reasonable lead here.  The sum of £80,000 which he mentioned is derisory in regard to the huge problem that exist in Kampuchea, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Afghanistan.  In the latter country alone I gather that there is now a total of almost one million refugees fleeing from the Soviet invasion.  In Zimbabwe there is the threat of starvation and famine in rural areas before the month of October, in Uganda the removal of Amin and the huge problems that exist now in that war-torn country, and in regard to Kampuchea there is the sickening situation of people being driven from their homeland and the continuing conflict there.  I will return to that if time permits.</P>
    <P>In regard to the EEC the most notable aspect in recent times was the Taoiseach organising as a propaganda stunt the conference at Dublin Airport on the return of Ministers Lenihan and MacSharry following the conclusion of negotiations on the UK budget contribution and the farm package.  Of course he failed to reveal the full facts in his efforts to portray as a shining success what could be regarded as abject failure.  To settle the UK budget problem our Government agreed that we would contribute £16 million in ease of the British taxpayer. Have we lost sight of reality when we agree to pay EEC bills for our richer <Col N="1349" /> neighbour, this despite the clear prior assurance of the Taoiseach that the settlement would not involve any financial burden for us as the poorest nation in the EEC?  The attempt by the Taoiseach in his report on the Venice Summit and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs today to hide the facts in the overall figures of the EEC is ludricuous.  We joined the EEC on certain terms.  We paid the price for joining.  We lost 75,000 industrial jobs because we accepted the regime imposed by the EEC.  To suggest that merely because we are now getting our due entitlement under other headings&mdash;in some of these we are not&mdash;is an excuse for us putting our hands into our pockets and paying to keep the British taxpayer happy about the EEC is ridiculous. Furthermore, the farm package in its net terms is going to mean a net loss of incomes for farmers for the second year in a row of at least 15 per cent.  It is bad enough to have failed so bady in representing our interests in Europe, but surely it is adding insult to injury to misrepresent the results in this fashion.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few remarks about the Olympics.  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan brought a response from the entire free world which response in all cases was positive and definite.  Here the Government dithered in an inconsistent and indecisive fashion.  Various Ministers swung from clear statements in favour of participation in Moscow to sitting on the fence where they teetered for some time until ultimately the Government at the last moment adopted the Fine Gael policy issued at the start of the year.  In the meantime our athletes at home did not know where they stood and again in international circles our credibility suffered.</P>
    <P>The complete catalogue of the mismanagement of our foreign policy by the present Government would require a full debate on foreign policy.  It is interesting this morning to find the Minister in some difficulty in getting through his own statement because of the shortage of time. It is vital in the interest of the country that we should have a full debate which <Col N="1350" /> would permit the Government to present their case fully and to defend themselves against the many legitimate criticisms being made of it and at the same time to permit the Opposition not just to criticise but to present constructive alternatives. The time factors involved in a short discussion here do not permit the delicate and sensitive areas to be explored in the detail which they require.  We requested this debate a number of times and it has not been arranged.  In general one can only comment in general terms.  It appears that, from Rockall to the jettisoning of our claim to an exclusive 50-mile limit, the much-heralded major diplomatic initiative that was to be launched in Northern Ireland and in all other areas, our foreign policy has been in very unsafe and unsure hands since the present administration took office.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I want to refer to a couple of other areas.  I am concerned particularly about the situation in El Salvador at the moment where the continuing depression is something that we as a small nation should be concerned about.  It appears also that in the past we have not pursued the policy in regard to condemnation of denial of human rights in a sufficiently definite manner.  As a small and neutral nation we are in a unique position to take an initiative in this regard.  In regard to El Salvador there is a mass of evidence available of the continuing repression by the regime there.  One has to say clearly that this repression is aided by the fact that that regime receives aid and arms from the US Administration.  I feel very strongly that in that situation we have a duty to bring home to the US that we do not approve of their continuing to arm and aid the regime in that fashion and that we condemn it utterly and we call on them to discontinue their efforts.  I have no doubt that American foreign policy in propping up right-wing repressive regimes is providing an open door for a subsequent left-wing communist regime.  To the ordinary person in Cuba the difference under Battista and under Castro is nil.  While the US continue with that kind of policy they are only encouraging the setting up of <Col N="1351" /> totalitarian communist dictatorships.</P>
    <P>Wherever we see breaches of human rights of citizens of any country, no matter what the political hue of the regime practising those denials, we have a duty to condemn.  I suggest that we have even a further duty.  We could be taking a greater initiative in this whole area of human rights.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of areas such as Kampuchea.  When there is a great outcry and the news from those areas is flashed on television screens, there is a response from our people.  They are encouraged, mainly through the voluntary organisations, to contribute substantially. Indeed, in contrast to the record of the Government in the current year, it is clear that the Irish are open-hearted, sensitive to the problems existing in other areas and willing to contribute what they can.  It is important to put on record that we, as a nation, should not be judged solely on the mean and tight fisted policy of the present administration, which does not represent the outlook of our people who when called on are more than generous in their contributions by way of aid to various organisations operating in the Third World.</P>
    <P>At the same time there is the difficulty that when the major news stories are taken off the television screens the problem continues and this is particularly relevant in regard to Kampuchea, where the entire race is in danger of extinction. Many refugees from that country are perhaps being forced to return home where very probably what a waits them is torture and death.  There must be a continuing recognition of the problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>There is also at the moment the problem of South Africa.  Indeed, over the last few days we have seen the tactics of the authorities resulting in very many deaths and injuries.  This highlights again the continuing injustice in that country, which calls for a response from this country&mdash;not a response in monetary terms but a voicing of our opinion at every possible opportunity about the apartheid policies of that nation and the oppressive <Col N="1352" /> actions of their regimes.  It involves looking at the people who have been courageous enough to stand up to the regime and who are now suffering as a result.  One in particular is Nelson Mandela, to whom I referred in this House some months ago, who is now serving the sixteenth year of a life sentence passed on him because of his efforts on behalf of his people.  We must continue to remember people like him and to remember that merely making an individual protest is not sufficient.  We must continue in a sustained fashion to voice our condemnation of practices such as are being continued in South Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In that situation I have not the opportunity of going into many other aspects to which I should like to refer.  I shall finish on a personal point which rather highlights the problems of the Third World resulting from the cutbacks today.  It comes from a letter from one of our people who went to Kenya in September of last year and is teaching in a school there.  She says that the cut in her salary is 20 per cent.  Her salary was £80 a month and is now cut back to £50.  She wants to know why she, who is trying to do her bit in the Third World and has been willing to accept what here would be considered a very small salary of £80 a month, because of the Government's attitude has to accept such a substantial cut in an already very small salary because of the mean and tightfisted approach of our Government on the question of Third World aid.  This is just one example of the very many genuine people who volunteer for service in the Third World and are trying to do their bit in a personal capacity and representing their country in that area and highlights the whole problem.  This should not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude by making a last appeal for a rethink.  In the name of this nation, let us hold our heads high in regard to the Third World.  Let us discharge our commitments and put back now the £5 million that should be additional to these <Col N="1353" /> Estimates.  The figure should be £21 million and is only £16 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that I, like the previous two speakers, am constricted in time and will not be able to talk about all the issues concerned, or, indeed, to discuss the issues in the depth that many of them require.  Briefly, this must be a review which on reflection will be very inadequate.  If I miss out points it will not be through lack of interest but because of shortage of time.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party are particularly concerned with the apparent drift of our foreign policy since the change within this present administration of personnel from one Department to another.  I say that in front of the Minister, whose personality is well known and liked in this House but who is accountable here purely for his political actions.  I say with all seriousness that we are frankly concerned with the way in which our foreign policy in substance and spirit, has been drifting since the internal reshuffle within the present Fianna Fáil government.  The position in many instances does not appear to have changed but in the way in which things are presented and pursued &mdash;whether in relation to our attitude to the conflict between the superpowers or in relation to commitments to our overseas development co-operation programme&mdash;there has undoubtedly been a considerable change in this House in the pursuit of foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may very well say that a small country like Ireland is indulging itself to a certain extent and that Opposition Deputies are indulging themselves to a certain extent in asking questions and demanding what the Minister is doing about this country or that issue.  Proportionately, international affairs concern small countries like Ireland very much more than they do large countries.  We cannot afford to ignore international affairs. We are at the mercy of international events in a way which does not affect large countries.  Economically we <Col N="1354" /> already know that interdependence with the rest of the world and politically the profile and structure of the world's economic order is very much determined by the political attitudes adopted by particular countries.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, from its very foundation and certainly from the time that it became a party of this House, under the leadership of Tom Johnson, consistently and courageously pursued a policy of fundamental non-alignment and neutrality.  The other two parties, in varying forms, adopted that position at the outset of the Second World War in 1939, and for a variety of reasons have held fast to it, but for reasons which do not necessarily go much deeper than a certain degree of pragmatism.  If the Minister is annoyed or concerned as to why so often the question of our position on neutrality is raised in this House it is because in certain issues&mdash;and I will come to them specifically&mdash;we seem to be moving a way from the fundamental spirit of that position which has the support of the Labour Party and I believe, the wholehearted support of our people. Neutrality is not a question of being morally indifferent to, or morally agnostic about the fundamental issues confronting the world.  It is a logical outcome of a state which has striven to obtain its own independence over many years.  It would be a total renunciation of our entire struggle for independence if, having gained statehood and independence in our own right, we would turn around and throw in our lot in terms of foreign policy with one bloc or another.</P>
    <P>In the next 20 years of the century, the changes in world economic order to be brought about by the pressures, north and south of the economic equator, if not the actual equator, will be such that, unless we pursue vigorously, in concert with like-minded nations within the EEC, within the European community of nations outside the EEC itself and with other countries throughout the world, our capacity to influence events, our position will not then be secure.  Our position will be determined largely by how vigorously we pursue a clear-sighted and well-founded foreign policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> We cannot talk in terms of economic justice of reasonable trading relations with countries of the Third World when there are oppressive regimes within them which are gaining support from either the United States or from the Soviet Union, if we appear to give some kind of consent to that position by virtue of our silence.  The process of world history has shown that oppressed peoples do not go a way in the pursuit of justice and that, ultimately, they achieve a degree of independence and liberalisation.  We have seen that in all of southern Africa to date.</P>
    <P>I was confronted with that particular reality when, at a meeting of EEC observers with the Zanu PF representatives after the Zimbabwe election, a German Christian Democrat asked the Zanu PF representative, Mr. S. Muzenda, what their relations would be with the EEC. His response was: &ldquo;Gentlemen, we have been fighting a war for the past seven years.  It is very nice of you to express an interest in us now, and to be concerned about whom we will be trading with&rdquo;. For that reason, whether it is El Salvador, Namibia, Kampuchea or any other place, the small voice of Ireland, which hopefully will be enhanced in the coming year by a seat on the United Nations Security Council, should not sing silent for fear that we might be out of harmony with our EEC partners, President Carter, Chairman Brezhnev or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Ultimately we may become dependent on a large number of other countries like ourselves.  It is no longer enough to say that our position on international affairs is well known and that we are respected. The courageous stand of Frank Aiken to the admission of Red China to the United Nations and to the test ban treaty is not so much in evidence now in the United Nations Assembly.  Our relations with many Third world countries relate to that period and certainly not to the present.  I would like to think we would return to that spirit of independence and neutrality and not hide behind a silence.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the North-South dialogue, whether it is within the context of the Brandt Report or the <Col N="1356" /> Special Assembly starting on 25 August, is of particular importance to this country.  In conjunction with the Benelux countries we have a far greater dependency on trade than any other EEC state.  The nature of many of our industries is such that we will be in severe competition with industrialising nations in South-East Asia and in parts of Latin America for certain products. The IDA strategy in relation to attracting certain kinds of industry could be up-ended within five to ten years because of economic development internationally.</P>
    <P>We have to be actively and vigorously involved in the question of the North-South dialogue even with the small voice and leverage we have.  If we ignore it, saying a small country like Ireland cannot do very much, we do so at our peril. I recognise the limited leverage this Government have as an individual Government and the stronger leverage they have within the Nine.  But I do not think the process of EPC, which is useful and constructive, should be allowed to divert us from the need to clearly establish an Irish profile as well as a component profile within the process of EPC.  They are not contradictory positions. There are many times when the skills of diplomacy have to be brought to bear in reconciling them but I seem to detect an abandonment of one in favour of the other.  If the Minister corrects me on that, I will be more than pleased to accept it.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of issues touched on by the Minister.  On the question of the Middle East, the Bahrain statement, the Venice Declaration and the whole sorry, sordid, vicious and horrendous position of the continuous war that has been fought in the Middle East since 1948, I believe Ireland as well as the other EEC countries, has perceptibly moved her position.  We moved for one reason&mdash;oil.  Prior to 1973 nobody was saying the Palestinians had a right to a homeland or to self-determination until the oil producing countries took the energy-short European Community by the neck and extracted the kind of turnaround <Col N="1357" /> in spirit that is now taking place.  As a result the Israeli people have been driven into a more absolute and determined position, and with some reason.</P>
    <P>The Jewish people remember what happened to them the last time there was an international economic crisis.  They remember the last time capitalism went through a catharsis and near collapse in 1929 and they became the scapegoat for the so-called economic ills and collapse of a particular country.  With all the personal damage that happened to these people in that first holocaust, is it any wonder the Israelis have adopted what I regard as a totally intransigent attitude in certain areas, whether it is in relation to the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people or the settlement on the West Bank?</P>
    <P>So long as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the EEC, say the Palestinians have an increasing role or an increasing right&mdash;whatever way you put it, the impact is the same in Tel Aviv or in Jerusalem&mdash;without telling them that they must amend the covenant and that they cannot have as a basic objective the absolute eradication of the Jewish people and of the state of Israel, how can we expect these people to sit down and discuss this matter?  Regrettably there is no counter-balancing evidence in the way we read the document that that kind of request and pressure has been put on the PLO.  As recently as six months ago the EI Fatah Organisation met.  Why should they change that part of their charter?  So far they have been doing very well without amending it.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the state of Israel which are totally unacceptable but, without making excuses, they have been driven into a position which is now being consolidated by the present approach of the EEC.  Many Israelis involved in decision-making remember the last time Europe forgot about the Jews, when people were silent from 1933 on.  It is not enough to say Israel has the right to live within secure boundaries.  It is essential to state also that no organisation have the right to say one of their objectives <Col N="1358" /> is the elimination of another State.</P>
    <P>On Afghanistan and the Moscow Olympics, the record makes sad and sorry reading.  The Minister's response to questions on 22 February asking whether our athletes would attend the games&mdash;in which I was not able to participate unfortunately&mdash;are Gilbertian. The record shows this.  As far as the chairman of the International Olympic Committee, Lord Killanin, is concerned, meaningful games will take place in Moscow this year.  Much fewer than three-quarters of the nations&mdash;the figure given by the Minister last February&mdash;will be abstaining.  The majority of nations will be participating. Despite the assurances and statements made by the Minister in February the Irish Government's advice was that our athletes should not go.  In that context Ireland was seen to be part of the western alliance, part of a group of countries participating in one bloc and not in another.  We have forfeited the profile of neutrality and independence which we sought for so many years to maintain.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement in regard to Iran and we fully support the efforts being made to try to restore some degree of international contact with the State of Iran.  The way in which the whole Iranian people rose against the Shah and the repressive regime which was backed substantially in every conceivable way by the US, had unfortunate consequences which have been compounded by the reality of a presidential election in the US.  International relations and the Iranian position in regard to the hostages have not been helped by the action President Carter has taken, purely for domestic opinion poll requirements. International security and the well-being of our people have been put at risk because of the domestic political considerations of the President of the United States.  We will lose our profile of independence unless we say that the position of the hostages is untenable but that the United States should not aggravate the situation by such means as <Col N="1359" /> the doomed military raid.  We can say this to the United Nations without losing their confidence and without becoming in any way anti-American.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by dealing with the question of development co-operation and the extension of the North-South dialogue.  The Government decision to cut back on all Government spending was badly handled by the Minister in relation to the bilateral aid programme.  I would question whether there was any fight to defend it.  The bilateral aid programme was thrown to the wolves and the Minister is no amateur or novice in dealing with Government Estimates which from time to time, because of budgetary constraints, have to be cut down.  When an Act dealing with public information is passed the records will show that there was only a minimal defence of the bilateral aid programme, if there was such a defence at all.  The effect of the abandonment of the bilateral aid programme is that our credibility in certain countries, particularly Tanzania, is open to question.  We now have a development co-operation officer there who does not know what funds will be available except in regard to one rural development project which may start in the second half of this year.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party welcomed the commitment given in opposition by the then Deputy O'Kennedy to the bilateral aid programme and the overall commitment in budgetary terms to our development co-operation programme.  When the last Government went through a severe budgetary crisis caused by the earlier oil crisis there was the same sort of raid on development co-operation, for the simple reason that there is no constituency involved in this.  However, the public outcry with which the Minister has now been confronted, regrettably only in the newspapers, is evidence that there is support for our aid programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that the resources needed by APSO will be made available and that the cut-back will now be staved off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met the executive of APSO and they have been reassured that I will be in a position to work within the ambit of the overall allocation in the area of overseas development assistance to ensure that existing bilateral commitments and the personal service activities of APSO will be maintained.  I have assured the House that the important aspect in the budget is the overall figure of £16.23 million which is an increase of 12 per cent on the allocation for last year.  By using commonsense and a flexible approach there could be movement of funds within the various areas under the umbrella of the total allocation so that existing commitments will be met.  By reason of budgetary constraints I freely admit that we will not be able to embark on new projects in the current year, but we will maintain existing projects and meet existing commitments. It is important to remember that there has been an increase of 12 per cent in the total aid programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foreign policy of a small country must be in accordance with the general principle of enlightened self-interest.  We must seek to ensure as far as possible that an enlightened approach and the self-interest of the nation coincide and that balance is maintained.  That has been our consistent approach within the European Economic Community.  By way of referendum the Irish people decided by an overwhelming majority to join the EEC and that decision has been proved right.  The essence of our approach within the Community is to make sure that the institutions work as effectively as possible.  That must be our overriding concern as a substantial net beneficiary of the Community in practical terms.  It is in the interests of the world as a whole that the Community should function in a sensible and constructive manner.  The countries of Europe which have been ravaged by wars over the centuries have now embarked on this totally new experiment and it is very important that it should succeed.  It is especially important for Ireland since we are net beneficiaries in the financial sense.  As I said in my opening <Col N="1361" /> remarks it is estimated that we will benefit to the extent of approximately £360 million in net financial terms in the current year, 1980, and indications are that there will be an increase of approximately 30 per cent on that figure for 1981.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is important for us that Community institutions work.  The nearest that Community institutions have come to a breakdown has been in recent months arising out of the controversy over the British contribution to the budget.  We saw it as being of paramount interest to us to secure a resolution of that matter.  We played our part in ensuring that it was brought to a successful conclusion recently.  In our view the fact that the resolution of the matter resulted in Ireland having to pay a small additional sum&mdash;in the current year of approximately £7 million and next year in the region of £9 million, making a total of approximately £16 million over two years&mdash;was a very small price to pay in respect of a country benefiting to the extent of £360 million in the current year, and as part of a package involving £75 million in agricultural aids along with additional funds from a west of Ireland package, arising out of the resolution of the sheep meat controversy and also the unlocking of the non-quota section of regional fund aid.  Altogether these would bring in, in approximate terms, additional benefits of £100 million to us in the current year. Therefore, side by side with resolving the controversy that tended to wreck the Community and its institutions&mdash;and was on the way to doing that&mdash;we reaped substantial financial gains.  That is what I mean by pursuing a policy of enlightened self-interest.</P>
    <P>Similarly throughout the rest of our foreign policy areas we have followed a policy along those lines.  In regard to the Middle East, which has been mentioned here, obviously it is right and proper, from the enlightened point of view, that there be peace in the Middle East.  If there is not peace in the Middle East we are tending towards a world war situation. Let us be blunt and frank about it: <Col N="1362" /> it is the most dangerous area at present right around the globe in terms of a potential, serious war situation. Therefore, from the enlightened point of view, it is essential to secure peace there by way of a negotiated peace settlement. This means sitting people around a table as they represent nations and peoples. This means getting the PLO around the table.  This means getting the Israelis around the table.  This means getting the big powers around the table.  This means ensuring that a negotiated peace settlement is hammered out that recognises the essential integrity of Israel as a State within the boundaries of Israel as they existed prior to 1967.  This involves recognising the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the right of the Palestinian people to be settled within boundaries within which they can grow and develop as a State themselves.  This envisages the right of Jordan to continue to exist as a State, the right of the Lebanon, the right of Syria, Iraq and Egypt, all of the countries involved in the Middle East, to exist as a State&mdash;such a peace settlement to be ensured and agreed to by the big powers.</P>
    <P>That is the enlightened approach and is precisely our approach to the matter. What I said in Bahrain does not differ one whit from what has been said by the President of France, what has been said by the Chancellor of West Germany, what has been said by all of the other leaders in Europe, and what was agreed to in Venice last week by the Leaders of Europe gathered together.  Again there is a coincidence here&mdash;which I regard as fundamental to diplomacy, as I mentioned earlier&mdash;between enlightenment and national self-interest.  It is also in our national self-interest that there be peace in the Middle East, that there be trade and commerce between the Middle East, Ireland and Western Europe generally.  It is right and proper also from the practical point of view that there be the exchange between Europe and the Middle East involving Europe's export of technology, expertise and goods to the Middle East, and the Middle East itself exporting oil and whatever goods it may <Col N="1363" /> have in a proper, balanced and sensible way to Western Europe.  There is a mutual identity of interest in the development of trade and commerce at every level, from the practical to the service, to the technology level.  There is an identity between self-interest as far as Europe is concerned, as far as Ireland is concerned and the enlightened approach at the same time.  Again that is what diplomacy must endeavour to achieve.  Similarly in regard to Afghanistan&mdash;and this is the Community attitude to which we fully subscribe&mdash;it is essential to ensure a state of neutrality in Afghanistan, to ensure that the Russians withdraw, that there be agreement by the powers to guarantee a neutral Afghanistan, unaligned and free from any of the power bloc associations.  Again that is in the interest of Afghanistan and of the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about our associations with and attitudes towards countries where dictatorships exist.  Unfortunately in the world&mdash;and the world is a difficult place in which to live&mdash;it is a fact of life that the great majority of countries at present are either Right Wing or Left Wing dictatorships.  Unfortunately we have to live in a world of that kind.  Whether it be Soviet Russia on the one hand or EI Salvador on the other all of these dictatorships exist and function as viable States.  However we deplore the type of government or administration, we have to work with them within the United Nations; we have to do business with them in trade and commerce and, in some cases we have to recognise them from the point of view of diplomacy.  It is important to remember that.  We just cannot go around the world wearing the conscience of the world on our sleeve.  We have to do practical business with these people.  The only Community to which we do belong, thankfully, is the EEC in which every single country is a working parliamentary democracy.  To that extent we are aligned, within that Community, with people of like-minded philosophies, psychologists and a like-minded approach to a way of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I should like to emphasise that as far as our approach to Northern Ireland is concerned, we will continue a policy that seeks to promote and emphasise the mutual self-interest of Ireland, Britain and Northern Ireland in the settlement of this matter.  Again this amounts to an identity between self-interest and enlightenment.  It is right and proper that this problem be settled from the point of view of the world at large, from the point of view of establishing peace in this island.  It is also in the mutual self-interest of both of these islands that this matter be settled, to remove this incubus that is frustrating trade, commerce and economic development, to remove this incubus that is damaging not just Britain and Ireland but the whole of Western Europe and North America by reason of the strategic significance of the island of Ireland where it is located in the Atlantic. Here again I want to emphasise that as far as the British Government, the people of Northern Ireland and ourselves are concerned, to look at this in a practical way is now the imperative of our time, to look at this in a practical way as far as the self-interest of the peoples of these islands are concerned because there is far more that unites us than divides us within these two islands as a whole.  Looked at with that attitude and in that practical way it does not make sense to continue this barrier across this island that continues to cause troubles, discord, loss of life, loss of property, a continuing haemorrhage, draining away financial resources as far as the peoples of the two islands are concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards what I have outlined in the various areas with which foreign affairs is concerned, I have tried to demonstrate adherence by me to policies of enlightenment and self-interest, trying to ensure a balance in which both can be identified and pursued in a coherent manner.</P>

      <P>I propose to combine the original Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate, which I will move later, for the purpose of explaining the financial provisions.

The combined capital and non-capital provisions, totalling £677,850,000, are offset by appropriations-in-aid which are estimated at £42,800,000.

    <P>Increase in pay costs account for £124.8 million, that is, over four-fifths of the total increase.  Budgetary increases in the rates of cash allowances account for £5.8 million, that is £1 million in respect of the extra three months cost in 1980 of the increases in rates approved as from <Col N="1366" /> April 1979 and £4.8 million for the 1980 budget increases.  The balance of £21.75 million is attributable to extra costs in 1980 arising from improvements and developments of services in 1979, including changes in entitlement to services as from 6 April, 1979, the commissioning of new units of accommodation in 1979 and 1980 and provision for price increases in 1980.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-In-Aid are estimated to produce £42.8 million in 1980 as compared with £35.8 million for 1979. The increase of £7 million is due largely to extra income which is expected to be realised from the scheme of pay-related health contributions which was introduced from 6 April, 1979.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate accounts for £93.19 million of the increase in Vote requirements between 1979 and 1980.  A total of £88.39 million of this is needed to meet the cost of pay settlements for nurses and others.  The balance of £4.8 million represents the estimated cost of adjustments in rates of cash allowances provided for in the 1980 budget.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, increases in expenditure on pay for health services personnel account for £124.8 million of the increase in the non-capital Vote requirements between 1979 and 1980.  Of this total, £36.4 million is due to the extra full year cost of pay increases approved in 1979, including pay adjustments associated with the national understanding. Recent pay awards for nurses will give rise to grant requirements of £76.3 million in 1980 and the balance of £12.1 million is required to fund health agencies in respect of the cost of pay awards for certain medical, para-medical, non-nursing and administrative grades.</P>
    <P>The overall capital allocation for health services amounts to £28 million for 1980, of which £27.5 million is being provided under subhead K of the Health Vote.  The capital allocation for 1979 was £27.5 million.  I will refer later to some of the projects on which this money is being spent.</P>
    <P>In a year in which the Government <Col N="1367" /> have had to take many difficult decisions in relation to public expenditure generally it was inevitable that some financial constraints would have to be imposed in the health area giving rise in turn to difficulties for those involved directly in the provision of services. Health services are labour intensive and have been subjected for some time now to considerable demands for improvements in conditions of service for personnel. The figures which I have given show how big a proportion of the extra money we have this year will go to meet these demands.</P>
    <P>The health services are there to meet needs which are of great importance to individuals and we are continuously under pressure in attempting from available resources not only to maintain existing levels of service, but also to make improvements to cover perceived gaps. They create new demands which can often be very expensive to meet.  The phenomenon of rapidly increasing costs and the demands for increased levels of service is not peculiar to our country.  It applies internationally and the resultant financial problems cause concern in countries with far greater resources than are at our command.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties of the economic situation the Government have made available a reasonable share of overall Exchequer resources to finance health services in 1980.  Before we take account of the large sum provided for in the Supplementary Estimate which I will move, about 20 per cent of the total non-capital Exchequer requirements are allocated to health. This compares with 18 per cent in 1975.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of the very sizeable additional expenditure which has to be faced in 1980 to meet the cost of special pay claims, such as those provided for in the Supplementary Estimate which I will move, it will be appreciated that the Government have agreed to a commitment of a very sizeable share of national resources to meeting the cost of health services in 1980&mdash;indeed the greatest share that has <Col N="1368" /> been provided in any year up to this point of time.  This must be accepted as a positive demonstration by the Government of an acceptance of the need to provide the best possible services that can be provided from our national resources.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the services themselves and deal with a number of recent improvements and with policies for the future.  I will commence by reflecting on some of the groups who require and deserve our special attention. First, the elderly.  At present, there are over 350,000 people aged 65 and over living in this country.  Some 13,000 elderly people are in long-stay care.  That means that most of our older people are continuing to live in their normal environment.</P>
    <P>My policy for the elderly is to encourage them and to help them to stay in their own homes and in their own communities, to help them remain healthy and independent, and to encourage them to use their talents for their own and other people's benefit.  Voluntary organisations in association with the health boards play the vital role in the provisions of these services.</P>
    <P>While much valuable work has been done and continues to be done, I am in no way complacent about the services for the elderly.  There is still, in too many cases, too wide a difference between the quality of life of the elderly and those who are in the working population. Many people on retiring from work are not able to cope with the change and this affects their health.  Many of our old suffer from isolation and loneliness and many do not use the services which are there to be used.</P>
    <P>We need all the time to review the role of our elderly in the community as a whole.  With the structure of families nowadays the traditional cherished position of the old person has been steadily eroded and I am afraid that we have not been very successful in coming up with alternatives ways to make sure that a person does not become stigmatised and written off purely because of the number of years he or she has spent in this <Col N="1369" /> world.  I would hope, therefore, not only to improve services where this is necessary but to bring about a somewhat different attitude to old people, both in their own perception of themselves and in the perception which others have of them.</P>
    <P>During this year I will be establishing a National Council for the Aged.  I hope that this body will not only draw together the many groups who are working with and for the aged but will help to put a new perspective on how we can help the elderly to cope with their problems and to take the opportunities which their leisure time affords them.</P>
    <P>During this year also the Health Education Bureau will be publishing a booklet which will reinforce the positive aspects of ageing and give very useful advice to people on how best to maintain their health in their older years.  This book emphasise that being old does not necessarily mean being dependent.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Health boards are carrying out a review of the effectiveness of two services which have great significance for older people, that is home helps and meals-on-wheels.  The objective of this review is to ensure that the service being provided is relevant and that it is done in a way which is both effective and acceptable.</P>
    <P>Next year will be the International Year for Disabled Persons.  There will no doubt be many opportunities over the next year-and-a-half to discuss this whole problem and I do not intend to dwell very long on it here today.  However, I sincerely hope that through all of our efforts the process of accepting and integrating the handicapped person into our community will be considerably advanced as a result of what happens during the year.  I will shortly be setting up a national committee to co-ordinate and promote the objective of the International Year for Disabled Persons.  The committee will give a consderable amount of attention to considering how our attitudes to the handicapped can be improved so that the normalisation which the handicapped greatly desire <Col N="1370" /> will come closer to realisation.  I expect to be in a position to announce the membership of the national committee within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>I have recently reconstituted the National Rehabilitation Board, which has a key role to play in furthering the well-being of the handicapped person in the community.  I hope that the board can function as an effective co-ordinating body, as a setter of standards, and as a catalyst in improving the quality of life of the handicapped person.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the handicapped, I acknowledge the major contribution being made to the improvement of our facilities by the moneys made available from the European Social Fund.  In the current year, we have been allocated £8.2 million.  This represents an increase of £2.1 million over 1979 and brings the total amount we have received to £25 million.  It has been particularly gratifying to see community workshops developed throughout the country, bringing to reality a concept which is particularly geared to the needs of the rural community.</P>
    <P>Since 1974, my Department have exercised a lead responsibility in relation to services for children.  In 1975 the Task Force on Child Care Services submitted an interim report.  The implementation of the recommendations of that report is now almost completed.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the final report of the task force, and to prepare for the major work that remains to be done in this area, the Government have strengthened my Department both at ministerial and official level.  Deputy Tom Nolan, Minister of State, has been assigned a special responsibility for children and family services.  As soon as the Task Force on Child Care reports we will be in a position to respond quickly and to prepare the new Children's Bill which has been long awaited.  I have no doubt that the implementation of the task force report will also involve a strengthening of the services both in the community and in residential facilities.  I assure the House that the Government will continue to give this task the very highest priority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> It is generally agreed that any health services which can be provided in the community should be provided there rather than in hospitals or other institutions. For one thing, the cost of institutional treatment continues to grow and anything which can be done to minimise the impact of this cost is of course desirable.  The cost factor is not, however, the only one nor even the most important.  It is now generally accepted that it is in the individual's interest to be treated in the community where this is possible, and I am continuing to approach the problem of the provision of services by strengthening so far as possible the community care services which will enable treatment to be provided outside institutions.</P>
    <P>With this in mind we have recently started a review of the organisation within the health boards for the delivery of community care services.  This review, which is under the direction of a steering committee comprising representatives of my Department and the health boards, will begin with a review of the existing organisation by a firm of consultants. They will be reporting on the effectiveness of the present organisation of community care services, on how this is functioning and will involve discussions with the staffs providing the services to obtain their views on the manner in which it is working.</P>
    <P>We are also undertaking at present a review of the general practitioner maternity and infant care service.  It is appropriate at this stage to re-examine this scheme, which has been in operation since 1956, and to establish whether there are improvements which could be made in its operation.</P>
    <P>Medical card holders and their dependants have for a number of years past been entitled to dental services. However, it proved difficult to recruit sufficient numbers of dental staff in the public dental service to meet the expanding needs and to enable a satisfactory service to be provided for the eligible medical card holders and their dependants. During 1979 a working party, <Col N="1372" /> representative of the health boards, the Irish Dental Association and the Department of Health, examined the existing dental services and made representations about the manner in which they might be improved.</P>
    <P>Arising from this report a scheme was introduced in November 1979 under which the health boards referred eligible persons from their waiting lists to private dental practitioners who had agreed to provide services under the scheme.  The scheme operated successfully for some months, but the Irish Dental Association have in recent months indicated that they do not wish to continue with it until certain matters concerned with fees under the Social Welfare scheme are brought to a conclusion.  I have put proposals to the association and I hope that these matters can now be resolved quickly and that the association will be willing to participate fully again in this scheme, which has been extremely effective in reducing the lengthy waiting lists for dental treatment which had existed in almost all health board areas.</P>
    <P>In September 1979 a new scheme was introduced providing for sight tests for medical card holders and their adult dependants.  Formerly such persons had to attend at health board clinics to have their eyes tested.  Under the new scheme sight tests can also be obtained, at the patients' choice, from ophthalmic surgeons or ophthalmic opticians in private practice.  The new scheme has been very effective in reducing the waiting lists for ophthalmic services, which were until then common in all health board areas.</P>
    <P>At the same time new arrangements were introduced for the supply of spectacles. Previously these were obtainable only from contracting opticians, generally one per county.  New spectacles can be obtained readily from any practising optician who is in the scheme. These new arrangements are proving very acceptable, particularly to elderly and other patients who find it difficult to arrange travel to central clinics for fittings, adjustments or repairs.</P>
    <P>The general medical service currently provides a choice of general practitioner <Col N="1373" /> for the 1.2 million people who are eligible for this service.  It is a service which operates effectively and I receive very few complaints about it either from those for whom it is provided or from the doctors who are actually providing the service. It is estimated that it will cost £54 million in 1980, of which about £25.5 million is accounted for by the cost of drugs.  The high cost of drugs continues to be a matter of concern to me and I am perhaps more concerned with the excessive and increasing recourse to drugs by the population as a whole.  This has serious implications for health and welfare.  I will be asking the Health Education Bureau to pay particular attention this year to the area of drug consumption.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on drugs in the health services is at a relatively high level&mdash;estimated to total £50 million in 1980.  This is the subject of detailed investigations at present and I will be pushing for measures aimed at reducing the high costs which we have to meet.</P>
    <P>We are continuing to expand the facilities available to enable community health services to be provided effectively. Seven new health centres are expected to be completed during the current year and the planning of 17 others is in hand. Attention is also being paid to the provision of accommodation for community care teams so that these will be capable of effectively delivering services.</P>
    <P>In relation to hospital services, the total sum provided in the public capital programme for hospital and other health projects in 1980 is £28 million.  As I indicated earlier, £27.5 million of this will come from the Exchequer, the balance coming from the Hospitals Trust Fund. The total of £28 million compares with £27.5 million in 1979, £21.5 million in 1978 and £16 million in 1977.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £28 million for the current year was fixed having regard to the general constraints on public expenditure this year and made it necessary to review activity on the capital side generally and to impose a degree of constraint on the overall hospital and health building programme.  However, despite <Col N="1374" /> these difficulties I am satisfied that considerable progress has been achieved in our hospital development programme.</P>
    <P>In the last three years the implementation of the programme of general hospital development gathered new force and saw the Government's policy of providing as rapidly as possible the most modern hospital service for our people proceeding with vigour.  During that time the construction of the new hospitals at Beaumont in Dublin and in Tralee was begun and is now very well advanced, as is the construction of the major development of Letterkenny General Hospital. In other parts of the country the planning of the development of general hospitals has reached the final stages in many instances.</P>
    <P>Construction of the developed Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital in Dublin will commence this year.  The planning of the hospital projects at Cavan, Castlebar, Mullingar, Sligo and Ardkeen in Waterford is at an advanced stage.  At the same time the planning of the development of Galway Regional Hospital and Wexford and Kilkenny hospitals is being pursued.  Planning is also going ahead for the provision of maternity units at Limerick Regional Hospital and at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and for a new medical department at Tullamore hospital.  Preliminary planning for the development of James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, and Portlaoise hospital has also commenced.</P>
    <P>Therefore, despite the current financial restraints, the momentum gained in the implementation of the programme of general hospital development has been maintained and will continue until our agreed aims are fully achieved.</P>
    <P>This year, following consultation with all the bodies involved, I made the necessary order for the establishment of the board which will plan, build and administer the new hospital at Tallaght. The board will include representatives of the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals in Dublin, the Eastern Health Board and the University of Dublin.  I am now <Col N="1375" /> about to appoint the members to the board so that it can begin its work without any further delay.  Agreement has also been reached with Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council for a suitable site which would be made available at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Another matter which remains to be resolved is the future organisation of general hospital services in south-east Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The matter is complex and I have decided, to enable the views of the hospital authorities providing services in the area to be taken fully into account, that examination of the matter could best be undertaken by a group comprising representatives of my Department, the Eastern Health Board, and the hospital authority for St. Columcille's, Loughlinstown, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire.  I expect the group to commence its work shortly.</P>
    <P>Another area in which final decisions were outstanding was the future organisation of specialist services in Cork city.  With the opening of the new Cork Regional Hospital at Wilton in 1978 it was essential, to ensure the proper future rationalisation and development of general hospital services in the area, that a detailed study of the specialist services required and how they should be provided and organised should be undertaken.  Consequently, a group representative of my Department, the Southern Health board, the Cork Voluntary Hospitals Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal and University College, Cork, was established late last year to carry out this task.  This group has now reported to me, setting out its recommendations for the short-term and long-term development of the services in the area.</P>
    <P>I believe that the recommendations contained in the report will make for an effective and comprehensive service in Cork city in the future and in the mean-time will allow the existing services to be developed in a rational manner.  I intend <Col N="1376" /> to have copies of the report made available to interested Deputies shortly.</P>
    <P>Apart from the major hospital developments already outlined other significant improvements have been undertaken in hospitals throughout the country over the past three years.  Time does not permit me to refer to these in detail but the projects were decided on following consultation between my Department and the hospital authorities and are generally in accordance with the priority afforded by these authorities.</P>
    <P>During the period 1961 to 1978 the number of patients treated in our acute hospitals rose from 266,000 to 512,000, an increase of 92 per cent.  This increase cannot be attributed to the increase in population as this was 19½ per cent over the same period.  There is no sign of a levelling off of these figures and, while the position has been contained to some extent by a reduction in the average length of stay in hospital, many hospitals have to cope with problems of regular overcrowding due to pressure on beds.</P>
    <P>The general hospital development programme will help to relieve pressure on hospital beds by providing improved accommodation in many areas. However, it would be unrealistic to believe that we can continue to provide and pay for additional hospital beds and facilities without any financial limit. Other developed countries are also faced with a similar problem.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a study by officers of my Department to try to find out the reasons for the rising rate of admissions and what measures could be taken to relieve the position&mdash;for example, whether greater emphasis needs to be placed on use of day-beds or five-day wards and the provision of treatment on an out-patient basis.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I circulated to all hospital authorities copies of two booklets published by my Department which were based on the report of a working group set up by my predecessor to consider the information needs of hospital patients and the arrangements for receiving people in hospital out-patient departments.  The main purpose <Col N="1377" /> of the two booklets is to direct attention to the need to provide all necessary and useful information to hospital patients before admission and the importance of receiving them courteously and helpfully. I might add that the issue of the booklets is not to be taken as a reflection on hospital managements but rather as an encouragement to improve still further the arrangements for receiving and furnishing information to hospital patients and their relatives.</P>
    <P>Since 6 April 1979 everybody has eligibility for hospital services other than the services of hospital consultants. Hospital services are now free of charge in a public ward or at a fixed charge in a private or semi-private ward of a public hospital.  Subsidies are paid towards the charges made in private hospitals.</P>
    <P>For the services of hospital consultants an income limit operates.  Persons below this income are entitled to get these services without charge.  Persons with income above the limit are liable for the fees of the consultants concerned.  I have recently increased this limit to £7,000 based on income for the year ended 5 April 1980.  Approximately 85 per cent of the population are within the limit and are entitled to full hospital services without charge.</P>
    <P>The remaining 15 per cent of the population can for a small premium insure against the cost of consultants' fees with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Consequently, we have in effect a comprehensive hospital service.  I have given some further data to Deputies in a hand-out and these are available to them for their comments on the Health Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps indicative of the entire performance of the Department of Health and the cut-backs they have suffered this year that the Minister in the time allotted to him was not even able to deliver his 21-page speech, managing only to get to the top of page 17.  The Minister did not circulate any statement for the information of Deputies.  He circulated a script which he was unable to read&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1378" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that correction. It is a script, not a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a script of what the Minister did not say.  Presumably, in his concluding remarks the Minister will complete his introductory remarks, which again is typical of the performance of the Department of Health over the past year.</P>
      <P>There has been a great interest in the health area among those who are in the health field and who are unfortunate enough to be called to the Department in this year of severe and stringent financial cut-backs.  The words of a children's song have become a common joke among the health boards and hospital board managements in the health services. The old song said: &ldquo;When you go down to the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise....&rdquo;  That is the only thing they are sure of when they go to the Department today or any day this year&mdash;a big surprise when they discover by how much the Department are insisting on the level of existing services being cut back, on hospital patients being cut back in the actual diet being provided for them, in starvation of capital funds.</P>
      <P>There is an increase of £500,000 on last year on an Estimate of £27.5 million, an increase in capital services in the health field of 1.8 per cent.  That is the increase in money terms.  Official figures now show inflation running at over 20 per cent.  Those with any experience in the building field know that since last January building costs have increased by 15 per cent and the Minister has given the health services an increase of 1.8 per cent against an inflation rate of 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Professional staff engaged on the forward planning, about which the Minister spoke so proudly, have had to be dismissed.  Work has ground to a halt. As far as I can see, in the capital field as regard health services, it is all planning and no action, no building.  We know that capital means building, provision of jobs and provision of facilities for extra services.  That has been torn up and scrapped by the Government this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> Each day the health activities of the Government become worse.  That is a poor boost for a new Minister when that complaint can be made to him six months after taking office.  Let us not forget that he took over from the man who is now Taoiseach and responsible for the overall economy.  The Minister was handed a Department in a situation where even if he wished to introduce improvements&mdash;I have no doubt that he would&mdash;he is unable in any way to introduce any real improvements in health services this year.  Things have been reduced to the ludicrous level, as we heard in the House some weeks ago, that the diet of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the Southern Health Board area has been cut.  The total contribution of the present Government and the new Minister for Health, as far as patients in the Cork psychiatric hospitals are concerned, is that they can no longer be given apples and oranges&mdash;not exactly what one might consider a luxury.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the non-capital services.  The Minister pointed out that the increase on last year's expenditure was £152 million, of which salaries and pay costs accounted for £124 million. That left a total net increase in the non-capital services, the day-to-day running of the health services, the health boards and the community services, of £28 million or 5.5 per cent.  Official figures show an inflation rate of 20 per cent and an increase in money terms of 5.5 per cent.  The result is a cut-back in the services being provided for the general population, a cut-back in the services being provided for inpatients and outpatients, loss of personnel, failure to appoint people to existing vacancies and a turndown in the health services generally.</P>
    <P>We have seen a situation which I never believed would happen in this country.  In the course of the last year of the previous Minister for Health and in the first year of the present Minister for Health the one group of people I never believed would take militant industrial action, and who always expressed the view that the last thing they wished to do <Col N="1380" /> was to engage in industrial action which might affect their patients, were forced by the recalcitrant attitude of the two Ministers for Health and the Government to take industrial action.  I am speaking about the nurses.  There have been many debates in the Houses over the last three years about the need to improve the pay, working conditions, employment opportunities and training of nurses.  The previous Minister for Health was warned by me that he was living dangerously with the nurses and that he was sitting on a powder keg which was likely to blow up in his face.  It blew up because we engaged during the last three years in a policy in the health field of putting on the long finger anything which was unpalatable and adopted as a short priority anything which obtained a high publicity aspect.</P>
    <P>The high publicity is gone and the previous Minister for Health is gone.  The present Minister is left with the sweepings. There is not a lot of high publicity emanating from the Custom House these days.  There are not a lot of promises or great undertakings these days.  There is not a lot of talk about the undertakings reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last January as having been given by the present Minister for Health that there would be not cut-backs whatsoever in health or social welfare.  He denied this undertaking in the House on 5 June last and his statements that day and today were clearly fallacious.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the promises which were given by the previous Minister for Health and by the Fianna Fáil Party in their election manifesto of 1977.  We do not hear about this document very often these days and it is not quoted very often by the other side of the House.  One of the undertakings given in that document was that an all-party committee of the House would be set up to advise the Minister for Health on health matters.  In volume 302, column 1065, of the Official Report for 8 December 1977, the former Minister for Health said:</P>
    <P>The committee of the House will be set up very shortly and I look forward <Col N="1381" /> to them performing a very useful and important role in the administration of the health services.</P>
    <P>The Minister actually refused to set up that committee as a committee of the House but a year later he appointed an all-party informal committee which was to advise him.  If we want any better indicator of the real degree of interest, we have only to look at how often that committee have been convened by their chairman, the Minister for Health.  In the three years the Government have been in office that committee had one meeting, which was the inaugural meeting at which no other business was conducted except the insistence by the former Minister for Health that he be appointed chairman.  The committee have not met since and there is no indication when they will meet.  According to the Directory of officials in the public service, a full-time officer in the Minister's Office is secretary to that all-party committee. That is that man's official title, but the committee have not met now for one and a half years and had not met during the previous one and a half years.</P>
    <P>An undertaking was also given in the manifesto to have a complete reorganisation of mental health services.  In the part of the Minister's statement which he did not read it is stated:</P>
    <P>This Government have been anxious to ensure that standards in existing services in psychiatric hospitals were maintained and that a reasonable degree of comfort was provided for patients.</P>
    <P>That is a far cry from the undertaking to completely reorganise the mental health services and it is also fallacious.  The greatest shame in the health field under successive Governments is that the level of services for patients in psychiatric hospitals has been and continues to be abysmally low and there has never been any real effort or commitment on the part of the Department of Health to separate the psychiatric and the mental handicap services.  Until that is done proper standards cannot be achieved in any of our psychiatric institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> In one of the largest psychiatric hospitals less than half the patients are receiving any form of therapeutic care. We are told that a reasonable degree of comfort is being provided for the patients.  Patients from St. Ita's hospital in Portrane used to be brought to a house donated to them in County Wexford for a holiday but this year they are denied their holiday because the Department of Health refused to sanction the payment of wages to the nurses who must accompany them.  That is the achievement of this Minister and of the Government in 1980.  The mental handicap long-stay patients in St. Ita's hospital, Portrane have been denied the one thing they have been looking forward to for a year&mdash;a week's holiday in County Wexford&mdash;because the Government are broke.</P>
    <P>For two years now we have been promised a new Bill on mental treatment. It has not appeared yet.  If the Minister had got an opportunity to read all of his speech he would have told us that it is to be circulated next week.  His predecessor promised it early last year, the middle of last year and late last year.  Since the present Minister took up office he has also been promising it.  I hope when it is circulated that it goes some way towards dealing with the problems of the mental handicap services and it deals with the question of setting up separate services, separate directors of mental handicap and psychiatric services.  I hope it provides a real level of service, comfort and therapeutic care for people in long-stay mental institutions.  I want to assure the Minister that if it does not provide those things it will receive a very stormy and lengthy passage through the House. If it is circulated next week it will not be discussed until next session.  I want to assure whoever is Minister for Health when this Bill comes before the House that if it does not contain the areas which I referred to it will receive a very stormy and rough passage through the House.</P>
    <P>Another promise given was that the Government would encourage the development of a Voluntary Health Insurance <Col N="1383" /> Scheme by substantial taxation allowances.  We have had three budgets up to now but we have not heard of that promise again.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some indication of the situation in relation to that undertaking.</P>
    <P>The most time taken up by Deputy O'Connell, by the former Minister for Health and by me in this House in the health field last year was the debate on the Government's Family Planning Bill. That Bill was passed a year ago and was signed by the President 11 months ago. But it is not yet in operation because the present Minister and his predecessor have not the courage to make the regulations to bring the Bill into force, because the entire Bill and its concept was, as the Minister's predecessor said, an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Government's solution to the Irish problem is, having spent many hours delaying this House in discussing this Bill, not to make regulations to implement the Bill and consequently not to bring down upon their shoulders the criticism of all of those who would be affected adversely by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not a very realistic way of approaching government.  It is not a great way of showing respect for the House and for the intelligence of the electorate, but it is certainly an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  Having applied the solution to the problem, you then do not implement the solution so that you cannot get yourself into any further trouble. Perhaps the Minister will let us know why after six months in office he has not yet managed to sign the regulations to bring that Act into force, or perhaps he will tell us whether he is going to make those regulations or whether that Act is to lie on the Statute Book inoperable for the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>The last debate in this House in which the Minister's predecessor participated was on the needs of the physically disabled. It was pointed out at that time that 1981 had been designated as the international year for the physically disabled. The Minister managed to get as <Col N="1384" /> far in his script as referring to the physically disabled.  He announced that he was setting up a national committee to co-ordinate and promote the objectives of the international year for disabled persons.  Since December 1979, when the House last discussed the position of disabled persons, there has been no real progress in most fields in relation to the ten points which I suggested were all achievable, many of which did not cost money.  I am going to reiterate them, despite the fact that once again we are in a situation where we are confined to 25 minutes to discuss the activities of one of the major Departments of Government.  That same situation applied last year and there has not been in this House in the three years since this Government took office a full debate on the Estimate for the Department of Health because of the refusal of the Government to allow time for that debate.  I am still going to take the additional time to speak about the needs of the disabled.  At that time in December I suggested that there was a need in ten areas which could be achievable.  They are as follows.</P>
    <P>(1)  Local authorities should be asked to prepare an indication of the number of physically disabled people on their housing lists, the number of specially designed houses in course of construction or planning for them and the number of modifications which they had carried out on existing dwellings.</P>
    <P>(2)  There should be a time limit established after which all public bodies would receive, if necessary, a financial cutback if they had not carried out modifications to their public buildings so as to make them acceptable to the physically disabled.</P>
    <P>(3)  A date should be set after which all transportation authorities would have financial restrictions imposed if they had not carried out modifications to their trains, boats, buses and planes so as to make them easily accessible to the physically disabled.</P>
    <P>(4)  All public bodies should be set, and made to achieve, an employment <Col N="1385" /> target so that they would employ a certain proportion of physically disabled persons in their organisations.  I see in yesterday's papers that there is some move in that regard in one small part of the public sector but not throughout the public service generally.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Department of Health, and the Government through their other Departments, should ensure that there are no excessive delays in the payment of the special grant for modification of private dwellings so as to allow them to be used by the physically disabled.</P>
    <P>(6)  The physical planning of all new buildings should contain by Government directive a planning condition that special provision be made in those buildings for the physically disabled.</P>
    <P>(7)  Ordinary schools should be modified so that children who are partially disabled and who at the moment are obliged to attend special schools would be able to participate fully in the life of their community and attend ordinary schools which they are so anxious to do.</P>
    <P>(8)  There should be some reasonable amount of spending money given to physically disabled people who are living in long-stay institutions and whose physical needs are catered for but who are left penniless and unable to participate in any way in their community as a result.</P>
    <P>(9)  Travel grants should be rationalised so as to encourage physically disabled people who are endeavouring to carry on full employment in the community.</P>
    <P>(10)  The Department of Labour rather than the Minister's Department, whether he realises it or not, are the employment agency for the physically disabled and the Department of Labour should be assigned that function rather than the Department of Health who clearly are unable to carry it out.</P>
    <P>Perhaps an indication of the Government's concern or otherwise for the physically disabled is best examplified when I remind the House that last July I <Col N="1386" /> attended a very pleasant function in the middle of my constituency which was the turning of a sod for the building of a new rehabilitation unit shelter workshop for the disabled in Swords, County Dublin.  The sod is still turned and there is a sign on the site and we will celebrate the first anniversary of that sod-turning next month.  There is a different Minister. He might like to come out and re-turn the sod.  Nothing further has happened since the day the Minister for Health had his photograph taken, his script circulated to the newspapers, his publicity achieved and we all went home happy. The Government have an interest in the physically disabled.  Let them get on with the rehabilitation site shelter workshop for Swords which they started 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the cut-backs in real terms.  Yesterday's newspapers tell us that the Southern Health Board have had a cut-back of £.5 million this year, the North-Western Health Board a cut-back of £1 million and the South-Eastern Health Board a cut-back of £1.5 million in their need for the running of their day-to-day services.  Virtually none of the health boards has been given an allocation for the carrying out of any new capital works whatsoever.  Only yesterday at Question Time I asked the Minister when it is proposed to sanction the extension to the school for handicapped children at the Dominican Convent, Cabra.  The Minister's answer was, &ldquo;While I am sympathetically disposed towards the project, I am not in a position to indicate at this stage when the building work can commence.  I will keep the matter under review&rdquo;.  The Dominican Convent, the handicapped children and this House do not want the Minister's sympathy.  They do now want the Minister's review.  They want the extension built.</P>
    <P>On June 5 I asked the Minister whether he would sanction the additional moneys to enable stage 2 of the programme for the Coolmine therapeutic community to be established properly.  The Minister's answer was, &ldquo;I regret that it will not be possible for me <Col N="1387" /> to make resources available in the current year to enable the Coolmine Lodge therapeutic community to commence fully this year&rdquo;.  The House does not want the Minister's regrets.  The House wants the Minister's action.  If the Minister is unable to obtain from his colleagues in Government sufficient money to carry on adequately the existing level of health services, never mind the improvements planned or the additional physical building and the additional facilities and services spoken about over the years, if the Minister has not enough muscle to get the money to have the existing level of services maintained, then there is one short of action open to him and it should be very obvious to all.</P>
    <P>It would be better if the Minister was to seek to get sufficient moneys to run the services rather than have carried out by his Department these insidious campaigns against the hospitals like St. Columcille's where every effort is being made to denigrate the services of that hospital and to run down the level of services being provided for the people of south and south-east County Dublin. That is not acceptable.  If the Minister has work to do, let him do it in getting sufficient money to have services maintained at present rather than endeavouring to close down existing services.  Let the Minister look at the operation at the out-patients' department which are urgently in need of attention.  Let the Minister remember that in 1970 when McKinsey recommended the setting up of the eight health boards he also recommended that their progress be reviewed after five years from the point of view of cost, effectiveness and efficiency.  They have been in operation now for ten years and no attempt has been made by the Minister's Department to carry out an investigation into the health boards, never mind into some of the other hospitals.  Let the Minister realise that one of the greatest social problems in our developing areas is the lack of health centres and the fact that health centres are arriving five and ten years after new communities with young families are in <Col N="1388" /> those areas.  Let him realise that day centres are needed for the elderly and that no attention whatsoever has been given to the area of the pre-school play groups with no standard and no training set down for the teachers in those groups.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister look at the area providing services for school children in the 12-16 age groups and let him provide the service which by law he is committed to providing in the infant welfare and school inspection services in rural Ireland.  Many children never receive that service which the Minister is obliged by law to provide.  Let us realise most of all that the Minister said, &ldquo;As Minister for Health I have very little influence over many of the factors which affect health&rdquo;.  At least he is truthful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The £635 million which has been allocated to the health service this year represents over £190 a year or over £3.50 a week for every man, woman and child in this country. Since 1978 expenditure on health has risen by 86 per cent.  We now have 7.3 per cent of our GNP allocated to the health service.  That is a statistic which places us among the big spenders on health care in the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question we should ask ourselves is, are we getting value for money in our health services?  Has this massive expenditure resulted in a corresponding increase in the quality of the health services and the health of the population as a whole?  In short, has more money meant more health?  Unfortunately, I would say no.  We have spiralling health expenditure co-existing with deteriorating health services, and the standard of health among the general public has remained static for the past ten years.  It is almost like throwing paper into a furnace. The more we spend, the less we are getting in return for it.  Despite this massive expenditure, we still have a very high incidence of mental handicap with over 4,000 people in dire need of proper institutional care.  We have the worst record on dental health anywhere in western Europe.  We still have 1,200 deaths of infants under the age of one <Col N="1389" /> and we have a further 800 stillbirths a year.  Many of our hospitals are Victorian ruins with staff having to put up with working conditions and overcrowding which no trade unionist would accept.  The conditions in some of our psychiatric institutions are appalling and they constitute a violation of basic human rights.</P>
    <P>Of course we can point with pride to the fact that 90 per cent of our population are entitled to free hospitalisation and 36 per cent to free general practitioner care.  However, a massive waiting list for everything from hip replacement operations to basic dental care indicates that all too often these are merely paper entitlements.  They may exist under the Health Act, 1970, but they do not exist in practice.  The simple point I am trying to emphasise here is that the benefits of massively increased health expenditure have failed to percolate down to the consumers of health care.  I do not envy the Minister for Health his task.  It seems that what we pour into it is not going to the consumer of health care, to the ordinary person in the community. There are a number of reasons for this, such as medicine relying on advance technology and highly skilled labour, both of which are very expensive.  Extension of medical care also leads to more demand for that care and this also leads to ever-increasing costs.  The priorities of health care have centred largely on hospitals and other institutions where costs are very high instead of on a proper system of community care and health education which seeks to cut down costs by keeping people out of expensive institutions.</P>
    <P>In 1979, 46 per cent, almost half the health expenditure, went on general hospitals alone and that is an enormous amount of money.  We have to look very carefully at the whole situation of health care and we must have a radical overhaul of our health services if we are to produce the health in our community that we are aiming at.  It will call for a Minister with great dynamism who will be able to bring about the necessary <Col N="1390" /> radical reform in the health services that will benefit the public as a whole.  The State at the moment is costing itself millions upon millions of pounds by its failure to develop community care services, particularly for the elderly.  It is a shortsighted policy to cut back on services such as public health, nurses, home helps and meals on wheels, the very services which can keep our elderly people out of institutional care, where costs range from £60 to £100 per week.</P>
    <P>The Government should be aiming to increase the prescribed maintenance allowance to a level which would encourage families to keep their parents out of these institutions.  We have the anomalous situation where the State pay £11.75 to a relative to keep an old person out of a home whereas if they let them go into the home it would cost from £60 to £100 a week.  One of the radical changes required is a proper £20 to £25 a week prescribed relative's allowance, to encourage people to keep their parents out of these institutions.</P>
    <P>Community care services for the mentally handicapped are also being neglected. A number of day centres have been forced to abandon their services through lack of funds.  This is causing a severe strain on families who are trying to cope with mentally handicapped people at home.  The community care idea also remains underdeveloped at the level of the local health centre.  These facilities should be developed as a halfway house between the home medicine cabinet and the hospital&mdash;a place where routine first aid and diagnostic services should be available without having to hospitalise people.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister has moved to streamline the out-patient facilities in hospitals.  This is an area of importance, but my point is that the basic concept of community health care and preventive medicine remains untried in this country. There is nothing in this Estimate to show differently, with the exception of some increases for the health education bureau.</P>
    <P>The issue I wish to concentrate on in the relatively short time available to me <Col N="1391" /> today is the neglect in the area of services for the mentally handicapped.  The question must be raised in this House as to whether these people's basic human rights are being catered for in our health services at present.  The mentally handicapped stand out as a prime example of this neglect.  Health planners have failed totally to take account of the fact that mentally handicapped people are living longer now than they did in the past and are requiring services and facilities for their care.</P>
    <P>The recently published Report of the Working Party on Services for the Mentally Handicapped states that there are 2,300 mentally handicapped persons in the community and that these are in need of residential care and an extra 2,500 mentally handicapped being kept in institutions where they do not belong&mdash;in psychiatric hospitals and geriatric hospitals which are totally unsuitable for the care of the mentally handicapped. There is an immediate need of well over 4,000 places in proper residential care for the mentally handicapped. The report argues that there is a large number of mentally handicapped people displaced, many people with mild conditions being cared for in homes who could be cared for in the community and a large number with severe handicaps who should be treated in residential centres. We could not just switch over and take those mentally handicapped people out of homes because we have not got the necessary community services for them. These services are not adequately developed.  You could not therefore do a magic trick with these figures.  There are a minimum of 4,000 mentally handicapped persons who require suitable care and we are not allocating the necessary funds for these facilities to be built.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding our mentally handicapped is being allowed to deteriorate to such an appalling extent that basic human rights are being violated.  This is particularly so with regard to the 2,500 mentally handicapped persons being kept in psychiatric hospitals in conditions to which a farmer <Col N="1392" /> would not subject his cattle.  If I may read from the report of the Association for the Rights of the Mentally Handicapped, as a result of a visit to one of these psychiatric hospitals, this is what they had to say:</P>
    <P>They sleep in a long, bare dormitory. The beds are old, mattresses sagging and the bed clothes did not look clean. Next to the dormitory there is a day room with bare furniture except for forms arranged around the walls.  The floors were very dirty, particularly near the walls where we noticed that the floor boards were rotting... The dining hall was a similar room. Rat holes were clearly in evidence... The stench of ancient urine-soaked floors was palpable...  The urinal regularly overflows and floods out onto the floor.</P>
    <P>That is a report on St. Ita's Hospital by the Association for the Rights of the Mentally Handicapped made in February 1979.  One could be excused for wondering whether that should have been 1879, because conditions in so many of our institutions for psychiatric patients are a throwback to that era.</P>
    <P>The most depressing aspect of all is that successive Governments have lacked the political will to come to grips with the problem and provide the necessary facilities for mentally-handicapped people.  Let us face it, the mentally handicapped are the last in the queue for Government funds when economic times are good and the first in the queue for the government cuts when economic times are bad.  They have no political clout.  They are not organised. They hardly represent a significant electoral block.  In short, given the way political economic priorities are established in this country, they do not count.</P>
    <P>Last year a paltry 144 new residential places were created for the 4,000-odd mentally-handicapped people in need of proper residential care.  It would take over 30 years to meet the existing need for facilities for the mentally-handicapped were we to continue at this present rate.  So we can forget about <Col N="1393" /> plans, reports and predictions.  We must talk about performance.  With a mere 144 new residential places created last year we can tell a parent with a child who is mentally-handicapped and needs residential care that we just might be able to accommodate him some time around the year 2010.</P>
    <P>The record on the community care side is even worse: 115 hostel places only were created for the mildly-mentally-handicapped capable of being catered for in the community.  At this snail-like pace it is absolutely inconceivable that a significant number of places can be opened up for residential care by removing those who can be cared for in the community because the facilities do not exist.  The Department of Health say they expect to create 240 residential places in 1980 and an extra ten hostel places, a target which still leaves services for the mentally-handicapped 20 years behind schedule.  I admit that this Government are not alone to blame.  I am not here attempting to score any political points.  But, if past Governments must share the blame, it is the present Government which must bear responsibility for action at present. Because of that I appeal to the Minister to make the needs of the mentally-handicapped a very special priority. Unless a Minister for Health does so at some point, these people will continue to be condemned to enduring a shadow existence, to lives which are a mere reflection of what living could and should be.</P>
    <P>The other area of the health services to which I should like to refer is the long-neglected question of psychiatric services. I am regularly receiving disturbing reports about conditions in St. Loman's, St. Ita's, St. Brendan's and other institutions throughout the country.  Psychiatric nurses working in St. Loman's Hospital had occasion to describe that institution as little better than a Victorian workhouse.  There are different categories of patients, from geriatrics, to acutely disturbed persons, to alcoholics, all lumped together in the same ward.  Conditions are so overcrowded that a billiard room had to be requisitioned <Col N="1394" /> as a ward and a storage closet as a recreation room.</P>
    <P>Another result of the overcrowding at that hospital is that patients have to be shifted from one bed to another, which means that a patient may find himself being taken out of his bed at 6.30 to 7 o'clock in the morning to make room for another patient moving in to have electro-convulsive therapy.  That is happening at St. Loman's Hospital at present. And, with one bath only for up to 40 patients, even basic hygiene is difficult to maintain.  St. Loman's Hospital has a mere 179 beds in adult wards and only 110 fully-trained staff to look after these inmates.  The situation is chronic. The staff shortages are so severe that on occasion school leavers have been left to look after seriously disturbed patients.</P>
    <P>Conditions at St. Ita's are little better with patients still being kept in wooden huts built over 80 years ago to house construction workers.  I have been speaking about these huts and the conditions at St. Ita's for the last ten years and I have found very little change.</P>
    <P>What can I say about St. Brendan's other than that it is literally falling apart? An engineer's report warned that the main building as well as units L, M and N must be evacuated and demolished.  It is a crying shame, and indeed an indictment of the inspector of mental hospitals that he inspected that hospital and ignored the dangerous conditions existing there.  When I went up to inspect it I could not believe that he could pass a hospital like that, where on one occasion four stone of ceiling fell in on a patient who was transferred to another hospital. The whole place is falling apart.  I was appalled to think that these, the most defenceless people of all, were being herded into places like this.</P>
    <P>What is the solution?  The Minister made an appeal on the grounds that psychiatric patients should be cared for at home in the community.  I quote him when he said:</P>
    <P>Today we cannot and must not allow our friends and relatives to be locked away from the world.  They are members of our own community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> Rightly so, and I commend him for those sentiments.  But, while I am in favour of community care for psychiatric patients, I must sound a warning.  Community care does not mean that we literally throw these people back into society after years and years of life in an institution because they simply would not be able to cope.  The only way in which they could be returned to the community is if there are proper services provided, half-way houses, to meet their needs.  These psychiatric patients whom we have institutionalised require support.  To throw them back into the community without the appropriate back-up services to give them that support would be totally irresponsible.  This message must be borne in mind as we debate the future of St. Brendan's.  Community care must not be used as a justification for running down our present residential psychiatric services.  What I am saying is that we cannot justify the appalling conditions in our psychiatric hospitals on the grounds that we are wasting money by keeping these institutions in proper repair.  We cannot do that.  We put these people into these institutions.  The very least we owe them is a basic, minimum standard of care which respects their decency and dignity as human beings.</P>
    <P>I brought to the attention of the Minister for Health reports to me from psychiatric nurses at St. Brendan's Hospital.  To give the House an idea of what conditions are like I might read some of their remarks: They say that harmless patients are being kept in the high security unit while dangerous patients are being dispersed to other wards.  After 5 o'clock in the afternoon there is one junior doctor only on duty, this also at the weekend, when there is only one senior doctor on call, who may be as far away as Dún Laoghaire from St. Brendan's.  The meals provided are not sufficient to maintain even a basic resistence to disease among patients. Breakfast consists of two slices of bread, porridge and weak tea.  These patients get nothing after 5 o'clock in the afternoon, nothing at all.  The problem is that many of these patients may require <Col N="1396" /> electro-convulsive therapy which is not administered until 12.30 to 1 p.m. the following day.  Therefore they are forced to fast from 5 o'clock in the afternoon until approximately 1 o'clock the following day.  That is appalling and something must be done to treat them as normal human beings.</P>
    <P>Again these psychiatric nurses reported to me that in one female unit at St. Brendan's Hospital, Unit O, young psychopaths are being kept with geriatric patients who literally fear for their lives. These are psychiatric nurses at the hospital who feel they want to have conditions improved, who want to help the patients but who feel they do not get the necessary leadership.  They do not know to whom they should refer their complaints. Another example of what I am talking about is that patients are drinking tea out of soup bowls.  These psychiatric nurses want improvements effected. They are demoralised by the situation obtaining.  In a letter to the Minister I appealed that something be done about those conditions as a matter of urgency. I am dwelling on this question of the mental health services because I feel something must be done about these most defenceless people in our society.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the question of medical cards.  An enormous proportion of our health expenditure goes to general hospitals.  We are encouraging this situation by cutting down on the entitlements to medical cards.  The present limit of eligibility for the medical card are totally unrealistic in the present inflationary age.</P>
    <P>There is gross discrimination against certain sections of the community, mainly those living in urban areas.  In the west and north west 50 or 60 per cent of the people are entitled to medical cards while in Dublin city 14 per cent are entitled to them.  This is due to the two methods used to determine eligibility&mdash;the notional system for farmers and the gross income for people in the urban areas.  As a result, people in urban areas are suffering tremendous hardship.  This accounts for the fact that <Col N="1397" /> so few people in the Dublin area are entitled to medical cards.  Last night ten people came to me because they had been deprived of their medical cards due to the changing guidelines.</P>
    <P>If we spent more money on the family doctor service we could keep people out of hospital and save money.  I am not advocating that more money be spent on the health service.  I am against that.  We could do more for our people by providing a proper health service without destroying the economy by devoting more money to primary health care.  This would call for a dynamic Minister and radical changes.  I hope the Minister will take into account the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that under the rules I cannot make a full speech, may I direct the Minister's attention to the continued development of three hospitals&mdash;Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar.  Will the Minister be prepared to sympathetically consider a new approach to the provision of hospital and health services for the people of Longford, a growing and progressive town?  Over the years I often wondered why the people of Countries Carlow and Longford have been so patient when they do not have up-to-date hospital services.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about cancer.  While we are debating statistics here there are hundreds of people dying in hospital of cancer.  What are we doing about educating the people about ways of preventing this disease?  What are we doing about cancer research?  What are we doing to provide sufficient publicity to educate people about cancer?  We should teach them that cancer is curable.  We do not have screening facilities or the proper approach to this matter. Throughout the world 17 million people out of 50 million people die each year from cancer and this figure will continue to rise.  What are we doing to educate people about preventative cancer measures and early diagnosis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of the thousands of <Col N="1398" /> people who are walking around and do not know they have cancer, what action will be taken to reduce the number of deaths from cancer?  This can be done by organisation.  A special section of the Department should deal solely with preventive cancer measures.  I intend making a speech on this Estimate and devoting it to one theme, that is, the practical steps to be taken in cancer treatment, the provision of early diagnosis and educating the people about cancer.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be contributing to this cause generously if he takes a courageous and practical approach to this disease.  Some people regard it as the death knell.  This is the wrong approach. Let us take the advice of the experts: cancer is curable.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the cancer experts who are doing a marvellous job.  They need more co-operation and should have closer international contacts with experts in the rest of Europe and the United States.  If the Minister tells us he will do something about this serious problem, I will fell that my contribution, however brief, was worthwhile.  He will have the deep gratitude of many thousands who are likely to fall victim to this serious disease.  I hope on a future occasion I may have the opportunity to deal more fully with this serious problem which needs to be courageously tackled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputies for their comments.  I want to point out that the arrangements for the timing of this Estimate debate were agreed between the Whips.  I would be happy to debate this for whatever time is allocated. Because of the time restriction I made available to Deputies a script in case there was not time to read it through.  As Deputy Boland asked a number of questions I will cover some of the points dealt with in the last pages of my script.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to capital expenditure on improvements to mental hospitals and the provision of new units, in the past three years 14 major schemes to improve conditions were completed.  An <Col N="1399" /> additional 14 schemes are at present in progress or nearing completion and 22 schemes are in various stages of planning. There are over 300 capital projects under way at present.  It could be misleading to follow the views put forward by Deputy Boland and I would be the first to admit that I am anxious to have further capital money.</P>
    <P>Concerning the development of community psychiatric services, since this Government assumed office such facilities have been increased by 100 per cent.  In 1977 there were 30 hostels catering for 300 patients.  Today there are 600 patients living in over 60 hospitals.</P>
    <P>The text of the Health (Mental Services) Bill, 1980, will be circulated to Deputies early next week.  The Bill, which I believe to be fully in accord with the most modern developments in psychiatry so far as the detention and treatment of persons suffering from severe mental illness is concerned, will provide in an up-dated way for the registration and supervision of the operation of centres for the mentally ill, the control of admission and discharge procedures and will include safeguards against the unnecessary detention of patients.  The Bill will be circulated next week.  This means Deputy Boland will have plenty of time to discuss this and to bring forward next autumn the views he has threatened.  I am making this Bill available now so that he can give it his maximum attention and come up with constructive suggestions. I hope other Deputies will do likewise.</P>
    <P>On mental handicapped services, I totally refute Deputy Boland's reference to a lack of development.  Steady progress continues to be made in the provision of additional residential and day accommodation for our mentally handicapped children and adults.  In the last three years an additional 420 residential places came into operation and it is expected that a further 240 residential places will be completed during the course of this year.  At present there are about 5,000 places in our special <Col N="1400" /> residential centres and hospitals, while a further 8,000 places are available in a variety of day-care facilities, including schools, special classes, care units and sheltered workshops.  I am conscious however, that much remains to be done before our total needs in this area are met.  The most acute need in this service relates to the provision of extra facilities for adults and in drawing up the programme for capital development, priority has been given to those projects which will make extra adult places available.</P>
    <P>I am also particularly concerned about the promotion of positive good health.  Deputy Boland quoted me somewhat out of context in saying that as Minister for Health I have very little influence over many of the factors which affect health.  That was in the context of the positive development of health.  As I have said, as the member of the Government with a particular responsibility for health, I have the information and expertise available to me to make other decision-makers and people of influence in the community aware of how they can either damage or sustain their health by what they do or omit to do.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the extent to which the abuse of alcohol is causing major social problems.  There is clearly a will in many parts of the community to do something about curbing excessive drinking, particularly among young people. What has not yet been agreed and will have to be settled soon is the means which should be adopted in order to do this.  There is no single easy way of doing it.  There is no way that the Government on their own can do it, and it is a matter in which we all have an interest and a part to play.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the proportion of overall national resources which the Government provided for the health services in the Estimates for 1980.  I pointed out that at 20 per cent it compares more than favourably with the 18 per cent allocation made available by the previous Government in 1975.  The share provided in the Book of Estimates for 1976 stood again at 18 per cent.  The <Col N="1401" /> Government's commitment of resources in the current year is increased appreciably by the need to provide a further £93 million by way of Supplementary Estimate.  All fair-minded people will admit that the Government are playing their part in helping the health services to cope in a difficult period.</P>
    <P>I have been asking health boards and other health agencies to pursue energetically the question of finding all economies which can be secured through efficient management of available resources.  Nobody wants to see the curtailment of any service which is vital to the well-being of patients.  On the other hand the sources of any possible waste or extravagance should be eliminated and the best possible use should be made of available manpower.  All opportunities for achieving economies in the use of energy and in general management expenses should be examined.  I particularly appreciate Deputy O'Connell's remarks in this respect.</P>
    <P>I have twice met the chairmen and chief executive officers of health boards to discuss their problems and have been greatly encouraged by the spirit of co-operation I have found.  They have, of course, referred to the difficulties they are experiencing, particularly because of the present rate of inflation.  I will be meeting them again in another month or so for further discussions when information is available as to the level of savings being achieved through the implementation of the economy measures on which they have decided.  Positive and useful proposals for economies have emerged from these meetings.</P>
    <P>The situation as regards voluntary hospitals and homes for the mentally handicapped is being monitored regularly.  There is a need to base projections on the rate of success which is being achieved through the programme of economies which managements have introduced. Some but not all of the managements envisage difficulties, especially in cases where growth in service levels over 1979 has resulted from the appointment of additional consultant <Col N="1402" /> staff and increased admission rates and utilisation of services.  The general situation will be kept under constant review to see what can be done.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies will, no doubt, recall that the position now is in many respects similar to what occurred in 1976 when the then Minister for Health had also to deal with the inevitability of economies in expenditure.  I will not dwell unduly on this because I am sure Deputies will be familiar with these facts.</P>
    <P>Our strategy today is, predictably, based on securing economies through efficient management and on the avoidance of reductions in essential services. We may be faced with some problems as the year passes and we will have to see what can be done to ease any situation which presents a major difficulty, but not necessarily through the allocation of additional funds which in present circumstances are not available. Nevertheless, it will be noted that we are continuing to develop new facilites throughout the country as resources permit. We also have an opportunity to assess our present services and likely future needs so that we may be prepared to develop quickly when national and international circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>Several comments have been made in relation to St. Brendan's Hospital.  I visited it very recently and have seen the particular building to which Deputy O'Connell referred.  I should like to point out that over £1 million has been spent on improving conditions in the past year and over a number of years many areas in the hospital have been brought to a very acceptable level of accommodation. It is very important that Deputies recognise this.  I accept that there is a great deal to be done in that area but it is equally important that we recognise the work which is being done.  A meeting has been arranged to take place in my Department next week between my officers and officers of the Eastern Health Board to resolve problems in relation to the transfer of patients from wards seven and eight.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also referred to St. Loman's Hospital and I found this particularly <Col N="1403" /> interesting.  I recently made a speech at the opening of a day hospital in Kilcock and I emphasised the need to keep our friends, relatives and neighbours in the community as far as possible.  This is an excellent example of a day centre being provided with community participation.  This has had the effect of relieving some pressure in St. Loman's although this is just one part of the problem there.  However, it is an indication of the direction in which we wish to see these services going and this is why I have given it so much attention. I might add that St. Loman's Hospital is a modern building and could not be described as Victorian in any sense.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £40,044,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on <Col N="1405" /> the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>While there was strong growth in employment in Ireland in 1979 there are at present far greater problems in increasing employment due to national and international developments.  The record increases in net employment achieved in the last two years are unlikely to be repeated in 1980.  While in general job creation targets are being met, the situation about off-setting factors such as closures and redundancies is less favourable.  The number on the live register of unemployed persons has also been increasing in the last couple of months.  The fact that our working population is growing rapidly is another factor which makes achievement of employment targets more difficult.</P>
    <P>My Department run a number of schemes designed to help people in securing employment.  The Employment Incentive Scheme, under which premiums are payable for additional unemployed workers recruited, is continuing to operate successfully in 1980.  Since the scheme was initiated in 1977, up to 30 May last premiums have been paid in respect of over 23,000 additional employees. The allocation in the 1980 Estimate provides for participation by 11,000 employees, including about 5,600 school leavers, in the scheme.  The scheme is supplemented at the present time by additional premiums payable out of the Employment Guarantee Fund which is financed equally by the Government and additional employers' social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>The Employment Maintenance Scheme, which applies to the maintenance of employment in certain labour intensive sectors of industry, such as textiles, expired on 31 March 1980 and the provision in the Estimate is to meet outstanding claims under the scheme.  A new scheme&mdash;the Employers Temporary Subvention&mdash;operates from 1 <Col N="1406" /> April to end of December 1980 to assist firms in sensitive sectors whose workers face threats of serious unemployment. This scheme is financed from employers' contributions to the Employment Guarantee Fund but is being administered by the Department on behalf of a Steering Committee of representatives of employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>The Work Experience Programme since it was introduced in 1978 has helped over 8,000 young people to get some practical employment experience. About 80 per cent of the participants have succeeded in obtaining regular employment. The Estimate provides for continuation of the scheme in 1980 at about the same level of participation as was achieved last year.</P>
    <P>The Vote provides for Exchequer grants to agencies engaged in industrial training&mdash;AnCO and CERT Ltd. AnCo trained a total of over 18,000 adults and apprentices in 1979, over 77 per cent of whom were immediately placed in employment&mdash;over 80 per cent of them were under 25 years of age.  The current Exchequer grant to AnCO is expected to be supplemented by payments from the European Social Fund giving a total budget for current training activities of over £31 million.  The capital grant to AnCO is also being increased in 1980 to allow for the continuing expansion of their training centre network.</P>
    <P>CERT Ltd, which looks after training for the hotel, catering and tourism industry, also benefits from aid from the European Social Fund.  In 1979 CERT financed the training of about 1,200 persons on formal full-time courses, including over 500 first year trainees, and of almost 2,000 workers on short in-service courses.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department are the principal agency involved in helping people to get employment, in providing counselling and occupational guidance services and in administering at local level the employment schemes run by the Department.  The programmed expansion of the service will continue in 1980 both in terms of <Col N="1407" /> staff numbers and new offices.  I hope that before the end of the year each region will have at least one occupational guidance officer.</P>
    <P>The practical work of our employment services has to be backed up by adequate manpower information and research.  A major survey on the employment experience of 1979 school leavers is at present being carried out.  Late last year 17 surveys on availability of semi-skilled labour were undertaken and the results are at present being published.</P>
    <P>The representative manpower consultative committee, which I chair, continue their important programme of work.  The committee have identified shortages arising in a number of occupations ranging from engineers to technicians and craftsmen.  This has led to measures relating to recruitment from abroad and expansion of education and training capacity to meet shortages.  The committee have also been examining the general youth employment situation and attitudes towards industrial employment.</P>
    <P>My Department, working through an inter-departmental committee, have been pursing measures to secure additional employment for disabled persons in the public service with a view to achieving a target quota of 3 per cent by 1982.  A recent significant step forward has been a decision by the Civil Service Commissioners to hold a special competition for recruitment of disabled persons to the Civil Service.  The inter-departmental committee have also been discussing with State bodies, local authorities, health boards etc the fulfilment of their obligations under the 3 per cent quota.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, became law earlier this month.  The various sections of the Act will be brought into operation by means of commencement orders.  I should like to take this opportunity to appeal to employers and workers to avail of the provisions of the Act in relation to safety committees.</P>
    <P>The Dangerous Substances (Amendment) Act, 1979, enabled me to <Col N="1408" /> bring into operation in September last the Dangerous Substances Act of 1972. I expect shortly to make an order declaring 25 substances to be dangerous for the purposes of the Act.  At the same time I will bring into operation safety regulations controlling the conveyance by road of these substances.  I also propose to make regulations relating to the loading, unloading and storage of these substances.</P>
    <P>As regards future worker protection legislation, Deputies are aware of my commitment to promote legislation for maternity protection of women in employment.  These proposals will involve extensive discussions with the social partners.  I would hope, however, to introduce this Bill before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Other legislation in early prospect relates to protection of workers engaged in off shore installations and reduction of statutory limits on working hours. Two Acts administered by the Department which are at present being subjected to major searching reviews are the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, and the Night Work (Bakeries) Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Safety in Industry Act I undertook to set up a working party on safety and health at work which will have very wide terms of reference relating to the occupational protection of people at work.  I hope to have this working party set up in the near future and that it will conclude its work within about two years of its establishment. I expect the report of the working party to have a major influence on our legislation in this area and on the development of our future occupational safety and health programmes.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency which has the function of monitoring the operation of the Equal Pay and Employment Equality Acts is financed from my Department's Vote.  I am considering proposals for changes in these Acts sent to me by the Agency and the Labour Court.  My Department are also responsible for liaison with the Council for the Status of Women.  The Council are being <Col N="1409" /> given various facilities by the Department to help them to carry out their role. The council have been afforded consultative status in relation to draft legislation.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act provides for election of worker directors in seven designated State bodies.  Directors have taken up their appointments in five of these bodies.  Arrangements have already been made for an election in a sixth body&mdash; CIE&mdash;and I hope that an election in the seventh&mdash;Aer Lingus&mdash;can be arranged later this year.  I published a discussion document on worker participation in March last and it is my wish to encourage voluntary initiatives in relation to worker participation in all sectors of the community which can be successfully implemented on an agreed basis.</P>
    <P>The Council of Minister for Social Affairs held this month adopted a directive on the protection of workers from harmful exposure to chemical, physical and biological agents.  This directive will involve consequential legislation in Ireland.  A resolution for guidelines for a Community labour market policy was also agreed as well as proposals to improve relations with the social partners which should enable meetings of the Tripartite Conference, which has dealt mainly with employment problems, to be resumed.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the aid which AnCO and CERT received from the European Social Fund.  Grants totalling £38.7 million from the fund were approved for Irish applications relating to 1979 operations covering training, including training of the handicapped, resettlement and job creation measures for young persons.  For 1980 operations, grants totalling £48.2 million have already been approved including £2.3 million for schemes of job creation for young persons.  Applications for a further £8.93 million for 1980 operations are still to be dealt with through the normal fund procedures.  The Government would like to see an expansion in the resources in the fund and in the types of aid in support of employment which <Col N="1410" /> the fund can give.  It is my intention to press for extension of the fund activities in these ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one topic which attracts frequent comment in the media and among the public, it is the state of our industrial relations.  Certainly there are occasions when criticism is not only justified but necessary.  At the same time the fact that the vast majority of differences between workers and employers are resolved through peaceful negotiation often seems to escape notice.</P>
      <P>It is only realistic to recognise that conflict will arise on occasion between both sides of industry.  In a situation of rapid economic, technological and social change, differences about how things should be done and how the rewards for improved productivity and increased production should be shared are bound to arise between workers and management. We must apply ourselves to the task of reducing the extent of the conflict and also to devising the best methods of resolving conflict when it arises.</P>
      <P>Too often, we have experienced unnecessary strikes which do untold harm to our economy, discredit our reputation abroad as an attractive industrial base and seriously damage the job prospects for our expanding and young work force.  Many of these disputes have taken place among the better-off sections of our work force.  The more these people take out of our national resources, the less there is for the lower paid and more vulnerable sections of our community. These people seem to have little regard for the effects of their actions on their fellow workers or on the community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When parties to disputes fail to settle their differences through direct negotiations, it is imperative that full and proper use be made of the dispute-settling machinery made available by the State namely the Labour Court and its industrial relations service and the rights commissioner service.  These institutions <Col N="1411" /> have been doing invaluable work over the years in the industrial relations area and are entitled to the full respect of both sides of industry.  Increasing use is being made of the court and its industrial relations service.  In 1979, industrial relations officers acted as chairmen to negotiations in 1,301 cases as compared with the 1978 figure of 1,288 which, itself, had been an all-time high figure. The court held 622 hearings and issued 575 recommendations in 1979 as compared with 545 recommendations in 1978, 462 in 1977 and 162 in 1971.  In 1979 the rights commissioner service investigated, under the 1969 Industrial Relations Act and the 1977 Unfair Dismissals Act, about 1,760 cases as compared with about 1,960 in 1978 and 1,830 in 1977.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there have been criticisms of the Labour Court with regard to delay in hearing cases and in issuing recommendations.  To deal with the increasing workload of the court, I have appointed a new division of the court and I have also provided the court with additional resources so as to ensure that cases will be handled with minimum delay.</P>
    <P>As well as strengthening and expanding the State dispute-settling machinery, I am convinced that a strong well-equipped, well-informed trade union movement can make a positive and significant contribution to improving our industrial relations.  Since taking up office the Government have increased, in real terms, the level of State assistance towards the education, training and advisory services of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The State grant is paid on the basis of an 80 per cent contribution by the Exchequer, the balance of 20 per cent being subscribed by congress.  The allocation for congress this year is £300,000.  This represents a substantial increase over last year's allocation of £205,000.</P>
    <P>One factor which has militated against securing a more orderly system of industrial relations has been the large number <Col N="1412" /> of trade unions relative to the size of the labour force.  Primary responsibility for securing the rationalisation of the trade unions rests with the movement.  I am personally aware of the valuable work being undertaken by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to difficulties over inter-union disputes.  Congress indeed engaged an expert from the International Labour Office some time ago to look at the situation here and I understand that congress are at present engaged in follow-up action arising from his report with particular reference to developing greater co-ordination between unions in multiple-union situations. The Trade Union Act, 1975, specifies the procedures for the amalgamation of trade unions and enables State assistance to be provided to recoup financial losses directly related to such amalgamations.  A sum of £30,000 is provided in the 1980 Estimate for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The period of the agreement on pay policy contained in the National Understanding for Economic and Social Development negotiated last July will expire shortly for some workers.  As the Minister with responsibility on behalf of, and with the authority of, the Government for negotiations with the social partners on any future national understandings I have had a number of meetings over the past few weeks with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of employer and industry organisations on the possibilities of another centrally negotiated arrangement on pay and related issues.  Further discussions are envisaged to see if an acceptable measure of agreement can be reached on the wider issues as well as agreement on pay policy.  Deputies will understand that it would not be appropriate for me, while discussions are in progress, to comment on developments at this stage.</P>
    <P>There is also a supplementary estimate for £300,000 to cover a Government contribution to the cost of improving the physical facilities for welfare services at the Irish Centre, Camden Town in London.  A request for aid from the <Col N="1413" /> centre was examined by an inter-Departmental committee which recommended that, subject to certain conditions, aid to this amount should be granted. The Government are satisfied that the provision of this aid is fairly justified for the purpose of helping our less fortunate emigrants, who encounter various difficulties, mainly after arrival but also at later stages, in adapting to life in the London area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that these Estimates have been cut down to such a limited time.  Neither the Minister nor this side of the House have adequate time to discuss what is a very important Estimate.  Before I begin, I apologise for the labour spokesman who is unable to be here and who has asked me to stand in for him.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a few points. Work experience is a very important aspect of life in any economy, but particularly where we have high unemployment and where unemployment is growing we must ensure that work experience is available to young people.  The Minister said that he intends to maintain the programme at the same level as last year.  For this year £1.8 million is provided; last year the figure was £2.8 million.  I would like the Minister to tell us how with a 20 per cent inflation rate we can carry out the same programme in the light of those figures.  I do not think that it is &ldquo;on&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the Safety in Industry Bill and welcomed participation in it.  Again, there is the question of money for the National Industrial Safety Organisation.  I presume they make some input in this area, and there is an increase of just £1,000 in their funds.  Does the Minister think that is adequate if he has expanded and intends further to expand their programme?  Later he indicated that he had set up a working party to examine safety in industry.  I welcome that development because great emphasis should be placed on safety in industry It is a pity the working party was not set up prior to the legislation, but possibly when the Minister became <Col N="1414" /> aware of the shortcomings in the legislation he realised it was necessary to have the working party to ensure that a comprehensive study leading to broader legislation would be undertaken to meet the needs in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned disabled persons and the 3 per cent quota in the public service.  I suggested previously that the employment premium scheme should be used in the private sector to encourage employers to take on disabled persons.  I still think that should be done. The Minister can exercise direct control over State activities, but he should give an incentive to the private sector so as to ensure that everything possible is done to enable disabled people to live as full and as normal a life as possible.  The Minister should examine this matter again even if it means seeking grants from the EEC.  We always seem to look to the EEC when the question of a grant arises.  It is important to broaden our aims regarding disabled persons and see if we can give some support to private industry to encourage them in this regard.  If private industry had a conscience they might employ disabled people, but I think they require a push here and there.  Many of them do a reasonable job, but the Minister could make a little more effort in this connection and I ask him to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke of maternity protection.  I would like to know how far he will go in that regard and whether it will be the responsibility of the Government to ensure that maternity leave money is paid rather than have the amount foisted upon the employer.  We must be careful not to place too many impositions on employers.  Otherwise, they will tend not to employ people.  This is a point which must be considered in relation to social welfare, PRSI contributions and so on.  There is a limit to the load the back will take and any more will have a negative effect.  The same applies to maternity leave.  Any extension there should be met in full by the Department concerned rather than impose a further burden on employers. They are in competition and if they are <Col N="1415" /> to survive they must be competitive.  If we impose too much on them it will have an adverse effect.</P>
    <P>There is a great challenge as regards our young population in the sphere of job experience.  According to the newspapers in the past couple of days, the number of persons under 25 now unemployed is rising dramatically.  Persons of that age are at peak capacity in enthusiasm and ability and if that great reservoir of energy is left untapped many things can happen.  It is a dangerous situation and the Minister must ensure that every effort is made to ensure employment for our youth.  Obviously, the number in this category tends to increase and it will cause great concern.  It requires real and positive steps to deal with this challenge.  If we cannot employ our youth at this age the country will have serious economic and social problems.  The social consequences could be catastrophic.  We can see around us today the social consequences of unemployment, and if present trends increase there will be a real threat to the whole fabric of our society.  It behoves the Government, not just the Minister, to meet this challenge head-on and ensure that employment prospects are improved.</P>
    <P>To judge by the Minister's reference to industrial relations one might think that there were no problems in that area at all.  There are occasions when criticism is justified and necessary.  At the same time, the vast majority of differences between workers and employers is resolved through peaceful negotiations. There is nothing extraordinary about that; it is as it should be.  But there are serious problems and these will have serious consequences on employment prospects unless we take a radical look at the whole area of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In the administrative changeover of late last year the Minister was blowing hot and cold on legislation.</P>
    <P>One day we heard that unofficial strikes should be tackled one way and the next we were told they should be dealt with by peaceful means and by <Col N="1416" /> negotiation.  This is a very dangerous attitude towards industrial relations.  We also had the Minister making a speech shortly after the Taoiseach made a plea on television in regard to industrial relations. We got the impression that the Taoiseach had made his speech, divine providence had spoken and everything was all right.  Everything was not all right.  It is very dishonest of the Minister for Labour to say that, because the Taoiseach has spoken or some other Minister has spoken, we will have peace. That is an insult to people involved in industrial relations&mdash;the trade union movement and the employer movement&mdash;who are concerned about the matter.  We should not have this type of indifferent attitude towards industrial relations, that industrial problems are minor ones.  They are not; they are with us every day.  Nobody relishes them, but very little action is being taken.</P>
    <P>Positive steps are not being taken to ensure that there are good industrial relations.  I know the Minister set up a committee to examine industrial relations. The country wants action not commissions or working parties. Governments are elected to take responsibility and to do their job.  The Minister is not doing his job in the industrial relations field.  Far too many disputes are taking place, far too many problems are arising every day.  Our economy is tottering and international goodwill has been lost because of the indifferent approach of the Minister.  That will have a dramatic effect on us in the long term.  I ask the Minister to come up with concrete proposals in the whole area of industrial relations to ensure that management and labour are not against one another.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take a serious look at the trade union movement.  Fine Gael in their document suggested that funds should be provided for the trade union movement we can legislate for industrial disputes but, unless the conditions are right, legislation will not make any difference. The way to solve problems is by consensus, consultation and good communications. We will not get good industrial <Col N="1417" /> relations by vague statements and what we should or should not do. We should get a formula worked out for good industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Management and trade unions want to see a peaceful work force and want to see industrial relations working well, because it is good for employees, for the economy and for the country.  Those people have an interest in good industrial relations and it is now a question of getting together and the Minister and the Government coming up with proposals. The first thing is to inject money into the trade union movement.  Money is given through the various agencies for the development of employment and there is no reason why the trade union movement, who represent our work force, should not get money for training, and the development of proper staff structures within the movement to ensure that there is no question of the trade unions being remote from workers.  There can often be disputes because there is a little remoteness from head office.  Trade union officials are possibly the hardest working people there are, because they work 16 hours a day and, as a result, sometimes they may be a little remote.  I believe that, if enough money is injected into the trade union movement to ensure that there are good staff relations and that the officials get closer to the factory floor, we will have fewer problems.</P>
    <P>I believe that many industrial problems arise from bad management. When problems arise the finger is always pointed at the trade union movement, but they are not always at fault.  Very often indifferent attitudes by management towards workers is the cause of industrial disputes.  Personnel departments should not be seen as being there as a sort of protection for upper management and for boards.  They should be there for both sides of industry.  If we can get it established that personnel are there for workers and management in the best interests of everybody, we will have peace in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I have been in negotiations on behalf of workers and when we were talking to personnel we did not feel they had our <Col N="1418" /> interest at heart.  We always felt we had to argue a point to make a point.  Personnel departments should get both sides together and give a sense of trust and well-being to everybody.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of worker participation on boards.  That is grand, but it is like putting the chimney pot on the house first and working down.  We have got to get our structures right at the bottom and then work right up through industry to the top.  We talk about Sweden and about Germany.  But we have our own attitudes and we should develop our personalities within industry and forget what happens elsewhere.  We can work well if we do that.  The Minister should take the whole question of industrial relations much more seriously than he has done up to now.  There is very little space given to industrial relations in the Minister's speech, which is probably because of the shortage of time.  I would have liked more time, but I realise the time has been agreed.  Possibly I will be able to make my points again on another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As we enter the eighties I believe greater emphasis must be placed on the Department of Labour, because with a growing population and greater emphasis on young people the Department of Labour are one of the most sensitive Departments for the peaceful and adequate development of our economy. The Department of Labour are concerned with employment, unemployment and industrial peace&mdash;the three facets of our life which are most necessary for proper development and the greater employment of our people in the years ahead.  We may have other national priorities.  I support these objectives wholeheartedly, but before they can be achieved what must be uppermost in our minds is the provision of adequate training programmes and ultimately adequate employment for all our people, because the basis of future development and job opportunities for this country must be based on a contented work force.  I have referred to the ever-increasing youth population.  Their main needs are jobs and housing.  They are a very responsible <Col N="1419" /> section of our people and I am satisfied that if we can show concern for their needs, the response from that ever-increasing number in our population will be worthwhile and will contribute to the well-being of our community.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to many aspects in the Minister's report which are important in their own way for the achievement of this objective. First, I will take the operation of AnCO.  I applaud their efforts as a member of a VEC and I support wholeheartedly what they are doing in the field of employment and training programmes.  As I have stated at VEC level, I believe that if we are to attain the ultimate objective in youth programmes and youth employment, there should be greater discussion and getting down to the job between AnCO and the VECs at IVEA level.  In both areas there is an overlap and perhaps by working together we can attain a better result by having our objectives in line rather than having perhaps a wastage of energy, power and finance.  This matter has been discussed at VEC level and, as far as I know, it has gone to congress.  It may seem that criticism of AnCO is intended, but I am not criticising them.  However, a better relationship between the VECs and AnCO would enable our objective in employment to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT are concerned mainly with the catering and tourist trade.  I appeal to the executive of that body for alertness especially in the catering and hotel trade here.  Even after many years of protest and recommendations to that body, a certain amount of hardship is being created in the working conditions in many sectors in the hotel and catering industry.  The Safety in Industry Bill has been finalised after two years but it is still inadequate and leaves much to be desired.  I regret to say that the cart was put before the horse.  The working party would have been better advised to come in with the report before the Bill was enacted.  Now, despite the fact that the Act has been passed, we are still awaiting a working party report which it <Col N="1420" /> is estimated will take two years more to produce.  In this area it is vital that we have proper and safe methods of working because, as was said on discussion on the Bill, so many new ways of working and so many new sophisticated pieces of equipment have been introduced that it is essential for the safety of the work force that everything possible is done to ensure maximum safety in the carrying out of their duties on the industrial site.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago we spoke here about the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1977, and I supported the extension of that for another 12 months.  Unless a full and finalised Bill is brought before the House in 1981 this side of the House will not support a further extension of a temporary cover for our young people under this very important Act which precludes them from being abused financially by many people.</P>
    <P>On industrial relations I would like to refer in particular to the need for co-operation on all sides in this very important field.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>We must apply ourselves to the task of reducing the extent of the conflict and also to devising the best methods of resolving conflict when it arises.</P>
    <P>Later on he said:</P>
    <P>I am aware that there have been criticisms of the Labour Court with regard to delay in hearing cases and in issuing recommendations.  To deal with the increasing workload of the court, I have appointed a new division of the court and I have also provided the court with additional resources so as to ensure that cases will be handled with minimum delay.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's efforts because, from my knowledge of the trade union movement and the ordinary worker, great impatience and annoyance have been felt over the handling of issues by the Labour Court.  One could wait two months for a hearing.  I know of cases where there have been delays of three to four months before the final recommendation was issued.  We talk <Col N="1421" /> about wild cat strikes and irresponsible strikes, but if a man with a genuine case&mdash;and there are many genuine cases&mdash;must wait six months for a hearing and the finalising of that hearing, I can well appreciate an impatient man becoming a little more than impatient.</P>
    <P>I made a recommendation some months ago to the Minister that, for the better working of the Labour Court and for the achieving of its objective of as early solutions as possible, there is a need for decentralisation, with particular reference to the conciliation and arbitration services of the Labour Court.  No longer can everything be resolved in the city of Dublin.  While we have offices throughout the country, with officials from the Department of Labour centred in the greater areas like Limerick, Waterford and Galway, the important people of the Labour Court are those who will be the early warning system to resolve difficulties quickly on the ground and not let the situation be exacerbated. If the conciliation and arbitration services were to a greater extent regionalised and decentralised the Minister would be doing something worthwhile to reduce the serious industrial strife of recent years.  The Minister would be contributing to the reduction of tension and the quicker resolving of strikes in the country.  We all know that every strike is not in Dublin and 100 miles may mean a lot in the prevention of a strike.</P>
    <P>In the middle of the year 1980, what are the facts of life as regards the national situation on employment, as we face the eighties?  The newspapers and the Minister have said that the picture is bleak and the outlook frightening. Unless serious steps are taken within the next 12 months or two years there could be serious repercussions within our work force&mdash;or perhaps I should say, within the force that is not working.  Recent headlines have indicated an unemployment figure in the region of 95,000 and rising.  In the last two months there was an increase of 7,000 on the unemployment register, at a time when employment should be at its peak.  Not alone <Col N="1422" /> that, but a further headline is even more frightening, of 50,000 young people this year without jobs.</P>
    <P>Our young people are our future generations and will be the backbone of this country.  Unless this serious situation is tackled, I forsee serious social problems in the ten years ahead.  Unless this great challenge to our ability to provide employment is taken on by next year, without being pessimistic, I predict a figure of 150,000 on the unemployment register.  That brings us to an unemployment figure of almost 10 per cent of our work force.  That is not an optimistic picture, but is a realistic one which must be faced in the light of what was enunciated some two years ago by the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, who envisaged an inflation rate of 5 per cent and full employment by 1982.  Surely this pie in the sky has to disappear when one reads of the harsh realities of the unemployment situation in Ireland in late June of 1980?  What frightens me even more is the Central Bank report.  After reading two chapters, I threw the report away because there was not a happy ending in the final chapter.  What I did read was that the Central Bank were very clear and definite that the budgetary proposals and policies in January 1980 were not sufficiently retrograde, with not sufficient cut-back on finances, and they were urging that in 1981 our Government should take even more drastic steps to ensure further cut-backs.  Where will this thinking lead our country? What has happened to the messianic charisma of the Taoiseach when elected last December?  We all know that the change of leadership came for one reason basic to all, the survival of the fittest. The backbenchers decided that the then Taoiseach was not sufficiently geared to ensure their survival in the next general election and they selected a new Taoiseach to get the economy back on the tracks again, thus ensuring a viable economy facing the next general election.</P>
    <P>To my layman's point of view, our <Col N="1423" /> present economy is shattered, off course and out of control.  If I were a doctor, I would say it is seriously ill.  We have many serious problems to deal with in the next 12 months.  I conclude on this aspect by saying that many of our ills were created in the last three years by a certain amount of mismanagement of state affairs, unfortunately initiated by the kiss of death from the abominable manifesto, if I may put it that way.  This was followed by many hit and miss policies and often no policies at all.  In late 1978, because of earlier budgetary proposals, our inflation rate had been reduced to approximately 7 per cent and our GNP had increased by 6 per cent.  It was a healthy development and we seemed to be going in the right direction, to be moving again and our economy gathering strength.</P>
    <P>What has happened in the meantime? We now have, as reported yesterday, an inflation rate of something over 20 per cent, with less than 1 per cent increase of GNP predicted for this year.  To add further fuel to the flames the national papers indicated yesterday that our inflation rate was the highest in the EEC.</P>
    <P>In my budget contribution I described the budget proposals and the package as a time-bomb primed by a substantial increase in energy costs.  I predicted that ultimately this explosion would cause fierce repercussions in the cost of living, in unemployment and perhaps in industrial peace.  Many of my predictions have already come true, less than six months afterwards.  Our price spiral is out of control, our living standards impaired and our industrial growth reduced, which last will mean further unemployment despite the very best efforts of the IDA and the semi-State bodies who are concerned with creating as many jobs as possible for our young people in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the most important item presently being discussed at national level, which is the need for a national understanding.  It is imperative, and we agree on all sides of the House, <Col N="1424" /> that if this country is to go back on the rails again and our economy to get a boost and if there is to be a period of industrial peace, the tripartite talks on the national understanding must be got under way and any differences resolved as quickly as possible.  We must have as little industrial unrest here as possible.  I hope that all sides in this discussion will be concerned about our future prospects. The trade union movement are a very reasonsible body who know what is needed in this country.  They know that jobs are needed and that industrial peace is needed.  We also need some control on the cost of living, with Government intervention to ensure that this spiral of inflation will not continue to affect the ordinary lives of the working people of our country.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I wish to thank the Deputies for their contributions on the Estimate.

      <P>I wish to reply to some of the points raised by Deputies, the first being one raised by Deputy O'Brien regarding the Work Experience Programme, in reply to my opening remarks about continuing the level of the Work Experience Programme this year. He did not compare like with like.  In fact, the total expenditure last year on this programme was £1.57 million and this year it is £1.80 million, which is real increase, as I said at the outset.  He also questioned the allocation to the NISO. Let me say that since my appointment as Minister I have taken a very deep interest in the activities of the National Industrial Safety Organisation.  Indeed, I have supported their many commitments in this field, their conferences and so on. I cannot speak too highly of the dedicated people attached to this very important orgainsation.  During my term of office not alone have I substantially increased the allocation of moneys to them, but on my promptings some time ago, encouraged their funding particularly from the insurance field, because I believe that an improvement in safety would mean benefits for the insurance industry and that it should contribute to a mainly voluntary grouping such as the National Industrial Safety Organisation.  Their efforts in that field have been reasonably successful.</P>

      <P>If I may explain to the Deputy, and his insincerity is so obvious here, when we introduced this programme at the end of 1978&mdash;from memory I would say it was September 1978&mdash;we could only estimate what our needs might be for 1979.  The demand did not conform to what we had anticipated. However, as the Deputy has raised the matter of the programme, I must say it has been extremely successful. Its replacement rate, as I said in my opening remarks, has been substantially greater than 80 per cent, which is an indication of how successful that scheme has been from the point of view of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy F. O'Brien referred to disabled and to handicapped people.  I would agree with the comments he made about encouragement being given in the private sector for their employment.  I might say that the organisations concerned, who are deserving of great credit for the way in which they look after the handicapped, are mostly opposed to and are not enthusiastic about a quota system for employment in the private sector.  Having said that, I believe however that we should encourage the private sector at every possible opportunity to assist in the employment of handicapped people. For example, the employment subsidy schemes assist in getting handicapped workers into employment.  Needless to say employers are eligible for qualification <Col N="1427" /> under those schemes also.  We receive also substantial grants from the European Social Fund for the training of handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>I made a commitment that legislation in regard to maternity protection would be before the House by the end of this year and that there would be extensive consultation with both sides in industry. Obviously that would be important in the case of both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employer and industry organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy F. O'Brien referred to a number of matters on the industrial relations front.  Obviously he is somebody who believes that legislation would solve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this is not the case.  We all have a duty&mdash;I think it was Deputy Ryan who said this&mdash;to strive towards and encourage good industrial relations.  Some of Deputy O'Brien's comments certainly were not helpful.  He referred to dishonest comments, to glib speaking.  Let me say that, in relation to the Taoiseach's broadcast to the nation at the beginning of January, a very fine broadcast that showed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1428" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the qualities of leadership that prove so conclusively that he alone among the Members of this House is fitted to lead this country, in that broadcast the Taoiseach appealed for industrial peace.  That appeal, together with the efforts of all concerned&mdash;the efforts of the social partners, their commitment under the national understanding and, indeed I might add, the strenuous efforts of the services of the Labour Court and, with my assistance, of the Department of Labour&mdash;all contributed to what I said in this House some time ago was the best first quarter of industrial relations we have experienced in this country since we began to compile records in the Department in the mid-seventies.  Of course I agree with those who have said that we have too many disputes: we have.  In my opening remarks I said that often these disputes were unnecessary, that the procedures to prevent them taking place should be used to a greater extent than they are.  I should repeat that, despite the publicity attached to and the difficulties created by those disputes, the vast majority of Irish workers and industry move along each day of each week of each year without such difficulty.</P>
      <P>Again I would support those who emphasised the importance of the personal role.  It is of extreme importance in that field, as is education.  Since I became Minister there has been a substantial increase in the moneys made available to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for the educational, advisory and training services.  This is only right.  The previous Minister for Finance imposed a percentage limitation on what could be provided by the Government&mdash;in other words, a certain percentage had to be provided by congress.  I amended that&mdash;I thought it was a penal imposition&mdash;and it no longer applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Worker participation was mentioned and the necessity for good communications. In the worker participation document I issued there was a chapter specifically related to the necessity of drawing up a voluntary code of practice on information disclosure, in consultation <Col N="1429" /> of course with the social partners.  I believe that would be very desirable, useful and welcome from the point of view of the community.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Brien who referred to the finger being pointed at one side or the other.  I have repeated several times that blame for disputes, disruption or industrial action be attributed to both sides.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to AnCO.  I agree with him about the necessity for co-operation between AnCO and the vocational education system.  There is a standing liaison committee between AnCO and education, including the VECs and the IDA.  That committee has recently been revamped with a view to improving procedures for consultation between the bodies represented.  In the Manpower Consultative Committee, which I chair and to which I referred earlier, we agreed recently to give representation to vocational interests also.  I believe that in that whole area of placement, training and education there is a very important link for our future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the Working Party on Safety.  Yes, consultations have been held with both sides of industry on the composition and the terms of reference of that working party.  I hope in the very near future we will be able to get that working party in operation. They have a very big job to do and a very important role to play and obviously they will take some time to complete their tasks.</P>
    <P>On the protection of employment of young persons, I made a commitment in my opening statement that when the review is completed we will bring in amendments.  As regards the Labour Court conciliation services and decentralisation, I must confess that when I was in opposition I too raised this point many times.  The court sits regularly in various cities and towns and the conciliation officers travel in accordance with the programmes laid down to deal urgently with problems.  The possibilities of decentralisation are constantly being studied.  It could be argued that conciliation officers are the solution but there <Col N="1430" /> may be drawbacks.  At the moment a conciliation officer tends to be involved with one area of industry.  If there is only one officer available in an area that may create problems because he may not be suitable to one side or the other.  When there are a number available in the Department, there is a certain amount of flexibility.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £16,720,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose that the usual practice of discussing the Fisheries and Forestry Estimates together be followed in which case I shall move the Forestry Estimate after the debate concludes.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Estimate shows an increase of £718,990 over last year's Vote. The overall increase is due mainly to increases of £1,250,000 for major fishery harbour works, £334,500 for salaries, wages and advances, £557,500 in the grant-in-aid to Bord Iascaigh Mhara for administration and current development and £56,700 in the grant-in-aid for the Inland Fisheries Trust.  Reductions occur in the provision for the construction of exploratory fishing vessels, the capital grant to Bord Iascaigh Mahara and expenditure in connection with the acquisition of fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> On progress of the industry, conservation measures in 1979 and in particular those which closed herring fisheries, caused a reduction in landings as compared with 1978.  A small increase in unit prices, however, resulted in a marginal increase in the value of domestic landings.  The total value of the catch, excluding salmon landings and including foreign landings, increased from £25 million in 1978 to £27 million in 1979. The value of the salmon catch was £5.03 million.  The value of exports increased from £31 million in 1978 to £33 million in 1979.</P>
    <P>Twelve projects, incorporating either new processing plants or extensions to existing ones have been approved for grant purposes in the calendar year 1979 involving a total investment of £2.6 million.  Statutory quality controls have been introduced for pelagic and shellfish to supplement those already in operation for demersal varieties.</P>
    <P>On fishery harbour works and miscellaneous marine schemes steady progress is being made in providing improvement works where they are needed for fish landings, berthing of boats and other necessary facilities at fishing ports.</P>
    <P>At Killybegs, civil engineering work in connection with the installation of a weighbridge is almost complete.  The civil engineering works in connection with the installation of the syncrolift will be put to tender later this year.  A contract has been awarded for the construction of the auction hall and work will commence very shortly.</P>
    <P>At Castletownbere, plans for the provision of an effluent disposal plant and for the supply of a 38kv electricity supply to the area are well advanced. Work is progressing on the fish processing plant which is being built on Dinish Island by Eiranova Limited, an Irish subsidiary of the Spanish firm Pescanova.</P>
    <P>At Howth, work is progressing according to plan on the harbour development scheme.  The works in progress include the building of a new trawler breakwater, rock drilling and blasting within the new harbour area and the <Col N="1433" /> reclamation of the foreshore to the west of the west pier.  A syncrolift, slipways, and auction hall, and the widening of the west pier are included in the scheme which will take about three years to complete.  Over £1 million has been spent on the scheme to date.</P>
    <P>As with my predecessor my main concern in relation to Ireland's membership of the EEC is the continuing negotiations on a definitive common fisheries policy. The Government's position in regard to a final agreement on such a policy has been made clear on numerous occasions and I see no advantage in retracing old ground today.</P>
    <P>The Council meeting in January last was able to agree for the first time on a Community regulation laying down total allowable catches for Community waters for 1980 and this was complemented by a regulation providing for a Community system of catch reporting, which again is another first in this area.</P>
    <P>The most recent Council was held in Luxembourg on Monday last, 16 June, and this will be followed up by a further meeting on 21 July.  Last Monday's meeting was mainly taken up by a discussion on a Commission paper on possible ways of calculating quotas for individual member states which incidentally provides for implementation of The Hague commitment to double the Irish catch between 1975 and 1979.  This meeting was conducted in a very friendly and conciliatory manner which was to be expected following the resolution adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers on 30 May 1980 which specified 1 January 1981 as the target date for the adoption of a new common fisheries policy.  I am therefore quite optimistic that we are now on the way to reaching final agreement on this very contentious issue.  The outcome of the 1979 scheme of FEOGA grants for the inshore fishing industry was very favourable as far as Ireland is concerned in that nine fishing boats and three mariculture projects were allocated grant-aid amounting to £2,166,000, or 26 per cent of the total available for all member states.  A scheme on the same <Col N="1434" /> lines has been agreed by the Council for 1980 and should be in operation shortly. This scheme will for the first time provide grants for the modernisation of fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1980 for administration and current development amounts to £3,760,500, and the grant-in-aid for capital development amounts to £5,000,000. Additional funds are available by way of repayable advances from the Central Fund, a line of credit from financial institutions and the board's own resources to meet the demand by fishermen for loans for boats and so on.  In addition to subvention towards the purchase of boats and gear the board's grant-in-aid for capital development also covers the provision of services to the fishing industry such as ice plants training and grants for mariculture.</P>
    <P>In reviewing events of the past year a reference must be made to the sale of their boatyards by BIM.  As Deputies are well aware, these yards has been incurring substantial losses in previous years and redundancies were inevitable. Transfer of the yards to private ownership has proved to be a very satisfactory development.  The yards were disposed of at satisfactory prices, the Exchequer has been relieved of the losses and, more important, the large scale redundancies which faced the work force were avoided.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made recently in this House that the delay in publishing the 1978 BIM report was due to covering up of irregularities.  I can assure the House that there were no irregularities to cover up.  There was absolutely nothing sinister in the delay, which was unavoidable. I hope Deputies will accept that.</P>
    <P>The most significant development in the mariculture sector has been the introduction of the mariculture grant scheme administered by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Under the scheme grants of up to 30 per cent of capital expenditure may be made available, thus giving an important stimulus to the promotion of mariculture development. <Col N="1435" /> The revised legislative procedures outlined in section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, will become operative as soon as all prior applications under the old legislation have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I now refer to our inland fisheries, the most important of which are our salmon fisheries.  Provisional figures show that the total weight of the salmon catch in 1979 by all fishing methods was 1,073 metric tonnes, valued at £5.03 million as against 1,180 metric tonnes, valued at almost £4 million in 1978.  The overall catch by weight in 1979 showed a 9 per cent drop on the 1978 catch, which in turn showed a similar decline on the 1977 figures.  The market value of salmon caught in 1979 rose by almost 25 per cent on that for 1978, due no doubt to the effects of supply and demand and general inflationary trends. These figures do not include sea trout, which however are of relatively minor importance.</P>
    <P>The estimated quality of salmon exported in 1979 was 667 metric tonnes, valued at £3,858,000, compared with 1,061 metric tonnes, valued at £4,191,000, in 1978.  A proportion of the salmon exported in 1979 was of course in processed form, which was reflected in an increase in the exported value as against the landed value.</P>
    <P>As to the protection of our salmon fisheries, my Department, with the co-operation of the Minister for Defence, arranged again for vessels of the Naval Service to patrol our coastal salmon fisheries during 1979 in support of the Garda and the fisheries protection staffs of the boards of conservators.  I am pleased to say that this combined fishery protection effort was largely successful and resulted in the seizure and removal from our salmon fisheries of good quantities of fishing nets of illegal size and made from prohibited monofilament material.  I have arranged that naval patrols of our salmon fisheries, with a backup land force of gardai where this is called for, will be carried out again during the 1980 season in co-operation with the protection staffs of the boards of <Col N="1436" /> conservators.  The need for these enhanced joint protection measures continues in order to conserve our declining salmon stocks by ensuring adequate escapement of brood salmon to the spawning grounds in our rivers.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Act, 1980, became law in March 1980.  The main object of the Act is to secure the most effective conservation, management and development of inland fisheries through the reorganisation and strengthening of the existing administrative structure.  To that end, as previously publicised, the Act provides for the dissolution of the existing 17 boards of conservators and the Inland Fisheries Trust and for their replacement by a Central Fisheries Board and seven regional fisheries boards.  Arrangements to set up these new boards are under way in my Department and I expect them to be in operation within a few months.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Forestry Vote, the nett main Estimate, £21,021,000, represents an increase of £3,473,000 on the overall 1979 provision and is due mainly to higher salaries and wages and increased prices.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that since the Estimate was prepared it has become necessary to make provision for a number of developments which could not have been anticipated.  These are now the subject of a Supplementary Estimate for £4,053,000, which, as Deputies are aware, has been introduced and which I shall be moving when the debate on the main Estimate concludes.  I trust that it will be more convenient for Deputies if, as well as dealing with the main Estimate, I refer also, at the appropriate stage, to the items covered by the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>As the restricted time available does not permit me to deal with each subhead in detail I shall concentrate on the major items and, in particular, those which reflect substantial changes from last year.  However, I shall of course when replying to the debate deal with specific points which Deputies may wish to raise on individual subheads.</P>
    <P>Subhead C 21 deals with Forest <Col N="1437" /> Development and Management.  As usual, this constitutes the main focal point of expenditure.  Of the total subhead provision in the main Estimate, over £12 million is needed for wages to keep over 2,600 forest workmen in regular employment.  This subhead caters for the wide variety of activities associated with the development and management of the national forest estate, which now embraces some 367,400 hectares or 907,800 acres.  These include the production of nursery stock; the establishment, maintenance, and protection of State plantations; public recreation facilities; purchase, hire and maintenance of machinery; construction of forest roads; and the harvesting and conversion of timber.  Provision is included for certain replacements in the machinery fleet and for an expansion of the roadmaking programme.</P>
    <P>Subhead D deals with grants for private planting and my Department continues their policy of encouraging private forestry.  The additional provision in the subhead this year reflects my recent announcement that substantial increases in the level of grants were being made available to assist private planting.</P>
    <P>Under subhead G, game development and management, the substantial increase this year arises from the recruitment of 48 wildlife rangers.  This new cadre of field personnel is geared towards a better enforcement of the Wildlife Act, not merely in relation to game matters but also in the context of the entire wildlife spectrum.</P>
    <P>The conservation grant-in-aid for 1980 provides mainly for expenditure on wildlife research, an essential element of wildlife conservation and management. Habitat protection is perhaps the most important single aspect of wildlife conservation. It is my intention that current work of identifying important wildlife habitat in both State and private ownership will continue with a view to the establishment and management under the Wildlife Act of a representative network of nature reserves.</P>
    <P>The final element in the main Estimate is subhead J, appropriations in aid.  As <Col N="1438" /> Deputies will see, the projection for receipts in the original Estimate represents an expectation of £1 million more than in 1979.  However, this has been found to be over-optimistic.  I will deal more fully with this item in a few moments and, with this in mind, I should like now to turn my attention to the Supplementary Estimate referred to earlier. Of the total net supplementary amount, £4,053,000, nearly £2½ million&mdash;spread over a number of subheads&mdash;is accounted for by increases in pay and allowances for some 3,200 foresters and industrial workers sanctioned subsequent to the preparation of the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>The remaining non-pay requirements in the Supplementary Estimate, which come to £1.6 million arise from the difficulties at present being experienced in the timber industry.  With the continuing depressed state of the market for pulpwood-size timber, the Forest and Wildlife Service is faced with a growing arrear of thinning.  If this problem is not attended to, it will inevitably have adverse effects on the quality, size and total availability of the more valuable sawlog sector in future years.  In these circumstances the Government, having regard to the considerable national economic advantage involved, authorised that contracts be placed for a limited period with the two remaining pulpwood processing firms in the country to undertake harvesting and removal of small material in specified State forests by carrying out the necessary thinning of designated plantations on a contract basis, utilising the services of experienced harvesting gangs.  This arrangement, coupled with the work done by the limited training harvesting work force of the Forest and Wildlife Service, will control to a degree the arrears of thinning in the State forests. An additional sum of £800,000 is included under subhead C.2 (7) for contract thinning of State forests.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C.4 the sum of £400,000 is being provided to fund the continued operations of Chipboard Ltd., which is in receivership, for a limited <Col N="1439" /> period while proposals for a restructuring of the company are being considered.</P>
    <P>The final item in the Supplementary Estimate concerns subhead J&mdash;Appropriations in Aid&mdash;to which I referred briefly a few moments ago.</P>
    <P>Receipts in the Forestry Vote depend mainly on sales of timber.  The current year's receipts from such sales arise partly from contracts entered into in 1979 and partly from contracts being made in 1980.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said gives Deputies a good general picture of both sides of my Department and I shall be most interested in their comments.  I now commend the Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time the Minister has presented an Estimate to this House.  I should like to offer him our co-operation so far as Estimates and the interests of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are concerned.  In return, we expect him to give close attention to points raised by Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we dealt with fisheries but today I should like to concentrate on forestry, although I must point out that I would need much more than 15 minutes to deal with this subject.  The Minister was quite right to stress that in dealing with fisheries and forestry we are concerned with two of our most important national industries.  In a sense the Minister is lucky because he is new to the job and can put forward new policies.  There has been talk about the dying forests, but many of us think that for the past while the Department have been dying if one is to judge what they have done with regard to fisheries and forestry.  We welcome the new Minister. He should not be afraid to put forward new policies that are in the interests of these two major industries.  Recently a very good Bill affecting inshore fishermen was brought in and the Minister's predecessor got much support from this side of the House.  The Minister can expect the same co-operation if he brings forward the right kind of Bills to get these industries moving again.  In the <Col N="1440" /> past I have been critical and I shall continue to be critical until something is done about our natural resources that have been wasted for too long.</P>
    <P>With regard to forestry, a report was commissioned in 1978 and I understand a summary was published in the <i>Progressive Farmer</i> in May 1980.  I should like to know from the Minister what has happened to that report.  Does he intend to implement the suggestions contained in it?  Ireland has the lowest percentage of land under trees in Europe. We have just about 3 per cent or 4 per cent under trees as against 20 per cent in other European countries.  Probably 25 per cent to 30 per cent of our land is poor, waste or mountain land.  When one travels in the western countries one sees many acres of land that are not utilised. In Germany every square yard of land is utilised.  We must utilise our land, and the Department are the people to do that.</P>
    <P>After all, the importation of timber represents our heaviest import bill.  I should like to know what the Minister proposes to do in this area.  The Government are trying to cut down on imports. We should ensure that we grow more trees, that we process more timber and thus reduce this shocking import bill.  Afforestation progressed steadily in the 1950s.  Recently we asked the Minister to tell us how many acres he considered would be planted in 1980 and how many acres were planted in 1979.  His reply was about 20,000 acres annually.  Even on that calculation, there was a shortfall of 5,000 acres in 1979 and 1980.  What is the reason for this?  We should not be satisfied to plant only 20,000 acres.  We must plan ahead because people who know about afforestation agree that there will be a world shortage of timber before the end of the 1990s.  We should plan now to cope with that problem, just as planning was done in the 1950s but that unfortunately did not continue.</P>
    <P>We have a ready-made market in this area because Britain can never be self-sufficient in timber.  We can be self-sufficient, and there is no excuse for any government to pay these vast amounts <Col N="1441" /> for imported timber.  The Department of Forestry will need to streamline the system regarding the acquisition of land. The present system is totally wrong. There should be no such thing as bargaining when it comes to buying land.  The people should be offered a realistic price for their land and if they do not accept it that is too bad.  The Department should offer farmers the proper market price, they should buy the land and get on with the work of afforestation. We should advertise for more land.  Our target should be to plant 40,000 acres per year.  There should be proper access roads to the forests so that the trees can be taken out.</P>
    <P>There has been much concern recently about the number of forest fires.  I should like the Minister in his reply to tell us how many acres of forests were destroyed by fire in 1979.  Fire brigade personnel have told me that the present system is not the right one.  I understand they have to consult with the forester and sometimes the Army before they attempt to put out the fire.  A direction should be given that the forester only should have complete control in the event of a fire.  Forest fires have cost the State a lot of money recently.  We should develop our forests, bogs and mountainous land.  Until this is done anybody who is serious about the development of afforestation cannot be happy.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the serious situation with regard to factories.  I suggest that the Department, in conjunction with the IDA, should ensure that factories are situated near the forests. This was part of the problem recently where there were closures in the saw-milling and chipboard industries.  We will have to deal with areas such as Cork, Mayo and Donegal.  It is sad to say that even the thinnings are not being taken from the forest.  As Members know, if thinnings are not taken away, the forests cannot develop properly and trees will not grow to maturity.</P>
    <P>We must get a market for our thinnings. It is sad that some of our thinnings are being left to rot.  The Department should give serious consideration to <Col N="1442" /> getting industrialists interested in the processing of timber.  These trees have been planted since the twenties and thirties and now that they are ready, it is sad that we have no processing facilities and no market for our timber especially when the second highest import here is timber.  The factory at Athy has been closed, the factory at Waterford has been closed, there are difficulties in Scariff and there is a question mark over Clondalkin.  I hope that every facility will be provided to ensure that another factory will not be closed.  The timber needed in this country can only be processed if we encourage the right people to process, manage and eventually sell the timber.  Thousands of jobs are going to waste in the timber industry. The Minister for Forestry has a challenge here to see that the forests are fully developed.</P>
    <P>In relation to fisheries I am glad that the Minister stated that he hopes to have an EEC policy before the House in 1981.  In relation to deep sea fishing we need to restructure BIM, we need an Irish fishing policy and also an EEC fishing policy.  We should re-structure BIM and formulate our policy before going to Brussels in relation to the EEC fishing policy.  The Minister's hand should be strengthened in this way because it will not be easy to negotiate in Brussels unless we have a fishing policy of our own.</P>
    <P>The function of BIM should be changed.  What is needed is a marine council to get all the interested parties under the one umbrella.  At the moment there are about six different departments dealing with marine life and three departments dealing with technology and research alone.  We are wasting a lot of expertise on the duplication of work.  The Minister, at Cabinet level, should suggest that everything to do with marine life should come under his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>BIM should be restructured <Col N="1443" /> so as to include everything to do with marine life under the one umbrella.</P>
      <P>In relation to our fishing policy, having regard to what has happened over the last couple of years, we cannot go to Brussels and talk only about quotas.  We must seek a system that will give us a 25-mile or a 20-mile fishing limit.  In relation to herring fishing the people in the south-east were not allowed to fish in their natural waters because of EEC regulations but at the same time if EEC boats come back to fish in the Celtic Sea the stocks will only last for a couple of years and the sea will be closed again.  We must learn by our mistakes.  Quotas are not enough.  When I inquired as to the quotas of fish taken from the Celtic Sea I could only get quotas for the Irish fishermen. We do not know what amounts of fish have been taken by the Dutch, French and Scottish trawlers and neither do the EEC.  Without knowing that we cannot talk about quotas.  We are the good boys and these people are getting away with blue murder.  As far as we are concerned our natural industry is not developing in the way it should.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I have not longer to deal with this and I suggest that in future in relation to two very important estimates, a lot more than 15 minutes should be given to cover them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the previous speaker, welcome the Minister to his new responsibility.  I offer the Minister my co-operation and that of my party in ensuring that the full potential of both the forestry and fishery areas is achieved.  As long as we know that the Minister is making an honest effort he will have our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many problems in the Department of Fisheries will not be dealt with here because of the short time we have at our disposal.  Even the Minister did not have time to conclude his opening speech. Before our entry into the EEC in 1970 <Col N="1444" /> the six countries in the Community put together a common fisheries policy the results of which have dogged our industry and will continue to do so until a common fisheries policy is achieved which meets our demands.  The original Communities fisheries policy was meant to give equal access to the six member states in territorial waters and there were no exclusive zones.  On our entry, EEC fishermen could fish right up to our coasts.  That has resulted in very considerable problems for us.  The common fisheries policy has been delayed on many occasions, particularly by the British Minister who insists that the British interests are fully met.  We too should have our interests met as far as possible by ensuring that a conservation limit around our coast is included in that policy.  This would give the Minister and his Department the sole right to decide on what is caught inside that water.  A 50-mile limit was suggested by me in the European Parliament several years ago. Unfortunately because of our membership of the EEC we cannot have an exclusive fishing limit.  However, we can have a conservation limit.  Surely we can demand a conservation limit.  We must ensure that the decisions taken in relation to fishing are decisions which will meet the needs of Irish fishermen exclusively. If we do not do so we will have a continuation of what has gone on since 1973 where over-fishing by Community boats and third country boats have depleted several important stocks.  Herring are at the point of destruction, not because of the activities of Irish fishing but because of the activities of those countries who having over-fished their waters have turned to the lucrative waters of other countries.</P>
    <P>We may not admire the approach of the British in many of their EEC negotiations but we have become familiar with their demands for their money, their fish and their waters.  We hope the Minister will maintain, in future, on the basis that Irish waters contain Irish fish for Irish fishermen.  I hope the Minister will have a strong approach in the coming very tough negotiations he has to face.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has not prospered <Col N="1445" /> as perhaps agriculture did on our entry to the EEC.  This can be quickly seen by the results given in the current issue of the BIM accounts which show that 91,000 tonnes of fish were taken in 1953 and in 1977, the latest year for which figures are available, 96,000 tonnes.  The value of this fish has risen enormously and the value through processing and exports has also risen enormously, but in fact the improvement in fish landings has been minimal, a little over 1 per cent over the years since our entry into the EEC.  The Minister must take this into account.  The expansion and investment in the industry are being questioned even by BIM in their opening remarks in their annual report.  The future of the industry depends on a common fisheries policy which will take into account the Hague Council's commitment to this country to double our catch over a period of&mdash;I think&mdash;five years.  The Minister has this as ammunition when he sits down at the council table.</P>
    <P>At present we are suffering through the dumping of fish from Canada and Norway.  One of the planks of our EEC membership has been Community preference.  The Minister must insist on Community preference for our fishermen. We are aware of the slump in the price of fish in the past week.  The salmon price is half of what it was last year, a windfall undoubtedly for the housewife and the consumer, but it will be a shortlived one because if the destruction of the fishing industry results from dumping here we know that after a short period prices will rocket beyond last year's figures.  We must all feel much sympathy for the salmon and inshore fishermen, and without going into the problems which the Minister faces in that area we must ask him to take a sympathetic line on the problems of the fishermen he met yesterday in this House.  Nobody wants to see the campaign set out in this morning's paper developing when we would see action having to be taken by our fishery patrols against these fishermen.  I ask the Minister to think further on the problems put forward by these fishermen, perhaps <Col N="1446" /> meet them again and try to arrive at some compromise before the campaign promised by these men begins.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the 10 per cent levy on buyers and consumers is being passed on to the fishermen.  Imposition by our Government of Community regulations, as Deputy White said, has meant that fishermen all around the coast, particularly in the poorer areas, are deprived of their livelihood.  Application of Common Market rules has reduced fishing periods and has closed fishing grounds and put certain species outside the catching potential of inshore fishermen, who are double the number of full-time fishermen and therefore a considerable asset to the industry.  The Minister should further consider the actions he may be contemplating against fishermen, and I ask him to give sympathetic examination to this very difficult problem which he faces.</P>
    <P>Those of us in the Labour Party in the European Parliament have tabled a resolution for discussion in the Committee of Agriculture on the problems of inshore fishermen.  We believe that this will be a help to the Minister in trying to get an improved policy and ensure that the destruction of this industry and the great difficulties this would place on the areas where fishermen live could be alleviated not only by the Department but also by community action.</P>
    <P>We know that work is proceeding at Howth Harbour and we must look at areas where perhaps it is not proceeding, such as Clogher Head particularly.  The value of landings in 1977 was half that of Howth and the facilities in Clogher Head are minimal.  We know the Minister is examining the situation, but we ask him to do so as quickly as possible. The pier there is crumbling.  He has seen it and I have seen it.  He should do something immediately in this case. Common Market funds are available for that purpose.  I believe there is a 50 per cent regional fund grant available for helping in that area.  Closer to my home town of Wicklow, I know that the Minister is considering aid for a fish landing quay there, and I ask him to give that also sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> In the time available I cannot make much impact on the very important Estimate for Forestry as it affects not only my own constituency but the whole country.  There are difficulties in the forestry industry, again resulting from the lack of application of Community preference by the Commission and through the lack of a forestry council meeting and the production of common forestry policy by the Council of Ministers.  The Minister is new to his office and probably has not had as much time as he would like to deal with this problem, but I would ask him to have this forestry council meeting to deal with the problems that are besetting the Irish industry.  The potential is there for an expansion of forestry, but we can see forest industries very close to where I live closing down because this potential is not being realised.  Some 45-50 per cent of forestry is produced within the Community, which implies a deficit situation of between 50 and 55 per cent.  The value of their imports last year was £5,000 million.  A small share of that spent in our country would make our forest industry much more viable.</P>
    <P>Forestry has various aims, the production of timber being the main one. There are also the conservation of the environment, provision of recreation, creation of employment and improvement of the standard of living, particularly in poorer rural areas.  I know its value to my own constituency.  Those of us who have the dual mandate, Deputy Cronin and myself, have asked questions on forestry so as to ensure that the Irish interest is always in the forefront of decision making.  I ask the Minister to allow us to use our influence at Parliament level in the future so as to ensure that the problems existing in the industry are raised on every possible occasion.  He was there with me for some time before 1979.  There was co-operation there then and I can assure him it is still there.  All Irish Members of the European Parliament are prepared to lend their full weight to any Irish Government proposals for the improvement of fishing, forestry or any other area of <Col N="1448" /> economic activity.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I hope that before the end of the year we will have a fuller discussion in both these areas when we will have time to cover many more aspects of this very important Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank particularly the two Members who have contributed to this debate from the other side of the House.  I am very conscious of the courtesy shown by Deputies and of the fact that their geographical position and personal experience might equip them to be much better able to deal with this than a person like myself who has not those advantages, not being from a maritime county.  I would like to thank them for their co-operation.  The Deputies mentioned that I might bring some new thinking to this Department.  I came to the Department with an open mind. Deputy White mentioned a change of heart.  I do not like to make a pun on it but I trust that a change of heart will operate from now on.  The Deputies appreciate as I do that we are dealing with national resources, forests, fisheries and wildlife, which are things which we would all like to cherish.  We have a common objective there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy White referred to a report from the National Economic and Social Research Council.  That report has been received and, in fact, many of the recommendations in it have become operative and as a result of this the IDA have been in a position to grant-aid 33 saw log projects this year and gave 500 people extra jobs in the timber industry.  We are often castigated because we have the lowest percentage of our land in forestry in Europe.  This is one thing we can say we have inherited when we look back to the old poem &ldquo;Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad&rdquo;.  That is so long ago that we should not use it as an excuse.  I believe we have made wonderful strides and we have done more work on afforestation than any other country since we got our liberty and opportunity to do that.  I believe if somebody who emigrated from <Col N="1449" /> here at the time the State was founded came back and we wanted to show him one particular item more than any other to illustrate what we had done in the course of that time I would dearly like to bring him to Deputy Kavanagh's county and say &ldquo;There are the forests which were not there when you left; there are the forests we have planted since.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do not want to rest on our oars. Imports of timber have been mentioned and we are conscious of the fact that we need to carry out more processing at home, we need better presentation and drying facilities, precision sawing and cutting of timber.  We are endeavouring to do this.  During the year we has discussions with the people in the timber industry. We have endeavoured to change the old system of tendering to probably an agreed price for a portion of that timber and to see that the cost of travel and the cost of bringing timber to the mill is got over as best we can.  Those matters have given us thought during the year.</P>
    <P>In my speech introducing the Estimate I forgot to mention the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  A sum of £80,000 is included in our Estimate to meet our contribution towards the expenses of that. That commission in recent years have had increased annual deficits, which is probably due to the rise in the wages of the commission's protection staff, which must be maintained.  There is a certain amount of illegal fishing in the area and the commission's income from fishing licences and profit from commercial fisheries have not succeeded in keeping pace with the extra expenditure.  The commission have increased the salmon licence duties payable for fishing in the Foyle area and will continue to try to reduce expenditure.</P>
    <P>Grants to the Inland Fisheries Trust were increased this year to over £1 million and to the Salmon Research Trust to £40,000.  The Galway Fisheries, which we acquired some years ago, showed a profit of £61,000 last year. Those are some facts which I should have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We have a figure of 10,000 hectares <Col N="1450" /> per year as our planting programme. There is a certain amount of difficulty with acquisition.  The Deputies will appreciate that land which was easily acquired was acquired some years ago. Price is not the only consideration.  There is a reluctance among Irish people to part with their land.  We have £2 million marked for land acquisition this year.  As we go on and as more mature timber becomes available opportunities for reafforestation rather than afforestation for the first time will enable us to reach our planting targets.  We are prepared to offer a realistic price.  Deputy White said that we should give them a realistic price.  When they are given a realistic price they feel that possibly they should have looked for a little more so there is more to it than that.  I assure the Deputy that we are endeavouring to acquire the land and we will make the money available to do that.</P>
    <P>The Deputies mentioned fires.  I share their concern with regard to forest fires.  I know I can count on the co-operation of all the House in relation to this matter. We had extraordinarily dry weather in April and May this year and 2,500 acres of forests were destroyed, an exceptional figure.</P>
    <P>We have had difficulties with the processing of thinnings.  This matter is being examined constantly by the IDA and we are glad of their co-operation. We have three or four firms who have shown very considerable interest.  We hope they will be back and that we can set up an industry which will deal with them.  The problem of the thinning of our forests is causing some delay.  There is, however, a certain amount of flexibility in the year that a thinning must take place.  The continued delay in thinning would result in eventual reduction in the diameter of the crop.  It is undesirable to allow it but we can cope with this in a year or two and hope to make it up later.</P>
    <P>We are getting continued co-operation from the IDA.  We have also entered into consultations with the ESB.  They are examining the potential of thinnings as a source of energy.  We are also dealing with pulpwood and the pulpwood trade. <Col N="1451" /> Even though those difficulties may be irksome now I am confident we will overcome them in the course of a few years.</P>
    <P>Deputy White mentioned the restructuring of BIM.  I saw a reference in the papers recently to that suggestion.  I am not positive that BIM are ideal.  I am sure even Fianna Fáil are not ideal.  We all have our faults but it is like the Land Commission which people said should be removed.  When one gets round to talking about what one would replace it with one would probably replace it with something else very much like it.</P>
    <P>BIM came in on the ground floor and did a lot of good for our fishing industry. They provided a ladder to enable many people to climb to the top and some of them are perhaps anxious to kick it away now in case others might climb up after them.  I know BIM are not perfect but they are not a liability.  Perhaps BIM need to be restructured, maybe we could improve them.  We will look at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern and I agree with him in regard to our scientific approach to marine life and that we should co-ordinate our efforts, see that there is no duplication of efforts and that any knowledge we have is combined and used.  The EEC and our attitude towards conservation were mentioned. If we decide on quotas there is no use talking about them unless we are sure they will be obeyed.  We must monitor catches from individual countries. We need to know more about this. It is only recently that the monitoring system has become a reality.  It only remains now to decide on the format of the log book that will be used.  That will be a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputy Kavanagh for his kind remarks and for his co-operation, which I have already enjoyed in Europe and further afield.  I, like him, regret the delay in implementing a common fishery policy.  We have, with our nearest member State <Col N="1452" /> across the water, established very close links.  We have had talks with them recently.  Those talks will be ongoing and I believe Britain and ourselves will be able to reach agreement on what we would like and, hopefully, look for, an exclusive fishery limit around our shores with preferential treatment beyond that. My priority, and I am sure it is the priority of everybody in the House, when I go to Europe is to look for the best possible deal for our fishermen, which will include the Hague Agreement.  The progressive and continuing development of our fisheries will go on there.  During the last week we have made efforts to curtail imports from Canada and lesser amounts from other countries.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to our difficulties in relation to the Salmon and Fishing Association.  I met them yesterday.  I have still a certain amount of sympathy for their case.  I realise that their work is hard and unsocial but it is not easy to deal with people when they hold a gun to your head and say: &ldquo;We will look for your co-operation and we will break the law if we do not get it&rdquo;.  That is not the way one expects to deal with people.  If Deputies can help in any way to bring about a peaceful solution&mdash;I am still looking at it&mdash;I would like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give them a commitment that the money will be put back into restocking?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that.  I have already given them that commitment.  That commitment is there and I assure them that it will be doubled and trebled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am positive of that. Deputy Kavanagh mentioned community action and his help in Europe.  I realise that when all parties in the House go to Europe they are Irishmen first and will work together.  I welcome the Deputy's offer of help.  I hope to have consultations with him during the year as to how best with our fishing, wildlife <Col N="1453" /> and forestry point of view we can advance our efforts in Europe and gain the greatest amount of good for the country.</P>
      <P>Harbours were mentioned.  We have specified particular harbours and we are allocating a lot of money to them.  Those are the select ones but that does not mean that work ceases on other harbours. We do one which we consider will be the greatest benefit and we get around to the others eventually.  We are giving Clogherhead active attention.  Deputy Kavanagh said that his own harbour in Wicklow had difficulties in relation to landing.  This is a very long-standing problem because over 1,500 years ago Saint Patrick experienced great difficulty in landing in Wicklow, when the people there would not allow him to land and he had to go north.  Maybe even at this stage we will manage to solve that problem.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak even briefly on this important subject.  I am glad that the Minister himself is here for the debate and I am grateful to him for coming here.  I trust that this is in recognition of the importance of this aspect of his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects of the public service which give rise to varying degrees of concern.  We are fortunate in <Col N="1455" /> having before us the Public Service Advisory Council report for year ended 31 October 1979, which has just been presented to the Dáil.  It reminds us of a number of issues which lie before us.  In this report the position with regard to promotional mobility is set out at paragraph 3.3.10.  It does not make very encouraging reading.  We are told, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...19 meetings were held with the staff interests with a view to reaching agreement for some opening up of posts to competition.</P>
    <P>&mdash;at several levels.  We are then told:</P>
    <P>Subject to ratification by the various staff associations, agreement has been reached on the overall objective that &ldquo;existing promotional arrangements in the higher grades of the Civil Service should be opened up with a view to the best-fitted civil servant being appointed&rdquo;.  It has also been agreed that the attainment of this objective should be on a phased basis and a period of five years is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>This is very limited progress indeed. One could turn this around and say that what is agreed is that the best-fitted civil servants in many cases will not be promoted in the next five years.  Put in those terms as an equally accurate statement, it is a depressing picture.  As the report of the council points out, this situation has continued now for ten years.  They refer back to the review group's recommendations that vacancies at the levels referred to, assistant principal level and higher, which are not to be filled from open competition should be advertised over the entire public service including commercial and State-sponsored bodies who should have a reciprocal arrangement.  In the decade which has elapsed it seems that little or no headway has been made towards reaching these important objectives.  The report suggests that it will be five years at least before limited progress is made in this area, and this is very disturbing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> There can be no legitimate case made against the principle that the best-fitted public servants should hold office.  We are talking about the public servants, the civil servants whose function is to serve the public and the community.  That service can be given only if the best of the best-fitted people are available and can take the posts that exist by way of promotion.</P>
    <P>There are two problems here.  One is promotion by merit within a particular Department and the other is mobility between Departments on a promotional level.  So far as promotion on merit within the Department is concerned, the picture is very patchy.  Some Departments have made great strides in many years past by promoting on a merit basis and I trust that this will be maintained, with due regard for humanity in cases of people whose merits may not sustain a case for their early promotion but who, nonetheless, should be fitted in as far as possible when a vacancy arises to a post which would be within their capacity. However, that does not change the fact that the position is pretty depressing.</P>
    <P>No case can be made for the present patchy system, where some Departments are fully on a merit basis and others appear to be on the basis of seniority, regardless of merit.  The difference between the types of service provided to the community by Departments where the different systems apply is quite striking.  While, of course, changes must be introduced gradually and humanely, and where they have been introduced this, has been done with success, there can be no case for retaining a system in which people are promoted regardless of merit on the basis of seniority.  The country deserves better than that.  What is striking is the quality of service provided by the civil service if given a chance to do so, where people are promoted on a merit basis.  It is clear that the civil service contains people of great ability who, once given the chance, can serve the country at a level and with a capacity which equals that of any country with whom we are in competition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Another important aspect is promotion between the Departments which secures mobility.  There are specialised grades requiring special experience in some cases.  Allowing for that, and minimising it as much as possible, it is important that when any post becomes available for a general service grade it should be open to competition throughout the service.  Anything less cannot be acceptable to the public, who are paying very substantial sums indeed&mdash;almost double what they were three years ago&mdash;for public service remuneration.  There is a problem of mobility at higher level.  The report from the Department has not much to say about this.  In paragraph 338, it tells that discussions have been held between the Department of the Public Service and the Confederation of Irish Industry with a view to staff exchange between the civil service and private industry, without the slightest indication as to what, if any, progress has been made or even what was discussed beyond the fact that it involves staff exchange.  As to whether short-term, long-term or what kind of scale or where they had got to in the discussion, nothing was said.</P>
    <P>The report of the council does not advery to this, as far as I can see.  I hope progress can be made here and that the skills and abilities of public servants can be made available to the private sector where there is a possibility that they can be utilised and that, in return, the public service could gain an access of knowledge and experience from outside, through people in the private sector moving in, possibly for a period of time rather than on a permanent basis, and that through that mobility both the private sector and the public service could benefit.  That should be our aim.  I ask the Minister, in that regard, because his own Department's report is so discreet, to say the least, to give some indication as to what progress was made in this respect.</P>
    <P>There is an important section in the report of the Public Service Advisory Council on the image of the civil service which should be read and considered by <Col N="1458" /> everybody who is concerned about the public service.  Their image is not as good as it should be, or as good as it could be, considering the kind of service given to us and the capacity and ability and sense of duty in service throughout the public service as a whole.  The council does advert to the difficulties which the civil service have in putting themselves across, the inhibitions imposed by their necessarily low profile.  There have, however, been times in the past when they have been successful in projecting themselves and as a result have been able to attract a significant proportion of the available talent into their ranks.  A sustained effort should be made to maintain progress in this regard and to improve their image so that the reality of the existing opportunities in the public service&mdash;and in the period ahead the opportunities will play a dynamic part in the development of our whole society&mdash;should be appreciated by young people who should not be put off by the stereotyped image of the civil service which has been handed down from generation to generation.</P>
    <P>There is a reference on page 14 of the council's report to staff relations in the public sector.  It is clearly a very inhibited reference which talks about delays in dealing with certain issues and that they are inhibited by the fact that the Commission on Industrial Relations are considering the matter.  It is clear from what they say that they are concerned about justifiable complaints which can exist about delays in dealing with staff relations matters, which of course in many instances have led to important and serious, and in some instances, prolonged strikes.</P>
    <P>There is a reference on page 34 of the Department's report paragraph 352, to the question of flexitime.  It is a rather disappointing reference and talks about a number of pilot projects covering about 1,500 staff, a tiny proportion, less than 5 per cent of the Minister's civil servants. No indication is given, either in the report from the Department or the council, as to why so little progress has been made and as to why there should be <Col N="1459" /> resistance within the civil service to flexitime. I hope that more progress will be made and that the suggestions which are current that opposition to flexitime derives from a situation where, with existing, rigid, fixed working hours, in the absence of checking in and out, civil servants may not be as tied down to doing a full day's work and that they fear that, with flexitime, they will be required to do a full number of hours work will be rebutted both by the staff organisations and by the Minister. The only effective form of rebuttal is for a general introduction of flexitime wherever, in the interest of the service to the public, this can be achieved.  There is no excuse for a situation where over 95 per cent of the public service are not operating flexitime and where there appears to be a resistence to it or a failure to implement it.  The Minister could usefully refer to this and tell us what progress he hopes to make.</P>
    <P>On page 34 also there is a reference to training for the public service and the working party between the CSTC and the IPA.  I am no longer a member of the executive committee of the IPA, so feel that I can refer to this.  Over the whole period of my membership of the executive committee there has been a constant saga of foot-dragging and evasion of the issue on the side of the civil service, which has inhibited the development of the maximum use of the training facilities by the IPA and, indeed, in the civil service, to the best advantage.  I trust the Minister will pay some attention to this and ensure that his working party submit a report rapidly and that he, himself, will take steps to ensure that the services of the IPA are fully used, as they have not been throughout the last ten or 15 years because of resistence within, in fact, his own Department.</P>
    <P>On the question of recruitment, it is striking that the report of the Public Service Advisory Council makes no reference to recruitment and this has been a tradition of their reports.  It is one of the features of their reports which I do not understand.  I would urge the council to turn their attention to this.  The <Col N="1460" /> Department, in its report, does refer to recruitment but only in a very limited sense in terms of improvements in the local appointments commission <i>modus operandi</i> which might be introduced also in the Civil Service Commission.  The whole question of recruitment to the civil service is something which should be looked at.  Recruitment is of course, effectively in the administrative grade exclusively at the level of people completing their education and with no possibility of people coming in bringing with them experience from outside.  To ensure against an adverse effect on promotional opportunities any such arrangement would have to involve a corresponding opportunity for people in the public service to move out and encouraging outward mobility so that people coming in would not be blocking promotions but could bring with them the kind of experience which under present circumstances cannot exist within the administrative sector of the public service, the members of which inherently are limited to whatever experience they acquire during the educational process. This, I know, is a deficiency in the system and mobility outwards and inwards would overcome this.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter to which I would refer, and I must speak very rapidly and very briefly, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is beginning to look at me.  I must refer to this matter, which is the allegations that have been made of political intervention in two important sectors of law enforcement within the last couple of months.  We have had this in regard to the Garda Síochána from the Association of Inspectors and Sergeants and the Minister for Justice's reply to this was misleading and disingenuous. He purported to believe that the only suggestion of political intervention related to such matters as transfer of gardaí where the initiative was taken by the gardaí themselves and ignored the fact that the allegations extended to stopping of prosecutions by political intervention and the stopping of Garda activity by preventing gardaí from doing their work.  These are most serious <Col N="1461" /> allegations, made six weeks or two months ago, which require full investigation and a full report to this House to be made by a responsible body of those concerned.</P>
    <P>We now have similar allegations made by the preventive officers.  There is a suggestion of political interference and governmental interference, not merely in cases where somebody brings the odd bottle across that they should not, but in cases which involve criminal activities and assault on preventive officers.  These allegations have been denied by the Minister.  Frankly, his denial is no more convincing than the evasive attempts of the Minister for Justice to deny that such influences are at work in regard to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>These are matters which the Government must take seriously if they have any concern for the public interest.  We cannot continue in a situation where public servants are forced, through their staff organisation, to make public allegations in this respect and these allegations are not investigated, where their morale is undermined and the confidence of the public in the Garda and the preventive officers and other bodies of law enforcement is undermined because of the failure of the Government to respond to these allegations.  The Minister must take this matter seriously, both in reference to people under his own direct control and people who are indirectly the responsibility of his Department, as being within the public service.  All I can say is that for our part, if and when we have the responsibility&mdash;and I would expect it to be before very long&mdash;of forming a Government, I would regard it as my responsibility, were I to head such a Government, to take all necessary steps to prevent this type of political intervention. That would involve the necessary steps to be taken against any politicians who intervene in these matters.  The Minister will recall that when we were in Government we created the office of the DPP as an independent office and created a situation in which any attempt to interfere with the DPP in carrying out his functions would itself be an offence. <Col N="1462" /> That has stopped that particular loophole.  But it is quite evident that what the Garda say is that it has merely transferred the attempts to interfere at a lower level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is only when there is the belief and conviction on the part of servants of the State that if they report any such attempts to interfere with them they will benefit and not be disadvantaged, it is only when that is the case, which it is not under this Government&mdash;and as far as I can see will not be under this Government&mdash;that this country will get the kind of service it deserves from our Garda Síochána, preventive officers and other officials of the State not intimidated by politicians into not carrying out their duties.</P>

      <P>I support many of the things in relation to mobility within the public sector to which Deputy FitzGerald referred.  Perhaps the Minister would devote some attention to that when replying.</P>
      <P>On the specific Estimate there is a figure of £250,000 under subhead A2 for Consultancy Services.  That is a considerable increase bearing in mind the general tightening of public expenditure and cut-backs generally.  Would the Minister let us have an itemised indication as to what that consultancy increase relates.</P>
      <P>Those are the two basic questions I wanted to pose in support of the many points made by Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to add a few points to what Deputy FitzGerald said arising out of this Estimate generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the House and people should keep an eye not only on mobility within the public sector but on the much more desirable target of mobility out of the public sector.  As I never tire of saying here, the public sector consists of a very large number of extremely dedicated, sincere and loyal people but there are far too many of them. Naturally that is not something which can be laid at the door of any individual one of them, and I do not lose sight of that human dimension.  But we have a bureaucracy which, measured against the productive sector of our economy, is many times too large, was too large even ten years ago.  Most certainly it is too large now.  I would be interested in seeing a system evolve&mdash;and I said this in the form of questions to the previous Minister for the Public Service on a few occasions&mdash;whereby schemes would be developed to induce civil servants to take what I might call quasi-sabbatical leave <Col N="1464" /> away from the service altogether, into private industry or business or, for all I care, into pig or poultry farming. Something which is very often forgotten is that the social pattern of this country for many decades was such that the public service attracted into it and got the absolute cream of the school-leaving brains.  That is something we should be glad about and proud of, except that too many of those creamy brains went into the public service and, I think, left the producing sectors of the economy relatively starved.</P>
    <P>It is never too late to change one's career.  I know there must be many bright talents and burning spirits in the public service concealed behind the routine of a fairly ordinary job, people who, with families and mortgages, perhaps feel that they cannot make a move.  I would be very interested in a system&mdash;and I thought that Deputy Colley when Minister in this area agreed with me that he would look into the matter&mdash;whereby a public servant could ask for what I might call quasi-sabbatical leave, in other words, leave which would not involve him in any risk of sacrificing seniority or re-employment in the same grade in the event that his experiment was unsuccessful, thereby allowing him put to the test any belief he might have in his capacity in business or in productive enterprise.  I know that if one succeeded in doing that with a handful of public servants one would be only scratching the top of the iceberg, let alone demolishing it so far as trimming the size of the public service is concerned.  But we must start somewhere.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that all I see coming from the Department of the Public Service&mdash;and I hope I am not offending anybody; I freely admit I am not an expert on the public service or anything like it&mdash;is stuff which can be described as an excuse for apparent activity.  That very Department for which the Minister has responsibility only two weeks ago launched a brand new journal of the public service.  I looked through the journal. On my oath there was nothing in it except a single article which would not <Col N="1465" /> have been out of place in the Journal of the Institute of Public Administration.  It was the kind of article one sees every other month in the Journal of the Institute of Public Administration.  What is the reason or excuse for a casual spending of, no doubt, a few thousand pounds and the casual employment of very highly paid public service time as well in the production of this absolutely, as far as I can see, unwanted, unneeded, unexcused, unheralded and unnoticed journal of the Department of the Public Service?  That is the kind of casual waste of money, waste of time, waste of life I deplore in this country.  That is seen more in the public service and in its out-crops in the semi-State bodies than anywhere else.  It would not be tolerated in private enterprise because it costs money and valuable time.  It costs that in the public service too except that the rest of us are paying for it, not the man who is in charge of the operation at all.</P>
    <P>I shall end by saying this&mdash;and I should like the Minister to treat this as a question and say a word or two about it if he does not think it too contemptible a point&mdash;that I sat here on 5 July 1977 nursing my wounds, along with my colleagues beside me, and listened to Deputy Jack Lynch make his acceptance speech on reappointment as Taoiseach.  I recall one thing above all others on which he laid emphasis in that speech, that was, reform of the public service.  He even spoken about the necessary requirement being political will, that political will was needed to reform the public service.  Let us ask what he meant by reform.  It is agreed that there is no element of corruption within the public service, so he cannot have meant cleaning it up in that sense like a district attorney in Medicine Bend or Tulsa.  It cannot have been cleaning up the public service.  We are agreed that they are dedicated and properly motivated so it cannot have been teaching them their job.  It cannot have been explaining to them what to do. Reform of the public service meant making sure that we had fewer of them.  It could not mean anything else and, if it <Col N="1466" /> does mean anything else, I am not interested in it.  That is what the former Taoiseach must have meant.  Where has that political will about which he spoke been visible over the last three years, or even since the apocalypse&mdash;if that is the word I want&mdash;arrived in the last six months in which every one of our economic indicators has gone from bad to worse, in which every pound note has sweated off ten pence of its value since December 1979?  Where is the political will to reform the civil service, or anything else for that matter?  I do not speak about cleaning anything up because there is far less hope of that now than there might have been once upon a time.  Where is the political will?  I am sorry to have expressed it rhetorically, and perhaps excitedly, but I would like the Minister to say a word or two about what he sees as being the primary objective under the heading reform of the public service, and what he proposes to do about it.</P>

      <P>In relation to flexi-time, the Department's policy has been to operate the pilot scheme for 12 months.  It is intended to extend the scope of flexi-time should the reviews prove they are accep table and useful schemes and in my view they are.  So far all indications are that flexi-time has proved itself but the final reviews will not be completed for some time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly raised the question of reform in the public service.  His idea of reform is that the service should be reduced.  I do not think we have too many civil servants, not do the staff associations.</P>

      <P>The only precedent which has been established is that Deputy FitzGerald, the leader of the main Opposition party, has made what he must now realise to be an unwarranted allegation at the inappropriate time when the Minister concerned is not here to deal with it.  That is a very undesirable precedent.  In response to the other allegation, I will deal with the area for which I have responsibility and the implication by the Deputy that there is foundation in the allegation because he regards my reply as unconvincing.  The <Col N="1474" /> allegations were in respect of political interference from all parties.</P>

      <P>Recognising the gravity of the allegation in terms of the role of the Government, public representatives and the public service, I had consultations immediately with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and asked if he would ascertain if there was any substance in these allegations.  Until such time as I get that report I cannot comment further.  However, I would point out that nothing had previously been brought to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Deputies must know that if representations on matters such as this are made at any time they are referred directly to the Revenue Commissioners or through the office of the Minister or the Department of Finance.  I presume Deputy FitzGerald knows that these matters are referred by the Minister or his Department to the appropriate statutory body, the Revenue Commissioners, for their consideration and reply and for their analysis of the problem.  When the reply comes through it is transmitted from the Revenue Commissioners to the Department or the Office of the Minister of the day and is then transmitted to the person who made <Col N="1475" /> representations, be that person a public representative or otherwise.  That has been standard procedure for a long time. If Deputy FitzGerald is suggesting that this involves unwarranted interference, then he should review the whole role of public representatives and the plight of members of the public who feel they have a grievance.  This matter is of such importance that I found it regrettable that the leader of the main Opposition party, without having any substantiation and without checking with his own party who are also alleged to have been involved, should make an allegation which he knows will be given publicity and which could give rise to further apprehension until such time as the true position emerges.  I regret that he has done this and I assure him that the Revenue Commissioners have not been and will not be in any way suborned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to offer both praise and blame to the Minister and his subordinates in this matter.  Many of the operations of the Office of Public Works in regard to national monuments and to buildings or structures of historic interest and worth are extremely tasteful and well executed.  I suppose it is hard to expect that in an empire of the kind presided over by the Office of Public Works everything will be well done.  Unfortunately they do not show the same sense of sensitivity in every case.  I understand it may be too much to expect that but I have to point out that there is a certain insensitivity with regard to their treatment of minor monuments.  Many of these memorials are not very famous but nonetheless they are attractive features of the decoration and fittings of public buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention two examples and I hope that by mentioning them here in the hearing of the Minister and his officials something may be done about them.  If I had time I could give many such examples. I am sure Deputy Quinn could multiply those examples by the thousand because I know it is a matter of special interest to him.  About 12 years ago a bomb was placed underneath a granite obelisk on the front at Dún Laoghaire just above the mailboat pier.  It was placed there to commemorate the visit of a British monarch to this country in 1821&mdash;King George IV.  I want to assure the House that I do not care a fig <Col N="1478" /> for King George IV, and I hope the Minister will accept that.  However, I believe if we have a monument it should be maintained.  If we are so sensitive and thin skinned that we cannot bear these memorials of our unhappy past, then let us remove them.  I am sure that in a far-flung corners of the British Empire or even in Britain there are people who would be glad to have that obelisk if it were offered to them.  If we want to keep it, let us keep it up.  If we do not want it, let us get rid of it.  Let us not do the half-thing, the slave thing, the bogman thing that is all too common here.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was a student about 25 years ago Dublin Corporation, that prize collection of patriots, decided they could not bear the sight of the cast-iron crowns on Kingsbridge.  The crowns were taken away: the bridge did not go because we still had to go back and forth. across it but it was a demonstration of patriotism in 1950 to remove the crowns.  Essentially that broke up the unity of the design.  That bridge was erected at the time of the visit of King George IV and it was called after him.  If we are ashamed of our history let us knock down the whole damn thing, build another bridge and christen it Heuston Bridge.  This fidding around, re-christening it after a patriot of our own while spoiling what was put there which, whatever its history, had a unity and an attraction of its own&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the Office of Public Works were responsible for Heuston Bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it was done on the motion of Dublin Corporation.  Certainly the Office of Public Works are responsible for the condition of the memorial in Dún Laoghaire.  It rests on four stone spheres and one of them was blown out by the explosion 12 years ago.  Since that time it has been resting on what I can only call a &ldquo;paddy-ignorant&rdquo; block of wood and naturally that is deteriorating. One day it will rot away completely and the memiorial will fall and quite likely injure people.  We should remove the damn thing or else spend a few pounds&mdash;as <Col N="1479" /> much money as would be spent on some tuppenny ha'penny celebration for something most people never heard of &mdash; and replace the memorial as it should be.  We should do one thing or the other.  I have no ideological commitment to the memorial good or bad but it is visually an attractive feature and I am sure that Deputy Quinn would agree with me.  I do not want to exaggerate these matters but to an eye that is sensitive to what is around one on the street&mdash;that goes for many people here as well as tourists&mdash;these things are important.</P>
      <P>When I was elected to the Seanad in 1969 there was a Victorian lamp standard&mdash;the standard is still there&mdash; near the Merrion Street gate.  Even though its proportions showed it was originally designed to hold a lantern at its summit&mdash;it was roughly two feet in depth with outward sloping square sides in the lower half&mdash;it was replaced by a wretched little article I could put in my pocket.  It was like something one would see outside a suburban villa in Stuttgart or in some industrial town in the Ruhr.  It had horrible little amber panes of glass, with fake bottle bottoms.  It was the most revolting little contraption.  When the late Deputy Henry Kenny was in charge of the Office of Public Works I asked him to do me and many more people the favour of improving the visual amenity of this place by finding somewhere in the vast empire of the OPW an appropriate lantern to surmount the standard. Fair play to the late Deputy Kenny, he found that lantern and had it erected.  It was a joy to the eye and I think Deputy Quinn would agree with me.  Will the House believe me when I say that is gone now and it is replaced by a grisly circular lantern that is completely out of keeping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise for holding up the House on points like this but these are the things that get us written off as ignorant people who do not care about their surroundings. I do not care about the colonial past.  Funnily enough, the Russians who are much more ideologically hostile to their past are very careful to keep and maintain the memorials of the <Col N="1480" /> Tsarist times.  Try blowing up one of their palaces and see what happens.  Try vandalising one of the monuments, however sad it may be for the history of the ordinary Russians in Leningrad, and see what happens.  The Irish, not because they have any ideological commitment one way or another but because they cannot be bothered to have a view or an opinion or to do anything about the matter allow what I have described to go on around us.  They allow a situation to be reached in which, as the poet Raftery said, &ldquo;nothing is whole that could be broken&rdquo;.  That appears to be the motto of the Irish establishment, represented far more by the Minister's party than by any other party in the House.</P>
    <P>I realise I have spoken excitedly about this matter.  I do not wish it to diminish the sincerity of the praise I gave to the Office of Public Works for the very fine work they have done which everyone admires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up the point which was rightly made by Deputy Kelly, which he well illustrated in his inimitable manner.  The range is quite exhaustive, it ranges from the small Victorian lamp standard to which the Deputy referred to the devastation that is done under the arterial drainage scheme.  Areas of our landscape are transformed by the machinations of a JCB which when draining a river piles high on either side of the river the excavated material so that what had been a river landscape from time immemorial is transformed into a sort of half-manufactured canal or half-excavated river.  The columnist Mr. John Healy has written on numerous occasions about this form of devastation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a number of questions in relation to landscaping on the completion of arterial schemes on the Boyne, Blackwater and so on, but the present Minister of State was not in office then. It is possible to make provision for the landscaping of the excavated material along the banks of rivers.  There is no evidence to suggest that this is being done.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate <Col N="1481" /> precisely the position in relation to this.  When an arterial drainage scheme is done is a landscape plan prepared?  Have the Department qualified landscape architects and horticulturalists in the Office of Public Works to cope with this work?  Who gets to see these plans?  Do either the local authority or the local group of An Taisce?  These bodies should be involved.

      <P>Subheads E and D refer to £12.5 million in the coming year.  The appearance of many of the buildings occupied by State Departments is quite scandalous.  The entrance halls and the windows are not cleaned and so on.  The degree of maintenance and cleaning down of reception areas, the furnishings and so on are at an unacceptably low level.  We are talking here in the region of the millions of pounds for maintenance and supplies.  Surely some of it is allocated for maintenance and surely somebody in the Office of Public Works reports directly back to the Minister and says that Oisin House, for example, is due for regular maintenance and clearance.  The Department of Social Welfare in Townsend Street is a particular example of this sort of thing.  It was a scandal last winter and the previous winter to see people queuing on the street waiting for payments because <Col N="1482" /> of the difficulties caused by the postal strike.  It made Dicken's London look like a benign utopia&mdash;the misery of coming down Townsend Street and seeing the miserable people who through no fault of their own were forced on to the social welfare system.  We could not even put a roof over their heads while they were waiting to have an inquiry dealt with.  What programme do we have in terms of clearing and keeping clean the public aspects of the public buildings? Arising from a question that Deputy Griffin of the Fine Gael Party put down to the Taoiseach I would appeal that something should be done in relation to the display of public art and for a general improvement in the visual appearance of public buildings for which we have been asked to vote moneys to maintain.</P>

      <P>This is too big a matter to go into now.  In relation to the problems in the staffing of Leinster House, I quite realise that we cannot ask the staff who have already got enough on their plate particularly a lot of security responsibilities, to do trivial jobs which were not originally envisaged.  But there are some small services which could be provided here.  For example, it should be possible to buy ordinary postage stamps in this House at any hour when the House is open.  It is fantastic that these services should be available here only when the Dáil is sitting.  There are no postal services here during the recess. There are no postal services even during sessions of the Dáil from the time the Dáil rises on Thursday until it sits again on the following Tuesday.  I know about the free post but there are other functions besides this.  Some Deputies, of whom I am one, occasionally buy a stamp for their own personal mail.  That cannot be done in the House.  There is no post office nearer than Clare Street on the one hand and Anne Street on the other.  I know these are not very far away but it is a nuisance in the middle of a busy morning if you have to go out and waste a quarter of an hour fetching stamps.  I do not suggest that anybody at present on the staff of the House, who would find it an unacceptable or difficult addition to his work, should be asked to do this trivial job but it is a facility that should be here.  Perhaps there should be at least some skeleton post office service of a general sort here every day that the House is open.</P>

From a totally different angle I <Col N="1486" /> agree with Deputy Quinn that there are adequate facilities for Members here at the moment but I would like to know the cause of the delay in having this work carried out.  At what stage are the plans or preparations to make good the damage?  I ask this because people in many parts of the country who want bridges built, for which perhaps the Board of Works, as we call it, are responsible, will say: &ldquo;If this type of work takes so long in Leinster House what hope have we of having our requirements attended to in remote parts of the country?&rdquo;  I would like a brief explanation of the delay in repairing this part of the House and to know when we may expect that the work will be done.</P>

      <P>I do not have any information on the bar here but I can speak from memory.  I think the Deputies should refer the questions to the Restaurant Committee because they are the people who are holding up the work.  Officials of the Office of Public Works have had discussions with the Restaurant Committee and told them they could restore the bar as it was previously, the members' bar and the public bar.  The Restaurant Committee did not want that.  They wanted a grandiose type of bar and a coffee-dock type of restaurant.  The Public Works officials and the Restaurant Committee had several discussions and only yesterday I asked my officials what the up-to-date position was.  They are awaiting confirmation of a request sent to the Restaurant Committee two months ago. We have not got this back.  The Board of Works are not holding up the matter. When we get co-operation and consent from the Restaurant Committee I can <Col N="1487" /> assure the House that the Board of Works will have the contract advertised as soon as possible and have the bar restored.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputies realise that this bar will have to be restored during holiday time because it cannot be restored when the Dáil or Seanad are Sitting.  The matter is now back with the Restaurant Committee.</P>

      <P>I do not think I have ever spoken on this subject before but I should like to put on record that everybody on my side of the House has, I think, a very high regard for the integrity and absolute regularity of the statistical operation.  I recall that, even when we were in Government, when one might have expected that some kind of favour or edge might be shown, that never was the case and there was never any question of getting figures early or getting them in any form other than that in which they were generally available. That is how it should be and I should like to praise the Central Statistics Office for maintaining those standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I suppose it can only do what it has the resources to do and it must do what it is told to do in the <Col N="1489" /> sense of what it is told to collect.

I raised this with another office-holder&mdash;there are so many of them that I cannot keep track of them; they are like mice at a crossroads &mdash;yesterday or the day before and I was told that the change was the result of a recommendation of a committee.  What kind of committee?  I am perfectly certain that there were no representatives of the Opposition on it.  It may have been the recommendation of an interdepartmental committee or a committee of administrators but I would be very surprised if it were a committee of people who actually need the services which the statistics office afford.  I may be wrong and if so I will say that I am sorry.  I should like the Minister to give us the reason for the change.</P>

      <P>My Government endured the publication of unemployment statistics every Friday afternoon and our noses were duly rubbed in them the following Tuesday when the Dáil met. The Government have succeeeded in avoiding that and have substituted for the 52 annual embarrasments a matter of 12, less the recess periods.  That is a very considerable political gain.  Let the Minister not tell me there was no political motive behind it.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Revenue Commissioners I am afraid I cannot bestow the same bouquet with the same glad heart on them as I did on the Commissioners of Public Works.  I want to reiterate in the Minister's presence a suggestion I made more than once before, which is that the Revenue Commissioners when issuing any kind of demand to any member of the public ought to use a form which incorporates a notional 100p broken down into the heads of services for which State expenditure is being incurred in that year.  That is not an eccentric idea.  It was a practice followed by Dublin Corporation in issuing rates demands and presumably still is to those who still pay rates.  Quite likely other local authorities did the same thing.  That performed a certain function of public instruction and enlightment because the ratepayer could see that for every £ he was paying in rates 2p was going for street lighting, a shilling was going for rubbish collection, so much for health, so much for housing and so on. That had a certain marginal function in public enlightenment and instruction.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, every Minister seems to regard no speech as complete unless he has thrown into it some bleating words about moderation in making demands. One cannot expect moderation in making demands from people who do not know what their money is being collected for.  Any move, however marginal, which will tell people and explain to them what State revenue is being expended on would be helpful even to the Ministers over there, little though they deserve the help of a suggestion like that.</P>

      <P>Obviously there is no comparison between Dublin Corporation or any local authority and Government services.  It is not confined to Dublin Corporation.  Every local authority have that practice.  Deputy Kelly must appreciate that if the Revenue Commissioners were to send out details of how the moneys collected were expended they would have to send out the total picture of Government expenditure. Obviously he is not talking about a document but a very substantial booklet.  I do not know exactly what Deputy Kelly has in mind, but the range of Government activities nowadays is so wide and comprehensive that it would be impossible to send a short list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that it could be done in a simplified form.  For example, out of every £ which the State disposes of, roughly 43p goes on public service pay and pensions, roughly 27p goes on paying interest on the national debt, roughly so much goes on social services and roughly so much else on defence and things like that.  I am not asking for a Book of Estimates but about ten simple heads which a citizen can understand and which will make him aware of the functions and the services for which the money being taken from him is being used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only got a minute on this.  I said the other day and I want to say it again in the Minister's presence that my impression is&mdash;I formed it before occupying briefly the post of Attorney General and have consolidated the impression since&mdash;that the legal services of the State are not sufficiently centralised and are not sufficiently well manned.  The people who are there are of the highest calibre but there are not enough of them and they are expected to do too many things.  This is the context in which I raised the matter last week.  In particular, the matter of the arbitration of the Continental Shelf between this <Col N="1495" /> country and Britain is of an importance which it would be difficult to exaggerate. It involves the potential ownership of a stretch of territory albeit covered by water and now not easily exploitable, almost the size of Ireland.  That is almost the size of what is at issue between ourselves and the British.</P>
      <P>It requires the non-stop attention of at least one very senior and fully qualified legal adviser all the time non-stop.  There is a mass of legal material of all kinds to be digested and it is not fair to thrust that task on a small office, dedicated and devoted as they are.  I know they work hours longer than the norm, it naturally goes without saying, without being paid for it or without getting any special recognition and they do not expect it.  It is not only not fair to them but it is not fair to the public interest that a matter of this immense importance should be simply one dusty file among a pack of others which a very small number of men have to handle.  I urge the Minister to take an interest in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I agree with the Deputy entirely.  As Deputy Kelly knows I have always been the forerunner in that area.  We would not have this issue being discussed between the Governments now had I not brought it to the attention of Deputy Kelly's Government who ignored it completely.  Deputy Kelly's Government laughed at it and it now transpires that the laugh was not very well warranted.</P>
