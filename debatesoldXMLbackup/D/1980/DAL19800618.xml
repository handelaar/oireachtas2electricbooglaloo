    <Title>International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1980: Second Stage (Resumed) and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="896" />
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the replenishment of the funds of the International Development Association, which is part of the World Bank.  It is important to highlight the fact that our joining in this replenishment does nothing to redress the outrageous cut-backs which have occurred in development assistance generally.  These cut-backs are of the order of £5 million this year, and will continue, and the Minister has not given an assurance that the situation will be in any way reversed. This Bill does not provide for a voluntary contribution on the part of the State, as suggested in the Minister's speech.  As a Part I member of the International Development Association we have a commitment and we are now merely discharging that commitment.  It is also important to bear in mind that the funds which will flow from the passing of this Bill, which I support, will not be paid in the current year.  It is in that context that we must look at the Bill and appreciate that it does nothing to restore our image in regard to the Third World or to redress the serious situation which has arisen as a result of Government cut-backs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some factors which must be borne in mind in discussing this Bill.  The International Development Association is an arm of the World Bank and some criticism might be made in regard to the fact that the human rights situation in countries in receipt of loans from the World Bank and the International Development Association is not apparently a factor in decisions on loans from these bodies.  I appreciate that there are difficulties in enforcing a standard of human rights in some underdeveloped countries through the loan mechanism, but I feel it should be one of the criteria borne in mind by the International Development Association and its parent body in making these loans.  While it would be simplistic for us to say that loans should not be made available to countries where there is a clear denial of human rights, at the same time the situation should not be ignored entirely.  The people in those countries are not to blame for the denial of human rights and <Col N="897" /> that must be a major consideration, provided there is a clear assurance that the loans made available will be ultimately to the benefit of the poor and will not merely result in the rich in those countries becoming richer.  I believe there could be a stronger emphasis on the human rights aspects in the sanctioning of these loans and a certain amount of pressure could be exerted to make it clear that those with a good record in human rights will be given greater priority with regard to the availability of funds.</P>
    <P>Another factor which must be borne in mind is that loans from the International Development Association are made available to Governments, largely for infrastructural projects, and to a large degree do not touch on the person-to-person contacts which have been so much a part of our own Third World aid programme which concentrated, in the voluntary and bilateral areas, on personnel. The damage which has been caused to the development of that kind of programme by the cut-backs made by this Government must be reversed.  I strongly urge the Minister to reverse the present policy in regard to Third World aid generally and even at this late stage to give a commitment that the clear and unequivocal guarantees which were given in that area in the past will be met by the present administration.</P>

      <P>One will not find anybody on these benches voting against any proposal to donate any amount of money, however meagre, to Third World development.  I think it is reasonable to put this Bill in its context, to raise a number of questions and to ask the Minister to comment on them.  It has been stated in the Minister's speech that the International Development Association is one of the organisations that makes up the World Bank group.  It has been evident for some time that the activities of the World Bank and its associations in the matter of development aid have not been above controversy and have sometimes exposed the World Bank to considerable criticism, much of it justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge there are difficulties in <Col N="898" /> this area.  On the one hand the developing countries are saying to the World Bank and its associated organisations such as the International Development Association that it is a fundamental principle of development aid as seen from their end of the telescope that there should be the minimum interference by the World Bank and its agencies in the internal affairs of those countries.  On the other hand, there are political movements in other countries, and indeed the Governments of donor countries in some cases insist on the attachment of conditions to World Bank loans and grants in relation to such important matters as human rights.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly narrow dividing line to be drawn here between a paternalism which is mainly designed to benefit the nations who are being paternalistic, mainly the donor nations, and the need to ensure that aid of this kind is effective and is not used in developing countries to shore up regimes of injustice, oppression or terror.  I am not satisfied that these criteria are always met or that the structures through which this aid is administered are not top-heavy with bureaucrats and with people whose main concern is a career rather than being devoted to altering fundamentally the balance of economic advantage as between the richer and the poorer countries.</P>
    <P>Another point worth making in this connection is that it must be difficult for people in this country to follow the sometimes labyrinthine twists and turns of our foreign aid policy.  We give aid under many headings; it could be argued that all of it is inadequate.  We give aid through the International Development Association and through the World Bank itself&mdash;although we are a recipient of World Bank aid in some instances. There is aid through the EEC&mdash;the Lomé Convention&mdash;and there is aid through bilateral agreements with individual countries.  One would like to see a more co-ordinated approach in which the balance sheet of our relationship with the developing world could be more clearly stated.  I suggest to the Minister <Col N="899" /> that on some appropriate occasion he might set out such a global balance sheet to indicate to the Irish people precisely where we stand under all of the headings taken together instead of dealing with them as we necessarily must <i>seriatim</i> under legislation like this.</P>
    <P>In particular, I think the Irish people would like to have a more general statement of Government policy in relation to development aid, an indication of whether the Government propose to muddle along on this piecemeal basis or whether they take seriously the demands of the developing countries for a new economic order.  Do they take seriously the predictions&mdash;I almost dare to say the doomsday predictions&mdash;of the Brandt Commission in relation to the economic relationship that should exist between the developing and the developed world?  This is an aspect not only of our foreign policy but also of our economic policy.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that the long-term political advantages of putting ourselves firmly on the side of the developing nations in the battle they are fighting against the highly industrialised, exploitative countries of the northern hemisphere could be substantial.  I ask him to address himself even briefly to these points when he is replying to this debate.</P>

      <P>In common with other speakers I support the Bill but I wish to raise some queries on the matter.  The Bill and the explanatory memorandum do not go into detail and I think the House is entitled to know exactly where the money will be spent.  It is not sufficient to get a bland statement saying that the fund generally is of the order of $12 billion over three years without giving a breakdown of that figure.  It is not sufficient to be told that we are contributing approximately $12 million during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply I should like the Minister to tell us of the nations who are contributing to the fund.  I ask that question because it is quite obvious that some of the developed countries are not pulling <Col N="900" /> their weight when it comes to providing aid for the underprivileged nations who are suffering famine and starvation.  It should be clearly spelled out here who is providing the money and who is reneging on their commitments.</P>
    <P>Obviously we are not in a position to provide a vast amount of money.  In our own rather difficult economic climate our contribution is praiseworthy.  I should like to know if the Russians, the Chinese and the better-off eastern bloc countries are contributing.  In addition I should like to know where the money is going.  I have read shocking figures about international funds to the underprivileged nations of the Third World.  I have read dreadful reports on the actual amount of money that reaches its destination in terms of medicines and foods and the percentage being used in the interim on administration.  When public funds are being granted we are entitled to have a breakdown of the actual amount of money that is reaching the people in need and the amount which is being spent on administrative costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an obligation to provide those figures in the House.  We, as the responsible body here, are entitled to know where the money is going.  We assume that it will go to areas of starvation and famine, to places such as Bangladesh, to countries in the horn of Africa such as Eritrea where there has been desperate starvation and famine, to Ethiopia, to Somalia, D'Jibouti and to Southern Sudan and so on.  In his reply will the Minister spell out exactly where the money is going.  Is it going to Kampuchea, where millions have starved in the last couple of years, or to Zimbabwe, where famine is taking its toll and famine is threatened for years to come because crops have completely failed, or is it going to Afghanistan?  Are political considerations dictating the areas to which the money is being channelled or is it being distributed on a purely humanitarian basis?  I am interested to see that the money is going to the places of greatest need.  I would like to know who is contributing and who is not contributing.  I <Col N="901" /> would like to know who is getting the money and who is not getting it, how much is getting through and how much is being spent on administration.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for the constructive manner in which this Bill has been met.  The basic purpose of the Bill was set out in my opening speech last evening.  The voluntary contribution of £6,230,000 by the Irish Government has to be sanctioned by this House and it represents .11 per cent which was estimated by the International Development Association as being the appropriate percentage for Ireland.  We have completely fulfilled our commitment. Indeed this was emphasised by the visit on Monday of Mr. Cargill, the senior Vice-President of the World Bank Group, who came here specifically to thank the Minister for Finance for the expeditious manner in which our contribution of £6¼ million to the association had been dealt with.  With the passage of this legislation our contribution will be one of the first to be lodged with the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of idle talk which indicates that we are not discharging our responsibility to the Third World, but that is not the case.  This is one example where the full amount sought was agreed to promptly and will hopefully be sanctioned by the Houses of the Oireachtas promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy's point is very valid. None of eastern European countries, Russia or China are contributors in this area apart from Yugoslavia and tentatively Romania.  As we know, Yugoslavia has been independent from the Eastern European bloc for some years and is a contributor.  Romania hopefully will be a contributor, but Russia, China and the other countries of eastern European bloc are not contributors. I have a long list of the contributors which if the Deputies require I can read out, but broadly speaking the contributors are all the other European countries, the North American <Col N="902" /> countries, some of the South American countries and Australia and New Zealand&mdash;in other words, the countries of the developed world, as we understand it.  The recipient countries are the countries regarded as being developing countries mainly in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan raised the question of the transfer of resources from the developed world to the developing world and this question could be the basis for a comprehensive debate.  The Deputy mentioned the Brandt Commission, which raises the point that unless there is a substantial transfer of resources from the developed world to the developing world we are heading into a crisis situation with the gap widening between the two areas.  In the past 12 months the most serious damage to the achievement of reducing disparities between the developed world and the Third World has been done by oil-producing Third World countries.  This is a sad but very real fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

      <P>I was at an OECD conference in Paris the week before last at which this was fully discussed.  It was also discussed at a meeting of the heads of state or Governments in Venice last week.  On the recycling of funds alone it is estimated that in the last 12 months 135 billion dollars have been transferred by reason of oil increases from the OECD countries to the OPEC countries.  Most of this has not found its way back into the world financial system.  Oil prices increased last year by about 120 per cent.  What all this means in practical terms is that the developed world has been hit so hard by the substantial oil increases that they are finding it difficult to meet their obligations to deal with the serious problems that exist in Third World countries that do not have oil or energy resources and who have serious economic and social problems.  The effectiveness of what were the wealthy expanding economies of the developed world to cope with this <Col N="903" /> shocking problem in the Third World has been considerably curtailed because of the action of those Third World countries over the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>The tragedy is that the Brandt report came out while this was happening and much that was admirable in that report depends on the continued expansion of the economies of the developed world.  If the developed world is in a period of economic expansion they can make the sacrifices and cream off the necessary funds to develop the developing world and thereby lead to a progressively improving world order in which we can reduce disparities and build up the Third World to the level of economic activity and social well-being that exists in the developed world.  That is Brandt's main thesis, but it has been frustrated in the manner just outlined.  This whole area is so important that it is engaging the attention of statesmen and leaders throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Bill has been widely welcomed as being our contribution to the International Development Association.  Deputy O'Keeffe made a number of points in regard to the question of aid generally.  In relation to the overall position in regard to overseas development assistance, for a number of reasons already mentioned this year we, in company with a number of other developed countries, had to a certain extent to cut our cloth to measure and not give as wholeheartedly or as generously as we would wish towards development assistance.  However, we did what could be done within reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total figure, including the various channels within the United Nations and the EEC by way of direct bilateral aid and through APSO in regard to the personnel service aspect, will amount to £16,226 million which represents an increase of £1.726 or approximately 12 per cent over the amount available for overseas aid in 1979.  I would like that figure to be much higher.  It is not higher by reason of the fact that, as a Government, our first priority was to our own people, our own budgetary standing and <Col N="904" /> to deal with our own economic problems.  On account of this first priority we were forced into a situation where we were not as generous as we would like to be.  The reason for that was as I mentioned earlier, prompted by Deputy Horgan, that the oil increases of last year placed very difficult budgetary constraints not alone on this country but on far more developed countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.  These countries are away ahead in terms of wealth and GNP and are pursuing policies of very strict budgerary constraint and restraint at present.</P>
    <P>In order to protect our economy, subject as it is to the variability of trade and commerce and an open trading economy, it is incumbent on us to adopt very stringent standards in regard to budgetary planning for the current year. Within that context there is an increase of 12 per cent in overall development assistance this year compared to last year.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy O'Keeffe that no existing schemes or commitments that have been made under the bilateral aid programme or APSO programme will be cancelled.  We have, because of the budgetary constraints, to be very careful about initiating new projects in the current year but as far as existing ones are concerned our commitments will be met. The Deputy seemed to indicate some criticism yesterday as to how the extra financing would be done.  I indicated on a previous occasion in answer to a Parliamentary Question that I proposed to utilise what flexibility exists as regards the transfer of funds within the overall total that I mentioned of £16.226 million.  I have a certain flexibility within that total and hope to be able to transfer funds from one block to another in order to meet commitments when they arise.  We will not renege on our commitments. There may be some scope for transferring from some of the multilateral blocks of funding to the bilateral funding.  This was done before where, because of the slowness of larger authorities to spend money, there is a shortfall in regard to multilateral expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> At the beginning of the year it is important as a State, to show our commitment and credibility, to make our contribution to these multilateral agencies, to the UN agencies, to the EEC and to the International Development Association. It is important to show earnest of our credibility and <i>bona fides</i> in the matter to give the full percentage sought by them and agreed between Ireland and them.  Quite often because of a slowness in administration there is a shortfall in actual expenditure.  That gives a Minister scope for transferring to bilateral commitments. This I propose to do.  It is the most pragmatic way to approach the matter.  I have informed the various people in charge of programmes of this fact already.  I have spoken to DEVCO, Dr. Tom Walsh, APSO and so on.  We will not fall back or cancel our commitments in this matter.  This point arose in the debate and is not really relevant to the Bill.</P>

      <Col N="906" /> FIRST SCHEDULE.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 69:</P>
    <P>In page 10, Article 3 (1), line 40, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to add &ldquo;only on the grounds of dereliction of duty as a member.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the removal of a member of the governing body.  Article 3 (1) of the Schedule states that the governing body, on the recommendation of the Minister, may remove a member of that body but it does not state the grounds or the circumstances for such a removal.  There is a need to specify the circumstances under which this removal may take place.  It is important that members of the governing body should have a relatively secure tenure of office.  They need that so that they can express themselves freely on the council.  They should not be in fear or be looking over their shoulders when making statements. Article 3 (1) implies that they can be removed from the governing body at the whim of the Minister.  That is unsatisfactory and open to abuse by a vindictive Minister.  I am not saying that the present Minister would be a party to abusing that provision but another Minister could do so and remove a person from the council who might otherwise be making an excellent contribution.  That is undesirable and the Article should be changed as I have suggested in my amendment.  A member should only be removed on the grounds of dereliction of duty.  That would be an equitable way of dealing with the membership of the council.  If a member is carrying out his duty the Minister should not be able to remove him from office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated already, I can envisage &ldquo;dereliction of duty&rdquo; being a fairly wide term and one that would cover the most normal circumstances for the removal of <Col N="907" /> a person from office.  I do not think there will be an inhibition on the freedom of speech of a member because of this.  For example, dereliction of duty can mean absence from meetings, as I mentioned earlier.  It is my experience on examining records of attendances of certain bodies like this throughout the general service and semi-State bodies that some people do not attend as often as they should. That is a dereliction of duty and, in my opinion, such a person should not hold office on a board.  There is also a question of illness.  A person may not be capable of assessing his own ability to attend a meeting and for that reason there should be power to remove such a person from office.  There may also be the question of a person, even though in a minority, who may be working completely against the interest of the governing body, who is making a nuisance of himself or herself.  While I appreciate the Deputy's sentiments with regard to this I do not admit that there is any danger in the provision.  The powers in the Schedule should be maintained.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 71:</P>
      <P>In page 11, Article 4 (1), line 9, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 4 states that an ordinary member of the governing body shall hold office for a period not exceeding five years and my amendment proposes that such a member should be in a position to hold office for a period of ten years but not more.  In my view ten years is adequate. Article 4 limits the period of office to one term.  A situation could arise where a college or institute might embark on a development plan which would normally take from six to eight years and in those circumstances a member of the governing body who was involved in that plan from the outset should have the opportunity of seeing it through.  That cannot <Col N="908" /> be done if his period of service is limited to five years.  Realistically, he should be able to look forward to a period on the governing body of ten years ago so that he can actively participate in the decisions of the body and see them brought to fruition.  My amendment is reasonable and desirable.  Article 4 is narrow in its outlook.</P>

      <P>Article 4 (1), if the Deputy's amendment is accepted, will read:</P>
      <P>An ordinary member of the Governing Body (including the chairman but excluding an ordinary member who is a registered student of the Institute) shall hold office for a period not exceeding ten years.</P>
      <P>That would be too long for any member. The only way such a member could be removed would be by bringing the Minister in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, that is not correct.  Ordinarily, a member is appointed to the governing body for five years.  There is nothing to stop any Minister from changing the governing body after five years but I am seeking a provision that a person may be reappointed for a second period of five years.  At the moment that cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="909" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come back to that in a moment but first I want to make my point.  I think it is too long a period to ask a person to serve in the first instance for ten years, except student members. In particular we have been talking about the importance of this institute and with regard to technological education it has become almost a cliché at educational gatherings and in educational debate to say that the pace of technological change is so fast that we must be on our guard to give the proper kind of education to enable people to adapt and retrain as quickly as possible.  Since 1945 the pace has been so fast that it is surprising that we have been able to maintain our educational sanity.  If the pace is fast we must involve people who are aware of the speed of change, who will be able to give advice on how to cope with this without losing our basic, solid hard core of training which enables change to be made.  That is one point.</P>
      <P>The second point is that when approaching people who by the nature of things, by definition almost, are busy people, people involved in this sphere and many of whom make great sacrifices in order to give service to education and to the country, they will be reluctant to accept if a period of ten years is mentioned, whereas it is quite possible that they will be willing to serve for five years.  The third point and the one which is most important is that I am informed that on the reading of article 4 (1) line 9 on page 11 somebody who has been appointed for five years may be reappointed for another five years.  So, there is no necessity for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On my reading of the First Schedule either the Minister intends to appoint a member for a period not exceeding five years and if that is so, on my reading of article 4 (1) he cannot be appointed for a second period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my interpretation of it.  Obviously, we are not being political here at all.  We are trying to <Col N="910" /> have a proper reading of a Bill for clarity's sake.  There are no politics here at all.  It is a drafting problem.  It could mean that the Minister intends to appoint a person for five years and if so there is no provision for reappointment for a further five years.  One possible reading of the Bill is that he can only appoint a member for five years.  That is paragraph (1).  If that is the case, I would reject it.  A person should have the possibility of serving for two terms of office, five years and five years.  On my reading of the Bill that is not possible. My amendment does not seek to appoint a person for ten years.  I think that is undesirable and certainly not my wish, which is to have the reading of the Bill such that the term of office is five years, that a person should initially be appointed for five years but that he should have the opportunity of serving for a period of not more than ten years.  In other words he would have the possibility of being reappointed once.  If we can get to a clear reading of the Bill I shall be happy about it, but at the moment it does not lend itself to a clear and simple reading and it will be open to misinterpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have managed to clarify many things in the past couple of minutes.  Deputy Collins's intention is now very clear.  I am not certain that his amendment would carry out this intention. Equally, I am sure that the Minister's response to Deputy Collins, by meeting one of Deputy Collins's points, does not meet the other one.  It is clear to me from my reading of the Bill&mdash;and one must read the amendment and the section of the Schedule it proposes to amend in conjunction with other sections of the Schedule&mdash;that first under Article 4 (1) of the Schedule, an ordinary member of the governing body shall hold office for a period not exceeding five years, but under section 3 (4)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes it quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is stated that an ordinary member of the governing body whose term of office expires by effluxion <Col N="911" /> of time&mdash;that is at the end of the five years&mdash;shall be eligible for reappointment. That clears up one point.  But there is another point that Deputy Collins has raised and which the Minister himself has adverted to.  That is the effect of leaving this provision unamended.  The effect of leaving it unamended is to enable the Minister to reappoint people <i>ad infinitum</i> up to the age of 70.</P>
      <P>Here I must charge the Minister with inconsistency because he began his reply to Deputy Collins by pointing out the speed of technological change, the need for replacement of personnel so that new insights and so on could be brought to bear on the work of the institute.  Yet, he is doing that in a Bill which contains a Schedule which allows him, first, to reappoint every ordinary member of the council indefinitely up to the age of 70 at five-year intervals and which, secondly, allows him to appoint a chairman to the governing body, perhaps at the age of 50, who could hold office without further reappointment for another 20 years. Where is the consistency in this?  Would the Minister between now and Report Stage not consider a drafting amendment which would limit the reappointment, at least of ordinary members, to a single further term of five years in order to underline the facts that he himself advanced in his initial response to Deputy Collins about the renewal of knowledge in this area?</P>

      <P>I reject the idea of inconsistency. The Minister would be inconsistent only if in fact he reappointed and kept on reappointing up to age 70.  There is no inconsistency in the Bill as it is when it says, as Deputy Horgan rightly pointed out, that an ordinary member of the governing body whose term of office expires by effluxion of time shall be eligible for reappointment.  If he is 65 and the Minister reappointed him despite the Minister's argument about the speed of technological change, then the Minister would be inconsistent, but he is not inconsistent simply because he has part of a Schedule to the Bill which allows reappointment, <Col N="912" /> as it does under 3 (4), which must have escaped the notice of Deputy Collins.  It leaves the Minister open to pick the best person, to leave him five years or ten years, depending on his quality, as a member and to cease reappointing him when the Minister is convinced with the advice available to him that the person is no longer an effective member of the board.</P>

      <P>The objective of my amendment is to ensure that no ordinary member of the council will have a life span on the council of more than ten years.  Neither articles 3 (4) nor 4 (1) meet that objective.  That is undesirable. I intend to take this matter up on Report Stage.  Another aspect which I would like to comment on, which has escaped the Minister's attention is section 5 (3) where it is stated:</P>
      <P>The first Governing Body of the Institute shall be appointed... for the period of one year.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for serving on the first Governing body because article 4 (1) of the First Schedule says:</P>
      <P>An ordinary member of the Governing Body... shall hold office for a period not exceeding five years.</P>
      <P>No exception has been made in this article for serving on the first governing body.  Am I to understand that a person appointed to the first governing body shall be a member of the next governing body?  What special provision is there for the appointment of ordinary members to the first governing body, which is for only one year in view of the wording of article 4 (1) of the First Schedule?</P>

      <P>In page 11, Article 4 (2), line 11, to delete &ldquo;one&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the ordinary member of the governing body who is a student.  I do not believe that a student or anybody would contribute much to a governing body in the space of one year.  It is far too short a time because a number of discussion papers and a number of reports would come up from committees, which one would expect in the normal course of events to take more than one year.  A one-year membership for a student is inadequate.  I suggest that a period of two years would be quite suitable for a member of the governing body who is a student.  I do not believe that a contribution over a period of one year would be successful.  There would be a lot of coming and going for the student in a short period and I do not believe that would be of any great benefit to the council.  The student might be quite brilliant and he might want to contribute to the work of the council.  He will certainly not be able to do that in the period of one year and I suggest that two years would be a reasonable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see why the original ruling in relation to amendment No. 73 was made because people can be students for a great number of years in third level institutions.  Various devices have been adopted from time to time to reduce the maximum number of years. During the time Deputy Collins and I were in college, students used to be there for donkey's years sometimes running into two figures.  I urge the Minister to consider adding something like what is in the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the Bill is the most reasonable one because, as the Deputies know, usually a student reaches the presidency of his students' representative council in his final year and the sabbatical year is then available. This is a useful period for student membership because he can dedicate himself to the affairs of students and have the time to put in a reasonable input into the governing body.  I do not think that the student organisations would be too keen on having a position blocked for two years and very good material which was available might have to skip a year and not have any opportunity of serving.  The actual holders of office on the governing body could be reduced by 50 per cent if the nomination was only every two years. The provisions of the Schedule as they are are the best in all the circumstances. There is no argument that convinces me that we should change that.  This is mainly based on pragmatism in that, as I see it this is the way the scheme is operating as of now.  The officers change year by year and almost half of the executive changes.  They are very jealous of their own prerogatives and each executive and officer board would like to be in a position to nominate their own person for this governing body where they have the facility.  The definition of the student who can act on the governing body is that he must be a full-time student of the institute.  Deputy Horgan covered the point about the chronic student <Col N="917" /> who used to exist, but life has become too serious for that nowadays. However, at present there are from the Continent of Europe several complaints about the eternal student even from EEC countries where the period for graduation, although in no way tainted with the chronic label can be seven or eight years as a full-time student before getting final qualifications.  It is one of the things that we find very hard to understand here. Our students are graduating rather on the young side and the result is that even proper statistics cannot be compiled. Whereas the graduation age can be 25 or 26 on the Continent, many people graduating in the ordinary science, mathematics, and commerce courses in our universities are 21 or 22 at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 74:</P>
      <P>In page 11, Article 6 (a) (i), line 25, to delete &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;elected&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to allow members of the governing body to be nominated for a Seanad Éireann election or a Dáil Éireann election or for election to the European Assembly and still retain membership of the governing body.  It is extremely unfair and narrow-minded to expect that members of the governing body who probably are very highly qualified and whom we would like to see in Dáil Éireann and continuing as members of the governing body have to resign from the governing body as soon as they are nominated.  After all, in the first instance we would like to see them <Col N="918" /> on the governing body and we would also like to see them in this House or the upper House or in the European Parliament. It is unfair in the extreme and reflective of the narrow approach and narrow stance of the Minister to expect people who have been nominated to resign immediately from the governing body.  We should be encouraging people to stand for public election and we should encourage highly qualified people, experts in various fields, to stand for election and to become Members of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament. Yet here we have a block being put in their way.  A stumbling block exists now in this Bill whereby highly qualified people who wish to stand for public election find that if they are even nominated they will have to give up immediately the place on the governing body of NIHE Limerick and I assume that this applies also to NIHE Dublin.  That is intolerable in this modern age of ours when we are all anxious that experts should be nominated for election.  Here is a stumbling block being put by this Minister.  It is unacceptable to me and to my party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment.  I can see the reason why the power of the schedule is as it is because plainly the Minister would not like to nominate or have nominated to the governing body anybody whose sole aim and objective in relation to the governing body was to use it as a political jumping-off point or platform. But any danger that that might happen could be dealt with very adequately by the other powers available to the Minister under other parts of the schedule.  He would be able in minor cases of abuse&mdash;I put it in that way&mdash;to decline to reappoint the person at the end of five years, and in anything that he might regard as a major case of abuse, there could be two elections in a five-year period if it fell in a particular way. He could exercise his powers to remove the person from the board at short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other aspect that occurs to me is that in relation to somebody who is nominated for election.  The effect of this <Col N="919" /> part of the schedule as unamended would be to ensure that he could not put on any of his election literature that he was a member of the board of the institute. If he has done a reasonable job on the board of the institute it seems unreasonable and unfair to force him to say &ldquo;a former member of the board&rdquo; when he was a member up to the day he handed in his nomination papers.  I suggest to the Minister that he look sympathetically at this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we do not stick our head into the sand over this matter.  If a person is good enough to be appointed to a governing body, so be it, he is a member of the governing body. It does not matter if he is described on his literature as a member of the government body or as a former member of the governing body, the stature remains the same.  The way the Minister has it is that if he did put it on his election literature it might be unfair.  There is nothing unfair about being a member of the governing body.  It is something of which one should be proud.  One should be quite happy to see it on his literature and I would not have any qualms about that. This is reflecting an extremely narrow minded approach by the Minister.</P>

      <P>In page 11, Article 6, to delete lines 42 and 43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to section 6 (b) (2) of the Schedule.  I should point out at this stage that if it were accepted, either <Col N="922" /> now or on Report Stage, there would be a necessity for a consequential amendment to 6 (a) (1).  In passing, I may say that the point raised by Deputy Collins about the use of the words &ldquo;appointed to&rdquo; is important here.  If we clarify that, we shall realise that one can become a representative of the Assembly of the European Communities by appointment as well as by election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation specifically to my amendment, I stress that a consequential amendment would be necessary if it were accepted.</P>
      <P>I raise the area of the propriety of appointing person of a political nature to bodies such as this.  In the past it has not been unknown for Governments to appoint serving politicians, as it were, to boards in general, and especially to the boards of educational institutions.  If my memory serves me correctly, Mrs. Celia Lynch, for example, was a serving Fianna Fáil TD who was appointed and reappointed on several occasions to the governing body of University College, Dublin and, no doubt, performed excellently as a member of that body.  We seem here to be introducing and copper-fastening the idea that if one is elected as a public representative it disqualifies one <i>per se</i> from appointment in certain other areas of public service, even though, as here, they are not remunerative ones.  I would be slow to give total support to that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that if one is in politics, it is to secure the widest possible acceptance for one's political point of view.  There appears to be no realistic argument against the Government making appointments of a certain kind&mdash;when I say of a certain <Col N="923" /> kind, I must stress that it would be open and public and above board&mdash;of people who share their political convictions to certain bodies in certain cases.  There are, of course, areas in which this would be difficult.  As a principle, no politician who believed in the truth and validity of what he was about in this country could tie both his hands behind his back in relation to any appointment that the Government, of which he was a member, might choose to make.</P>
    <P>There are two kinds of patronage. There is the backstairs patronage, the job-for-the-boys patronage, the enabling of people to jump queues which they could not otherwise jump, the appointment of people in such a way that it keeps out of jobs people who are better qualified than they are.  That is a form of patronage that we, on these benches, find totally reprehensible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to appointing, in the public forum, people to public bodies to ensure that the political viewpoint which has elected one as a member of a Government is adequately represented in the institutions of the State, then a fair case can be made for allowing a Government a reasonable amount of freedom in this matter.  The Government must stand over their appointment and ultimately face the electorate. That is the sanction on that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have chosen one particular aspect of this matter for my amendment.  I have accepted, for the purposes of argument, that a TD or a Senator should be ineligible for appointment to the governing body of this institution.  I am, however, suggesting in the amendment that a member of the European Parliament who is not a TD or a Senator should be eligible for appointment to the governing body.  I do so for several reasons.  Firstly, it is not, by any means, certain that members of the European Parliament will always be members, in addition to being members either of the Dáil or of <Col N="924" /> the Seanad.  The Minister's own Party exacted a pledge from candidates to the European Parliament that, if elected, they would not stand again for election to the Dáil in the forthcoming General Election.  For their own good reasons, no doubt, his party are now reconsidering that pledge, but we are, at least, entitled to assume that there were good reasons for exacting the pledge in the first place and that as a result there are good reasons for withdrawing it in current circumstances, and that the correlation between membership of the European Parliament and membership of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas is not necessarily a fixed and definite thing.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that, as I have said, there is a tradition of appointing certain politicians to boards, which is not an ignoble tradition provided that they do their work properly and that the appointments are made in a fair and above board fashion.  The third reason, which applies with particular force to NIHE Limerick, is that this is a national institute. The possibility for a member of the European Parliament to be a member of a board of a national institution like this is one that should not lightly be tossed out.  It would reflect the national character of the institution and indeed&mdash;and this is my final reason&mdash;might make it possible for that particular institution to have a degree of access to European sources of funds and, indeed, of research and other forms of expertise by a direct link which might prove particularly fruitful.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to support my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there is the question of the heavy pressures on representatives, especially European representative and particularly those who have a local mandate, of which I am sure Deputy Horgan is aware.  It is something all the political parties have to come to terms with.  But the expertise which such representatives in the European Parliament may develop, particularly if they serve on one of the committees involved in education and the technological areas, surely will still be <Col N="925" /> available to the educational institutions of the country by virtue of the fact that a person is representing Ireland and would see it as his or her duty and obligation to put whatever information and expertise they so gathered at the disposal of the Department of Education and of the institutions in the State.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a point about the reason for being in public life and spoke of the legitimate desire of a person to have the widest possible acceptance of a political point of view.  I will accept that in general but its relevance to the membership of a governing body of a national institution is not immediately apparent.  Where ideology impinges on educational policy, yes, but in the ordinary way I do not see that this would be of any particular advantage in the activities of a governing body.  In the widest possible philosophic state of what the Deputy was speaking about, yes, I could see that.  But if it came down to the day-to-day political scene in the area it would not be of any great help at all.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Deputy and the House to the European Assembly (Irish Representatives) Act of 1979 which deals specifically with the cases of members of the European Assembly.  It is far more restrictive than anything I have in this Bill.  Members of the European Assembly are disqualified from membership of or employment by a whole list of bodies including the National Council for Education Awards and the Higher Education Authority. When I brought before the House amendments deleting section 9, subsections (6) and (7) I went a long way to meeting some of the points raised on this amendment.  I do not think the Deputy would ask me to go any further.  I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to something which is important, that is, that the member of the European Assembly would have an awareness of areas where funds might be available to a national institute. He touched on a very important point, that it is incumbent on every person in the European Parliament, while not carrying a begging bowl, to keep his <Col N="926" /> or her eyes and ears sharpened to the possibilities of advantage for his or her own country.  I am quite sure that the people elected to the European Assembly will do that.  Certainly they will receive encouragement from the Government and obviously also from the Opposition for the general welfare of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 76a:</P>
      <P>76a.  In page 12, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following Article:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) A member of the Governing Body who has&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) any interest in any company or concern with which the Institute proposes to make any contract, or</P>
      <P>(b) any interest in any contract which the Institute proposes to make.</P>
      <P>shall disclose to the Governing Body the fact of the interest and the nature thereof and shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Governing Body relating to the contract, and the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the Governing Body.</P>
      <P>(2) A member of the Governing Body who is related to a person who is a candidate for appointment by the Governing Body as an officer or servant of the institute shall disclose to the Governing Body the fact of the relationship and the nature thereof and shall, if the Governing Body so decide, take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Governing Body relating to the appointment, and the disclosure and decision shall be recorded in the minutes of the Governing Body.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> Briefly the effect of this amendment is to bind any member of the governing body to disclose any interest he or she may have in any company, concern or contract with which the institute is involved. Also it seeks to declare any relationship any member to declare any relationship he or she may have to a candidate for appointment to the staff.  It seeks to impose an obligation also not to take part in any deliberations or decisions of the governing body in connection with these affairs.  In other words, it covers the whole area of declaration of interest and the withdrawal from any activities of the body connected with those interests whether they be interests of relationship or of a material nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today the Minister charged me with incompetence. This amendment is proof of his incompetence in relation to this Bill, I tabled my amendment No. 79 to ensure that there would be no possibility of a member of the governing body using his knowledge for personal advancement within the governing body.  I want to make it quite clear that the Minister's amendment was introduced some time after mine had been published.  The wording is very similar.  Therefore, the Minister has introduced nothing new in his amendment.  He was merely being niggardly to the extent that he did not want my amendment to be passed, knowing it to be a proper one and essential for the good of the Bill and of the governing body.  I do not know why the Minister should be so narrow-minded as not to want my amendment passed.  I am sure he did not have a political reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to ensure that a member of the governing body who has any interest in any company or concern with which the governing body proposes to make any contract, or has any interest in any contract which the governing body proposes to make, must disclose to the governing body the fact of the interest and the nature thereof and shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the governing body relating to the <Col N="928" /> contract, and that the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the governing body.  It is essential that that should be so.  We have often heard bandied around allegations that people have used their positions in relation to knowledge or money, gaining from such knowledge, and advance knowledge of government matters, to such an extent that it has caused public disquiet.  Therefore it is important that we ensure that this will not be the position of the governing body.</P>
    <P>The second part of my amendment reads:</P>
    <P>(2) A member of the Governing Body who is related to a person who is a candidate for appointment by the Governing Body as an officer or servant of the Governing Body the fact close to the Government Body the fact of the relationship and the nature thereof and shall, if the Governing Body so decide, take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Governing Body relating to the appointment, and the disclosure and decision shall be recorded in the minutes of the Governing Body.</P>
    <P>That is also important.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of my amendment, and of the Minister's too, which should be commented on, I omitted to state any penalty for the failure of disclosure.  That is a fault in these two amendments.  We are stating what a person should do and shall do when he is a member of a governing body.  I was at a loss to know how far I should go in this matter.  What is the position of a person who does not disclose his interest or his relationship? If it transpires that a member of a governing body does not declare his interest in a company which might be tendering or has tendered, for a building of an extension to the NHE and he votes on the granting of the contract, what is his position? Is he liable to action in the courts and, if so, by whom?  Will it be by the institute or by the Office of the Public Prosecutor?  Will a penalty be imposed? Will he be fined?  These questions are very important and I would like the Minister to comment on them.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 76a is practically the same as the provision in the National College of Art and Design Act, 1971, which was piloted through both Houses by the present Minister for Defence, Deputy Faulkner.  Section 9 of that Act reads:</P>
      <P>(1) A member of An Bord who has&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) any interest in any company or concern with which An Bord proposes to make any contract, or</P>
      <P>(b) any interest in any contract which An Bord proposes to make,</P>
      <P>shall disclose to An Bord the fact of the interest and the nature thereof...</P>
      <P>The section goes on to deal with the position of a candidate for appointment. In that Act there is also an obligation to disclose.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Collins' question if there is a breach of the law of the land, there is no need to stipulate this because there is a series of laws to cover any eventualities with which this section of the new Bill is designed to cope.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 77:</P>
      <P>In page 12, Article 8 (3), to delete &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to a quorum of the governing body which in my view is too low&mdash;one-third.  If 23 members are appointed to the board they have an obligation to attend meetings.  By having the quorum as low as eight we are allowing 15 members to absent themselves from the meetings of the council.  This is undesirable.  It means twice as many members could be absent as are present. I would prefer the quorum to be as high as 12, half the number of ordinary members. I opted for ten because I did not want to make things too difficult.  In my view eight is an unacceptably low number.</P>

      <P>There is no way anyone can decide what the best quorum is.  In this House a quorum is 20 Members, a much lower percentage than is required in the governing body.  This is a vexed question and is always subject to debate but a number of matters have to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>In a national institute, in this instance situated in the mid-west parts of the country, the board members are appointed nationally.  If there is an emergency&mdash;a strike or an epidemic and if the quorum is too high, it may not be possible to hold an emergency meeting.  The general quorum decided on in bodies of this kind is usually one-third.  Ten would be a reasonable quorum for a governing body of 30.  Eight should be sufficient to be representative of the views of the governing body and to facilitate the holding of meetings.  Normally I would expect attendance to be nearer 100 per cent but it is safe and democratic to choose eight as a quorum in order to cover any eventualities which might arise from time to time.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the quorum in this House being 20 Members.  However, that comparison was not fair because if we rang the division bells the number of people in the precincts of this House would be nearer two-third or three-quarters of full membership, some Members being away on official business or paired because of illness. The Minister will agree that every encouragement must be given to members to attend meetings of the governing body.  We disagree on the number constituting a quorum.  I consider ten to be a low number and would prefer a quorum of 12.  It is important that we bring moral as well as legislative pressures to bear on the institute.  Would the Minister consider a higher figure on Report Stage?</P>

      <P>This deals with the question of the engagement of consultants and advisers and the amendment is introduced after consultation with representatives from the institute.

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The First Schedule, as amended, relates to the functions and activities of the governing body.  We had a fairly good debate on this matter and a number of amendments, but I am not satisfied with the composition of the First Schedule.  I am not happy with the powers given to the Government and the Minister for Education concerning the removal from office of the chairman.  It is too open-ended and does not allow for the opinion of the governing body to be stated.  This is a weakness in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The matter of the appointment and removal of ordinary members of the governing body is also open to criticism. The method of appointment is barely acceptable to me and I would rather see outside interests having direct appointment powers <i>via</i> the Minister.  This was discussed on section 5.  The aspect of the Bill on which I now wish to comment relates to the removal of ordinary members from the governing body.  The Government may, on the recommendation of the Minister for Education, remove ordinary members from the governing body of the institute without any opinion being received from the governing body.  There is a very good case for giving the governing body some powers in respect of the removal from office of ordinary members of the council. The powers being given to the Minister and the Government are unnecessary and far too sweeping.  I remember discussing this matter in relation to the Bill dealing with the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>The period for which a member may hold office is not acceptable because it is not clear.  The Minister does not seem to be willing to look on this in the long-term context and does not appreciate the necessity to ensure that the article is clear.  At present it is not at all clear.  The matter of student representation is also open to criticism.  A two-year period is essential for any person who is a member of the governing body and a one-year period is far too short to allow for a constructive input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> The whole question of membership of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament has also been discussed.  I have stated quite clearly that a person should be entitled to stand for election for public office without having to resign his position as a member of the governing body of the NIHE.  We should encourage highly qualified people to stand for public office and it is extremely narrowminded of the Minister to suggest that a person should have to resign immediately he is nominated.  I would have called for a division on my amendment but for a minor drafting question. However, I will put this question to a division on Report Stage.  It is very important that we try to harness all the energy and brains in this country into public life in the Oireachtas and in the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to note that the chairman and ordinary members of the governing body will receive remuneration.  This is correct and proper.  It is very difficult to ask a person to incur financial loss because he is a member of a county council or a vocational educational committee.  He must attend meetings and give up his time, perhaps causing him loss of income. I am in favour of paying members of the governing body of the NIHE as well as members of county councils and vocational educational committees, if not by way of remuneration then certainly by way of expenses or a stipend of some kind.  We must give every encouragement to participation in public life and in this case ensure that membership of the governing body of the NIHE will be attractive.  We should ensure <Col N="934" /> that a person will not suffer financially because of his membership of the governing body.  I am in favour of this.  I am glad the Minister has included remuneration as well as the ordinary allowance for travelling.  That is the correct course.  However, I am sorry that the quorum is to remain so low.</P>
      <P>I am pleased there is provision for a mandatory declaration of interest although I am not too happy that it will be effective enough in that the powers are not specified in relation to penalties for the non-disclosure of interest.  I know that there are always the courts but I think failure to disclose one's interest should automatically result in the retirement of the person concerned from the governing body.  That should have been included in the Minister's amendment and in my amendment.  It is the least we could expect from a person who has failed to disclose his or her interest.</P>

The National Coalition ran from one university to another to try to give respectability to an institution that we considered very respectable in its own right and entitled to stand on its own feet without interference from any outside body.  We are giving the institute statutory authority.  The Deputy need have no fears with regard to the powers of the Government as incorporated in the Bill&mdash;they are not specific to this Government but will apply to Governments <Col N="935" /> in the next 100 years.

      <P>I have not finished my <Col N="936" /> reply.  The basic difference in approach relates to the granting of awards.  We consider that the comprehensive approach which would allow the institute to go to the NCEA or any of the universities for the granting of awards would be good from the point of view of education and would be of benefit to the institute. This Bill is attempting to strangle the institute because they cannot buy even a box of matches without seeking sanction from the Minister.  That is the kind of respect he has for third level institutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 80:</P>
      <P>In page 13, Article 4, lines 24 and 25, to delete &ldquo;, if present, shall preside at all meetings of the Academic Board and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 4 of the Second Schedule provides that the director shall preside at all meetings of the academic board.  My amendment seeks to delete that provision because it is unnecessary.  I consider the chairman of the academic board should be found among the membership of the academic council.  The director has no function in being chairman of the academic council.  That council is an important body.  It allows the academic staff to discuss matters, to make recommendations to the governing body and to make decisions in certain circumstances about the administration and running of the college.  It is an important body but <Col N="937" /> essentially it is a meeting of academics to discuss academic matters.  Therefore, it would be a natural development that the chairman of the academic council should be an academic.  It should not be the director, who is esentially an administrator. Certainly he should be at meetings, as he is allowed to be <i>ex officio</i>, and he should make his contribution but he should not be chairman.  For one reason or another, perhaps because of lack of finance, he might be biased in a decision to be made by the academic council.  For that reason and for reasons applicable to academics who love their freedom and jealously guard it, I feel that on an academic council a person to be chairman should be taken from the membership of the academic body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is interesting and would have relevance where there is a special breed of administrator. In the United States, for example, in third level institutions the administrators do not have the kind of input into the academic side of the life of the institution as would the president in our universities or institutions.  The provision in this Schedule is correct, taking into account the circumstances here.  I met an administrator in the US who did not know anything of the history or traditions or of the areas covered by the academic side of the university in which he worked, although he was an excellent administrator.  That dichotomy does not suit our circumstances seeing that it is a tradition here to appoint to directorships people who are<i>au fait</i> with the academic scene.  It is right that the director as chief officer should preside at the meetings when he is present.  It is not necessarily true that it should happen in the national institute when it is already in our universities, but it is a very good precedent, it has been effective and has been shown to be effective over the years.  It could be argued that, if the director was opting out to such an extent that he was going to meetings and not presiding or showing an interest in any area of the college's or institution's academic activity, he was neglecting his duty.  I feel strongly about this and I am in full support of the section <Col N="938" /> which Deputy Collins wants to amend.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.  Every Director shall be appointed in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to improve the Bill.  Article 5 states:</P>
      <P>Every Director, other than the first Director, shall be appointed, subject to the approval of the Minister, by the Governing Body.</P>
      <P>The director should be appointed in accordance with the provision of section 7, which already states:</P>
      <P>The Governing Body shall, with the approval of the Minister, from time to time appoint in a whole-time capacity a person to be the chief officer of the Institute and such officer is in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the Director&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important point of principle is involved in this.  If Deputy Collins's amendment were accepted the governing body would have to formally appoint the person who is at present employed as a director in the institute to the position of director.  This would be a new appointment.  Section 10 of the Bill covers certain aspects of continuity of service, credit for pension purposes and so on for the director and the existing staff and there would be a danger of his losing out.  The post of director was filled in 1969 prior to the establishment of a planning board or a governing body.  The man who holds that post is director of the <i>ad hoc</i> institute.  The form of my amendment will guarantee that he is still covered by section 10.  I am sure that Deputy Collins does not mean to deprive the director of the benefit of the protection of section 10 but there is a danger that his amendment would do that.  My amendment is to clarify the position with regard to the first director and to eliminate any doubt that after the commencement of the Act the first director of the institute might have a break in service. Very often, if there is a break in service, laws are so constructed, particularly in pension schemes, that it is difficult not to do an injustice to the individual concerned.  Two appointments would be involved and we do not want to get involved with regard to pensions, continuity of service and so on.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, shall, within three months of the commencement of each calendar year to which this Act has application, prepare and have presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, a report setting out the following in respect of each of the three previous calendar years&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Chair and to the Minister for the fact that I was engaged.  I was attending a party meeting and did not notice that the new business had come up.  In our amendment we are asking the Minister to give certain information about the impact of this Bill.  We want the Minister to let us know of cases that exist where farmers are paying very substantial rates relative to the incomes they receive.  There are a number of cases where farmers will be paying rates which will be about twice the amount of income tax they would have to pay if they were solely on an income tax code.  We have produced evidence that in the case of farmers with valuations in excess of £40 and £60 some of them will be paying in rates twice as much as a PAYE person with the same income would pay in tax.</P>
      <P>This is calculated on the basis that on average last year a farmer with a £40 valuation had an income of £4,000 and a farmer with £50 valuation had an income of £5,000.  This year that is a generous estimate of the income that would be derived on a farm of that size. Farmers with incomes between £4,000 and £5,000, valuations between £40 and £50, will be paying&mdash;if they are married with two children&mdash;about twice as much in rates as a result of this Bill as an equivalent person on PAYE would pay in income tax.  We regard this as unfair and something that should be brought to the notice of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the amendment we are seeking that the Minister would give a report to the House each year on the impact of this legislation.  We are looking for evidence of cases where farmers who because of insufficient income would not pay income tax but who as a result of this Bill <Col N="943" /> are liable to pay substantial rates.  We believe that this is unfair.</P>
    <P>We are urging in this amendment that that information referred to be brought before the House in the form of a report to be presented annually.  We are paticularly mindful of the fact that this week farmers received substantial rate demands.  Farmers this week are beginning to realise the full impact of this Bill because the rate demands being issued are based on provisions in it.  Farmers are now finding that they must face a substantial increase in their rates over and above the rates they paid last year. In some cases the rates are double what they were last year while in other cases they are treble and farmers must pay them at a time when their incomes are falling.  All independent assessments indicate that farmer incomes this year will be conservatively between 9 and 20 per cent down on last year.  In some cases they will be down by a considerably higher percentage.  Yet, those farmers will find that the rates they will have to pay, which are assessed regardless of their income, will be double and in some cases treble last year's demand.  Clearly that is unfair.</P>
    <P>We also want information about cases where the rate in the £ which farmers have to pay is increased in any given year by a larger proportion than agricultural incomes increased in that year.  That information is readily available to the Minister.  The presentation of an annual report in which the agricultural incomes and the agricultural rates are compared would clearly show that in certain cases in some years rates would increase less than the amount of agricultural incomes.  There is no harm in having that information presented to, the House.  In other cases&mdash;certainly this year&mdash;such a report would show that although agricultural rates are being increased substantially agricultural incomes are falling substantially.</P>
    <P>If that information was presented to the House in the form of an annual report we would be able to see exactly the effect this legislation is having.  That <Col N="944" /> is important.  We should understand what we are doing and the implications of legislation of this sort.  The implications should be constantly brought to our notice in the changing circumstances in which it is applied.  In many cases the impact of this legislation may not be foreseen now and, therefore, it is most important that a mechanism be set up whereby each year the implications of the legislation is brought to our notice. My amendment, which seeks an annual report on the implementation and effect of the legislation, will ensure that it is kept under constant review and constantly before public notice.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the amendment which is worthy of support is the provision whereby each local authority reported to the House as to the number of cases which exist within its area of responsibility where valuations of land are exceptionally high.  There are cases, as Deputy Fitzpatrick can testify, where valuations are extremely high in counties like Monaghan and Cavan.  Those valuations were drawn up on the basis of flax culture in the nineteenth century and gave the land at that time a relatively high value which it no longer has in the predominant cultures of the twentieth century.  Those high valuations still remain and rates are based on them.  We want a report annually on all counties where the average valuations in respect of areas within them exceeds £1 per acre. We want an indication of the extent of those areas in each county.</P>
    <P>That information would enable us to see, for the first time in any comprehensive report, the areas where valuations are unduly high and where as a consequence the rates which are being levied may well be equally unduly high.  The Minister has admitted that there are places to his knowledge in County Clare where the rates are unduly high&mdash;I believe he mentioned a figure as high as £2 per acre in parts of south Clare along the Shannon.  Such cases, which can be brought to the notice of the House in the course of a debate, should be surveyed comprehensively.  We should have information on all cases throughout the country <Col N="945" /> on a uniform objectively reported basis where in certain county council areas the rates are unduly high.  That information, if presented in an annual report such as we are seeking, would enable us to see at a glance cases where the rates by virtue of the valuation being unduly high are also likely to be unduly burdensome on a particular sector of the farming community and on a certain number of farmers.</P>
    <P>That information could be collected relatively easily, but the fact that it could be presented in one document annually will focus public attention on the inequities which exist in the rating system. It could bring about a situation where the Minister responsible will have an informed public opinion behind him when seeking to eliminate whatever injustices exist in the rating system.  The elimination of those injustices does not necessarily presuppose the revaluation of the entire country or the scrapping of the work done by Griffith of the last century. Indeed, it may be possible to concentrate on areas where rates are either excessively high or excessively low and to do some selective revaluation in order to eliminate difficulties which may exist in certain counties.  Such a report would disclose individual counties which have cases of particularly high valuations on given areas of land.</P>
    <P>Some precedure should exist for the elimination of injustices in the rating system.  It is not enough for any Minister to say that the rating system is unjust, that he admits that, but that it would be too big a job to change it and that more harm than good might be done if that was tried.  That is not an adequate response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair.  The report I have suggested would give us the type of information we need.  That is one of the merits of the amendment.  My main concern is with the first part of the amendment, to reveal clearly in public view on the basis of information which is available to the Minister the thousands of cases in which as a result of this Bill farmers who will not have any income this year on which they will be liable to pay income tax will still have to face a doubling or trebling of their rates.  That is going to happen.  The Minister knows that.  This amendment seeks to ensure that the Minister will have to come here and present a report each year and that he will admit at the end of this year that what we are now saying is true, that this is happening and that farmers who have an income on which they will be liable to pay tax will have a doubling or trebling of their rates this year, a year in which their income has fallen as against last year's level.</P>
      <P>It would be very salutary for the Minister and the House and for the people who believe and argue that the farmers are not paying their fair share that this information should be brought before the House so that people will see in black and white the many cases of farmers who will have a substantial increase this year in their rates at a time when their income has fallen and who in very many cases will have no income on which they will be liable to pay tax.  That sort of evidence should be brought before the House.  I believe this amendment will ensure that it is.  I regret that the Minister has not indicated that he is prepared to accept it.  We shall certainly do everything in our power to see that the amendment is accepted and that the information is brought to the knowledge of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the recent criticisms in a magazine (details supplied) that Irish official statistics are inadequate, he has any proposals to improve the operation of the Central Statistics Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office are experiencing continuing difficulty in improving the timeliness of certain series on short-term trends particularly those relating to earnings, employment and production in industry. This is due basically to the delays in the return of information in sufficient volume from the business community.</P>
      <P>Experiments of two kinds are under way within the CSO in an endeavour to improve the position.  The first involves the use of field staff to speed up response by personal calls on business firms.  The second aims where possible at producing overall estimates (without detailed sub-divisions) based on a minimum set of early returns.</P>
      <P>However, the time lag in the availability of these economic indicators will continue until all business firms can be persuaded to send back the basic information promptly.  There is a balance between timeliness and equality and even provisional figures must have a solid basis if they are to measure change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the article in the magazine referred to describes Ireland's official statistics as a national scandal and cites incidents of 177 Euro statistics where we have drawn a blank?  We have been unable to provide half of the statistics sought.  Does it not seem to the Minister <Col N="950" /> that there is a need to revitalise the Department or else return it from the Taoiseach's Department to where it originally was, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some shortcomings in the CSO but I am convinced that the people there are doing their best to update the whole thing and make great improvements.  They have already taken steps to improve matters. They are sending out field officers now to try to get those firms, who are not sending back their returns on time, to send them back quicker.  This may succeed in stepping up the returns.</P>

These discussions did not produce concrete proposals which could have been submitted for consideration to Roinn na Gaeltachta&mdash;the Department concerned.

      <P>The repatriation and resettlement of some 660,000 refugees and displaced persons undoubtedly presents the newly independent Zimbabwe with a quite considerable task, particularly with regard to the provision of food, until these people can become re-established and can achieve a certain measure of self-reliance in food production. This situation is, of course, not helped by the effects of war and two years of drought on agricultural output in Zimbabwe.  While, therefore, it is likely that serious food shortages will exist in the short term and international assistance will be required to overcome these, reports of widespread starvation in Zimbabwe have not been vertified.</P>
      <P>The new Government of Zimbabwe have requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to co-ordinate the repatriation and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons.  A programme of immediate relief is now under way, in conjunction with the local authorities.  The UNFAO World Food Programme has responsibility for evaluating food supply needs in the country.</P>
      <P>Response to the international appeal launched in April this year by the UNHCR has been extremely positive and a significant proportion of the identified needs in the immediate term have been met.  A Community contribution of some IR £5.4 million in the from of emergency financial aid is currently under consideration and a decision is expected in the near future.  250 tonnes of dried skimmed milk in the form of food aid is also proposed.  No decision has as yet been taken on our part on the nature and size of any bilateral assistance to Zimbabwe but this is under consideration at present, and I hope to make an announcement in the near future.</P>

That was an example of ensuring equality in a sensible manner.  There is no identifying of <Col N="963" /> closer political co-operation with membership of a military alliance.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has satisfied himself with the achievements to date of European political co-operation within the context of the nine member states; if he will outline the number of meetings that have taken place; and the number of staff of his Department directly involved in this connection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before describing the achievements of European political co-operation, I feel that it would be useful to say something about the way in which these activities among the nine are conducted. European political co-operation has a number of basic characteristics which differentiate it from the activities of the Community and determine the nature and scope of its content and indeed of its achievements.  As the Deputy is aware, political co-operation is a non-institutionalised intergovernmental arrangement.  It flows not from obligations assumed under a treaty but from a <Col N="970" /> political commitment by the nine member Governments to mutual information, consultation and, where possible and desirable, common action in foreign policy matters.  Secondly, because political co-operation is an effort on the part of the Nine Governments concerned to co-ordinate policies and work towards common positions, it operates pragmatically and by consensus.</P>
      <P>Another important feature of political co-operation which I should mention is that its field of application is external, in that it is concerned with the relations which the nine, as such, have collectively with the external world.  Finally, it is important to recognise that the means available to the nine in working towards common positions and common action are the normal instruments of diplomacy, that is to say, that their foreign policy activities are conducted by making their positions known through public declarations and representations to other Governments, as well as through concerted negotiation, common statements and co-ordination of voting positions in international bodies.</P>
      <P>One must bear these basic characteristics in mind in any attempt to outline the achievements of the nine in political co-operation.  And I believe these achievements are considerable.  In broad terms I would say that these achievements are of two kinds.  First, and most concretely, there is the fact that over recent years the nine have adopted common positions and taken common action in relation to numerous international issues where they were able to identify a clear community of interest.  As a result over a wide range of international problems they have been able to bring their considerable influence to bear in a manner consistent with the ideals and principles shared by the members of the Community in the promotion of peace, stability and equity in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second achievement, which is perhaps less obvious, is the fact that the nine, in operating the procedures of political co-operation on external issues, have by now developed between themselves the habit of consultation and co-ordination <Col N="971" /> to such an extent that it has become almost a reflex.  Consultation among the nine on international issues together with other important developments, such as the establishment of the European Council which deals with political co-operation as well as Community matters, has provided the nine with the capacity through political co-operation to respond to and influence world events through co-ordination, mutual solidarity and common action.</P>
    <P>From an Irish point of view I am satisfied that over the years political co-operation on the whole has achievements to its credit which are commendable and that political co-operation as currently organised is a means whereby the Community can respond and help to shape events in the world in a way which it would be virtually impossible for a small country acting on its own to do.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Deputy's question relates to the number of meetings and the number of staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs involved in political co-operation.  As to the number of meetings, the rhythm of these meetings varies in function of the need to respond to international events. However the figures for the period of the Irish Presidency will illustrate the scale and intensity of the activities involved. In any one year there are three meetings of the European Council.  One of these meetings, as the Deputy will recall, was held in Dublin during our Presidency. There are four meetings of Foreign Ministers each year.  Two of these were <Col N="972" /> held in Dublin.  In addition there are on average about 40 meetings at Official level.  In fact the precise figure for the Irish Presidency was 37 such meetings. In addition there are frequent colloquies conducted by the President-in-Office with the Political Affairs Group of the European Parliament.  The activities in the area of political co-operation are serviced by the Political Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs in addition to its other duties.  The number of diplomatic personnel directly involved in political co-operation is 22, together with 16 clerical and secretarial members of staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will indicate to President Carter the widespread disquiet felt in Ireland because of recent nuclear alerts caused by computer malfunctions; and if he will seek an explanation of the matter and assurances in regard to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern on this matter.  The attitude of the Government to nuclear weapons has been expressed on many occasions.  We believe that nuclear and thermo-nuclear armaments pose a grave threat to the future of mankind and we consider that so long as the nuclear powers maintain these weapons armed and ready to launch at each other there is a serious danger that war may break out accidentally or through miscalculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> The recent nuclear alerts referred to by the Deputy are an indication of how this could happen and they must obviously be a matter for grave concern. The US authorities point out that notwithstanding the computer malfunction which gave rise to these alerts other safeguard and checking systems operated effectively to halt the alert within minutes.  I believe that the US authorities are nevertheless concerned about what has happened and that they are taking such steps as they can to safeguard against a recurrence.  Accordingly I do not believe that I should seek an explanation or assurances as the Deputy has suggested.</P>
    <P>In our view however the only real way of reducing or eliminating the danger which nuclear weapons pose is to press ahead to nuclear disarmament.  The Government will continue to do everything open to it in this regard.  In particular, we hope to play an active part in urging such measures at the forthcoming conference in Geneva to review the operation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25, and 26 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has already been informed, a new establishment for the Naval Service has been authorised.  By 1982 the establishment will total about 1,250 all ranks as against 800 in 1978.</P>
      <P>Over the past year various measures have been adopted to improve both the basic pay and special allowances of Naval Service personnel and I am satisfied that within the resources available all reasonable efforts are being made to ensure that the pay and conditions of service of these and all other personnel of the Defence Forces are kept at an acceptable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of new vessels for the Naval Service is proceeding at an unprecedented rate.  These vessels have a very high standard of communications equipment and navigational aids.  The accommodation on the vessels is up to <Col N="986" /> the highest international maritime standards. Planning for two helicopter-bearing vessels is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the first of these will be delivered in 1982 and the second in 1983.</P>
    <P>As the information regarding improvements made to accommodation and facilities at the Naval Base is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Tenders will be invited soon for the construction of a new billet at the base to accommodate 70 other ranks personnel. This billet should be available by 1982.</P>
    <P>The accommodation and facilities at the base, which are now fully utilised, will be inadequate for the Naval Service as it expands.  With a view to facilitating the expansion of the Service, consideration is, as I indicated in reply to a question on 27 February 1980, being given to the provision of a roadway between Haulbowline and Spike Island and additional facilities on Spike Island.  A consulting engineer has been commissioned to carry out a study to determine the feasibility and cost of constructing a bridge, or a causeway, between the two locations.</P>
    <P>The final report on the study is expected to be available in the autumn.  If the report indicates that it would be feasible to build a bridge or a causeway, the question of building will then be considered in the light of the estimated cost and the resources available.</P>
    <P>An outline development plan has been prepared for the provision of accommodation for the Naval Service on Spike Island.  This plan incorporates existing buildings, many of which are in a reasonable state of repair, as well as new ones considered necessary to meet future requirements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures I have outlined will contribute towards the maintenance of a high level of morale among personnel of the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Following is the Statement: <Col N="987" /> Improvement of accommodation and facilities at Naval Base, Haulbowline Works carried out since 1 January 1970.</P>
    <P>1.  Renovation of and improvements to Canteen.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement on the European Council held in Venice on Thursday and Friday, 12 and 13 June 1980, which I attended with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The discussions at the Council covered economic and political co-operation subjects.  I have had the Presidency summary of the proceedings and certain other documentation laid before both Houses in the usual way.</P>
      <P>We discussed the general economic situation, energy, relations between the northern countries and those in the less developed part of the southern hemisphere, the Community's trade with Japan and the United States, international monetary questions and the recycling of petro-dollars.  There was a brief discussion of the Report of the Three Wise Men which is to be considered again by the Foreign Ministers in Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spent some time discussing the role of the next President of the Commission who is due to take up office in January 1981.  During his term, the incoming President will have to deal with the system of financing the Community, which, as Deputies will be aware, is likely to reach its limits by 1982, at the latest.  The prospect, which is of very real concern to Ireland, is, therefore, for a radical appraisal of the whole range of Community policies, expenditures and receipts, including the common agricultural policy and regional and social policies.  The incoming President will also have to deal with the enlargement of the Community and with many of the problems facing western society, including the impact of new technologies and relations with other countries and with the oil-producing States.  It is clear that the task of the incoming President will be formidable and his capacity to deal both with internal problems and with the role of the Community in a rapidly changing world will be of great <Col N="1011" /> significance for the future of Europe. The Council decided that the discussion should be regarded as a preliminary review of the question and that the Italian Presidency should consult further with the Heads of State or of Government with a view to securing an early decision.</P>
    <P>The aftermath of the settlement of the British budgetary problem was very much in evidence during our discussions. The House will be aware from documents laid before it by the Minister for Foreign Affairs earlier this month of the nature of the solution reached tentatively by the Council of Ministers at their meeting on 30 May and afterwards confirmed by governments.  In brief, their decision was to provide for a reduction in the net contribution of the United Kingdom to the Community by an average of about £866 million a year for 1980 and 1981, with a pledge by the Community to resolve the problem for 1982 by means of structural changes. The Irish contribution to the £866 million will be of the order of £8 million a year.</P>
    <P>This additional contribution by us must be looked at in the light of our overall position.  Recent Commission estimates show net receipts to Ireland from the budget as being of the order of £360 million in 1980.  Though we have a comparatively small population, we are the second highest net recipients from the budget and these receipts will increase in 1981 by a figure which is estimated to be up to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The settlement of the British problem enabled certain other difficulties to be dealt with.  These included clearing the increased farm prices for 1980, with an understanding on future years, the west of Ireland package involving an expenditure there from Community funds of about £150 million over the next ten years, progress with the development of common policies for fish and sheep, and a possible way forward towards larger regional and social funds.  The settlement could, in fact, result in the release to Ireland of Community finances <Col N="1012" /> amounting to an extra £75 million in 1980.  We had, therefore, a very immediate and direct interest in having the British budgetary problem solved quickly. The funds flowing to Ireland as a result of the settlement and the other benefits which could result are of an altogether different order of magnitude from the extra cost to us.</P>
    <P>We also had a much more fundamental interest in a solution which far outweighed any short-term financial benefit. The British problem and the intensity of feeling it evoked, at times seemed to call into question the very foundations of the Community.  The settlement means that the Community can go about its business once again in an orderly manner and grow and develop in a way that will promote the welfare of the people of Europe.</P>
    <P>The real pity is that the British problem generated an attitude which could be detrimental to the future development of the Community and which must be countered.  It has focused attention on the Community budget to an altogether disproportionate degree. The budget is, indeed, an instrument of Community policy but it is only one instrument and not by any means the most important.  It is often forgotten that it is, in total, less than 1 per cent of the gross national product of the member countries.</P>
    <P>The common agricultural policy which absorbs an important part of the budget is also one of the few policies which have developed a Community relevance.  The common agricultural policy is not just a policy for agriculture. It has a strategic importance in that it guarantees food for the people of Europe in these uncertain times.  It has an economic value in the extent to which it keeps families on the land, prevents rural depopulation and unwelcome and unnecessary additions to urban unemployment registers.  Furthermore, a thriving agriculture contributes considerably to general industrial and economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>The cost of the policy is perhaps 0.5 per cent of the gross national product of <Col N="1013" /> the member countries.  The cost&mdash;and the benefits&mdash;are not distributed in direct proportion to budgetary flows.  A fundamental principle of the CAP is the unity of the market&mdash;so that, in fact, benefits are related more to agricultural production in a particular country than to the size of budgetary transfers.  There is the further point that contributions to the budget often take the place of national expenditure on agriculture &mdash;they do not, in fact, represent a net extra burden to national Exchequers.</P>
    <P>I mention these qualifications because of the dangers which any review of Community policies confined simply to the budget must carry.  In fact, concentration on the budget to the extent that has been in evidence over the past year means that other aspects of the Community tend to be overlooked. Benefits or costs cannot be measured simply in budgetary terms and to imply that they can is totally to misconceive the nature and the working of the Community.</P>
    <P>The industry of the member states, and of some of the stronger economies in particular has flourished in the Common Market behind a common tariff. The benefits of this to the countries concerned, which are immense, are not measured in any budget figures.  Neither can the budget measure the benefits to a particular country from the encouragement of industrial investment and modernisation through the application of common laws, common standards and common procedures in a single market of 260 million people.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the Community gives the countries of Europe a standing in the world which they would not otherwise have.  The Community, acting and speaking as such, has far greater economic and political status than any loose combination of member states.</P>
    <P>Following on the discussion of the future of the Community after the British settlement, we looked at the economic prospects facing Europe.  The tone of this discussion was sombre.  We considered, in particular, the general impact of oil price increases.  While these <Col N="1014" /> increases are affecting standards in the developed countries, they are damaging the less developed countries to a devastating extent and they are also impeding the ability of the industrialised world to help the less well off regions. The price increases cannot, in the view of the Council, be justified by any objective consideration and their repetition constitutes an obvious threat to international stability.</P>
    <P>Changes in energy policy over time will lessen dependence on depleting resources.  In the shorter term, however, it was agreed that a constructive dialogue with the oil producers was called for and should be sought.  At the meeting, I stressed, in particular, the need to develop institutions and mechanisms at Community level so as to enhance our ability to recycle the finance flowing in such volume to the oil producers.</P>
    <P>The Commission's assessment of other aspects of the European economy was equally disturbing.  The momentum of inflation is now of the same order of magnitude as in 1974-75 when, as Deputies will recall, the rate here rose to over 24 per cent in a year.  Unemployment in the Community is forecast to reach 6 per cent on average in 1980, with a strong increase likely in 1981. There are great problems for young people entering into the larour force.  Low growth, higher inflation, large budgetary deficits, interest rates often at a crippling level, and general uncertainty are all combining to create an extremely difficult outlook.  The Commission see the restoration of better financial balance in certain countries as a priority for these countries.  Against this background, the Commission say that there is no alternative to maintaining broadly restrictive budgetary and monetary policies.  It proposes no common programme of action on unemployment.  These assessments are very relevant for us in Ireland, depending, as we do to such an extent on the level of world trade, in general, on European trade, in particular.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that growth in the largest market for our goods this <Col N="1015" /> year&mdash;the United Kingdom&mdash;is forecast to be negative and we will be selling there in a contracting market.  Furthermore, economic growth in Europe as a whole is estimated to be of the order of 1½ per cent in 1980.</P>
    <P>Our economic prospects at present are overwhelmingly influenced by the price of oil.  Last year about one-sixth of all the goods we exported went to pay for oil.  This year the proportion will probably be higher.  It is vital that everyone should clearly understand that increases in the price of oil mean a real transfer of resources away from Ireland; and that this transfer cannot be corrected by increases in money incomes here. Our European partners have accepted this reality and have acted upon it.  They have settled their economic and incomes policies accordingly in their efforts to defeat inflation.</P>
    <P>When some of the countries with the strongest economies in the world are trimming their sails in this way, it would indeed be foolish, if not dangerous, for us to try to act differently.  Our partners believe that inflation must be tackled as a first priority because unless it is, it will sap the strength of their economies and make the achievement of growth and lasting employment impossible.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a sound economy.  Our population is, perhaps, the youngest in Europe.  The potential of our agriculture and of the new industries which are coming here is great.  But we will realise that potential only if our economic policies are right and all those concerned in the key areas accept the reality of what is happening in the world, the intolerable burden which energy costs and inflation are imposing, and what this must mean for us.</P>
    <P>As Deputies might expect, the tone of our discussion on international affairs, in the context of European political co-operation, was no less sombre than that of our exchanges on economic matters. We met at a critical point in world affairs against a background of continuing violation of basic international principles and of continuing threats to peace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> The declaration on the Middle East which, as a statement of a common European position, breaks new ground, has attracted the greatest attention.  This reflects the recognition that growing tensions in that region constitute a serious danger to world peace and that it had not been possible by the date originally foreseen to make worthwhile progress towards agreement on the outstanding matters arising from the Camp David agreements.  We are of course, anxious not to prejudice whatever prospects remain for progress and this has been recognised in the reception given to our declaration by the United States Secretary of State.</P>
    <P>The declaration is carefully balanced. It recognises the need for the Palestinian people to exercise fully their right to self-determination. It recognises as well the need for guarantees of security for Israel. It also stresses that only the renunciation of force can create a climate of confidence and that such renunciation is a basic element for a comprehensive settlement.</P>
    <P>I have necessarily omitted some elements in the declaration which I commend to Deputies.  It concludes by indicating the Community's decision to make the necessary contacts with all the parties concerned.  The objective would be to determine in the light of the results of this consultation the form which a Nine initiative could take.</P>
    <P>The declaration on the situation in the Lebanon is satisfactory from an Irish viewpoint.</P>
    <P>We expressed our deep concern over the situation in Afghanistan and we agreed that it was now advisable to hold a meeting at political level of the two sides in the Euro-Arab dialogue.  In relation to Southern Africa, we noted the positive developments in Zimbabwe and expressed support for the efforts to secure implementation of the Security Council Resolution on Namibia.</P>
    <P>When in Venice I had the opportunity of a separate meeting, for about half an hour, with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, during which we discussed a number of subjects of common interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> The Venice meeting was valuable in that it provided the leaders of the Community with an opportunity to have a detailed review of the international scene and an exchange of views on the many serious issues facing us.  It also enabled the Community to co-ordinate its position for the forthcoming Economic Summit to be held in Venice on 22 and 23 June.</P>
    <P>I would like, in conclusion, to put on record, my appreciation of the quality of the facilities, with which we were provided by the Italian Presidency in the incomparable surroundings of Venice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer first to the declaration on the Middle East which was in many ways the essential feature of the meeting at which no significant decisions of an economic nature affecting the Community were taken.  This declaration treads a narrow path for the Community by the desire on the one hand to make a contribution to resolving the problem in view of the growing dangers of a situation in which tensions are rising rapidly and on the other hand the concern of the US to retain the initiative and be seen to do so, especially in an election year.  The declaration emanating from the European Council was probably the best that could be expected in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 4 the declaration states the classic position of the Community stressing on the one hand the right to existence in security of all the states in the region including Israel and on the other hand the need for justice for all the peoples which requires the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Paragraph 5 refers to guarantees in terms which may raise some cynical doubts in the light of what guarantees were seen to mean in the case of Cyprus and in the light of what is happening to the UN position in the Lebanon.  The significance of the brackets which surround the word &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; in the closing line of the paragraph is not clear.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nine declare that they are prepared to participate within the <Col N="1018" /> framework of a comprehensive settlement in a system of concrete and binding international guarantees, including (guarantees) on the ground.</P>
    <P>Those brackets are very esoteric indeed and I cannot imagine their significance.</P>
    <P>We have to face the reality of Israeli concern, in view of the nature of the legal borders of Israel, which at one point narrow that country to no more than nine miles in width, and the long history of conflict with its neighbours.  These things require the certainty that any solution arrived at will not endanger the security of Israel.  Unfortunately, a possible part solution to this problem which could involve Israeli strong points being leased from the sovereign power, whoever that power might be in the areas beyond Israeli's legal frontiers, for a period of a decade or two, has been seriously prejudiced by the Israeli settlement policy in these areas which has weakened the possibility of longer term Arab acceptance of such a solution which some at least in Israel have advocated. I had the opportunity to discuss this with the Israeli Government when on a visit there some years ago.  The failure to persuade Israel to abandon this settlement policy, so dangerous for its long-term interests, is a serious matter and I agree with what is said in paragraph 9 on this point.</P>
    <P>I also agree with paragraph 8 concerning Jesusalem.  Neither Christians nor Arabs can accept the unilateral solution based on conquest and occupation.  We are no longer in the time of the crusades and any solution to the Jerusalem problem must be acceptable to the people of all three great religions to whom Jerusalem is a sacred city.  Paragraph 11 deals with a renunciation of the use of force.  It is very relevant at a time when the PLO are moving back to a hard line position from which <i>de facto</i>, if not in their formal statements, they had previously been moving away under the leadership of President Arafat.  This backward movement by the PLO is to be regretted and deplored and whatever justification the PLO may feel they have on the Israeli settlement policy, they must face the fact that the way they have <Col N="1019" /> moved on this issue can only make a solution more difficult and can only weaken the support which has been growing for securing their rights to the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 deals with the right to self-determination, a concept which has emerged at Community level relatively recently in supplementation of the more traditional expression of the Community's position with regard to the problem in the Middle East, Israel and Palestine.  Irish people must support this concept of self-determination so much in line with our traditions.  It would certainly be difficult for us to accept the idea that the future of the Palestinian people in a state within the occupied territories should be determined not by ourselves but by Israel which asserts the right to determine.</P>
    <P>The Palestinians may have a role within a federation with Jordan but not in their own right in that part of Palestine left to them after the wars of the forties.  It is not even a sensible policy.  The Palestinians in a federation with Jordan are as likely to take over Jordan eventually and find themselves in control of a much larger area as they are to be kept under control by the Jordanians. Having discussed this particular matter with the Israeli Government a few years ago I found their answers unconvincing on this issue of insisting the Palestinians must not have a state of their own but only operate within some framework such as a federation with Jordan.</P>
    <P>I regret that, for reasons which still remain obscure and will do so until the relevant papers in the Department of Foreign Affairs are published, the Minister for Foreign Affairs moved so far ahead of the position of the Nine in Bahrain with his recognition of the PLO, unqualified by reference to the unacceptability of the claims in the PLO charter and without any public assurance of full recognition of our State and rejection by the PLO, on behalf of itself and all associated bodies, of aid to terrorists who seek to overturn our State and murder <Col N="1020" /> our fellow citizens in the North.  It is my policy, as the record adverted to by the Minister in this House at Question Time some weeks ago shows, to press for these assurances as an integral part of any process of recognition of the role of the PLO.  I regret that this Government have abandoned the diplomatic approach, important to our interests, which I believe could have yielded results, and have also expressed support for a recognition unqualified by any reference to the unacceptability of the claims in the PLO charter.</P>
    <P>As regards Afghanistan, to which the Taoiseach referred, there is understandable disagreement about the policy in relation to the boycott of the Olympic Games.  It is inevitable that this should be a cause of disagreement.  When we in our party took up our position in January&mdash;and the Government very belatedly followed, after apparently months of agonising consideration, in May&mdash;we knew in taking up this position, and I am sure the Government were also aware of it that it would be an unpopular decision with many people. Sport is something which for most people is nearer to them than the problems of a country so far away.  However, we were justified in the position we took up. We had no other weapon to hand with which to put pressure on the Soviet Union. We do not have credits that we could cut off, or a technological contribution to make which we could cease to provide.  The only weapon Ireland had to help the Afghanistan people and to try to put some pressure on to prevent the massacre of that people by the Soviet Union, the shooting down of schoolchildren in the streets and so on, was the Olympic boycott.  Had the boycott been more successful and secured more support in other countries following the lead which we among others gave, it could have had&mdash;it may still have, although it is more doubtful now&mdash;a significant impact on Soviet policy through its impact on Soviet public opinion to which the Soviet Government are eventually sensitive. The problem that has always existed is for us to get through to Soviet public <Col N="1021" /> opinion and the Olympic Games provided a unique occasion for that.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised, and the Government should emphasise as I have done in speaking on this issue, that on this matter there is no question of following the lead of the United States blindly as some propagandists have alleged. That seems to be widely believed in this country.  It could be argued, and the case is a strong one, that our Government and the EEC as a whole, have done this in the case of Iran.  That is a matter we will be debating briefly in this House next week.  In the case of Afghanistan those who argue to this effect are ignoring the fact that of the 40 countries which in January last were committed to this boycott 35 of them were non-aligned countries, mostly Moslem countries, and only four or five were members of NATO.  To put this down to the United States and say we are following their lead in regard to Afghanistan is to ignore completely the reality of world opinion, the support of 104 countries of the United Nations and the support given by many Moslem countries and other non-aligned countries to the boycott and the efforts being made by Islamic countries to try to pressurise the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>We as a small country have a duty to another small country to do what we can to help.  It is obviously a matter on which there will be legitimate disagreement and it is a matter for the athletes to decide whether they will go.  It should be seen by both sides that it is a matter of legitimate disagreement and it does not help to have propaganda arguments which are fallacious and ignore the extent and scale of the support among non-aligned countries on this issue with whom we are identifying, as some of these critics often ask we should do on other issues.</P>
    <P>In the Taoiseach's speech there is no reference to the part of the communique which deals with North-South issues. The numbering of the pages is peculiar because of the odd way in which these communiques are put together. However, paragraph 6 deals with North-South <Col N="1022" /> dialogue.  They do not say very much and perhaps that is why the Taoiseach did not concern himself with them.  It states:</P>
    <P>It is intended that a further boost should be given to co-operation with the developing countries.  This should contribute, on the basis of interdependence and mutual advantage, to creating the degree of economic expansion required, in the context of a restructuring of international economic relations, to enable the developing countries to make rapid progress.</P>
    <P>There is no hint as to how this boost is to be given, nor am I aware of any commitment to increase development aid.  Admittedly not all countries involved are doing what we are doing in abandoning our commitment to these countries and cutting development aid brutally as we have done this year, effectively disrupting our bilateral aid programme. Few countries have been as mean and brutal in their onslaught on aid to these countries as we have been under this Government this year despite the commitments entered into by the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs in opposition and which he continued to refer to in Government.  Nonetheless, the other member countries do not seem to have committed themselves to any increase in assistance to these countries which could be regarded as a further boost or have the effect stated in the communique.  This has an air of window-dressing more than anything else.  The same must be said of the reference to the Brandt Commission. It states that the report of the Brandt Commission could make a particularly interesting contribution to the successful outcome of the eleventh special session of the United Nations General Assembly.  It is hard to be more non-commital than that even in a bland communique from the Council.</P>
    <P>What the communique and the Taoiseach have said about world economic prospects must concern us. The use of words like &ldquo;sombre&rdquo; and &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo; must be a matter of concern. There are in the communique all <Col N="1023" /> the usual platitudes which no communique from this august body is ever without.  At one point the keenest concern is expressed at the hardening inflationary pressures and there is talk of doing something by means of &ldquo;appropriate monetary and fiscal policies&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; is not confined to this House where we had it several times yesterday in different contexts; it seems to creep in in other places too. Stress was laid on the importance of action to ensure that the risk of a general recession in demand is averted, although from what the Taoiseach said in his speech he has no confidence in that meaning anything or that there is any prospect of anything active being done. There was re-affirmation of the priority need in some of the member states for short-term structural measures in the context of an active employment policy to help young people in employment.  We know that that means nothing.</P>
    <P>The hope was expressed that all the industrialised countries would do their utmost to confront and resolve the outstanding trade problems.  It always puzzled me as a participant at these meetings, and it still puzzles me, as to what those who draft these documents think can be achieved by them and the failure to appreciate that the continuous repetition of platitudes simply undermines confidence in those who assume their authorship when they adopt them without any discussion at the end of these meetings.  It is odd that that lesson has never been learned.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we are so badly placed after the last three years of Fianna Fáil government to face the strains which, as the Taoiseach made clear, will be imposed upon us by the deteriorating world economic situation.  We are entering this period with a growth which is now estimated to be less than half that of the rest of the Community in the current year as against being almost three times that of the rest of the Community when we left office.  There is no common programme of action in the Community on unemployment.  Indeed, the whole <Col N="1024" /> situation with regard to unemployment is a terrifying prospect for us and, above all, for school leavers in the current year with unemployment rising now at an accelerating rate reaching 4,200 in the single month of May.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to Ireland as having a sound economy and said that the potential of our agriculture and of the new industries coming here was great.  He said we will realise that potential only if our economic policies are right.  That is certainly true but I do not think it is for a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, either the present holder of the office or his predecessor, to say that considering how wrong their economic policies have been and how damaging to our prospects in the face of the oncoming world recession those policies have been. I agree with the points made by the Taoiseach in relation to the Community budget.  He referred to the agricultural budget as being different in character from the rest and being in large measure a substitute for national budgets.  So the propaganda about its scale in relation to the rest of the Community budget, and about its distribution between different countries, is, in some cases, unrelated to GNP per head although not in our case because we are the main beneficiary and also the poorest member state.  I agree with what the Taoiseach said on those points but it is a pity that he did not succeed in convincing his colleagues of this. I accept that that is not an easy task.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a very real problem facing us now in this area because of the gradual disappearance, it would seem, of what had hitherto been a clear consensus among all member states, other than Britain, on the maintenance of the <i>acquis communitaire,</i> what has been achieved already in the Community.  We must insist upon this and I urge the Taoiseach that, in relation to the choice of the new president of the Commission, we should be above all concerned to ensure that no candidate is accepted by us or becomes president who is not committed to the maintenance of what has been achieved within the Community <Col N="1025" /> and to the existing policy structure. Regardless of what support any candidate may have from the larger countries, we should insist on that.  There are none of those countries now on whom we can rely in relation to our interest in the Community.  In the past a coincidence of interest or of ideals has ensured the support of France and Germany for positions involving the maintenance of existing Community policies upon the basis of which we entered the Community.  There have been disturbing signs recently of a shift in France away from insistence on the preservation of the CAP and the <i>acquis communitaire</i> in general towards the idea of a <i>juste retour</i>, of France getting back what it puts in.  If France is going to abandon its traditional policy then we shall have to fight very hard to maintain it.  There have also been some signs of a shift in Germany, perhaps in relation to the German elections.  We shall have to wait to see.  It may not be as serious as it looks but we must be on the alert in relation to this.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the past Chancellor Schmidt on several occasions moved to make changes in relation to the common agricultural policy but when it came to the point he failed to do so either because internal political considerations in Germany prevented this or because his ingenious Minister for Agriculture has, as occurred on more than one occasion, successfully sabotaged his efforts. We cannot necessarily rely on that continuing and after a German election the pressure group represented by German farmers, relatively inefficient by our standards, which led originally to the Germans insisting on a high price policy in the Community and has led them to continue to seek to maintain that, may be less potent than it is at other times.  In those circumstances we must use every weapon to hand to maintain the present policy structure in the Community.  We have one potent weapon at present, our agreement to a new president.  Our vital national interests are now at state as they are not often at stake in the Community. We can exaggerate the number of times when the national interest is at <Col N="1026" /> stake.  At times other countries&mdash;we generally avoided this&mdash;have used the argument about the national interest in relation to matters that are of relatively minor importance.  However, what looms ahead of us is of vital national interest to us and we should be prepared, therefore, to use the veto power we have in regard to a new president unless we are satisfied that he is committed to Community policies.</P>
    <P>That should be the aim of our policy on this matter of the presidency and, with respect, it is much too important for us for an extension of the public relations exercise the Taoiseach is giving all his time to in the domestic forum to be allowed take precedence over it.  I should now like to refer to the contribution to the British Exchequer which we are being asked to provide.  We had been given assurances that whatever solution was reached we would not have to pay. Indeed, that was being reasonable.  There is something totally lacking in reason, or logic or common sense when this country, the poorest in the Community, with an external payments deficit twice as large in relation to our GNP as any other member country, should be asked to pay sums of money for the benefit of our neighbour.  While there has been a relative decline in the British economy over the years and while our growth has been much faster than that of Britain we are still a good distance behind that country.  A decade or so will elapse before our prosperity will be such that we could reasonably be asked to contribute to help Britain.  The proposal that we should do so is one which we had assurances would not be put to us.  It has now been put to us and we on this side of the House find that unacceptable.  We are not in a position to contest it but it should not have been agreed to.  There must have been great weakness in arguments on our part to allow ourselves to be argued into a position, with a GNP per head 25 per cent or so lower than that of Britain in real terms and with a balance of payments deficit which is the highest in the Community, to have to contribute to a country which is that much better off than us and which, in <Col N="1027" /> fact, has a balance of payments surplus because of its oil.  What kind of negotiation on our part could lead to our being landed with that commitment is difficult to conceive and certainly nothing in my negotiating experience in the Community enables me to envisage what kind of mess of negotiation it would be necessary to make in order to arrive at that conclusion.  Even recognising the Taoiseach's legitimate concern to maintain good relations with the UK at present, what has been agreed goes too far.</P>
    <P>Moreover, looking at it in a broader context in terms of the burden it imposes on the Community as a whole, insufficient account has been taken by our Government, and other Governments, of the effect of this commitment to the British Exchequer on hastening the time at which the critical point will be reached when the 1 per cent VAT will be inadequate to provide for the financing of the Community.  When one watches the decisions being taken and the manner in which they are taken with something less than a full sense of responsibility by the member countries and their governments, one cannot but feel that we are on a very slippery slope indeed.  We are speeding up the process by which we will reach a stage where the 1 per cent limit is reached and there is not the slightest indication that there is a willingness to agree on the part of any Government &mdash;apart from our own, I hope&mdash;that the 1 per cent figure should be modified. It would require unanimous agreement to achieve that and, yet, we are moving to a point where we are now perhaps within 18 months of that limit being reached.  The existing policies of the Community may become inoperable by virtue of there being no way of financing them and no prospect of securing that because there is no unanimity on the point.</P>
    <P>It remains important for us to pose this issue and insist that it be answered before we enter into commitments that will hasten a situation so much to our disadvantage.  There is here once again a weakness in regard to what is the vital <Col N="1028" /> national interest of the country which is disturbing and which has been a feature of the negotiating pattern of the Government since taking office but, to an increasing degree, in recent times.</P>
    <P>Finally there is another point or query I want to put although I recognise there may be a problem about the Taoiseach replying to it but I raised it the other day and I did not get&mdash;this will be no surprise to the Taoiseach&mdash;any very clear or convincing answer from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Taoiseach has known the Minister for Foreign Affairs as long as I have and he will not be surprised at that.  The council declaration on the common fisheries policy dated 30 May arising from the Foreign Affairs Council meeting which preceded the European Council has the following statement in paragraph 1:</P>
    <P>The Council agrees that the completion of the common fisheries policy is a concomitant part in the solution of the problems with which the Community is confronted at present.  To this end the Council undertakes to adopt, in parallel with the application of the decisions which will be taken in other areas, the decisions necessary to ensure that a common overall fisheries policy is put into effect at the latest on 1 January 1981.</P>
    <P>That policy contains features which to us would be important such as fair distribution of catches having regard most particularly to traditional fishing activities, to the special needs of regions where the local populations are particularly dependent on fishing and certain other matters.  This is a very far cry from the coastal band which the Taoiseach personally and his colleagues in Opposition told us was to be had for the asking and which we did not have for the asking but which we were on the verge of securing by negotiation, as I briefed the Minister for Foreign Affairs when the Government was on the point of handing over prior to the new Government.  What we have here is very weak compared with that but it is all we have got.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> What I would like to be clear on and what the Minister could not answer satisfactorily is the meaning of these phrases, &ldquo;concomitant part in the solution of the problems with which the Community is confronted....&rdquo; and adopting &ldquo;in parallel with the application of the decisions which will be taken in other areas, the decisions necessary to ensure that a common overall fisheries policy....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does this mean, as from its wording it would appear to mean and as it has been interpreted recently in the press, that what has been agreed in regard to the British contribution is dependent and conditional upon agreement being reached on the common fisheries policy and that unless Britain is willing to withdraw its veto in this area the agreement about the British contribution will come into question?  It has been suggested in the press that that is the position of other Governments.  I should like to know if it is the position of our Government or are we on this also so weak-kneed that we are unwilling to stand up for our interests?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Taoiseach for his statement on the Venice Summit meeting but I must also reiterate my view that the European Council has lost much of its meaning. One of the most important issues before it in recent times was the British budgetary crisis, and it was not capable of solving that on its own and that issue went back to the meeting of Foreign Ministers who solved it at an ordinary meeting held either in Brussels or Luxembourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look a little closer at the main issues dealt with by this Summit. These were the economic situation, the presidency of the Commission and the Middle East crisis.  I do not think it required the summoning of a solemn meeting of prime ministers to define the present economic crisis but what would have been worthwhile would have been some indication that they had something useful to say about solutions.  As the recent communique of the OECD Council <Col N="1030" /> of Ministers commented, the economic situation remains bad: &ldquo;Unemployment has remained unacceptably high; inflation has remained deeply entrenched in many countries, and progress towards better balanced and less inflationary growth has been interrupted by a rise in world oil prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The economic circumstances with which we are confronted are of a very serious nature.  In particular the prospects for employment creation and a reduction of the general levels of redundancy and unemployment are bleak indeed and the latest survey of the business climate within the Community showed a marked weakening and a widespread pessimism.  That flood of pessimism extends particularly to the Irish economy. We have had reports from the ESRI and the Central Bank: &ldquo;Inflation of 20 per cent, unemployment rising to perhaps 100,000 by the end of the year, continuing credit curbs, a tough deflationary budget again next year.&rdquo;  That is what the ESRI have to say and it reflects the overall view of the European economic scene.</P>
    <P>In the face of such economic forecasts some positive policy proposals might have been anticipated from the Summit. Yet, all we have to show for yet another meeting of the Summit is a mass of documentation which will perhaps protect employment only in the Scandinavian paper mills and the printing industry. The other issue, the question of choosing a president for the new Commission again proved to be too much for the members attending the Summit.  All that the events of last week brought about is a new definition of our Minister for Finance; he is now very definitely a lame duck Minister for Finance.  He is sitting around waiting on the call to Brussels.  God knows if any member country of the Nine needed a Minister for Finance who would concentrate on the economic problems facing him, ours does.  Possibly our needs to concentrate a little more than most.</P>
    <P>Failure to choose the new president is quite a serious failure.  Consideration of a few of the major issues with which the <Col N="1031" /> new Commission must get to grips underlines the need for a strong president. There are a number of controversial issues, the question of enlargement and all of its political, economic, social and institutional implications.  There is need to deal positively with the findings of the two recent expert reports on the future running of the Community and of course the energy crisis and the whole question of North-South relationship which has been so graphically put into perspective by the Brandt commission.  There are only a few of the political challenges with which the new president must be capable of dealing in a sustained way.</P>
    <P>The Community initiative on the Middle East has already run into trouble and there has been a quite predictable reaction from all sides.  I believe the whole issue has been very badly handled and that its basic motivation is questionable. Here again we are faced with the outcome of the secret deliberations of socalled political co-operation.  What goes on at this level of the Community's working is not brought out into the open for proper debate in the democratic forums of our member states.  We are fully entitled to speculate on the motivation of the latest initiative.  Status, opportunism or oil could all underlie such a move just as much as any more worthy motive.  We do not and cannot know what decisions are made in secret and what we do not and cannot know is hardly likely to unite us.</P>
    <P>Were there to be any real hope of success for a Community initiative in the Middle East a number of clear principles must be seen to be honoured.  First, Israel's right to exist freely, peacefully and within secure borders must be recognised.  Second, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to a state must be given equal recognition.  Third, the Sadat initiative must be given every chance to move on to a further stage in the search for peace. There can be no settlement without an end to the cycle of violence, an end to PLO guerilla action and Israel's policy of counter-terror must also be brought to <Col N="1032" /> an end.  I believe there must also be an end to Israeli provocation such as the extension of settlements and the arbitrary arrest and deprivation of Arab community leaders.</P>
    <P>Both sides must give practical evidence of the desire of each for peace. Negotiations depend on the removal of existing obstacles of a permanent kind. Israel must accept the Palestinians' right to self-determination and must end the pretence that the Palestinians do not exist. The PLO and all the Palestinian militants must accept Israel's right to exist. The recent Fatah congress gave absolutely no reason to hope nor does Mr. Begin's continuing intransigence and insensitivity. I believe there should be no question of recognising the PLO unless they renounce those articles of their charter which call for the total destruction of Israel.  In the absence of such a change I believe there will be no negotiations and there will be no peace. Ireland's attitude and her ill-judged action in Bahrain has made absolutely no contribution whatsoever towards a solution and simply calls into question the maturity an the capacity of the Government in dealing in that whole area.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the recent summit gives much scope for discussion within the House unless one wants to concentrate on a series of failures.  There are one or two issues I would like to comment briefly on.  The first is the question of the settling of the difficulties of the UK in regard to their budgetary problems.  The Taoiseach was asked in the House after the Dublin summit whether or not this country would be asked to contribute in monetary terms towards a solution of the UK's budgetary problems.  He gave a categoric commitment to the House that there would be no agreement arrived at as far as a solution of the UK's problems at our expense was concerned.  That positive statement in the House by the Taoiseach has not been honoured.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his statement today puts it into the context of our net receipts from the EEC.  We are talking in terms of £16 million over the two years, according to the Minister for Finance <Col N="1033" /> yesterday.  The point is that a change has taken place from a very clear position which the Taoiseach assured the House was the Government's position.  The only thing I can say about this is that it is consistent with the Government's policy. The Government's policy domestically has been the same where they have consistently transferred resources within our national community from the less well off to the better well off.  That philosophy has been extended to the international field by the Taoiseach at the meeting of the heads of state.  I would accept the desirability of good relations and co-operation up to a point between the Prime Minister of the UK and ourselves. But we come to political co-operation and unilateral discussions, which the Taoiseach had with the British Prime Minister, I am inclined to think that £16 million is an expensive <i>tête-á-tête</i> and I do not think we should have agreed to it.</P>
    <P>There is very widespread concern among a lot of people&mdash;most Deputies in the House have received letters about this&mdash;regarding our commitment to alleviating distress, poverty and famine in the Third World.  The cut-backs in this area of aid to the Third World by the Government have stirred the conscience of many Irishmen and women.  This probably will not be a very popular thing to say.  I notice that members of the hierarchy have taken out newspaper space to carry on a campaign to encourage people to put pressure on political parties, political leaders and on the Government in particular, to live up at least to the undertaking we have given to the Third World.  I agree with that and I consider it is a shameful thing that we have not contributed.  It strikes me very forcibly that there does not seem to be among the same people the same commitment in or awareness of poverty and want within our society.  They should, without diminishing in any way our activities and concern for the Third World, which I support fully, also show a little more concern for and be a little more active regarding the 20 to 24 per cent of our people who are living in poverty and put a little pressure on in regard to those people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> The question of Afghanistan was mentioned in the Taoiseach's statement and it has also been mentioned by the leader of the Fine Gael Party in his address and also the question of support or non-support for the boycotting of the Olympic Games.  My party have been consistent in their approach.  We condemned unequivocably, without reservation, the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union.  There seems to be some confusion with regard to the 104 votes of the United Nations on the question of Afghanistan.  They were in total compliance with the Labour Party's point of view, the condemnation of the invasion of Afghanistan.  But nowhere am I aware was the question of the boycott of the Olympic Games included in any resolution which gained the support of the 104 nations which condemned the invasion of Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>First of all, my party do not believe that it is effective in achieving its objective&mdash;the withdrawal by the Soviet Union from the invasion of Afghanistan. Secondly, there is a high degree of hypocrisy in this whole area.  Our Government made noises, publicly and otherwise, in January and February giving a clear indication that, irrespective of what their political view might be, they would not confuse politics and sport in this particular area.  I recollect the Minister of State at the Department of Education going on a television programme with a Member of the other House and chastising him for bringing sport into the area of politics.  I do not want to do him an injustice but I think I can nearly quote him verbatim as saying that this was not the Soviet Union, that we did not impose those things on our sportsmen and that we did not confuse sport with politics.  The Labour Party are not prepared to confuse sport with politics and we are prepared to stay consistent on that line.</P>
    <P>I have one other comment.  I must talk about people giving in to pressures from the US administration.  I have no doubt that this Government changed their mind in relation to our participation in the Olympic Games because of pressure <Col N="1035" /> from the US.  In fairness to the US, they made no secret of the pressures they were putting not only on us but on every other country where they thought they could apply pressure.  They made the proper assessment as far as this Government were concerned and the Government yielded to the pressure.  That yielding was not in the best interests of anyone, least of all the people in Iran who are being held there as hostages, an action which any civilised person or nation must condemn.  However, this will not help and I do not think that it will help in the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>Again I thank the Taoiseach for his statement on the Summit.  I will finish by urging upon him that he and the other Heads of State should have a close look not at the usefulness of these meetings but at the potential damage that these repeated failures at that level are doing to the whole Community.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1980: Fifth Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are extremely disappointed in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill. We believe that the Bill is inherently misnamed. The effective content of this Bill is a restriction on reliefs that have existed for members of the farming community since 1898, if my researches are correct.  Farmers who are now being deprived of reliefs by this Bill were receiving those reliefs, and almost a century of this has existed.  Now the Government are coming along in a year, one could argue, of unparalleled gloom in the agricultural industry and removing reliefs which have existed since the latter part of the last century.  A noted agricultural commentator has stated that agricultural incomes fell last year, they will fall this year and they will fall again next year, and output will be down in those three years also.  There have been <Col N="1036" /> few periods in the agricultural history of this country when income and output in real terms fell over a sustained period of three years.  Therefore, it is all the more remarkable and surprising that this Government should choose the middle of that period of decline to remove reliefs that existed and were considered to be satisfactory in previous years when incomes were rising.</P>
      <P>We have argued that the rating system is one where reliefs of some sort are essential. One bears in mind that not only are rates levied on land on the basis of valuation dating from the last century, which in many cases is completely out of line with the production capacity of the land in modern agricultural conditions, but also there is no allowance in the rating system for the family responsibilities that people may have.  If a man has six children and a farm of £40 valuation, he pays exactly the same rates with no relief as a man with a farm of the same valuation who is unmarried and has no family liability.  To come along and worsen the position as far as the entire farming community are concerned in the matter of rates is to aggravate a system which already is inherently unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made already, and certainly never controverted at any time by the Minister, that this Bill has a much greater effect in terms of proportionate increase in rates on the smaller farmer than on any other farmer.  We have calculated that a farmer with a 40-acre farm of £40 valuation will have his rates increased from somewhere around £240 last year to £480 this year, a doubling of his rates burden for that smaller farmer. On the other hand, the position of a farmer with maybe 200 acres will be that his rates will be increased by only 10 to 15 per cent this year, a relatively small increase in his rates burden.  The farmer in the 40-acre category in many cases is not earning an income which enables his to set off his rates against income tax, which is one of the reliefs allowed. Therefore, in the case of a larger farmer with perhaps 200 acres there is no doubt that he will be earning an income&mdash;if he <Col N="1037" /> is liable to farm adequately at all&mdash;which will be sufficient to put him in a position to use his rate payment as a payment of his income tax and thereby get the full benefit of that relief.  In the case of the smaller farmer with a valuation of £40 and 40 acres, in many cases, particularly this year, he will not have an income which would put him in the income tax net.  Therefore, he will not get any benefit from the concession which has been granted in 1978 to farmers which allows them to offset their rates payments as an instalment of their income tax.</P>
    <P>I would describe this Bill as being in the classic sense regressive taxation.  We heard Deputy Cluskey earlier describing the present Government's policy as being one of taking from the weaker sections of the community to give to those who are better able to fend for themselves, and there is a degree of accuracy in what he says.  It would be hard to find more persuasive evidence of this proposition than this Bill, because this Bill takes more from the smaller farmer than it takes from the larger farmer. Clearly it is a regressive measure of taxation unrelated to income.  Incomes of the farming community this year have fallen by varying estimates.  I have cited a range of figures between 9 per cent and 20 per cent and in some cases it will be even higher.  For the farmer who has substantial debt payments to make and very high interest rates his income could have fallen even more proportionately than that of a farmer who is not in debt and is not paying interest.  Even though their income may be the same their outgoings are not the same.  In many cases the people who have the larger debts are the most progressive farmers and these very people will find themselves having to pay very substantial increases in rates which take no account whatever of their income position.  We believe this to be quite unjust.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for having an overall look at the rating system to see if it could be reformed.  This is something which obviously would take some time <Col N="1038" /> to conclude.  Certainly, pending such an investigation, it is very wrong to use a system which is admitted by everybody, including the Minister, to be archaic and out of date as a means of raising easy revenue in a regressive fashion in a year in which farmers are losing money on a unparalleled scale.  Never could circumstances be less propitious for a measure of this sort than they are this year.</P>
    <P>We have appealed throughout this very long debate&mdash;a deliberately long debate because we feel that it is only by means of consistently highlighting the injustice of this measure that it will be brought home to the farming community and the public that there is a need to reform the rating system.  We have argued that this is not the year to do what the Minister is now doing. Farmers, this week particularly, are beginning to realise the enormity of the injustice of this Bill because this week they are receiving their rates demands.  It is this week for the first time, when the farmers look at their rate demands and compare them with last year's demands, that they will realise the full extent of the implications of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Many farmers ignored the proposals contained in the budget, many will not have read the reports of the debate which has taken place on this Bill over the last few weeks, but this week when they receive their rates demands and see in the case of small farmers with 40 or 50 acre farms that their rates are being doubled, and trebled in some cases, they will realise what this debate has been all about.  I hope that this week, next week and every week between now and the general election, those farmers make the message clearly heard by the TDs on the other side of the House who have consistently on every occasion when the matter arose voted for these increases in the rates.  Only today, when we proposed an amendment on a very tiny matter which would mitigate the effect of this Bill, again the Fianna Fáil Deputies voted down our amendment, which would have in some small measure improved <Col N="1039" /> the position of the farming community. That policy has, throughout, been supported by them.  The only thing from which I draw solace&mdash;and I do not know if it has any political significance, perhaps it has none&mdash;is that on the vote today on this Bill the Government, who normally have a majority of 20 in this House, could only muster a majority of ten.  In fact, there were only 56 Deputies from Fianna Fáil out of a total of 84 who managed to come in here to the House.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this is the beginning, at least, of a consciousness on the other side of the House that they have made a grave mistake and committed a grave injustice in imposing this Bill on the farming community.  Perhaps some of the Members of the other side of the House received rates demands themselves this week and spent the time at home wondering how they were going to manage to pay them and did not come up here this week at all.  That may explain their absence, that they got such a shock on Monday or Tuesday or whenever their rates demands arrived and realised what they had been voting for.  Perhaps they had to stop at home to put their affairs in order, suddenly realising, when they received these rates demands, that their affairs were not as healthy as they thought.  Perhaps there is a beginning of a consciousness of the injustice of this Bill.  I certainly hope that the farming community will pay close attention to this debate and to the Fianna Fáil TDs and get them to realise what they have done and that, sooner rather than later, this injustice will be taken off the Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the Government in pressing on with this Bill are totally out of tune with the needs of our farmers.  In passing, I should say that the Bill seems to be very inappropriately named.  Any farmer this year who gets a rates demand for twice the <Col N="1040" /> amount he paid last year will be surprised to see that this is as a result of a Bill called the Relief of Rates Bill.  This, in fact, is happening throughout the country at present.  In pressing on with this Bill the Government are doing to the farmer what they have been doing in many other areas.  The Government's approach, resulting in the ballyhoo at Dublin Airport, welcoming the wonderful package from Brussels which would mean a reduction of 15 per cent in the farmer's current year's income will not fool the farmers any longer.  This is obviously Government by mirrors but, in that situation the Taoiseach's and his Minister's attempt to adopt the McLuhan philosophy of the media becoming the message will not wear.  It is quite clear that the farmers will have to pay a lot more money in rates under a totally unjust system.  Let me make it clear&mdash;and my point of view is shared by every Member on this side of the House, including farmer members&mdash;that we have never objected to the farmers paying tax on a fair basis on their profits.  We were the first party to see that the rates system was unjust.  That this Government, which afterwards adopted the same philosophy, now single out the farming community for a special attack in this regard is absolutely outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that point. In conclusion, this Government will have to have a re-think on their attitude to farmers. I recall that the Fianna Fáil Party when in Opposition made strident calls <Col N="1041" /> on behalf of the farmers and on behalf of farmers of over £100 valuation who were paying tax.  They wept crocodile tears.  Here we have the small farmers being reached through this Bill by the present administration, without any shame or any thought of their personal situation.  I must record my personal opposition to this Bill and my belief that the approach by the present Government is absolutely outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Fine Gael Party have strenously opposed this Bill at all Stages. We believe that the Bill consolidates and extends an unfair system of taxation of farmers.  It consolidates the rating system and extends it on the basis of 100 per cent on all farmers with a valuation of £40 or upwards.  We have voted against this Bill on Second Stage.  We opposed it on Committee Stage.  We put down amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  They were all voted down by the Government.  We cannot vote against the Fifth Stage of this Bill&mdash;and I want to explain that&mdash;because all that is left in the Bill now is relief for farmers with a poor law valuation of £40 and, were we to vote against it, they would be taxed on a full basis also.</P>
      <P>I rose first to explain that and, secondly, to say that the effect of this Bill on a farmer with a £40 valuation in an average county will be to increase his rates bill this year from approximately £198 to £498.  That is an increase of two-and-a-half times the present rates or thereabouts.  That is a tax being imposed on farmers irrespective of their earning capacity or their ability to pay.  That is the second time this year, under two different Bills, that the Government have imposed a farmers' tax without regard to their income or capacity to pay&mdash;this Bill and the resource tax which was bulldozed through here on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I make those remarks by <Col N="1042" /> way of passing reference only.  Where, I ask, is Deputy Connolly, the Minister of State at the Minister's Department, who solemnly and eloquently enunciated in this House that the farmer paid if he had an income, that the farmer paid if he showed a profit, but that the farmer would not be asked to pay if he did not have an income and did not show a profit?  That is not what is in this Bill. This Bill says that the farmer shall pay whether or not he has an income or shows a profit.  It is no excuse to say that the farmer can claim as credit against his income tax the rates which he pays.  As those of us who live in rural Ireland know, those of us who come from the land, who are familiar with farming, in this or indeed in any year very few farmers with a poor law valuation of £40 and approximately 50 acres of land will on an accounts system show sufficient profit as to be liable to tax.</P>
      <P>This is really an effort&mdash;and a successful one&mdash;by this Government to get at the farmer, to extract income tax from him whether or not he is earning an income sufficient to attract income tax under the income tax code.  That is what this Bill is all about.  As Deputy Bruton has said, it is particularly regrettable that in this year, when the farmer's income is tumbling down, when it will show a reduction of at least 10 per cent and perhaps up to 20 per cent, this unjust, arbitrary tax should be imposed on him. This is a transfer of rates from private houses, from industrial buildings, to the farmer.  That is what it is all about.  This is another method of paying for the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  This is another method of paying for the political debts Fianna Fáil incurred in getting them selves back into power at the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second type of tax to be imposed on farmers this year without any regard to income or capacity to pay.  It hits the smaller farmer much harder than the larger farmer.  The category of farmer or valuation bands affected this year for the first time are those between £40 and £60.  The farmer with a £40 valuation is hit much harder by this Bill percentagewise <Col N="1043" /> than is the farmer with a £60 valuation.  For some reason or other this Government, perhaps unconsciously, every time they have spread out their claws this year looking for more money have hit the poorer rather than the well&mdash;off man.  That applies right across the board whether it be in regard to income tax, cottage rents or whatever. The man on the low income is asked to pay more than his better&mdash;off brother or sister.  That is unjust and unfair.  It is unfair as it applies to farmers in the poor law valuation bands but it is unfair also as it applies between farmers in one county and another.</P>
    <P>We live in an age when people bring various complaints as far as the Supreme Court.  I believe that if the rating system with its inequitable yardstick were brought before the Supreme Court it might very well be rejected as being inequitable. No part of Ireland will be affected more by the provisions of this Bill than my constituency.  The poor law valuations in my constituency, particularly in County Monaghan, are notoriously unjust and unfair.  To the extent that the farmers of Monaghan are unjustly and unfairly discriminated against they will be hit all the harder by the provisions of this Bill.  When I tell the Minister that a £70 poor law valuation represents 95 acres of land in County Monaghan and represents 100 acres of land in County Kildare I hope he will see the enormity of the injustice, of the unfair discrimination against the farmers of Monaghan and, to a marginally lesser degree only, the farmers of Cavan.  All of that was based on some myth way back in 1852, or some time between 1852 and 1865 when the Monaghan farmers were sufficiently industrious, hardworking and, I suspect, hungry enough to indulge in the hard task of growing flax.  They were driven to growing flax because they had no other means of livelihood.  Now, 150 years later, they are to be penalised for their industry, hard work and for getting the most out of their land that could have been got at that time.</P>
    <P>This sort of Bill would be very unjust <Col N="1044" /> and unacceptable at any time.  But to introduce Bills at this time, when not so very long ago the Minister recognised the injustice of rates by their abolition, is rubbing salt into the wounds.  That is what happened here.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues sought votes in the last election on the basis that the rating system was unfair, unjust and should be abolished.  Now Fianna Fáil are introducing a Bill to consolidate, reinforce and extend that system.  They are consolidating it by applying it on a basis of a 100 per cent payment without any relief on farmers with a PLV of £40 or over.  This is the second belt they have had since Fianna Fáil returned to office on a campaign which said rates were unjust and unfair and that using the rating system as a yardstick was inequitable and unjust. They abolished agricultural grants on farms under £75, then £60 and now £40 with, for good measure, a resource tax of £3.50 on a £70 valuation.  Is the Minister not ashamed of himself?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I got up to explain why it is impossible to vote on a trick of a Bill like this on Fifth Stage.  This Bill is couched in such a way that it says &ldquo;you cannot hit me with a child in my arms&rdquo;.  They have not got at the farmer under £40 valuation yet, but no doubt they will when they are advised by the Department of Finance.  This is a disgraceful performance particularly from a Government part of whose programme <Col N="1045" /> was: &ldquo;Rates are unjust, poor law valuation is unfair.  Put us into office and we will abolish them&rdquo;.  There was not a word about this legislation when the former Taoiseach was giving an assurance that there would be no question of transferring rates from one category of hereditament to another.</P>
      <P>I agree it is not necessary to say anything more about this Bill because, as Deputy Bruton said, the farmers affected are getting a clearer and more meaningful message about it through their letter boxes and from their rate collectors than I could give if I spoke about this all night.  They are getting the message that they will have to pay two-and-a-half times as much rates as they did last year.  I believe the farmers will not forget this.  Immediately I saw the precursor of this Bill a few years ago I and my party exposed what was in it as loudly as we could but we did not deter the Department of Finance from cracking the whip over the Minister for the Environment.  I agree that this year he was not in a position to talk back to the people who were ordering him about after, if I may say so in a jocose way, the midnight tea party.</P>

He has walked, driven and cycled the roads of Clare collecting rates and knows the people who are being asked to pay.

      <P>I will not say anything about tea parties, Boston or otherwise.  I do not think the inequity of the rates system was obvious to farmers until the primary grants were removed from rates. Now the full impact of the inequity of the valuation system has hit them.  In my own area there are farms of 70 acres with a valuation of £140 and farms of 140 acres with £70 valuation.  That is how unfair this system is.  This Government are basing their taxation system and the resource tax on valuation, and now full rates are also based on that system.</P>
      <P>I believe the farmers' hackles are up. Before this year is out we will have a contest in the courts on this serious issue.  When we were in power we introduced farm taxation and we got a lot of &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; from the farming community. A farmer said to me the other day: &ldquo;We had `aggro' but we were able to pay&rdquo;. Now there is a different situation.  These people have very reduced incomes.  Most of them are having great difficulty trying to meet their financial commitments.  To get a rates Bill for two-and-a-half years' figure is something they cannot tolerate, nor would it be tolerated by any other section of the community.  If a man does not have any money, how can be pay? These farmers do not have any money. It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>There is no point talking about the EEC package.  At 5 per cent that was an excellent package for the EEC farmers who have single figure inflation, single figure bank interest rates and can balance their books, but at 20 per cent inflation, zero growth and 20 per cent bank interest rates, there is no way an Irish farmer will make money this year. He will lose money left, right and centre and this rates burden will cripple him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very serious side to this and that is, the Irish farmer maintaining his viability in the European market place.  Most of his EEC competitors pay one tax&mdash;income tax.  The <Col N="1047" /> Irish farmer has many disadvantages &mdash;a sea journey, trying to break in to new markets and so on but on top of all this the farmer is being crippled with the resource tax and rates.  How can our farmers compete against people who do not have to pay either of these taxes and who live in the middle of the market-place? There is no way they can do that.</P>
    <P>Because of the manifesto and Fianna Fáil's anxiety to get State cars, they have put this economy in the present situation. We see what they are doing at every county council meeting.  County managers are trying to cough up new things like development charges and extra water charges.</P>

      <P>The title of this Bill is surely a misnomer.  The only people who will be relieved by it are the Government and it is retrograde in every respect.  I wish to be associated with the remarks of previous speakers because during the past few weeks I have received a greater flood of representations than at any time since I became a Deputy.  This has occurred since the rates demand notices have been issued to people who will be affected by this Bill because they have valuations between £40 and £60.  We all accept that people should pay tax on profits but there is no logical or Christian basis for a levy on people who are not making a profit sufficient for their families to live on.  Throughout 1979 and 1980 there has been a drastic recession in the agricultural sector and people are finding it exceedingly difficult to make ends meet.  I have no objection&mdash;and neither have members of the farming community&mdash;to people paying tax on profits, but it is most unfair that people should face an exorbitant increase which in my country is at least in excess of 100 per cent and in some cases as high as 140 per cent.  People who last year paid rates of £200 are expected to pay as much as £500 this year; people who paid £300 last year are expected to pay £700 this year.  At the same time their real income has decreased.  I cannot see any justification for the removal of relief in these circumstances.  The Government should take a serious look at the whole matter once again and this is their last opportunity to do so.  If this Bill were allowed to go through this House in its present form it would be politically very stupid and socially wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the third year in which there has been removal of rates relief.  Initially it was reduced for people with valuations in excess of £75; last year it was reduced for people with valuations between £75 and £60 and now it is reduced for those with valuations between £60 and £40.  At <Col N="1049" /> a time when agriculture is at a standstill or going backwards in terms of real incomes surely it is wrong to levy higher rates and taxes.  This levy is being imposed on people who may not be making any profits.  I cannot see any sense in such an imposition.</P>
    <P>It has been put to me by people affected by this legislation that they should be allowed to pay their rates by instalments. Under existing legislation local authorities expect people to pay rates in two moieties.  Perhaps the Minister would consider extending the system because it is hardly fair to expect people with such a low income to fork out £600 or £700.  Perhaps payment of rates could be spread over a greater length of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty raised a pertinent point in asking how we as an agricultural country are expected to compete with our partners in the EEC when we have such an unfavourable rating and taxation system.  We have reached the stage where our system is now the most unfavourable, although some years ago the opposite was true.  Farming is now becoming uneconomic and the time is coming when farmers will have to get a second job outside farming in order to make a decent living.  Costs have been soaring during 1980 and there has been no increase in real income.  There has been a drop in the price of cattle and no increase in the price of milk and it is unreasonable to expect people to pay rates which are more than double the amounts paid last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to condemn in the strongest possible manner the cruel, harsh impositions in this Bill.  They are unfair and unjust in regard to the small farmers, especially those who have valuations between £40 and £60.  I defy the Minister to deny that their income is between £60 and £80 per week and many of them earn less than an agricultural labourer.  Last week Professor Sheehy stated that farmers' incomes last year dropped by 25 per cent and he reckoned they would drop this year by a further 25 per cent, thus making a 50 per cent drop in two years.  This <Col N="1050" /> Bill imposes an increase of between £4 and £10 per week on these unfortunate people.  Other sections got an increase of 20 per cent last year and they will get a similar increase this year.  These people work a five-day week with a month's holiday but the small farmer works for 52 weeks in the year, seven days each week, without any holiday.  In the past Fianna Fáil referred to the small farmers as the salt of the earth.  The Minister is rubbing salt into their wounds this year.</P>
      <P>Many small farmers in Longford and Westmeath have complained to me about the savage increases proposed by the Minister.  Last Saturday night some of these farmers told me they could not pay an extra £6 or £10 per week when their overhead costs were increasing by 25 per cent and the cost of living increasing by 22 per cent.  Many of them have overdrafts and they must pay the banks an interest rate of 18 per cent.  The Minister knows that last year young cattle cost £50 per cwt. but they had to be sold afterwards for £39 per cwt.  I cannot understand why those people who suffered such a loss are now expected to pay more to the Government.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers said it was a misnomer to refer to the Bill as giving relief of rates to farmers.  There is no relief for farmers with valuations of from £40 to £60.  For example, in Longford a farmer with a PLV of £50 will pay an extra £306 while a farmer in Westmeath with a similar valuation will pay an extra £238.  On a £60 valuation a farmer in Longford will pay an extra £400 and in Westmeath he will pay an extra £266.  In Westmeath 926 people will be affected while 361 people in Longford will be affected, making a total of 1,289 farmers who have to meet this additional cost while their incomes are falling.  There is no justification for this savage attack on small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised that not a single Fianna Fáil backbencher has been prepared to sit behind the Minister and support this Bill.  I do not blame them. Many of them made promises when they were canvassing before the last general election.  They told farmers the National <Col N="1051" /> Coalition would impose cruel, harsh taxation but they said Fianna Fáil were their friends.  They had many promises in their manifesto but they did not tell the small farmers in Longford and Westmeath or in the west of Ireland that they would have to pay an additional £250 to £300.  There is very little equity in what the Government are proposing. This rates system is most unfair and unjust and putting an extra burden on small farmers makes it even worse. Where is the equity in putting this cruel taxation on people whose incomes are dropping?  Other sections of the population got an increase of 20 per cent last year and they will get a further increase this year but the income of small farmers has dropped by 50 per cent.  This Government talk about equity and about cherishing all the children of the nation equally but the fact is that they are reducing the income of one section by 40 or 50 per cent while increasing the income of the other section by the same amount.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Hegarty said, we may be on the edge of a precipice.  In the past the farmers stood in the front line in many wars, national and economic.  If they were given the chance they would come to the rescue of the nation once again but unfortunately they are reeling under increased taxation and an increased cost of living at a time when the price of animals is falling.  If they were given the opportunity farmers could help to take the country out of the doldrums.  I am afraid the time is coming when the sheriff will call at the farmer's door.  I have never advocated to anyone that they should break the law but many farmers have told me that if it is a choice between their keeping the extra £4 or £10 to feed their wives and families they will do that even if it means that the sheriff will call.  It is a bad day for the farmers who have given their support to Fianna Fáil for many years.  They have been let down by the Government.  Many of them are waiting for the opportunity to toss Fianna Fáil out of power in a general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long debate on this Bill during which we travelled many roads.  Many of the points made had little to do with the Bill.  We were treated to contributions on valuations, income tax, farmers' prices and profits and housing loans and at the end of the debate we were discussing tea parties.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is simple.  It is to give farmers relief to the tune of £37.7 million which they would not otherwise get and no amount of talking can get away from that fact.  It is not true that the title of the Bill is not accurate.  Considerable relief is being given to farmers. Everyone understands how rates are calculated.  The valuation of the property is multiplied by the rate in the £ struck by the local authority.  The answer obtained as a result of this calculation is the gross rate on the property and this is what the ratepayer is obliged to pay under the general law relating to rates unless some action is taken to give relief. In this Bill such action is being taken with regard to land.  The Bill will ensure that for 396,871 rated occupiers with land valuations of up to £20 rates will not be payable.  For another 58,684 people with holdings between £20 and £40 valuation part of the gross rates are relieved.</P>
      <P>The total cost of relief from which a total number of 455,555 people will benefit is £37.7 million this year.  This amount is made good to the local authority through the agricultural grant so that they are not left short as a result of this rates relief.  The relief will apply in 1981 and 1982 as well.  This is a departure from previous years where the Bill covered only two years.  The reliefs are quite substantial.  Farmers with land of up to £20 valuation will pay no rates and those with land of valuations between £20 and £33 will get full relief on the first £20 and pay the full rate on the remaining £s valuation up to a total of £33. With regard to the rated occupiers between £33 and £40 valuation they are relieved to the extent of 80 per cent on the first £20 valuation and 30 per cent on the remaining amount up to £40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> The question of valuations was dealt with at length by a number of speakers and Deputy Bruton suggested that I take steps to ensure that, as valuations in some areas are very high based on Griffith's valuation, these areas should be revalued.  A suggestion that revaluation should be carried out on a selective basis is grossly unfair.  The whole country should be revalued or not at all.  The Deputy mentioned that valuations along the Shannon Estuary are very high based on Griffith's valuation but other areas away from the Shannon Estuary have very low valuations in comparison with other areas.  If we reduced valuations in the heavily valued areas the valuations would be liable to rise in other areas.  There should definitely not be a selective revaluation of land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy wished to know if it is possible to pay rates by instalment.  It is possible and it has always been possible to adopt this procedure.  There is nothing new here.  Many ratepayers use the instalment system to pay rates on an interim basis and they get an interim receipt.</P>
    <P>The total sum involved in bringing the upper limit for relief from £60 down to £40 this year is £6 million.  The total sum given in relief is £37.7 million.  A factor that seems to be forgotten is the 10 per cent limit which was imposed this year with regard to the increase in rates. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that we were asking the farmer to take up the Bill for the derating of the domestic sector.  We are not asking the farmer or the industrialist to do that and that is the purpose of the 10 per cent limit.  There was a lot of song and dance about the 10 per cent limit but we must also remember that the annual increase in rates of 10 per cent, although one year it was 11 per cent, is part of the increase where farmers are concerned.  The farmers benefited from the relief of domestic rates and from the relief of rates on farm buildings which had been subjected to rates.  The farming community benefited to the tune of £11 million as a result of the relief of domestic rates and of rates on farm outbuildings.  On the one hand <Col N="1054" /> there is the saving of £6 million and there is also a total relief under the relief of domestic rates of £11 million.  I do not see the argument that the farming community with valuations between £40 and £60 are being asked to pay for the domestic sector.</P>
    <P>Because of this Bill this year a total of 455,555 people will benefit by £37.7 million.  They will benefit to the tune of £11 million also because of the derating of the domestic sector.  This Bill is properly named.  It is to relieve rates and we could not give that relief if this Bill were not passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It has been there since 1893 and I do not see any point in taking it out at this stage.  This Bill is designed to protect the consumer and it is part of a package of consumer legislation which we are bringing before the Dáil and Seanad.  Some of it has been passed already such as the Consumer Information Bill and the Pyramid Selling Bill is before the House.  There are a number of other Bills which we will be bringing in.  We are trying to extend protection for the consumer within the legislation.  Why should we reduce his protection if it is there since 1893?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be reducing the protection and that is why I am inquiring about it.  The Act of 1893 has in many ways stood the test of time but now we are trying to modernise and streamline the sale of goods and supply of services.  That is why I question the wisdom of having it implied.  It is implied that the consumer had a reasonable opportunity. A consumer may not have a reasonable opportunity, but the responsibility to inspect the bulk and compare it with the sample is thrown over on to him.  Is it wise to have that?  I presume the Minister understands what I am getting at.</P>

      <P>I understand perfectly. I accept the Deputy's point fully that the 1893 Act has stood the test of time, and what we are trying to do in some areas is improve it.  In this section all we are doing is restating it.  We are not reducing it.</P>

      <P>The Act stood the test of time in many respects but in this one my worry is that there is an implied condition. It is presumed that the person <Col N="1059" /> purchasing materials has had an opportunity to compare the two lots.  The responsibility rests fairly and squarely on the shoulder of the consumer.  The consumer should not have to prove this and the responsibility for it should rest on the seller or manufacturer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the amendments the Minister may have some worries about.  There have been cases recently of Irish companies going into voluntary liquidation and companies which import goods such as electrical goods closing down.  What is the position regarding spare parts?  What safeguards and remedies do people have?  I do not think this amendment tightens up the situation sufficiently.  There is not sufficient protection for consumers.  For example, if a person purchases a washing machine and after two months the company from which they purchase it goes into liquidation and if the machine goes out of order they have no redress and no way of obtaining spare parts.  This is not tightening up the matter sufficiently.  The Minister should include some protection for after sales services and spare parts. There should be some positive arrangement to protect people who purchase items such as washing machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation deals with contract law between a buyer and a seller.  It does not deal alone with spare parts but also deals with merchantable quality and other matters.  While I sympathise with the point made by the Deputy, as far as liquidation is concerned unless the purchaser can get at the liquidator through the relevant Act dealing <Col N="1061" /> with companies he will not be covered by this legislation.  For the information of the Deputy and the House I should like to outline the reason why the amendment was accepted by the Seanad. A certain dissatisfaction was expressed in the Seanad with the original draft of this section.  Arising from that I re-examined the provisions of section 12 in consultation with my advisers and concluded that a certain degree of tidying up was necessary.  The intent and framework of the section remained essentially the same.  I should like to comment on the changes introduced by the amendment.  It should be noted that the original order granting power has been deleted.  Discussion in the other House satisfied me that that would have added little to the section.  I should also mention that the Seanad devoted almost five days to the Committee and Report Stages of this Bill.  The Seanad gave the Bill thorough and detailed consideration.  We had a superb debate there.</P>
      <P>The new subsection (1) now takes account of a situation where an offer of spare parts exists and this whole question of spare parts and after sales service is made without reference to a specific time period.  In such a situation the implied warranty will be that the relevant parts and service will be available for a reasonable time but that does not take into account the question of liquidation. Subsection (2) enables the Minister by order to specify what shall constitute a &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo;.  That power contemplates a situation where a problem arises in relation to a certain class of goods.  It would be appropriate in my view for the Minister to intervene in the consumer's interest to define &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in relation to fridges, food mixers, motor vehicles and so on.  The new section provides, in subsection (3) that any contractual term attempting to negate an offer made in relation to parts or after sales service shall be void.  That provision is self-explanatory and seeks to prevent retailers from giving with one hand and taking away with the other.</P>

      <P>There are many views on the necessity and wisdom of the legislation <Col N="1062" /> and the Minister has met the case fairly here and in the Seanad.  The last amendment in the Seanad from the Opposition sought to give the Minister power to make an order in regard to spare parts.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister is faced with difficulties in regard to this and I appreciate what he has stated in relation to a person who purchases goods from a company that eventually goes into liquidation.  Such a consumer only has a right of action against the liquidator which is totally unsatisfactory for the consumer in that only a percentage in the £ will be paid after a considerable length of time.  That is of little use.  Companies involved in the manufacture of goods have a responsibility to provide adequate spare parts and an after sales service.  I do not think the amendment gets to the nub of this. The Minister should make an order insisting on companies setting aside a reasonable quantity of spare parts for repairs.  I appreciate it will be difficult to include such a provision but it is so essential that the Minister should take the power.  Companies should be obliged to provide financial resources, in the form of a bond or otherwise, for consumers who experience difficulty in obtaining servicing and spare parts after the company goes out of business or into liquidation. Yesterday on an RTE radio programme I heard a consumer tell us how difficult it was to get spare parts for a watch.</P>
      <P>Many items are disposed of at sale prices or high pressure salesmanship is brought into operation to get people to buy them but when such items break down they are useless because spare parts are not available.  Such items may cost up to £100 or, in the case of a colour television, may cost up to £400.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed at great length in the Seanad.  If I made the order requested by the Deputy and the company went into liquidation the spare parts would become part of the liquidator's stock over which we would have no control.  When this was discussed in the Seanad an amendment was put forward by the Opposition and I stated then that despite my personal sympathy with the terms of the amendment I was unable to accept it.  Such an order would have far-reaching repercussions for the industrial sector to the possible long-term detriment of the consumer. I certainly sympathise with the consumers among whom I include myself, who may find themselves with an obsolete washing machine, car, television and so on.  I can assure the House that when discussion on this problem gets under way at European Community level Ireland will participate fully so as to make sure that the problem is resolved equitably.  We are now going to stage two of the consumer package before the European Community.  The commissioner responsible for consumer affairs and the council are at this stage in working groups discussing stage two of the consumer legislation.  The whole question of spare parts is not just an Irish question but an international one. The Irish Government will not be lacking in their contribution to this debate <Col N="1064" /> and will fight their corner along the lines the Deputy suggests and which are very much in line with my own personal sympathies in this matter.</P>

It was suggested in the other House that it was somewhat inconsistent to create a criminal offence for sellers of goods displaying notices which purport to restrict or exclude the buyer's rights without making a similar provision for comparable practice in the area of services.  I agreed that in the circumstances suggested it would clearly be in the interest of the consumer to provide that a recipient of services could not be misled by means of notices which essentially take advantage of the consumer's lack of knowledge or inability to negotiate his or her legal rights.

      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 24 to 30, and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  The maximum period for which plant breeders' rights are to be exercisable pursuant to a grant under this section shall be twenty five years:</P>
      <P>Provided that, as respects fruit trees, forest trees, ornamental trees and grape vines (including in each case their rootstocks), the said period shall be not less than eighteen years and, as respects other genera and species, the said period shall be not less than fifteen years.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> I am proposing that the specify Bill both the maximum and minimum periods for which plant breeders' rights may be held. As originally drafted, the Bill specified the minimum period and the maximum period was to have been fixed by regulation. This amendment changes that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very reasonable amendment as it now provides for the first time for a maximum period for the exercise of a monopoly and I welcome it. My amendment is identical to the Minister's amendment.  It was put down first and within a very short time the Minister introduced an amendment which has identical effect but is perhaps more professionally drafted.  I naturally defer to this version of the same proposal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 27, to delete &ldquo;or discovered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is really consequential on what we have already agreed.  We agreed that plants in the wild should not be capable of becoming the subject of a monopoly under the Bill.  It seems to me, therefore, to be irrelevant to have the words &ldquo;or discovered&rdquo; in section 6.  Subsection (1) of this section states:</P>
      <P>Where a plant variety is independently bred or discovered by two or more persons, subject to <i>subsection (2)</i> of this section, the first of those persons by or in relation to whom an application is duly made under <i>section 4</i> of this Act shall be the person entitled to a grant of plant breeders' rights as regards the variety.</P>
      <P>I understand it will no longer be possible to take out a patent in respect of the discovery of a plant in the wild.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One will now only be concerned with plants which have been consciously bred as a result of scientific work by a plant breeder.  I feel that the words &ldquo;or discovered&rdquo; should be deleted from this section. I have not gone through the Bill <Col N="1079" /> with a fine comb to find out if there are other places where the words &ldquo;bred or discovered&rdquo; are used.  If there are, I feel the words &ldquo;or discovered&rdquo; should be deleted in every case where they appear. As we have already decided that only plants which are consciously bred may be patented and not plants which are merely discovered in the wild, I should think that those words should be deleted wherever they appear.  That is sensible drafting and it is possible that those words could create misunderstanding.  I urge the Minister to remove them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the proposed amendment would be too restrictive.  It would have the effect of limiting the scope of protection in that only varieties bred in a conventional manner would be eligible for protection. The convention stipulates that whatever the origin, artificial or natural, of the initial variations from which the plant variety has resulted, the breeder shall be in a position to obtain rights.  As I have stated earlier, no reservations to the convention are permitted.  Accordingly, I must reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how you could have a variety in a field which had not been bred in the first place and planted in the field.  Therefore, I do not see how you would find one just like that that was not a wild plant, unless in the one wheatfield where you had sown a number of seeds of the same variety some of them for some reason developed a slightly different characteristic in the course of growing in a particular place. The slight change which occurred from being grown in that environment could determine them to be a new variety.  I cannot understand that.  Obviously, this Bill is concerned only with new varieties which are distinct from previous varieties.  I cannot understand how you could have discoveries which are not simply discoveries of something in the wild.  Given the restrictions of the format of this debate, I realise that I cannot cross-question the Minister on this.  If I did cross-question him for long enough I would find out that there is a reasonable explanation for his attitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That satisfies me and that is why I raise this.  I do not accept the Minister's amendment as being sufficient. The Minister's amendment says that the controller shall grant a compulsory licence if he is satisfied that the applicant is financially or otherwise in a position to exercise the right in a competent manner, whereas up to now, even if the controller had been satisfied that the person applying for a compulsory licence was capable of exercising it in a competent manner, he still did not have to grant a compulsory licence.  Obviously, the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; in that sense is an advance in that at least we know that if all the requisite conditions are met a compulsory licence will be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not believe that that is sufficient by any means, and in order to support my case I must say that I believe that these provisions in section 8 which we are discussing now concerning compulsory licences are central to the entire <Col N="1083" /> Bill, and this is a most important aspect of the Bill.  Under this Bill people are going to be allowed to get a monopoly in relation to the selling of varieties of a particular plant that they have developed.  The only safeguard in the entire Bill against this monopoly&mdash;which may, as we have agreed, last up to 25 years&mdash;against, for instance, the person who has the monopoly refusing unreasonably to allow other people to use the plant in which he has the monopoly or charging unreasonably high prices or failing in any other way to engage in fair trade practices in the use of the monopoly that he has&mdash;this argument has been used by the Minister throughout this debate any time we raised this question as to whether the monopoly could be abused&mdash;was the safeguard of a compulsory licence.  Under the compulsory licence procedure it is open to any other individual who feels that he is being abused by the person who has the monopoly, to apply for a compulsory licence.  If this is granted, there will be two people with the monopoly, instead of one.  The second person, to get the monopoly, must prove that he has been unreasonably treated and that it is contrary to the public interests that the monopoly should remain with only one person.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, he must prove that he is financially in a position to make use of the monopoly if he gets it.  We believe that the conditions imposed by the section are unduly restrictive and, as they at present stand, will have the effect of ensuring that no one uses the compulsory licence procedures effectively, although they are the only protection against abuses of a monopoly.  In support of what I am saying I draw the House's attention to the fact that, although in British legislation on the statute books for 12 years or more, exactly similar licence procedures exist, in no case has a compulsory licence yet been granted in Britain under the provisions obtaining there, which clearly indicates that those procedures are inadequate.  I am certain that there were cases in Britain in which <Col N="1084" /> excessive prices have been charged for seed, but in no case has anyone yet been able to get a compulsory licence because the terms of the Act in regard to the conditions which must be complied with to get a compulsory licence are too severe.</P>
    <P>The three amendments in my name seek to relax those conditions in such a way as to ensure that&mdash;in Ireland, at least&mdash;it will be possible to get compulsory licences and that people who have monopolies will know that that is the case and as a result will not engage in any practices which would be unfair or unreasonable or in any sense lead to unduly high prices being charged to farmers for seed.  The ultimate result of an abuse of the monopoly powers being conferred in this Bill in relation to the use of plant varieties will be unduly high prices being charged to farmers.  Our amendments are directed at ensuring that that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Our first amendment, No. 6, is to delete the words contained in the section which is the conditions that only a person can get a compulsory licence if the controller is satisfied that the applicant is financially and otherwise in a position, and intends, to exercise rights in a competent manner which would be conferred by such an authorisation.</P>
    <P>In other words, the person applying for the authorisation even though he proves that there is an abuse of the monopoly must go on and prove to the satisfaction of the controller that he is in a position to use the monopoly if he gets it and in a position to maintain the variety, which is an expensive process, if he gets it and that he intends to exercise it.  He will have to prove as well as the abuse of the monopoly that he has the money, the ability and the intention to use the monopoly himself if it was granted to him, alongside the person who already has a monopoly.  If it is an individual who is applying, perhaps a farmer who feels that he is being sold seed at too high a price, if he got the compulsory licence there would be no doubt that the banks would give him credit and enable him to have the money to exercise the compulsory licence effectively. <Col N="1085" /> However, he must prove before he gets the compulsory licence that he has the money to do it.  In most cases banks would not be prepared to lend money to an applicant to the off-chance that he might get a licence and because he is applying. The only circumstances in which they would be prepared to grant him a loan is when he has actually got the licence under his belt.  The Act requires him to prove this in advance, which is unduly onerous and will result in many people simply not being able to apply because they would not be able to prove to the satisfaction of the controller that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Let it be said that of course these proceedings will be contested by the monopolist who will use every means at his disposal to prove that the person is not financially competent.  He will probably be able to afford barristers and solicitors.  In many cases it will be an international company with substantial resources which will be able to pay for the best legal advice and defence to prove that the applicant has not got the necessary financial competence.  On the other hand, the applicant may be a relatively poor man who cannot afford a team of barristers and solicitors to prove his side of the case.  The wording of the section, in my view, will put anyone applying for a compulsory licence at an unfair disadvantage.  For that reason I would argue that those words should be removed.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing, in amendment No. 7, to change the words that the controller, &ldquo;if he is satisfied&rdquo; that the applicant is financially or otherwise in a position to exercise this monopoly to the words &ldquo;if it has been demonstrated to his satisfaction&rdquo;.  These are more appropriate words.  &ldquo;If he is satisfied&rdquo; is a subjective thing and what would satisfy one man might not satisfy another, as we all know in any number of different contexts. It is basically a subjective judgment as to whether one is satisfied or not in a particular case.  If the words I am proposing &ldquo;if it has been demonstrated to his satisfaction&rdquo; were accepted, this would perhaps be more objective.  One <Col N="1086" /> could argue about that, but it is not a very major amendment.  If the Minister says the insertion of the words proposed would not make any difference, I would accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In amendment No. 8, I shall be proposing that the words &ldquo;financially and otherwise&rdquo; be deleted from this subsection.  I could not agree with Deputy Bruton's proposal to delete the additional words as it is imperative to ensure that in granting a compulsory licence the controller must have regard to the legitimate interests of the holder of plant breeder's rights.  He must ensure in granting a compulsory licence that the applicant will (a) be in a position to pay the royalties fixed by the controller or holder of the rights, (b) multiply the variety in such a manner that it remains true to its description, (c) exploit the variety in a competent manner so that valuable seed is not wasted and the value of the plant breeder's rights to the holder is not impaired.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 7, I am unable to accept this proposed amendment. It is the duty of the controller to satisfy himself that the recipient of a compulsory licence is in a position to exercise in a competent manner the rights conferred on him.  That is to say, the controller himself must be satisfied.  The proposed amendment would have the effect of making this requirement somewhat less specific.  I consider that the original words used here are more satisfactory and I could not agree to Deputy Bruton's proposed amendment.</P>

Perhaps the compulsory licensing procedure is not the best way of doing this.  But, as the Minister has said already, it seems to be the only way we can check abuse.

      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has adopted the attitude he has in regard to these amendments.  I should like some clarification from him on amendment No. 18 because he did not explain very fully what is implied. The amendment says that the appeal committee in confirming a decision of the controller to grant a licence under section 8 (2) of this Bill may modify any of the terms or conditions of the licence. I wonder what difficulties could arise from a licence being granted by the controller and then the appeal committee modifying it.

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 13, after line 52, to add the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11) The Controller shall grant a compulsory licence under this section if he is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a demand for the plant variety is not being met on reasonable terms as to price or other considerations, or</P>
      <P>(b)  that by reason of the refusal of the holder to grant an authorisation on reasonable terms the development of agricultural or commercial activities in Ireland is being unfairly prejudiced, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the terms on which the holder is prepared to offer an authorisation are more onerous than the terms being offered by him in respect of the same variety in another country, or</P>
      <P>(d)  the terms as to royalty payments imposed by the holder in respect of the grant of an authorisation are unduly burdensome on the applicant, seriously impairing his ability to complete with the holder, where the holder through prior licence royalties and profits from exploitation of the variety has more than recovered the costs allocable to Ireland of the development of the variety.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce new grounds on which a compulsory licence may be granted. Basically what we are saying here is that, if there is any of these four grounds of evidence of abuse of the monopoly, a compulsory licence shall be granted. Lest the House might think that this <Col N="1090" /> amendment has been drafted in a most unprofessional fashion I would point out that its precise wording is based on the wording contained in a Canadian Bill concerned with the amendment of patent law in Canada which was published in 1976.  I am using the terminology chosen specifically by the Canadian legal draftsmen in determining grounds on which compulsory licences should be granted in Canada in the case of an abuse of the monopoly.  As the compulsory licence is the only protection against the abuse of monopolies which this House is conferring on plant breeders, I feel that monopoly should be struck down if unreasonable prices are being charged, if a person is using the monopoly to engage in unfair competition with someone else, or if the terms on which the royalties are being charged are higher in Ireland than in some other country.  If, for instance, a person has a monopoly which applies to Britain, Ireland and France and is charging much higher prices in Ireland for the use of the plant in respect of which he has a monopoly than are being charged in France or Britain, that should constitute grounds on which a compulsory licence should be used to strike down the monopoly as it applies in Ireland if Ireland is being unfairly prejudiced by the method by which the monopolist is setting his price.</P>
    <P>Obviously the holder should be able to settle a royalty level which allows him recover the costs of developing the plant which are applicable to Ireland. Therefore we are making that exception in the amendment to allow that be done. But so long as that is being done we do not believe there should be complete freedom to charge any price one likes for the ability to use a plant.  Certainly the price should not be either higher in this country than is applicable in other countries or so pitched as to allow a breeder to engage in unfair competition or exploitation of the consumer.</P>
    <P>This amendment is relevant not only to plant breeders' rights but to the whole area of patent legislation.  I understand that we shall have a Patents Bill in the <Col N="1091" /> near future concerned with other forms of monopoly in the matter of intellectual property.  Therefore I feel an amendment along these lines is appropriate not only to this Bill but to others of that nature.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the grounds for granting a compulsory licence as proposed by Deputy Bruton in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of his proposed amendment are covered adequately by the existing provisions of section 8 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards sub-paragraph (d) of his amendment, as I said previously, it would be impossible to set specific figures in relation to allowable costs for developing a variety because such figures would not be available to the controller. Breeders usually work with many varieties, the majority of which never reach the market.  Even a breeder would have difficulty in estimating the cost of developing a particular variety.  I feel that the grounds for the granting of a compulsory licence are sufficiently wide to cover all reasonable grounds for issuing such a licence.  I do not accept this amendment.  However, Deputy Bruton may agree that in my earlier amendments to the section I have gone some considerable way to meeting some of those points already made by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the specific amendment suggested by Deputy Bruton, section 8 already provides that compulsory licences may be granted where unreasonable terms are set by a person holding the rights.  This includes price and other considerations.  Accordingly, precisely what Deputy Bruton is seeking has already been covered in section 8. Subparagraph (b) of his amendment is already covered by the public interest consideration contained in section 8, which in my view is sufficiently widely based to cover any possible difficulties. When all is said and done we must rely on the judgment and discretion of the <Col N="1092" /> controller.</P>
    <P>On subparagraph (c), the levels of royalty payments are often different from one country to another.  Many considerations, including size of market, inflation rates and so on, account for this. Royalties charged here are usually the same as Britain.  If the royalty terms here were significantly higher than in other UPOV states it would be open to an agreed party to apply for a compulsory licence on the ground of unreasonable terms.  I have already covered sub-paragraph (d) in my opening remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the words &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; are far too vague.  As anyone who studied political science knows, it is notoriously difficult to define &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo;. The public interest for a socialist is very different from the public interest for a capitalist.  Public interest is whatever you want it to be.  Putting the words &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; into a Bill means that whoever is the controller at a given time will be able to impose his view of what the Irish public interest might be.  If he is a man of a particular point of view, not necessarily a political point of view, about the development of agriculture, he might adopt a completely different stance from a controller who had a different, subjective point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment sets down more specific guidelines which, I would remind the Minister, are based on a Canadian proposal under which the controller must grant a compulsory licence if the case meets the objective conditions set out in the amendment.  It is better legislation to give a controller specific, definite, guidelines as to how he is to act in granting a compulsory licence rather than leaving it to him to determine whether the exercise of monopoly is in his view in the public interest.  The vagueness of the terminology in this Bill is more likely to lead to litigation and people being dissatisfied with the controller's decision and taking the matter to <Col N="1093" /> the courts than would be the case with my amendment, which sets down specific, objective and definable criteria on which compulsory licences should be granted.  In my view my amendment is a much better formulation of the situation than the Minister's rather vaguely termed public interest provision.  Therefore, I would like to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 5, after &ldquo;rights&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and it is in the interest of the advancement of agriculture in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it stands reads that &ldquo;Subject to <i>Subsection (2)</i> of this section, if on an application made in that behalf by or on behalf of a holder the Controller is satisfied that....&rdquo; an extension of the period for which the holder has been granted a licence should be extended, the controller may grant it subject to the conditions he might apply.  This amendment seeks to say that the extension of the grant should only be given where the controller is satisfied that it would be in the interest of Irish agriculture.  In requiring that additional assurance we are doing something sensible.  We do not want grants to be extended simply because the controller feels that it would be a good idea or that he likes the fellow applying for it.  He must be satisfied that not only has the breeder not been adequately remunerated, but that it would be in the interest of Irish agriculture that this extension be granted.  I do not believe the failure of the licensee to get an adequate profit out of the monopoly is, on its own, a ground for giving him an extension.  He was given a gift when he was granted the monopoly.  If in the rather generous period in which he had the monopoly&mdash;a minimum of 15 years&mdash;he has not been able to make enough profit, on the face of it that was his own fault.  The fact that he can prove he did not make enough profit is not sufficient ground for giving <Col N="1094" /> him an extension of the monopoly unless it can be shown that such an extension would be in the interest of Irish agriculture.  I believe that additional provision is a useful one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section already provides that the controller may if he decides to grant the application apply to the extension of rights such restrictions or other conditions as he may specify. Also, any extension would be limited as to duration up to a maximum of 25 years.  In my view this is a sufficient safeguard for what Deputy Bruton has in mind.  I can assure him that extensions will not be given lightly.  The onus will be on the applicant to prove his case and extensions will be the exception rather than the rule.</P>
      <P>This section deals simply with the remuneration the breeder received, whether it was adequate or otherwise. The question of protection of the public interest is provided for in section 8.  If after receiving an extension the breeder acts against the public interest, it is open to an aggrieved party to apply for a compulsory licence.  I might also mention that in time rights will likely be granted here to plant varieties other than strictly agricultural varieties.  In the circumstances the amendment would not be appropriate.  I am afraid I am unable to accept it.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - National Heritage Bill, 1980: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Government are not accepting this Bill, it is useful to have an opportunity of discussing our national heritage and to debate in a constructive way the need to preserve our national monuments for future generations.  We are fortunate in having such a quantity of excellent <Col N="1095" /> monuments scattered throughout the country and they are a major tourist attraction. I come from County Roscommon and I doubt that we would have such numbers of tourists if we did not have our monuments.  Work is now being carried out on Roscommon Castle and on the Dominican Abbey in Roscommon town.</P>
      <P>It may not be widely known that in most counties there is a national monuments advisory committee and I have the honour of being the chairman of this august body in County Roscommon. These committees could be strengthened and I appeal to the Minister of State to give them more statutory authority when preparing his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Our committee is composed of six members&mdash;four councillors and two lay people.  I propose that membership of these committees should be extended to ten with four experts drawn from different parts of the county to advise the council on the preservation and development of national monuments, in conjunction with the national monuments section of the Office of Public Works.  The committees should be given more statutory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have proposed that we should invite experts from the Office of Public Works to come to our county to discuss the development and preservation of our national monuments.  In the development plan of 1972 which is now being revised we have listed all the national monuments and sites located in the county. This gives the public and the Office of Public Works an opportunity to investigate these sites more thoroughly.  It is also important that any interference with these sites should be reported to the council.  I would ask that these points be included in the Bill being drafted by the Government and not in this Bill drafted by the Opposition which has not the right content and is not detailed enough to enable proper care of our national monuments.  This debate could be useful to the Government when drafting their <Col N="1096" /> Bill and many of the points raised by the Opposition could be taken into consideration. This could be considered a &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; before the Government's Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>There has been much controversy about the increasing popularity of metal detectors and I heard a radio programme this evening dealing with this topic.  I understand that their use is not illegal provided they do not interfere with national monuments.  However, the matter should be clarified and I would not encourage their use in or near national monuments because they could be destructive.  Detailed examination by experts is required in the case of any discoveries. I congratulate the person who made the recent find in Tipperary.  He was very mature and responsible and handled the matter with great care.  I know that he could have got into certain difficulties but he had some knowledge of these matters.  The average amateur, however, would not be in a position to excavate properly and could do an immense amount of damage.  In preparing his Bill the Minister should ensure that these metal detectors will not be banned because their use has become a fast-growing hobby in Europe and in this country, but users should not be allowed to interfere with national monuments and should incur severe penalties for so doing.</P>
    <P>It is opportune to congratulate the Minister and the national monuments section of the Office of Public Works on the excellent work they are doing for the State.  Though times are difficult financially, there has been quite a good provision in the budget for that section of the OPW and this represents a very important investment.  There is not a quick return but there are long-term benefits. A fortnight ago I visited Kilkenny Castle to see the fine work which has been done there by the OPW and I congratulate them on their work throughout the State. This work is done by professional craftsmen and they must take great credit for their fine work in Ballintubber Abbey in County Mayo.  They give expert care and attention to every job they <Col N="1097" /> tackle.  This is an investment in the future of this country which is tied up with tourism.  It is important for any country to preserve its past and the national monuments section receive bouquets from everybody in this House, including the Opposition, for their excellent work.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced by my friend and neighbour, Deputy Donnellan, is not broad enough for the Minister and the Government to accept.  The Minister has assured us that a Bill is at the drafting stage which will be a comprehensive review of our national monuments and he has appealed for the withdrawal of this Bill.  It would not be constructive to have a division in relation to a Bill dealing with our national heritage.  It would be much more constructive to await the Minister's Bill which will come before the House as quickly as possible. Anybody who is not satisfied with its contents can call for a division, if necessary. The points raised in this Bill will certainly be taken into consideration in the drafting of the Government's Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a subject in which I have a very deep personal interest.  As Deputy Donnellan said, I was involved with him in preparing the Bill.  For me it represents the culmination of three years' work on the subject, putting down parliamentary questions and gathering information.  I feel deeply that we need to modernise our national monuments legislation if we are to protect our heritage from destruction.  People do not realise the extent of the threat to our national heritage.  In the course of my contribution, I intend to indicate the size of the threat in some cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said he intends to present his own Bill and that that, in itself, was sufficient reason to throw out our Bill.  I would remind him of the proverb that &ldquo;the best is the enemy of the good&rdquo;.  If the Minister waits until he has what he considers a perfect Bill we may be waiting and waiting and waiting. We will never achieve perfection in anything concerned with legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan acknowledged at the outset of his contribution that this <Col N="1098" /> Bill was not perfect but at least we have raised some issues, perhaps the most important issues.  We have said that if the Minister allows this Bill to go to Committee Stage and if he wants to amend it, by adding to it or subtracting from it, we would welcome such amendment.  It would be a great pity if, at the end of this debate, the Minister were to refuse to allow this Bill to go to Committee Stage and voted it down in principle.  If, at the end of Committee Stage when we have teased out the various points, the Minister still considers the Bill is an inadequate framework and is not capable of being amended adequately, he could vote it down then.  However, to refuse to allow it to go to Committee Stage, to refuse to allow it to be discussed in detail, indicates a closed mind on the subject and that is not the right approach for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is an important one which deals with the protection of various wrecks off our coast.  There are approximately 20 wrecks along the Irish coast that were part of the ill-fated Spanish Armada.  In recent years with new technology in diving some of these wrecks have been under serious threat.  I shall quote in particular the case of the &ldquo;Santa Maria de la Rosa&rdquo; in the Blasket Sound, in the sea off the Minister's native county.  It was said in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 16 May that this ship was plundered by divers, that material was taken from it in a most unprofessional manner and sold for commercial purposes.  This wreck was deprived of almost all its important and valuable items; for instance, cannons were sold abroad and have disappeared forever from this country.  The Minister of the day was powerless to do anything about it because there was no legislation that allowed him to exercise any control on excavations that took place below the high water mark.</P>
    <P>We also possibly have a number of Viking long boats that may have been wrecked off our coasts.  To my knowledge their location has not yet been identified but there are bound to have been some such wrecks.  Although <Col N="1099" /> this Bill does not cover them, possibly there are other items such as the remnants of settlements that may have been submerged by coastal erosion that exist below the high water mark.  There may be important geological specimens of historic interest below the high water mark but under present legislation nothing can be done to prevent these items being plundered.  This Bill is intended to increase the power of the Minister&mdash;our political opponent&mdash;to deal with the problem.  We are trying to improve his powers to allow him to do his work.  If there is any example of a Bill that is not politically contentious this is one example.  We are trying to help the Minister to do his work better, to prevent materials being plundered in this way.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a letter from the Royal Irish Academy that was addressed to me in December 1977.  It stated:</P>
    <P>It is thought that a certain amount of surreptitious plundering of wrecks is also carried out but the final destination of the finds is, of course, not known.  The Academy is concerned that any search conducted on wrecks of archaeological significance should be properly controlled and that all finds of national importance should be recovered and made available to all interested parties.</P>
    <P>That most respected body have said they want protection for our wrecks.  Yet, we have no power at the moment to give such protection.  In many cases the wrecks are wooden vessels that are very well preserved.  They afford us an opportunity to see in an undisturbed condition evidence of the lifestyle of the 14th and 15th centuries.  Any evidence found on land is liable to have been disturbed with other cultivations that have taken place but wrecks at sea are almost entirely undisturbed. Thus, they are even more valuable than what may be found on land.</P>
    <P>In section 4 we are proposing that the Commissioners of Public Works be required to publish an annual report giving <Col N="1100" /> information about excavations they have licensed under the powers they have already.  There is considerable evidence that there is need for more public information and for the tightening of controls on excavations carried out under licence by the Office of Public Works.  In the past ten years they have spent about £500,000 in grants to archaeologists to carry out excavations.  These archaelogists are bound by law under section 23 of the National Monuments Acts, 1930, to report promptly to the National Museum any objects that they find in the course of their excavations.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question put down in 1977 I discovered that, of 45 excavations which had taken place under licence from the Board of Works in the previous ten years, in 15 cases the archaeologists who had received substantial sums of public money to carry out their excavations had failed to lodge the reports of their excavations as they were bound to do under section 23 of the Act.  There is a moral obligation on archaeologists funded by the public, who find objects of importance to lodge them with the National Museum when they have finished their research so that they are available to the public for display and study.  In reply to Question No. 314 of 18 October 1977 I discovered that in relation to the 45 excavations, most of which were carried out with the aid of public funds, only six archaeologists had lodged in the museum material found.  In six other cases some of the material was lodged and in 33 cases no material was lodged in the National Museum.  Some archaeologists may have found nothing. Indeed, one extensive excavation in Mayo revealed a lot of valuable information but no objects were found.  There are other cases where the archaeologist is still working on his material and may not have time to process and pass on the objects.  But in some cases the excavations are completed ten years and still material has not been lodged in the National Museum.  That is a bad example on the part of archaeologists.  Section 4 of this Bill would require the commissioners to give us a report every year on the extent to which the legal terms of <Col N="1101" /> these excavation licences are being fulfilled, so that any case of somebody not reasonably lodging material or producing reports of excavations will be brought to public notice.</P>
    <P>The next section is concerned with the guardianship of national monuments. One of the purposes of this Bill is to ensure that the Board of Works will have the power to take over an inhabited building and become the guardians of it. It is only as the legal guardians of the building that the Board of Works have any power to spend money in maintaining it.  The preservation of a farmhouse with people living in it is far more valuable than allowing the farmhouse to become a ruin and then the Board of Works trying to preserve it artificially. There are many buildings and farmhouses being lived in at the moment which are of immense historic interest and they should be preserved.  At the moment the Board of Works are completely powerless to do anything as they can only step in when the building has become a ruin.  Could anything be more ridiculous?</P>
    <P>We should try to preserve not only big castles and imposing buildings, but farmhouses and other houses, the types of dwelling in which the humblest people lived in the past.  We want to keep evidence of the entire lifestyle of our people even up to relatively recent times. Thatched houses are disappearing by the thousand, and in ten years' time perhaps there will be no thatched houses.  In ten years' time certain types of farmhouses will have disappeared without trace because of modernisation.  I do not say that every old building should be preserved but we should preserve specimens of each type so that in 200 years' time we will be able to show how people lived now.  It would be ideal if the Board of Works could go to a farmer or a householder living in one of these houses and say that they wanted it preserved, that they wanted the person to continue living there and that they would provide the money and would continue to provide the money to maintain it so long as the person maintained the house in <Col N="1102" /> good condition according to certain specifications.  That is what this Bill is trying to do.  It would be a pity if this generation were responsible for allowing things to disappear without trace simply because we did not get around to drafting the legislation to do it.  I am convinced that if Deputy McEllistrim had the powers which this Bill would confer he would use them.  As a result of the delays there would be in passing alternative legislation the Minister would probably not have the power for years, whereas if the Minister adopted this measure he would.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill is concerned with giving responsibility to the National Museum to look after the objects found as a result of excavations on shipwrecks. It is merely a routine amendment extending the power to make preservation orders.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is concerned with preventing people from using items from our historic past for purely private gain.  At the moment if somebody digging his garden finds something of historic interest he is by law required to report it to the National Museum.  In many cases the people who find such objects will not know the value of them or their significance and they are likely to show it to someone who knows something about it who will perhaps offer £10 for it knowing it to be far more valuable.  The man can then proceed to sell it abroad or to an antique dealer and make a profit from it.  The anomalous thing is that, although the finder is obliged by law to report it to the National Museum, the person who buys it from him even though he is more likely to know the value of it, is under no obligation to report the fact that he has come into possession of this valuable item.  That is a loophole that should be closed and this Bill will close it.  This will ensure that items which are of importance to us will not be exported abroad for profit.</P>
    <P>I attended an auction in Slane Castle which was concerned with fine art at which the National Museum were represented.  I was told by the people organising it that many of the items on <Col N="1103" /> sale were Irish items which had probably been illegally exported and sold and bought abroad and were now being brought back with the possibility that the National Museum might buy them at a high price.  These items should never have left the country and the National Museum should have bought them in the first place.</P>
    <P>We should not have the situation where the National Museum goes along to an auction either here or abroad where items of Irish national heritage are on sale.  If they have not got enough money they cannot buy them and the objects end up in a museum in New York or Washington.  That is not satisfactory.  These items should not leave the country but should be preserved here.  If the provision I am seeking to incorporate in the Bill was put into effect, whereby anyone in Ireland who comes into possession of a historical object of importance is obliged to report it, these items would never have left the country and the spectacle I have described of items coming back here so that the National Museum will have a chance of buying them&mdash;and if they do not they go back out&mdash;would not happen.</P>
    <P>The powers which exist to control exports of historical objects are totally useless.  Under section 14 of the 1954 Act the Minister may declare an object which in his opinion is an archaeological object to be an archaeological object and if he does so that object may not be exported.  There is no control over the export of any object that the Minister does not specifically declare to be an archaeological object.  On 18 October 1977 in Question No. 299 I asked the Minister if he had declared any objects to be archaeological objects since that Act was passed 23 years previously.  He told me that no object was declared to be an archaeological object in accordance with the terms of the National Monuments Act, 1954.  In other words, there is no control whatever on exports of archaeological objects because the Minister never got around to declaring <Col N="1104" /> any of them to be archaeological objects, because he never found out about their existence in the first place because of the lack of the provision which I am seeking to insert in the Bill.  Although controls exist on paper they are totally useless.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned with the control of the use of electronic devices or metal detectors to find items.  I have noticed in the papers many advertisements by people promoting the sale of metal detectors encouraging people to use them and giving the impression that if they are used one could hit the jackpot and become a millionaire overnight.  The fact is that 90 per cent of items which would be ancient and found by metal detectors and dug up as a result of their being identified are totally valueless in a financial sense.  A lot of them are only iron nails or some form of agricultural implement, spearheads and so on which one could not sell because they are made of iron and not of any precious metal.  If they are found and dug up, they are taken out of the context in which they originally lay side by side with other objects. If at a given level in the soil one found a certain type of nail in conjunction with certain types of wood and other remains, which would indicate that they were deposited there at a particular time in history, one might discover that a certain type of agricultural implement or nail was in use 200 years before one had thought it was.  If an unprofessional person using a metal detector discovers these, he just digs and digs and throws them completely out of their proper context. All one gets is the nail and one does not get any of the objects that lay beside it which may have been destroyed by the person shovelling.  One does not know anything about it except that it is a nail. It could be a nail which was used for one purpose or another purpose but one would not know for which purpose it was used by virtue of the fact that it had been dug up in this way.  If it had been excavated professionally one would have valuable information about the item, which in itself is financially of no value to anyone.  Not only does the person digging it up get nothing out of it, because a <Col N="1105" /> nail is not something one can sell, but they destroy the possibility of other people getting useful information.</P>
    <P>Metal detectors should not be used except under licence.  The Board of Works should see to it that if they are used to find historical items it should be done under licence by reputable people who undertake to comply with certain conditions such as reporting the objects found, recording the way they find them and so on, or in assisting archaeological excavations.  They should not be used by untrained people who are out for a treasure hunt.  It is not sufficient to say they should not be used around a national monument.  There may be items of immense value in areas we do not realise are national monuments.  There may be bare fields under which there may be a settlement of 1,000 years old completely obliterated from view by subsequent deposits of soil and one would not be aware of its existence.  If someone comes along with a metal detector, gets a sounding and starts digging in the process they may find some nails but may destroy something which is irreplaceable and may never exist again.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is also a problem.  About 15 per cent of recorder field monuments have been destroyed in the course of land reclamation.  In Meath alone a survey in 1970 showed that 56 monuments were destroyed in the course of land reclamation.  In the last ten years I am sure that more have been destroyed. There is need for control on that.  We spend a lot of money on archaeological excavations but the public have not had the significance of these explained to them.  More work should be done by the Board of Works to encourage the dissemination of information in a popular form about archaeological excavations so that people will realise what is there and not seek to destroy it.</P>
    <P>The penalties under the legislation are completely out of date.  At present the maximum fine one can receive is £50 for destroying a national monument.  That is a totally insufficient fine.  It should be about £1,000.  The Bill proposes to bring the fines up to date so that if a national <Col N="1106" /> monument is destroyed people will be penalised for so doing and will be deterred from doing so again.  I am also concerned at the delay on the part of the Board of Works in publishing the archaeological survey.  In the last five years they have completed a survey of three counties&mdash;Louth, Meath and one other.  The surveys have almost been completed.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works at public expense carried out detailed archaeological surveys of every item of archaeological interest in two or three counties but they have not published any of it.  That information, garnered at public expense, has not been published and I am not confident that it will be published in the foreseeable future.  The Minister of State should give a direction to his officials to publish this information within the next six months.  It is available in his Department and it is only a question of having it printed and published.  There is no reason why information obtained at public expense in relation to our national heritage in the archaeological survey should remain unpublished as is the case.  I believe strongly that legislation is needed urgently in this area.  The Bill we have put forward goes a long way towards meeting the case for improved legislation and the Minister should allow it become law, or, at least, to be discussed in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in this topic and I should like to make a few comments about the Bill.  It is a known fact, and people have been known to say, that those without history are like a man without a memory.  Over the centuries Ireland has built up a remarkable wealth of archaeological and architectural finds. Whether they be churches, castles, market squares or medieval dwellings they are all essential to our history and our culture.  I have read Deputy Donnellan's Bill, the title of which appears rather misleading.  &ldquo;National Heritage&rdquo; is a very wide term which includes national and cultural heritage.  The national heritage embraces all that nature has endowed the country with, the physical environment and the plant <Col N="1107" /> and animal life it sustains.  The cultural heritage is normally taken to include not only monuments, buildings and sites of historical, archaeological or architectural merit but also all that we have of value in literature, music and art.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a point in relation to the provision in the Bill regarding sea wrecks.  When one realises that in 1588 alone 25 Armada ships were lost off our coast and that the wrecks of only about half of them have been located one can see the amount of interesting historical material which may be available.  When one considers that valuable items from such wrecks such as guns, coins and so on have found their way abroad it is clear that something must be done to give legal protection to wrecks, control of the exploration of them and the recovery objects from them.  While Deputy Donnellan's Bill goes part of the way towards meeting those requirements it is unsatisfactory in other respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make it unlawful for any person to prospect any wreck within territorial waters other than in accordance with a licence issued by the Commissioners of Public Works but most recent wrecks would not be of historical but rather of commercial interest. The requirement of a licence from the Commissioners of Public Works under the legislation dealing with national monuments seems rather inappropriate. There is a question of ownership involved. It is not clear how a person who recovers objects from a sea wreck which is of archaeological, historical or artistic interest can be required to lodge them in the National Museum if the question of ownership has not first been clarified. The ownership of historical wrecks as matters stand is very unclear.  For instance, the <i>Trinidad Valencera</i> which sank off Glenagivney Bay in County Donegal in 1588 was a Venetian ship impounded by Spain for the Armada. There is said to have been a wealth of angry correspondence at the time between Spain and Venice about this.  In relation to the Armada wrecks off the <Col N="1108" /> Irish coast arguments as to ownership could perhaps be advanced on behalf of the British Government, as successors to the Government in Ireland of Queen Elizabeth I functioning at the time.  The Irish Government, on the same basis, the Spanish government, the Italian, Yugoslav or other governments, as successors to the rulers of Venice, Ragusa, or other states from which Spain chartered or requisitioned particular Armada vessels&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is correct about the British.  If that is the case they could claim everything we have.  That sounds amazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the Armada wrecks and moving forward in time to the modern case of the <i>Aud</i> we have a position where the rights of the German and British Governments, and of the underwriters, could be argued. Whether the wreck of the <i>Lusitania</i> would be of interest under national monuments legislation is another matter. The position is that such wrecks or material therefrom failed to be dealt with under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which was designed to deal with wrecks of a strictly commercial rather than historical value, where the receiver of wrecks has to be brought on the scene.  That is unsatisfactory and indicates that new legislation must be set out to resolve this problem in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 5 Deputy Donnellan is proposing to remove a restriction in the existing legislation which provides for historical buildings which are still in use as residences being taken into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works or of a local authority for maintenance as national monuments.  The removal of that restriction might seem desirable but I wonder if existing legal powers have been fully availed of for this purpose and if the full impact of these changes has been considered.  As already mentioned by the Minister of State, we do not have any special legislation equivalent to the Act dealing with historical buildings in force in other <Col N="1109" /> European countries.  However, I do not think that the defect should be remedied by extending the scope of the national monuments legislation.</P>
    <P>The policy hitherto pursued of devoting the national monuments service of the Office of Public Works, and the money allocated to this service, to the protection, preservation and presentation of ancient monuments should obviously, continue.  Indeed, this activity is so important that it would be a retrogade step to dilute further the limited resources available for it.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 gave local authorities power to list buildings which merit preservation and enabled them when planning applications were received to lay down conditions designed to preserve those buildings and their artistic, architectural and historical qualities.  It was found in practice that they did not extend to the interior of such buildings. That defect was remedied in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976.  Furthermore, section 14 of the 1963 Act authorises assistance from local authorities in the form of money or kind or by the provision of services and facilities, including the service of staff, to persons or bodies concerned in the preservation of amenities, including buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  Great houses are among the classes of buildings which are obviously in mind in Deputy Donnellan's Bill.  Other categories such as street scapes, facades, market houses, alms houses, theatres, great halls, churches, railway and canal buildings and a variety of other buildings and groups which form important memorials to historic events or passing industrial, social, cultural or economic phases in our past could also be considered.  If the State is to assist in the preservation of selective examples of these we would need to know more about the effectiveness or otherwise of the existing provisions of the Planning Acts, why they have not been as effective as we would wish, if that is the case, and the extent of the commitment, financial and otherwise, that Deputy Donnellan's <Col N="1110" /> provision might entail.  We also have to guard against the possibility of a person being enabled to have his dwelling maintained by the State simply by having it taken into guardianship under the National Monuments Acts.</P>

      <P>While this may seem a remote possibility the door could be opened to a second and more likely possibility, that the owner of a national monument in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works or of a local authority might try to move into it and might use it as a dwelling.  Several important monuments such as Bunratty Castle, County Clare, the Casino at Marino, Dublin, Trim Castle, County Meath, are monuments in guardianship. Incidentally, the Minister of State in his comments yesterday pointed out that the owners of distinguished houses still occupied as residences have got the benefit of rates relief just as the owner-occupiers of ordinary houses. This relief has tended to be decried by some speakers but it cannot be denied that it was a valuable concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very valuable concession to which the Minister also made passing reference yesterday was the exemption from capital acquisitions tax given in the 1978 Finance Act.  That exemption applied to houses which are shown to be of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, one of the conditions being provision of reasonable facilities for <Col N="1111" /> viewing to members of the public.  I do not think the requirement to allow the public access to those properties was unreasonable. Indeed, some owners had already made a move to put their properties on view to the public.  The owners of many of those properties have displayed a very sensible approach in devising means to provide finance for the upkeep of their houses and have appreciated the assistance and recognition they have got from the Government through the concessions to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I have already touched on the difficulties posed by section 7 of Deputy Donnellan's Bill which deals with objects and seawrecks of archaeological, historical or artistic importance where the question of ownership is by-passed. In this section the Bill refers to objects brought ashore from sea-wrecks stipulating that the Commissioners of Public Works must by order undertake their preservation and ensure their lodgment in the National Museum.  It is not clear how this would be implemented. First, how is the preservation order to be implemented if the Commissioners or their agents are denied access to the objects? The Bill does not propose to give them a right of access to inspect the objects. How are they to ensure that these are lodged with the National Museum since the Bill does not give them power to take possession of the objects nor does it compel the person or persons bringing the objects ashore to lodge them with the National Museum?  If such objects are not lodged with the National Museum the Commissioners of Public Works, and they alone, would be guilty of breaking the law in failing to ensure that the objects were lodged with the National Museum.</P>
    <P>The Bill uses the words &ldquo;objects brought ashore&rdquo;.  If this section were to become law it seems that a simple way of evading it would be not to bring the objects ashore but to dispose of them by boat to foreign interests.  Generally speaking, this provision seems out of place as an amendment of section 8 of the National Monuments Act, 1936, <Col N="1112" /> which deals with the normal preservation orders made for the normal type of monument.  To complicate that important and straightforward provision by the addition of a new provision regarding wrecks is likely to cause confusion in subsequent administration of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan's Bill proposes to raise the level of fines and penalties for failure to report or to incorrectly report finding of archaeological objects and for unlicenced archaeological excavation and generally for breaches of the provisions set out in this Bill.  It would be desirable when this is being done that penalties for all breaches of the National Monuments Act should be proportionate to the particular offence and to each other.  A piecemeal approach will only lead to anomalies where certain offences are subject to high fines and other offences of equal seriousness draw only minimal penalties.  This is another argument in favour of a completely new Act instead of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation of the type here proposed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have apparently felt that by opposing Deputy Donnellan's Bill the Government were implicitly rejecting the contents of the Bill as worthless and of no account.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister in his address yesterday went out of his way to acknowledge that the Deputy had valid and relevant points to make.  Some Deputies expressed the view that the Minister should meet the Deputy to see if the Bill as initiated could be adapted in some way which would make it acceptable to the Government. At least one Deputy referred to specific provisions in Deputy Donnellan's Bill which he would like to see incorporated in the Government's Bill when it is introduced.  In regard to all these points I repeat that the Government, in opposing the Deputy's Bill, are not saying that each and every section of the Bill is rejected in principle.  What they are saying is that they will bring in their own Bill which will cover those parts of Deputy Donnellan's Bill which they agree should be implemented although they may do so in a different <Col N="1113" /> way which will at the same time deal with other aspects of the detection and preservation of our national monuments which they feel are due for revision.</P>
    <P>I speak about this Bill which, although it has many good points, is apparently not completely correct and which the Government would hope to improve on in its own Bill, I wish to say that in the future when this legislation is brought in we will be in a position, when a site like the Wood Quay site in Dublin is being excavated, to realise in time the value of the site and we will be prepared and ready to preserve it which at that point in time we were not ready to do.  Had we been further advanced in our technology and scientific research we might have been in a better position to preserve the Viking site at Wood Quay.  As it was, as soon as it was excavated and the various wooden and wattle parts of the site uncovered we had no way of preserving them.</P>
    <P>On the continent I believe they have spent a considerable amount of money and are not yet fully aware of how to preserve this type of wooden structure found on Viking sites.  They are spending vast sums of money on scientific research.  I hope that in the next decade or two when another site like Wood Quay has been discovered&mdash;I am quite certain one will be discovered, because once there is one in that vicinity there must be others&mdash;then, by new legislation, we will be in a better position to deal with the site in time, preserve it and have it for our people.</P>
    <P>When I recently visited the site in Wood Quay I felt very sad that what I had the privilege of seeing could not be shown to the people in general, Everything there was very interesting. We saw the whole layout and structure of houses built in the year 900, with the hearth in the middle of the room, the walls and the stone steps at the doors.  It would have been wonderful to have been able to preserve that site for future generations.  We are not in a position to do that now.  We have not the technology or the money and we are not <Col N="1114" /> really ready to undertake such an excavation.</P>
    <P>I am quite confident that in the basement of the new civic offices we will have a wonderful museum and we will have every type of artefact which we have found on display there.  I believe that will be an extremely interesting museum for the people not only of Dublin and of Ireland but of the world. We all know that national monuments, national buildings, architecture and archaeological finds are an attraction for tourists.  People from all over the world come to see those things and they are interested in them.  They are part of our history and part of people's lives.  I have never seen anything so interesting as our national monuments at Knowth and Douth.  They are full of history and give one a sense of pride in our culture.  When we visit those national monuments it makes us feel that we belong to a country with a wonderful heritage and very old treasures.  Some of the people who lived in those times were probably more advanced than we are today.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government will be able to bring in this Bill in the very near future.  I hope the Minister will be able to incorporate provisions in that Bill that will ensure that any further excavation which takes place will be fully protected, that every facility possible will be provided so that the people carrying out the excavation work will have the right amount of time for the excavation and that everything will be done in a proper way.  We all look forward to that Bill coming in the next session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We are surrounded today by plastic, shoddy goods, shoddy buildings and concrete and cement.  It is extremely important for our people and our cities and towns to be surrounded with something which adds a little to our environment and our way of life.  A lot of our surroundings are soul destroying at the moment. They cause vandalism, social problems and distress.  People need a nice environment around them, they need culture and they need to feel they come from a long line of ancient history. They need to feel important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> I hope that in the future we will avail of every opportunity to preserve every bit we possibly can of our heritage.  We see coaches every morning outside the National Museum bringing children to see the beautiful art treasures.  The people who see them have a great pride in looking at those beautiful objects. Ireland was known as the Island of Saints and Scholars centuries ago and the people who lived then brought fame and culture all over the world.  Every individual in the country should be very concerned about what we have and make sure that every bit of it will be preserved.</P>
    <P>I know that when the new Bill is brought before the House the Minister will take all those points into consideration. The new Bill will safeguard what we have for ourselves.  There is nothing so sad as to see treasures leaving the country and being lost.  As Deputy Bruton said earlier, they are probably sold back to us at exorbitant prices, whereas they were ours in the first place and should never have left the country.  I hope it will not be too long before we see the new Bill on the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>May I take this opportunity to express thanks to the Office of Public Works for the manner in which they had their arrangements completed, in co-operation with Offaly County Council, for the visit of his Holiness, Pope John Paul II, to Clonmacnoise. Clonmacnoise, which is situated in my constituency, is one of the greatest sources of national interest to us but also has had worldwide recognition. After the Holy Father returned to Rome, he referred on more than one occasion to his visit to Clonmacnoise, which left a very lasting impression on him.  I want to express my sincere thanks for the high standard of efficiency of the arrangements for the Papal visit to Clonmacnoise. We are all extremely proud of Clonmacnoise because it brings to the modern period in which we live the great tradition and history of the past.</P>
      <P>I am glad that this Bill, the National Heritage Bill, 1980, has been introduced, because certainly it has focussed attention and brought contributions from all sides of this House on the importance of our architectural, archaeological and artistic heritage.  If it were not for this Bill coming before the House I doubt if the serious contributions in relation to this matter could possibly have been made.  I am aware that at present the Council of Europe are directing very great attention to the very problems covered in this Bill. I would like to express thanks and appreciation for the great and continuing interest which the Council of Europe have shown in the excavation works at Wood Quay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to our architectural heritage I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding work which has been performed which is of interest to this country and every other member state of the Council of Europe.  I pay tribute especially to the outstanding contribution made by Lord Duncan Sandys of the UK in relation to this matter.  We could not be discussing anything more important than the preparation of legislation to cover each of the problems that will arise in regard to this.  If we are going to deal with these problems let us not leave our <Col N="1117" /> notes on the shelves of the OPW to become covered with dust and surrounded by cobwebs.  Too long we have been waiting for legislation to deal with under-water archaeology, with our architectural heritage and its preservation, and separately with preservation. To link up with preservation we need a new authority to deal with museums and county museums, and more and greater powers must be granted to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister of State that during the summer recess he would take one week off and visit the city of York where I am sure Mr. Addyman, who is in charge of the excavation work in that city, will be only too pleased to extend his very generous hospitality to him and let him see the vast amount of work which has been undertaken by way both of excavation and preservation whereby the old buildings of the 16th century are now habitable.  A visit to that city would reinforce the interest of the Minister of State in seeing that some very progressive and practical steps would be taken here in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to under-water archaeology, let us be very frank and honest and say that nothing has been done in relation to this matter in this country.  I am informed reliably by experts that the world's most valuable treasures are under the Mediterranean, but next to those are the treasures around the coast of Ireland from Killybegs to Galway Bay, from Galway Bay around to Bantry and from Bantry right across to the Wexford coast.  The Spanish Armada was wrecked off our coast in 1580 and a certain amount of attention is being paid to diving for the purpose of locating part and parcel of anything connected with the Spanish Armada. That action should be proceeded with, and with the least possible delay.  I doubt whether the finances of this country will ever enable us to have sufficient funds to carry out a proper investigation in regard to under-water archaeology, but if sufficient pressure is put on the Government at European level or even at national level I have no <Col N="1118" /> doubt that steps will be taken to have substantial funds made available to ensure that the treasures which are under water will be brought to the surface and will become the property of this State.</P>
    <P>If the Minister proposes to introduce legislation as he says he will, let him accept this Bill as a first instalment and at least let something be on the Statute Book.  At a later stage when he introduces his Bill, let him deal fully, after the fullest consultation with the experts and others, in the order of priority with our architectural heritage which is vital. Some valuable work has been done but an immense amount of work even in this city still remains to be done to cover all aspects of our architectural heritage and to deal with what has been discovered, with new areas for excavation and with methods of excavation.  There is the problem of metal detectors and other devices which are covered under this Bill.  Special concern should be given to the old question of preservation.  First we must have preservation plans.  We must know what we are going to preserve.  I was amazed recently when a constituent of mine, a known and respected citizen of my town, sent for me and said, &ldquo;There are not very many members of my family left but I would like to leave the house in which I was born, which is the last and only house in that town which goes back to the year 1780&rdquo;.  He was anxious that it should be preserved. It is in reasonably good condition. Nobody has been living in it for many years.  Nevertheless it will show future generations what a house was like&mdash;small, neat, single-storey, whitewashed cottages in which very large families were reared and housed.  It is great that we have such a display of interest.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to national monuments, tombstones, burial places and other memorials.  The Office of Public Works know of my concern about these over a long number of years. It is extremely easy to neglect this part of our cultural heritage which is an important indication of native tradition, history and religion.  We cannot estimate <Col N="1119" /> the importance of tradition, and arrangements should be made for future support by local authorities in preserving such memorials of historical interest.  There should be no neglect in so far as the preservation of these places is concerned, otherwise we shall be charged by future generations with this neglect.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have a responsibility in that regard should ensure the best possible legislation.  In that connection, I make very special reference to the fact that the Republic is one of the few countries in Europe without what is known as a heritage group, a group of Members of Parliament of all parties who, in their own leisure, come together for the purpose of discussing problems such as we are discussing in this Bill.  I recently raised this matter with Deputy Jim Leonard and understand that he will undertake to solicit support from other Members of this House of his own Party.  I am sure that, among the Fine Gael and Labour Party members, there are Deputies who would be prepared to band themselves together into a parliamentary heritage group so that our views on matters of this kind can be discussed, irrespective of political views and these views transmitted, either as an expression of opinion to the Council of Europe or the Minister of State with a view to the formulation of legislation under consideration at the moment.</P>
    <P>In many countries the responsibility for this work is distributed vaguely between several State Departments, and that is what is wrong in this country. What is everybody's business is nobody's business.  We have the Department of Education, the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Environment, we have local authorities and church authorities.  We have all these authorities involved in this very meritorious work, but no-one has responsibility.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister of State has ever had the pleasure of visiting the Slieve Bloom mountain area.  This mountain area in the midlands has many different aspects of history and heritage.  It has been shown to have been an area of great importance in the stone, iron and bronze age.  It has clearly given evidence of its importance in early Christian and medieval times.  Part of this great mountain is under afforestation, so the Department of Forestry comes into the picture.  Work is in progress in many parts of the mountain and there is a grave danger that some of the old rocks and historic areas will be covered over by afforestation, if caution is not used. For this reason, I am glad that the Minister for Forestry is here.  He, as a teacher and as the person with primary responsibility for forestry matters, will be able to direct the serious attention of the Department of Forestry to the important evidence discovered of early Christian and medieval times in the Slieve Bloom mountains, with its beautiful streams.</P>

      <P>This area has some of Europe's precious archaeological remains and it is to be hoped that, with the co-operation of the Department of Forestry and the Office of Public Works, someone, by some means, will be given the responsibility for dealing with one of the most historic areas in all Europe.  A great unattended wealth of history and heritage lies here. It has been seriously neglected and unless we have legislation dealing with the problem, the neglect may go on in future generations.  National boards with full powers should be appointed for the preservation of these historic areas. These boards should contain representatives of local authorities and of bodies of national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always believed that our language also is of vital importance to our cultural heritage.  It helps us to disclose our identity as a nation.  Attention <Col N="1121" /> should be drawn to the artistic and historic significance of many memorials to individuals and to events throughout this country, especially those which do not form a protective part of a building, a ruin or an archaeological site.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the number of memorials which are disappearing without proper record or control as a result of new development, through simple neglect and through the work of vandals. No-one has the authority to prevent damage by vandals to these memorials. An interest is now being shown by many people in this House and throughout the country and efforts are being made by religious authorities, with the means available to them, but we need the support of the Council of Europe and, if necessary, the European Community, along with the resources we can afford, to ensure that this important aspect of our heritage is not forgotten.</P>
    <P>The primary role of local authorities should be recognised and closer coordination between all the Departments already referred to is most desirable.  Our memorials should, at least, be recorded, and no steps have been taken in the past in that regard.  Memorials to statesmen, victories, battles, location markers, important milestones, boundary stones markers of major events, be they floods, fires or other events of extreme importance, historical or otherwise, should be marked.</P>

      <P>On 10 June I asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he would outline the purpose of his recent visit to County Donegal and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The Minister answered the question and made a statement, the substance of which was that he went to Donegal primarily to attend a Fianna Fáil dinner dance in the town of Malin and that during that visit he took time off to visit certain harbours and piers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> The Minister for Fisheries went to Donegal but ignored the plight of Donegal fishermen, men who fish the Foyle estuary, the driftnet and draftnet fishermen with many and varied problems, the most recent being the salmon levy.  There were many things about which they wanted to talk to the Minister for Fisheries.  There are fulltime fishermen whose families are entirely dependent on the fishing industry, who have invested large sums of money on the purchase of boats.  There are other men who work part-time but their need to supplement their already small income is of such absolute importance that they also must get a fair and square deal from the Minister and from the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell the House of the continuous problem obtaining in the Foyle Estuary, indeed in the deep water off the mouth of Lough Foyle, the two lines drawn northwards from Inishowen Head and a median line dividing the Foyle from the Northern Ireland Fisheries Authority&mdash;something that has never been properly determined, something in respect of which the fishermen have never been told exactly what is the position, something which hinders their normal fishing operations during fishing hours; indeed in dangerous waters, of being intercepted by British naval vessels and being told that they are now over the median line because, when they are drift netting the tide takes them in that direction.  That is the problem that has bedevilled fishermen for generations.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister for Fisheries, appointed last December, saw fit to go to Donegal to attend a Fianna Fáil dinner-dance in the village of Malin without recognising his responsibility to the men who use those waters, whose families depend on their income for a livelihood. Not alone did the Minister ignore them but he treated their problems with utter and total contempt, something about which I protest in the strongest possible terms.  It is not acceptable, nor is it good enough that a Minister should use public moneys to attend a party political function&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Chair telling me that I am not entitled to question the cost of the Minister's travel to County Donegal?  I am not interested in what happened inside the hotel; I am not in the slightest interested in that.  I am interested in the affairs of the fishermen in County Donegal, not alone those of the Greencastle fishermen.</P>
      <P>To give the House an idea of how disinterested and uniformed is the Minister, when I asked had he not visited the Foyle Fisheries Commission in Derry, the headquarters of a commission with a cross-Border dimension unique not alone in Ireland but in Europe, charged with the prime responsibility of controlling the fishing industry across the Border in Northern Ireland and within the State, I discovered that he did not consider it worth his while to pay them a courtesy visit or to consult with them on their problems.  Indeed that was an insult to the staff of that office, that their boss would not pay them the courtesy of a visit or recognise the fact that they were there.</P>
      <P>For the life of me I do not see why I should be told that I cannot refer to a private visit of the Minister.  The Minister has been spending public moneys.  When I asked the Minister why he had not done this he replied:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> Had I visited the Foyle Fishery I have no doubt the Deputy would have asked me why I did not find time to visit Greencastle.</P>
    <P>The Minister is subconsciously telling me that there is a difference between the fishermen who fish Greencastle Harbour and the Foyle fisheries about which I am talking.  I do not understand the reply the Minister gave me.  Perhaps it was given in the heat of the moment, an off-the-cuff remark but I want to tell him that the headquarters of fishermen who use Greencastle Harbour are at the Foyle Fisheries Commission, Victoria Road, Derry and the general secretary or any of his staff would have informed the Minister of the many problems the fishermen would have liked to discuss with him.  I am at present dealing exclusively with the problems of the driftnet fishermen off Greencastle.  God knows they have been fooled long enough by having Ministers of Governments visit them, by Governments telling them this, that and the other.  Any time I speak to them I must make allowances for the strong language they use.  Were I one of them I would be using equally strong language to protest about the way they are being ignored.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recent cross-Border study, I had a parliamentary question in the House last Thursday, 12 June 1980 asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he would confirm if an application had been made for a grant from the European Regional Development Fund for Greencastle Harbour development; if he would make a statement in that regard in relation to development as outlined in the cross-Border study dealing with the Derry-Donegal area&mdash;the Minister in his reply, which I had to accept by way of written reply, told me that a submission had not yet been made.  In his reply the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Approval has been given for the carrying out of the second stage of the development programme at Greencastle Harbour at an estimated cost of £1.12 million.  The scheme will include the extension of the existing pier and the construction of a new pier to <Col N="1125" /> provide additional berthage accommodation, deepening of the existing berthage area, reclamation of an area of 8,250 square yards and the provision of an auction hall and other ancillary facilities.  It is estimated that the works will take about four years to complete.  Contract documents are at present being prepared for county council approval prior to going to tender.</P>
    <P>That cross-Border communications study was initiated by Deputy Garret FitzGerald when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It was presented to the present Government in the autumn of 1977, almost three years ago.  Repeatedly I have endeavoured to ascertain the amount of money being spent on Greencastle Harbour.  Yet now, after three years, we are told that no such application is with the EEC Regional Fund in Europe.  Did the Minister not consider it worth his while to go and talk to the fishermen at Greencastle about the expenditure of almost £1.12 million?  Did the Minister not consider it worth his while to go and talk about such development with the fishermen?  Did he not consider it worth his while being briefed on the fishing industry in County Donegal before going there?  I have nothing personal against the Minister.  I want to place this clearly on record. From the first day I met him we have always enjoyed a very friendly relationship.  I have always respected him as being an affable, friendly individual. I do not want that to change, but I must say that in dealing with constituency matters as grave as those about which I am now speaking I am led to believe either that the Minister has no interest in his job or that he is not fit for the work assigned to him.  There are many draftnet fishermen from Greencastle to Porthall who would have liked to ask him certain questions, but he did not tell them he was going to Donegal.  The only people he met were members of the Fianna Fáil cumann.  They heard on the grapevine that he would be attending a private function I am not allowed mention here tonight.</P>
    <P>If the Minister met any fishermen it <Col N="1126" /> was in their capacity as Fianna Fáil supporters. There is nothing dishonourable about that.  It is only right that a fisherman who is a Fianna Fáil supporter should approach the Minister to discuss these matters.  I applaud them for their actions but the Minister did not officially meet the fishermen's representatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in the Department of Fisheries for almost seven or eight months and to the best of my knowledge he has not yet visited a major fishing port.  I was told last weekend that he had received an invitation from the Killybegs fishermen which was ignored until recently.  He received an invitation from the Killybegs Fianna Fáil Cumann and I am told he will attend a dinner dance there this weekend.  Because I raised this matter here tonight, he will probably talk to the fishermen in Killybegs, but I hope he will visit Burtonport too and spend another day in the area and arrange to meet the fishermen from Greencastle and other ports.</P>
    <P>These are very urgent matters.  They may not be important to many Members of this House, but to the people who fish in the Foyle waters the median line is very aggravating and troublesome and something must be done about it sooner or later.  It is very difficult when fishermen have to keep this imaginary line in mind and at the same time do their work.  It was an insult when the man in charge of fisheries did not meet the fishermen's representatives.</P>
    <P>Falling salmon stocks in the River Foyle should have been dealt with, but so far as the Minister was concerned that was not important.  It was more important for him to attend an enjoyable function at which the crowd was so big it was difficult for him to dance, or so he tells me.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister, when visiting a county like Donegal which has a fishing industry with a cross-Border dimension and whose problems have never been resolved, does not pay them the courtesy of discussing their problems and doing something about them.  If he had visited the Foyle Commission he could have discussed the problem of buying secondhand boats from Irish fishermen in Northern Ireland.  It is clear that he is partitionist in his attitude, but he is so different from the rest of the Ministers or the Fianna Fáil Party who continually talk about Irish unity but are partitionist in their attitude.  It is unheard of for any of them to cross the Border into the city of Derry to talk to the people who control the Foyle fisheries.</P>
      <P>The Minister could have discussed the buying of secondhand boats from Northern fishermen, men who the Minister said according to his reply to Deputy White, are not really Irish because they live north of the Border but who fish the water.  The Greencastle and Coleraine fishermen are Irish people who fish the same waters, but the Minister will not allow them to buy and sell second-hand boats.  I would like to develop that point but I promised Deputy White I would give him some time.</P>
      <P>When the Minister next talks to the Taoiseach about making the unity of Ireland a top priority, he should consider the God-given right of the fishermen in Greencastle harbour to fish the waters with the fishermen of Coleraine.  The Minister should not do anything to impede that God-given right.  He is not entitled to do anything that would make it more difficult for these men to fish together.  If they want to buy secondhand boats, the Minister should not object but rather should encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to take politics out of the Department of Fisheries.  I understand he will be attending a function in Killybegs next Saturday.  Has he arranged to meet the salmon fishermen in that area?  Has he consulted the IFO?  Has he consulted the <Col N="1128" /> co-operative movement?  When he is in Donegal it is very important that he meet these different organisations.  His first commitment should be to look after the fishing industry, particularly in a county like Donegal.</P>
      <P>We all got a shock last week when we were told people in southern Ireland would not get loans if they purchased Northern Ireland boats.  Does the Minister realise we are training young Northern boys as skippers in Greencastle and that the State is subsidising them?  How does he intend to operate this new levy as far as Greencastle is concerned?  A great deal of the salmon coming into that port will come from Northern Ireland.  Does this mean Greencastle fishermen can bring their salmon to Northern Ireland and that they will not have to pay the 10 per cent levy?  These are very important points the Minister should answer.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that in these critical times the Minister is not visiting the Donegal ports which are badly in need of developing.  We badly need an auction hall in Killybegs.  For years we have been hearing that this or that project was sanctioned and that the money would be available shortly.  I would like to know when this money will be spent.  When will these buildings be erected?  I intended naming 12 different Donegal ports which are in need of urgent development.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to cut out the Fianna Fáil dinner dances in Donegal and go around the county and see the bad state of these ports.  Deputy Power is Minister for Fisheries and we are all relying on him.</P>

      <P>At first glance I could be impressed by the interest Deputy Harte has shown in my trip to Donegal on 9 and 10 May last.  I should like to compliment him and Deputy White on their remarks.  They seemed to be very impressed by my trip and perhaps the greatest tribute which could be paid to me is the fact that Deputy Harte persuaded the present leader of Fine Gael to <Col N="1129" /> enter for the Inishowen One Hundred and partake in the same pilgrimage last week in which I partook in May.  Possibly I could look upon my visit to Donegal as a trend-setting trip and perhaps Deputy Harte could now persuade former Coalition Ministers for Fisheries and Parliamentary Secretaries who had a responsibility for fisheries to remedy their neglect and acquaint themselves with the problems of Inishowen and the fishermen of the Foyle and the Swilly.  The pity is that no one thought that exercise was worthwhile when the Coalition were in power.</P>
      <P>I want to give the House the full picture of my itinerary in Donegal and I will outline some things that are facts, not fiction.  On Friday, 9 May we had a Government meeting and I had lunch in Dublin.  I set sail for Donegal and arrived in Lifford about 5.30 p.m. where I met Senators McGowan and McGlinchey and Deputy Hugh Conaghan.  The Deputy had arranged my trip and planned the itinerary and he felt that even though the main purpose of my visit was to attend a Fianna Fáil dinner dance in Malin I should avail of the opportunity of meeting local fishermen and acquainting myself with their problems.  Deputy Conaghan was kind enough to accompany me, as were some county councillors.  Accordingly, we visited Greencastle pier where I spoke to the fishermen, discussed the very problems which Deputy Harte has raised, spoke to the manager of the co-operative and asked them to make submissions of possible solutions to their problems.  These matters are now being pursued.  I did not hear any strong language from them.  They were quite ordinary, nice, courteous people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then visited Greencastle Fishery School and saw the installations and classrooms.  I got a very full briefing from the director there and was much impressed.  Despite the late hour we visited Culdaff and Bunagee pier and met the fishermen and discussed their problems, including the problem of the median line which is peculiar to the <Col N="1130" /> Foyle Estuary.  I did not ask them what party politics they were interested in but I have an idea that it would be hard to speak to any group of people there which would not include a majority of Fianna Fáil supporters.  I cannot help that.  Maybe these were not proper fishermen.  Maybe I should go back to a man I meet there called &ldquo;Tiger&rdquo; who was born in Inishtrahull and tell him that Deputy Harte does not consider him a proper representative of what fishing people should be.</P>
    <P>At 10 p.m. we arrived at Malin Head and had a very enjoyable meal and dance.  I felt that at 10 p.m.  I could possibly consider myself off duty and deserving of some convivial social company. As I mentioned before, only the very big crowd affected our ability to do a few fancy steps on the floor, but still it was quite nice.  During the night I had occasion to sing a few songs and among them I sang &ldquo;Four Green Fields&rdquo; which appeared to be very well received by the people there.  I got the distinct impression that they would not have considered me a &ldquo;partitionist Minister&rdquo; as Deputy Harte would consider me to be and as reported in the Official Report of 10 June, volume 322, column 31.  When we talk about partition of the Foyle and of this country, I must remind Deputy Harte that the party he represents are the party who put that partition there. They are the party who sold out this country and agreed on an oath of allegiance to a foreign king.  They agreed on the payment of annuities; they agreed that the very ports we are talking about should be retained in the hands of other people.</P>

      <P>These facts cannot be hidden when partition is talked about. These problems were not solved until Fianna Fáil took office.  We are the party who will solve problems and the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, is the man who will solve the final problem in this country.  I can understand the Deputy's reaction because these <Col N="1131" /> are bitter facts.  The changing of the name of his party from Cumann na nGaedheal to Fine Gael will not change that.  The fact that he is wearing his green coat tonight will not hide the fact that his blue shirt is underneath it.  These are facts the Deputy must remember and understand.  I refer him to a little song from Donegal &ldquo;When you think of emigration, won't you pray for Noreen Bawn&rdquo;; when the people of this country think of partition they think of Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>My predecessor as Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Lenihan, visited Derry on 19 July 1978.  Perhaps Deputy Harte could inform us if a Coalition Minister ever visited Derry in that capacity.  I keep myself acquainted with the workings of the Foyle Commission. The Assistant Secretary in my Department, Mr. Jimmy Power, is the chairman of that commission and Mr. Jack <Col N="1132" /> O'Connell is also a member of the commission. We have two representatives and Northern Ireland also have two.  If God spares me I will visit Derry when I get time but I will be the judge of that and I will not allow Deputy Harte to be the judge of it.  I am sure he can appreciate that when his party in Government were not in a position to persuade his own Minister to go there he can hardly expect me to be influenced by that.</P>
      <P>On Friday night I will be attending the dinner dance in Killybegs but I am sorry I cannot get Deputy Harte a ticket because they are completely sold out. When this matter was first raised in the Dáil I got the impression that Deputy Harte was carried away and I forgave his lack of logic and lack of truth because of his blustering behaviour.

      <P>They were not curtailed in any way and had a free hand to develop and invest in the fishing industry and they have failed the driftnet and the draftnet fishermen from Greencastle to Porthall.  The Commission's further existence makes little sense and any new government of which I am a member will severely scrutinise and fully investigate their affairs.</P>

The most recent acquisition was that from Mr. John McShain and included Mr. McShain's interest in the Middle and Lower Lakes.  The lands acquired adjoin the lakes and are an extension of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, comprising about 10,500 acres, which was donated to the State in 1932 by Mr. and Mrs. Bowers Bourn and Senator Arthur Vincent for management as a national park.  The additional areas were acquired to extend the park and thus conserve the natural features and beauty of the area and prevent unsuitable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Killarney, as elsewhere, the commissioners from time to time purchase properties for the purpose of providing accommodation for state employees and other State purposes.  At present they are considering the purchase of a property for the erection of a Garda station and a <Col N="994" /> maintenance garage for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>The National Manpower Service are currently contacting employers, including those who notified them of vacancies for skilled technological personnel last year.  When this exercise has been completed the service will assess whether the level of demand is sufficient to justify another recruitment campaign abroad and will consult with AnCO and the IDA, to determine the key worker occupations to attract the special resettlement grants and allowances which were a feature of the successful 1979 campaign.</P>
      <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee have already recommended a further recruitment campaign abroad to be undertaken in the autumn subject to the vacancies being notified in sufficient numbers to the National Manpower Service before that date.  The campaign abroad will be supplemented this year by an advertising campaign at Irish ports directed at skilled workers coming here as tourists.</P>
      <P>Of course, the supply of skilled technological workers will also be enhanced by the increase effected in the output from third level education resulting from the Manpower Education Programme launched last year. Altogether the programme is expected to give rise to an output of nearly 350 highly qualified technical workers this year.  Over 200 of these will be from the special post-graduate courses introduced for the first time last year with a view to conferring relevant skills and knowledge in the short supply occupations on graduates or diploma holders from appropriate related courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time AnCO are continuing to promote apprentice opportunities in both private and public sector employments.  The present level of apprentices registered with AnCO totals <Col N="996" /> 19,300 and represents an increase of nearly 3,000 in the past two years.  In the coming year many of the skilled crafts will benefit from a two-year output as apprentices who followed the old five-year apprentice system and those following the new four-year system introduced in 1976 complete their final years.</P>
    <P>In the last year AnCO enouraged employers to take on toolmaker and fitter apprentices over and above their own needs to provide for new industrial development by using any spare capacity to take one or two extra apprentices or by the development of in-company training programmes for larger numbers of extra apprentices.  AnCO will support the full cost of training these apprentices in the first year and 50 per cent in the second year and the IDA are also providing capital grants for in-company training facilities in specific cases.  Lapple Ireland Ltd. of Carlow who have developed a school for toolmaking apprentices are the first firm to benefit from this.</P>

      <P>In my reply I stated that there were unavoidable delays in the preparation and auditing of the accounts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1978. That statement was correct as the accounts had not been prepared and audited until 31st December, 1979.  Following the signing of the auditors report the accounts had to be cleared with my Department and the Department of Finance before the report and accounts could be sent for printing.</P>

      <P>A total of 6,800 people were employed directly by Aer Lingus on 1 January 1980.  Many of these have varying degrees of involvement in ancillary activities in addition to air transport activities. The company's maintenance personnel, for example, are also involved in the maintenance of aircraft for other airlines as an ancillary activity, but none of this staff could be regarded as being devoted solely to ancillary activities. Taking the amount of work in each area of the company's operations devoted to ancillary activities and applying this figure to the work force in the area concerned, Aer Lingus estimate at 1,600 the number of their staff involved in ancillary activities.</P>
      <P>The above figures do not include personnel recruited and employed by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Aer Lingus at home and abroad.  There were approximately 7,080 persons in these enterprises on 1 January 1980, 240 at home and 6,840 abroad.</P>
