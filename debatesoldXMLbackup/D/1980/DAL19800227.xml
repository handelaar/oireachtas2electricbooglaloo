      <P>Yes.  I recognise the right of the House to be informed on something of this nature in one of our major State companies.  I want to inform the House that there is a situation there, in the Sugar Company, Comhlucht Siúicré Éireann, which is being investigated both by the company themselves and by the Garda authorities. However, I want to suggest to the House that any sort of debate or discussion on it at this stage might not be desirable in view of the fact that Garda inquiries are under way.  Perhaps the House will accept my suggestion that it be left at that at present and as soon as information is available it will be made available to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 13, to delete &ldquo;Safety in Industry&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Safety at Work&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage this Bill is too <Col N="580" /> restrictive as there are thousands of workers who are covered by no legislation whatever as regards safety and health at work.  Office workers are covered by the Office Premises Act, 1958, which is years out of date.  The specific purpose of this amendment is to cover agricultural workers.  At present, unlike other EEC countries, they are covered by no legislation.  We are all aware of the dramatic increase in farm mechanisation in recent years.  In some areas farms are using as much sophisticated and dangerous equipment as are particular industries.  There has been a dramatic increase in the use of fertilisers, chemicals and other potentially dangerous substances on farms and we have the continuing problems of farmers lung and brucellosis.  It is ludicrous that in this day and age we do not have detailed safety and health legislation to protect farm workers.</P>
    <P>Some people might argue this should be an issue for the Minister for Agriculture.  I strongly contend that it is essentially a matter for the Minister for Labour.  The Minister for Agriculture is concerned with agricultural policy and the development of agriculture.  Working conditions and, in particular, protective legislation relating to working conditions must be the concern of the Minister for Labour for all, including agricultural workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Ryan said.  It is no harm to recap what we and Deputy Ryan and his colleagues said about this Bill.  It is an incomplete Bill in so far as it does not cover all work places.  I should like to talk about amendment No. 10a as we are taking amendment No. 1 with other amendments. Amendment No. 10a seeks to extend the scope of the Bill to:</P>
      <P>any premises or land in or on which people are employed in work of an agricultural or horticultural nature including fishfarms and the employees are not members of the owner's family. </P>
      <P>That is fully in line with what Deputy Ryan has said.  It also seeks to cover:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> any premises which apart from this subsection is not a factory, in which a computer is operated, or in which machines or machinery ancillary to the working of an office are operated. </P>
    <P>I know a little about computers and they would normally be covered by the Office Premises Act but when that Act was passed computers were almost unheard of.  They are very noisy and have not only an audio impact but a nerve impact as well.  In the amendment it is proposed specifically to cover computers and other noisy office machinery.</P>
    <P>It also seeks to cover any enclosed place of entertainment in which sound reproducing equipment is operating. There are many people working in discos who are subjected night in and night out to very high decible level which can only be damaging.  It must be damaging for clients of discos but at least they are going there voluntarily.  The concern of this Bill should be to provide for the health of people who work in discos or places of entertainment where there is no control over noise levels.  Noise can be a major factor in affecting hearing, the nerves and attitudes to work.</P>
    <P>The amendment also seeks to cover any kitchen or other place in which food is prepared apart from a domestic kitchen in a private house.  Many accidents occur in kitchens in restaurants, canteens and hotels.  This is an area in which the Bill is dificient.  I wish also to extend the Bill to cover any sewage plant, sewer, pipeline or manhole.  I am a member of the city council and a former Lord Mayor of Dublin and I have been approached by a number of workers about this problem.  There is no legal protection that I know of for local authority workers working in sewers.  I understand that they go down sewers without safety harnesses or any legal protection against possible gases.  There is a paragraph which would give the Minister, by regulation, power to extend the scope if other such areas arose.</P>
    <P>The incompleteness of the Bill is evidenced by the Minister's vast number of amendments.  I urge the Minister to accept the change in title and other <Col N="582" /> amendments proposed by Deputy Ryan and to accept the addenda to the Bill.</P>

When replying to that debate, I explained to the House that all-embracing legislation of the kind proposed by the Deputies would entail a considerable amount of prior research and examination.  The Deputies, at the time, seemed in agreement with this point and mentioned periods of three to four years.  I did say at the time that, as Minister of Labour with responsibility in the area of industrial safety, it would not be justifiable for me to wait that long when there are immediate improvements which could and should be made to the 1955 Factories Act.  It is in the belief that such improvements should not be delayed that the Safety in Industry Bill is now before the House.  It is thus a measure which has a very specific, although rather narrow, purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, however, I did make it clear that I was aware of the desirability of having a more global examination of the general area of safety. It was with that in mind that I announced to the House my intention of setting up a working party to give consideration to the question of safety in a broader context than that of industry alone.  I have since repeated that assurance to the House on a number of occasions, the last being in response to a parliamentary questions last year from Deputy O'Connell. I propose to make arrangements for the establishment of the working party in the near future.  I have written to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers in this connection, informing them that this is my intention and that I am presently considering terms of reference and have invited them along for any necessary discussions they would like to have regarding this review body.  Now that we are on Committee Stage in the House, I felt that some time had elapsed and that it was desirable that this working party should be got under way as soon as <Col N="583" /> possible and the composition and the terms of reference explored.</P>
    <P>The working party will be representative of the interests concerned.  Needless to say, I shall invite the Departments of Agriculture and of Fisheries and Forestry to make a contribution.  It would be possible for the question of the suitability of existing safety legislation for types of work other than industry to be examined, as well as the feasibility of enforcing it outside the context in which it was originally drafted.  The variety of operations, involving mechanical, ground crops, greenhouses, chemical soil treatment, spraying, animal husbandry, protective clothing and so on calls for very detailed examination.  It is only fair to my colleagues in the Department of I understand that about 800 instructors under the aegis of that Department give courses direct to farmers in local areas in which emphasis is placed on safety.</P>
    <P>The agricultural inspectorate comprises various groups which, in addition to giving specialist advice to farmers and operating certain schemes, have an educational wing devoted to the training of young farmers.  The courses involved are given by agricultural colleges and the question of machinery plays a large part in the courses.  Regulations have also been made in the Department of the Environment which make it a legal requirement that all tractors first registered after 1970 be fitted with a safety cab or frame and all tractors, old and new, be similarly fitted from September 1977. While it is, I understand, too soon to quote statistics to show how effective this legislation has been in reducing fatal accidents, I am informed that reports of those who have escaped injuries in tractors fitted with cabs would appear to show that the legislation should remove a major cause of death and serious accidents on farms.</P>
    <P>Some 85 per cent of the average of 29 fatal accidents on farms per year during the five year period 1973 to 1977 were caused by tractors overturning, mainly on public roads, or by other accidents <Col N="584" /> associated with tractors or with machinery.  A further 15 per cent involved other forms such as happenings caused by falls, drownings, suffocation, electrocution, poisoning, attacks by animals and sundry other causes.  It might also be mentioned here that one of the 14 priority items in the resolution adopted by the European Council on 29 June 1978 on an action programme of the European Communities on safety and health at work was to &ldquo;undertake a joint study of the application of the principles of accident prevention and of ergonomics in the design, construction and utilisation of the plant and machinery and promote this application in certain pilot sectors, including agriculture&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A seminar on safety problems in agriculture was organised by the EEC and took place in Denmark in October 1978.  The Department of Agriculture were represented at that seminar.  It may interest the Deputies to know that a working party was established over a year ago in the Department of Forestry to examine safety standards for various forestry operations, with the emphasis on safety, safe methods of working and protective clothing.  The membership of the working party comprises a chairman who is a divisional management inspector, a secretary who is a district inspector and ordinary members who are inspectors&mdash;that is engineers engaged in the civil, mechanical and work study side, in addition to representatives from the personnel side.</P>
    <P>The working party has completed a document on safety relating to chain saw operation.  Recommendations in the document include the wearing of steeltoed boots, ear muffs, face visors, protective clothing and safety precautions to be undertaken.  The working party has found that although this protective clothing is provided it may not be worn by the workers.  The working party is currently preparing a document dealing with safety precautions in general tree-harvesting work.  This work would include work at felling trees, taking trees to roadsides, operating tractors <Col N="585" /> and so on.  The working party is also giving consideration to the question of safety measures in connection with the extraction of timber by tractor.</P>
    <P>Let me make it quite clear that in rejecting these amendments, I am not in any way denying that the safety of agricultural workers is as important as that of workers in other areas.  Their safety is equally important.  What I am saying quite categorically is that this Bill has been conceived for a limited, but nevertheless desirable purpose.  It is not the appropriate vehicle for achieving what the Deputies are seeking here.  Indeed, my intentions with regard to the Bill would probably gave been reflected more accurately had it a short title such as the Factories (Amendment) Bill.  In choosing a short title, however, I wish to have one that would be more positive and more modern than that of the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I assure the Deputies of two things, firstly, that I shall be in touch with the Ministers for Agriculture and for Fisheries and Forestry at the first available opportunity to inform them of what the Deputies have said here today and secondly, to re-iterate that the projected working party on occupational safety and health, to which I referred, will provide an appropriate forum for the important question to be fully examined with the detail and care that it merits.  I have no doubt that the input from the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry in that regard should prove more than useful and helpful.</P>
    <P>Having explained that this Bill is limited for specific reasons, I say that it is extremely important and desirable that it should be proceeded with and that the other areas that I have mentioned can best be covered by the suggestions I have made and particularly by the work of the working party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement on the setting up of a working party to investigate and, we hope, cover all the needs and shortcomings in the Bill as outlined by both Deputy Mitchell <Col N="586" /> and myself in our amendments.  I said on the Second Stage that the scope of the Bill was too limited; it was hasty and ill conceived.  There were as many workers omitted from the coverage of the Bill as were included.  Allowing for the omission of agricultural workers, their safety and so on, I think it is a record when we find that the Minister had as many amendments to this restricted Bill as resulted from the combined efforts of both Opposition spokesmen.  I look forward to the report of the working party in the not too distant future.  I hope it will cover all the needs of the workers in all industries as we face the eighties.  We are becoming more industrialised and our agricultural sector more sophisticated and for that reason the people involved in these industries on the ground are entitled to and must get the Minister's protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reservation I have about the working party is that it could be a long and lingering effort in the case of this legislation, legislation which is badly needed.  The whole point about urgency here does not ring true as the Minister referred to it.  It is at least 18 months since this Bill was tabled and there has been great delay in getting the Committee Stage to the House.  We are told that passing the Bill is a matter of urgency and then we have a working party to examine points raised by Deputy Ryan and myself.  That does not seem to add up.  Other than that, the working party is a step in the right direction. The Minister has accepted the principle that safety legislation should cover all workers at all work places, or at least most of them, and to that extent I welcome it.  It is worth repeating however that the Bill was ill-conceived, as evidenced by the number of amendments&mdash;over 150, I think&mdash;many of them in the name of the Minister.  It is also worth repeating that the Minister did not consult the obvious people such as the Association of Industrial Medical Officers and the Faculty of Occupational Medicine at UCD in the drafting of the Bill.  Therefore, it is legitimate criticism to say that the Bill was just top-of-the-head stuff with not <Col N="587" /> much thought given to it.  This is substantiated by the large number of ministerial amendments and by the Minister's confession now that a working party is necessary to extend the scope of the Bill.  If that is the case&mdash;and we accept that there should be a working party&mdash;how should we proceed with the remaining amendments? I do not wish to waste the time of the House discussing individual amendments which will be successively turned down and referred to the working party. I do not know if we can come to some agreement on this or not.</P>

      <P>I welcome the approach of both Deputies to this important area of safety which has always been of prime concern to me, to my Minister of State and to the Department. I agree there has been a time lag since the Second Stage was before the House and that there is a considerable number of amendments from me and from the Opposition.  Some of the time was used very usefully in consultation with people most concerned in this field, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the FUE. Many of the amendments result from those discussions and others are drafting amendments.  Perhaps we all have a little responsibility for delay.  I remember being very anxious to get this measure on to the Order Paper in the last weeks of the Dáil session before Christmas but Deputy Mitchell did not appear to be enthusiastic.</P>

What we are doing this morning is in the interests of the safety of workers; it is perhaps limited <Col N="588" /> but nevertheless important.  As regards the other amendments, I think as we go through them we can co-operate to the best of our ability so as to speed up this important legislation.

      <P>&ldquo; `functions' includes powers and duties;&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is merely a drafting amendment referring to the regulations.  Its purpose is to insert in the Bill a definition of &ldquo;functions&rdquo; as including powers and duties.  The term &ldquo;functions&rdquo; need not necessarily cover powers and duties in every case but the possibility will exist for powers and/or duties to come within the meaning of &ldquo;functions&rdquo; when appropriate or desirable.  As an example of how the definition could be useful, under ministerial amendments to be moved to sections 36 and 37 the Minister, following consultation with representatives <Col N="589" /> from both sides of industry, will be able to make regulations to add to the functions of safety representatives and safety committees.  Now, by virtue of the definition of &ldquo;functions&rdquo; the Minister could, if necessary, include powers and duties of safety representatives and committees in the regulations also.  It is an amendment which will improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>`safety delegate' has the meaning assigned to it by section 37 (4) (b);&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Again, this is a drafting amendment, the purpose of which is to include in the usual way the definition of &ldquo;prohibition notice&rdquo;, &ldquo;safety committee&rdquo; and &ldquo;safety delegate&rdquo; in this interpretation section.  I think there should be no objection.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; `safety representative' has the meaning assigned to it by section 36 (1);&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is also a drafting amendment.  If the term &ldquo;prohibition notice&rdquo; had been used exclusively in this section the reference to section would have been correct, but now &ldquo;prohibition notice&rdquo; occurs also in paragraph (a) section 55 and for that <Col N="590" /> reason it is now necessary to substitute the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; for &ldquo;section&rdquo;.

      <P>This again is a drafting amendment.  In the Factories Act, 1955, a line or siding is mentioned in section 86 (1) in connection with docks, works, quays and warehouses; in section 88 (1) in connection with building operations; and in section 89 (1) in connection with works of engineering construction.  In paragraph (c) of the definition of &ldquo;specified premises&rdquo; in the Safety in Industry Bill, reference is made only to a line or siding mentioned in sections 86 (1) and 88 (1) of the 1955 Act.  For the sake of consistency, it is now proposed to add a reference to a line or siding mentioned in section 89 (1) of that Act.</P>

      <Col N="591" /> In page 6, line 16, to delete &ldquo;Minister for Health&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Industrial Medical Adviser and the National Industrial Safety Organisation&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I will not press this amendment because of the working party.  It is to substitute &ldquo;the industrial medical adviser&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Minister for Health&rdquo; where he is mentioned in the Bill.  It is not vitally important but it would be an improvement if we specified the industrial medical adviser as the person who would decide the many things referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy's reference to NISO first of all. This is a voluntary educational body founded for the purpose of promoting safety awareness and, I may add, a body for which I have tremendous respect. When it is a matter of consultations about proposed regulations under the Factories Act, the appropriate body to which they are referred for comment, is of course, the Factory Advisory Council which are a statutory body established under section 21 (7) of that Act.  They are representative of both sides of industry. It is the intention that this referral procedure will continue to be used in the case of regulations to be made under the Safety in Industry Bill when enacted.  That is a desirable reference there.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of substituting the industrial medical adviser for the Minister for Health, that was already raised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions during the course of the discussions which took place with both sides.  The reasons for rejecting the substitution were found to be acceptable to congress and I should like to outline them briefly here for the benefit of the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health has overall responsibility for promoting the health of all our citizens.  Therefore, it is only right and proper that he should be consulted when the Minister for Labour proposes to make regulations designed to <Col N="592" /> safeguard the health of certain of those citizens who work in factories.  Secondly, the industrial medical adviser is designated by the Minister for Labour, one of his duties being that of advising the Minister professionally in relation to his functions under the Safety in Industry Acts.  In this connection it goes without saying that the industrial medical adviser would always be consulted as a matter of course when any regulations under the section in question are being made.  This will be done on an administrative basis since the industrial medical adviser would be one of the officers in the Minister's own Department. There would be no need to make provision for consultation in the Bill.  I take it that Deputy Mitchell would accept that explanation.  The point he has made has already been withdrawn by congress.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 25, to insert &ldquo;registered&rdquo; before &ldquo;post&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Section 6 proposes a new subsection. Paragraph (a) of this subsection reads:</P>

      <P>No difficulty has arisen in relation to the provision in the period of over 20 years during which the 1955 Act has been in force.  In the circumstances I do not see any reason to change &ldquo;post&rdquo; to &ldquo;registered post&rdquo;.  It may, in fact, cause difficulties. Registered post, for example, cannot be <Col N="593" /> left with the intended recipient unless a receipt has first been signed for it.  A refusal to sign a receipt would then mean that a summons sent by registered post could not be served.  If I felt there was some merit in it I would consider the Deputy's point but not having experienced any problems with its operation over more than 20 years it is probably more acceptable and could perhaps cause fewer difficulties than if we changed it to registered post.  I suggest to him that &ldquo;post&rdquo; appears to have operated satisfactorily over a long period.  We are taking a second amendment with that and the Deputy may wish to speak on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 12a is to add a further paragraph to the section and reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 32 and 33, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) However in the case of a summons being sent by registered post, a copy of such summons should also be sent by registered post at the same time to all directors.'.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is to get over some of the problems the Minister mentioned.  I do not consider what the Minister has said is really very valid because it would be very easy, with the state of the postal services at the moment, for somebody to deny he received an ordinary letter.  There is no proof that one receives an ordinary letter whereas the very essence of the registered postal service is to have evidence of the receipt of a letter.  If it is not accepted that is evidence that there is something wrong in the situation and would, I hope, prompt the factory inspector to take further action.  The Minister should accept this very minor amendment.  This highlights the fact, on which there has been much comment, that the Department are irrelevant because even minor amendments like this are not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>I know from my own Opposition days the effort I put into legislation and I appreciate the difficulties that Opposition Deputies can <Col N="594" /> have when Bills are before the House.  I would always listen very tolerantly and I would be happy to see the Department looking very closely at any amendments submitted.  I can assure the Deputy that this has happened in this case as well. There are two options at the moment.  It can be posted or it can be left at the actual factory or premises.  It appears to have been adequate.  I will consider that amendment but it may well be creating difficulties that have not been experienced in the present system.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second amendment which the Deputy moved I feel very strongly that he may be introducing difficulties here that would slow down the work of the inspectorate or at times make it impossible for them.  It would mean that copies would have to be sent at the same time to all directors.  What guarantee have we that we have the names of all the directors of any concern? What would happen if we were found not to have such a name or if a change of directors occurred without notification?  It could introduce difficulties not experienced at present.  The service of documents in cases like that has not caused any problems.  But if these amendments are accepted I fear we would be introducing difficulties that do not exist at present and making it more difficult to get these documents across in the proper and regular way.</P>

At the initial stages of the preparation of this Bill a proposal was included to repeal section 68 of the Factories Act to which I have referred on the grounds that it could be considered discriminatory. Through an oversight the projected repeal was not removed from the draft Bill after the enactment of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  The opportunity is now being taken on Committee Stage to correct the oversight so that this protected provision may remain part of the 1955 Act.  Section 14 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, provides that nothing done by the employer in compliance with any requirement of or under (a) the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, (b) the Shops, Conditions and Employment Act, 1938, (c) the Factories Act, 1935, and (d) the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, shall constitute discrimination in contravention of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.

      <P>I move amendment No. 13a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 45, to delete &ldquo;following subsection&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;following subsections&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is a very minor amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15b reads:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1A) Failure to comply with any of the provisions of the foregoing subsection shall be an offence...</P>
      <P>It is not specified that it is an offence although, I suppose, it is implied that it is an offence.  I just want to spell it out there.  If the Minister can assure me that it is not necessary, that it is accepted as being an offence and that there is some penalty, I would be delighted not to press that part of that amendment.  The second part of amendment No. 15b reads:</P>
      <P>(1B) It shall be within the power of the Safety Committee constituted under this Act to fix penalties for the failure of a worker to comply with any reasonable directions on safety matters given by an authorised person and this penalty shall not in any case exceed 1 week's wages in respect of any single offence.'.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This part of the amendment is prompted by my own experience as a one time member of a safety committee.  The fact is that safety committees have no real influence over individual workers.  One of the major shortcomings of the Bill is that there is very little emphasis on the responsibility of the individual to abide by the safety procedures laid down and to use the safety equipment and clothing provided.  One of the major causes of accidents is the non-observance of safety regulations and the refusal to wear safety clothing or use safety equipment.  I would be slow to introduce compulsion where the same results can be achieved by a voluntary effort but I honestly believe that in dealing with human nature we can never get the degree of <Col N="597" /> safety required unless there is an element of compulsion or at least some strong incentive to use safety procedures, safety equipment and safety clothing provided. This paragraph, (1B), as part of amendment No. 15b, would give a certain authority to the safety committees and they would then have a certain relevance.  They would introduce a certain motivation to individuals to live up to their responsibilities to themselves and to each other.  I cannot stress that too much.  We certainly need to impose many obligations and responsibilities in relation to safety and health on employers and trade unions.  But we have under-emphasised the responsibility of the individual worker to himself and his fellow workers.  We should look very hard at how we can encourage and, if necessary, compel more responsibility on the part of workers to themselves and their colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I can reassure the Deputy on the first part of this amendment (1A).  Let me remind him that section 8 of the Bill merely amends section 125 of the Principal Act, that is, the Factories Act referred to this morning. Therefore section 100 (2) of that Act is applicable here whereby it is an offence for persons employed to contravene section 125 of the Act.  The penalties for any such offence which are laid down in section 101 of the Factories Act will be increased by virtue of a provision which I would be proposing for insertion in section 57 (1) of this Bill.  Thus the point raised is already covered and I can give the Deputy the assurance that he has asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second part of that amendment, I am not in a position to accept it because it would amount to giving legislative power to safety committees and it is the Oireachtas which decides on penalties and the courts which then impose those penalties within the limits which the Oireachtas has decided.  I do not deny that accidents, and in some cases fatal accidents, are caused by lack of due regard for safety on the part of persons employed, and many of the points made by the Deputy are relevant, <Col N="598" /> but it is an area where education, encouragement, example, leadership and so on by the safety representative or committee is far more important.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that to have such powers vested in a safety committee could lead to difficult problems in the work place, quite apart from legal problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister's submission is valid.  From my own experience I know that management can and does fine workers for breaches of the safety procedures, just as management has power to fine workers who are late consistently.  I accept that is a good reason not to be late.  There are many places in this city who fine workers who are late more than four times a year. That is very restrictive.  That practice operated where I worked for many years.  I am only suggesting that we have an enabling clause to allow such powers to be transferred to a safety committee. However, my view is that amendments will not be accepted by the Minister and this is just a futile exercise.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that amendments cannot be accepted just for the sake of accepting them.  There are amendments that are not considered desirable.  With reference to this amendment, I wish to say that it is to improve the legal grounds for taking precautions in the circumstances in which I said that an amendment to section 125 of the Factories Act is being made under section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to certain procedures that are operating.  These are voluntary arrangements, not arrangements imposed by the Oireachtas.  It is not desirable that the Oireachtas should confer powers on committees such as this to impose penalties in certain circumstances. Such power could create difficulties and problems on the shop floor.  I suggest to the Deputy that he leaves the imposing to the courts.  The inspectorate are experienced and are fully conversant with operations on the shop floor.  They are competent and capable <Col N="599" /> with regard to investigations after accidents and also with regard to inspection of premises.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage all of us referred to safety committees and their importance. The voluntary arrangements which are in line with our collective bargaining situation are far more desirable than having the Houses of the Oireachtas granting powers to a particular committee to impose penalties on fellow-workers. That would create serious difficulties on the shop floor.  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am not rejecting his amendment just for the sake of respecting it.  I have given this and all the other amendments the fullest consideration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 23, after &ldquo;used&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and failure to provide such safeguards shall be considered as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of an offence&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Section 9(1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be the duty of any person who manufactures, imports or supplies any plant for use at work in a factory or specified premises or in work which is work described in section 87(1) of the Principal Act to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that safeguards to ensure its safe operation have been provided in <Col N="601" /> relation to the plant when it is properly used. </P>
    <P>The Minister may be able to assure us that my amendment is unnecessary but, on the other hand, perhaps it might improve the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have the points raised by the Deputy examined in greater detail between now and Report Stage.  However, I must tell him I have reservations about accommodating either of the points mentioned.  Looking at amendment No. 16a as drafted, it would appear to be in conflict with the terms of section 9(1), where the provision of safeguard has to be ensured so far as is reasonably practicable. Therefore, for the Deputy to suggest that failure to provide safeguards is to be considered as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of an offence does not appear to take into account circumstances where it would not be reasonable and practicable to provide safeguards.</P>
      <P>Another matter which I should mention is that the consequences of the Deputy's amendment would be to change the onus of proof provision in relation to this one offence among all the other offences, both those existing already under the Factories Act and those proposed under the Safety in Industry Bill.  I remain to be wholly convinced that the point at issue would merit a discrepancy of this kind.  Industrial inspectors have not encountered problems with the existing onus of proof provision relating to offences under which the burden of proof does not lie with the defendant to show that he has not committed an offence.  However, I will have the point examined in greater detail between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding amendment 17a, it might be unwise to place such an absolute obligation on the occupier.  After all, it is conceivable that in certain instances the occupier might be genuinely unable to give an inspector the name of the person by whom the plant was sold or otherwise supplied.  That could be the case, for example, where an employer had taken over the factory as a going concern from <Col N="602" /> somebody else or where the plant had been in the factory for some considerable time and it had proved impossible to trace who had supplied it originally.  To constitute as an offence in either such instance the failure to give the name of the supplier would be patently unfair, since the occupier, through no fault of his own, would not be in a position to give that information to the inspector. In other words, I have strong reservations about amendment 16a. Despite that, I am prepared to look at it in greater detail between now and Report Stage.  However, it would be unfair to accept amendment No.17a, proposed by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the Minister's view on the matter I do not see much sense to subsection (6) which reads:</P>
      <P>(6) Where plant is used at work in a factory, in specified premises or in works of engineering construction and a request is made in that behalf by an inspector, the occupier shall give to the inspector the name of the person by whom the plant was sold or otherwise supplied. </P>
      <P>I propose to add &ldquo;and failure to do so shall constitute an offence&rdquo;.  The Minister says that we cannot do that and what he has said just now is advice to anybody not to give inspectors the information and to say, &ldquo;We do not know who supplied it&rdquo;.  That is going to be a very big loophole, especially in view of what the Minister said here in the debate. It is going to be quoted against him by lawyers and suppliers to the factories. Lawyers will advise clients if asked to say that they do not know.  That is the implication of what the Minister has said.  I hope that he will bear in mind what I have said and that he will consider it again on Report Stage.</P>

I am talking about difficulties that may arise in some small number of cases.  The inspectors have always found co-operation from occupiers and obviously also it is in the occupier's interest to give the name of their supplier or manufacturer because very often they may be interested in transferring the responsibility for damages or insurance to the supplier rather than taking it themselves.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 10, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;(1)  It shall be the duty of any person who erects or installs any plant for use at work in any factory or specified premises or in work which is work described in section 87 (1) of the Principal Act, where that article is to be used by persons at work, to ensure, <Col N="605" /> so far as is reasonably practicable, that nothing about the way in which it is erected or installed makes it unsafe or a risk to health when properly used.</P>
    <P>(2)  It shall be the duty of any person who manufactures, imports or supplies any substance for use at work in any factory or specified premises or in work which is work described in section 87 (1) of the Principal Act,</P>
    <P>(a)  to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the substance is safe and without risk to health when properly used,</P>
    <P>(b)  to carry out or arrange for the carrying out of such testing and examination as may be necessary for the performance of the duty imposed on him by paragraph (a),</P>
    <P>(c)  to take such steps as are necessary to ensure that there will be available in connection with the use of the substance at work adequate information about the results of any relevant tests which have been carried out on or in connection with the substance and about any conditions necessary to ensure that it will be safe and without risk to health when properly used.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>The purpose of the first part of this substantial amendment is to place a duty on erectors and installers of any plant to ensure that it is erected or installed safely and is not a danger to workers on the shop floor.  Plant or equipment can be wrongly or dangerously erected or installed in a factory or on a construction site.  The Minister may argue that the employer has a duty to ensure that it is safe and proper for the work force.  In addition to the employer we must ensure that installers adhere to safe practices and do not walk out of a premises or from a factory site leaving everyone at risk.  The second part of the amendment relates to the manufacture, importation and supply of dangerous substances.  We are becoming rapidly industrialised and more and more toxic and dangerous substances are being used in our factories. Most workers and companies have very <Col N="606" /> little information about these substances and are not aware of the potential danger to workers.  Many experts are horrified at the current state of our legislation in relation to this.  This amendment will place a duty on any manufacturer, importer or supplier to ensure that substances are safe and are not a risk to health.  It would oblige them to carry out the necessary tests to ensure their safety and, most importantly, it would oblige them to supply adequate information to the workers.  Many substances are supplied with little information other than the brand name.  I hope the Minister will rectify the situation by accepting this amendment and perhaps he will agree to have this important aspect of the Bill submitted to the working party as this is very important for workers in modern industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments were also put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the course of discussions which took place between Stages of the Bill.  In relation to the proposed definition of the word &ldquo;substance&rdquo; in the amendment between lines 4 and 5 of section 17, it includes &ldquo;any natural or artificial substance whether in solid or liquid form or in the form of gas or vapour.&rdquo;  This definition is so all-embracing that it would include, for example, water, flour and so on.  The acceptance of this amendment would require prior instruction or supervision of an extremely large proportion of the workers covered by the Bill.  It would be a nonsense to place such an onerous requirement on employer-occupiers, no matter how well intentioned the idea behind it might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern for safeguarding the health and safety of workers where intrinsically dangerous substances are concerned.  I sought legal opinion on the best way to deal with the purpose behind these amendments and my advice was that a dangerous substance would have to be mentioned in this Bill as one which the Minister for Labour had declared by order to be dangerous in Part IV of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 and where the <Col N="607" /> Minister for Labour would have made such an order he has more than sufficient powers to make any necessary regulation about the substance.  This in effect renders superfluous any reference to that substance in the Safety in Industry Bill.  I must admit that had I not received that advice I would have approached this in a different way. However, I accept the validity of that advice and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were informed accordingly that they should process their case in this instance in the context of the regulations to be made under the 1972 Act.  The Federation of Irish Chemical Industries advised me that they did not consider this Bill to be the appropriate legislation to deal with this topic and cited the various projected EEC requirements which, in addition to the 1972 Act, deal with dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's request that the working party should look at whether or not this is acceptable, I have no objection to any aspects of safety being looked at by them.</P>

      <P>In relation to the point about imposing duties on persons erecting and installing plant for use in factories, specified premises or in connection with ships described in section 87 (1) of the Factories Act, 1955, the responsibility in that connection should rest with the owner-occupier where the <Col N="608" /> safety of the person employed is concerned. On that basis where plant has been installed or erected the owner-occupier should be satisfied before it is used that it has been installed or erected properly so that when properly used it is neither unsafe nor a risk to health.  I am not disposed to consider a dilution such as that proposed in this amendment.  The responsibility must be pinpointed. Afterwards I could give the Deputy a copy of some of the regulations relating to the training and supervision of persons working with dangerous substances.</P>

      <P>In relation to the erection, I appreciate that the owner has a grave responsibility to ensure that the erection is of a proper standard so that the work force will not be in danger, but the builder should also have to conform to certain standards.  There is a twofold responsibility here, to ensure that while the employer is in control of the factory workers are not in danger and, initially, the builder should have to comply with certain standards and methods of building.  This is very important because the manager or owner of the factory may not have the expertise in relation to construction to know whether his building has been properly constructed or not.</P>

I accept the Deputy's point that certain standards should be adhered to during the course of construction but that would be covered by the construction regulations.  This amendment refers to where an accident occurs after the plant has been erected or installed and it appears to dilute the responsibility where the responsibility should rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the owner-occupier.</P>

Before the Bill was circulated the definition of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; in section 2 was broadened to include &ldquo;machine, plant, equipment or appliance, or any part thereof.&rdquo;  Such words, therefore, should have been deleted from sections 10 and 40 since the word &ldquo;plant&rdquo; which encompasses all of them occurs in those sections.  The relevant deletions were not effected and the amendments are designed to rectify the error.  In addition the opportunity is being taken to insert a reference in section 40 to &ldquo;process&rdquo; in two appropriate places in subsection (6) with beneficial effect to the scope of that subsection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase which it is proposed to delete weakens the subsection.  There are many loopholes in this Bill where it is provided that an action might be taken by the Minister in certain circumstances.  An <Col N="610" /> earlier subsection provides that an employer &ldquo;shall&rdquo; tell the Minister, but if he does not there is no penalty and he does not commit an offence.  I shall not press this amendment but perhaps the Minister would consider it.</P>

      <P>I have considered this but I am not disposed to agree to the deletion of this phrase, which I believe to be a prudent qualification.  It could, for example, be so self-evident that the accident or dangerous occurrence was caused by the plant that the Minister would not consider it necessary to have the plant examined.  If the words were deleted, there would have to be an investigation. On the other hand, while it might be self-evident that the plant had caused the accident or dangerous ocurrence, the Minister might consider an examination of the plant to be necessary as a preventive measure with the aim of ensuring that an accident of that kind would not occur again.  It is important that the Minister should have discretion in the matter and the deletion of these words would remove that discretion.</P>

As politicians we are susceptible to political influence and I should like to exclude that possibility as far as possible in the interests of safety.  In 20 years' time an accident could occur in a factory owned by a friend of the Minister of the day and the Minister might be asked to quash the matter.  He would have power to do that.  Given the present and previous holders of this office, this may not seem very likely, but we need to put beyond doubt the integrity and independence of the safety machinery, the factory inspectorate and so on.

      <P>The reason I find the Deputy's amendment unacceptable is because that amendment, and the consequential amendment No. 26b, would reverse what I feel to be the proper sequence of events.  The prime responsibility for the safety of his employees should rest with the occupier&mdash;a responsibility which, in this case, could be shared with the owner of the plant. Therefore, if the plant in question causes an accident or dangerous occurrence, the Minister should be empowered to require the occupier or owner, as appropriate, to have the plant examined and tested where that is considered necessary.  The right of the occupier or owner to select a competent person to carry out these examinations and tests should not be restricted to choosing someone from a list supplied by the Minister: that would be tantamount to ministerial interference with the independence of the occupier or owner.  Furthermore, it would remove the Minister's discretion to reject the report of the examinations and tests as inadequate.  The section as drafted at present is more satisfactory since it leaves the occupier or owner free to make their own arrangements for examination and testing of the plant in the first place and the Minister takes the initiative only if and when he is not satisfied as to the adequacy of the subsequent report of the competence of the person undertaking the examinations and tests.  For that reason, I prefer to leave the section unchanged.  If the Deputy's amendment was accepted the Minister would have to accept without any question that report.  He would not have any discretion left to him, whereas if the &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; is the owner's responsibility the Minister has other powers at his discretion if he finds there is incompetency involved or he questions the report.</P>

      <P>The deletion of subsection (3) of this section, which I am proposing, is made against the background of the terms of subsection (1).  Subsection (1) empowers the Minister for Labour to require an occupier or owner of plant to have such plant competently examined and tested in the event of its having been the possible cause, whether wholly or partly, of an accident or dangerous occurrence in a factory or specified premises.  In addition, when the examination and testing have been carried out, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) a copy of the results must be given to the Minister by the occupier or owner within seven days of its receipt by whichever of them is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) relates to what the owner of the plant has to do, by way of <Col N="615" /> informing the Minister about testing and examination of plant and sending the Minister a copy of the report of the results, in cases where the testing and examination were carried out other than by a direction from the Minister.  Since this subsection also applies to an accident or dangerous occurrence in a factory or specified premises, I have upon further consideration decided that in all cases where plant might have been the cause of an accident or dangerous occurrence it would be appropriate for it to be the Minister who would require the necessary examination and testing to be carried out.  Since subsection (3) permits the initiative in that area to be taken by some other person, I am now proposing that that be deleted and that the power stay with the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am sorry but we cannot accept the amendment.  In conscience, a justice of the District Court would not reach a decision regarding a prohibition notice until he was satisfied that he comprehended fully the import of the case put before him by both parties involved, regardless of how much the evidence that had been offered by the inspectorate, on the one hand, and by the applicant on the other hand, might be of a very technical and conflicting nature.  This competence is based on experience in the past in respect of cases brought under the Factories Act and which have involved technical advice. In addition, and perhaps just as important, are the broad implications that would arise from acceptance of the amendment.  Assessors would have to be paid and the question of agreeing to make provision for their payment would be a matter for the Minister for Justice and not for the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>To permit the use of technical assessors under this legislation would raise the issue that in equity their use should be permitted in any case, whether under legislation or otherwise, where technical evidence of any kind, be it medical or psychiatric, for example, were to be given.  Again, that would be a matter for decision by the Minister for Justice and not by the Minister for Labour.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to add, in addition to a fine not exceeding £200, a fine of £50 per day for each day that an offence is continued.  The Bill provides <Col N="617" /> merely that a defaulter could be fined up to £200 but in many cases it would be considered worth while paying such a fine which is small in industrial terms whereas if there were to be a fine of £50 per day for each day in respect of which the offence were continued, there would be a strong incentive to discontinue the offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy is saying but I consider that there is provision in section 11 (8) in respect of continuing offences.  Under that subsection if a dangerous activity is persisted in, despite the serving of a prohibition notice, the High Court is empowered to prohibit the continuance of the activity.  This would be much more severe than what the Deputy suggests. The subsection enables the court also to make interim or interlocutory orders and to make conditions as to costs.  A breach of such a High Court order would constitute contempt of court and would be punishable accordingly, usually by way of jail sentence until the order was complied with.</P>
      <P>I am advised also that providing for fines for continuing offences in connection with a prohibition notice would not be a satisfactory way of dealing with the continuation of a dangerous activity and that the provisions of subsection (8) represent the most effective way of dealing with continuing offences in this regard.</P>
      <P>In some cases the payment of £50 per day for each day of a continuing offence might be the easy way out but the fact that the court have the power to punish offenders by way of sending them to jail might be a much greater deterrent.</P>

      <P>12.&mdash;If the Minister is of the opinion that a person&mdash;</P>

      <P>he may serve on him a notice requiring that person to remedy the contravention within such period as may be specified in the notice. </P>
      <P>Section 11 provides also that the Minister may prohibit the carrying on of activities which could cause serious bodily harm and that in such cases prohibition orders would be issued.  The employer has the right of appeal to the courts on receipt of such a prohibition order.  However, there may be circumstances in which, while there is something wrong, neither the Minister nor his inspectors would wish the operation to cease immediately.  I presume also that in some circumstances an employer could claim in the courts that he should have been given an opportunity to rectify the position and that in some cases the Minister could issue an improvement notice whereby the employer would be obliged to remedy the situation within a set period, for example, within a number of days.  In such circumstances the employer would not be in a position to claim subsequently that he had not been given the opportunity to rectify the situation and that is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a similar amendment was put forward by the ICTU in the course of the discussions which took place between the Second Stage and the Committee <Col N="619" /> Stage.  It was explained to congress that the contravention letters which were issued under the name of the secretary of my Department achieved the same effect as the improvement notices provided for in the UK legislation, on which this amendment was modelled.  It was explained also that the contravention letters situation affords a more flexible approach than would be the case if they were legislative as opposed to administrative measures and that these letters could be said to form part of the advisory role of the industrial inspectorate.</P>
      <P>For the further information of the Deputy and of the House, I might mention that there are used different kinds of contravention letters in relation to the Factories Act, 1955.  For example, there is a letter which advises that when an industrial inspector visits a premises and reports a contravention of the Act, the contravention should be remedied without delay.  There is another one which advises that when an industrial inspector visits a premises and reports a contravention of the Factories Act, 1955 which is specified in the letter and draws attention to the penalties provided in the Act in respect of such contravention, he should request that an assurance be given to the effect that the matters in question are receiving attention.</P>
      <P>A further example is one which serves as a first reminder in regard to a contravention letter issued previously.</P>
      <P>Another letter serves as a further reminder in regard to a contravention letter previously issued and warns that, if on the next visit of an inspector, the contraventions are not remedied, the steps necessary to secure compliance with the law will be considered without further warning.  A further letter refers to a recent visit to the premises by an industrial inspector who found that the conditions there were not fully consistent with the requirements of the Factories Act, 1955, in the respects specified in the letter and requests that the defects mentioned are remedied before any manual workers are employed.  That should help the Deputy to accept the position and not to proceed with his amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says, that is, that certain sections of the Factories Act cover the points raised in my amendment.  Would he not agree that such terminologies as &ldquo;without delay&rdquo;&ldquo;receiving attention&rdquo;&ldquo;considered without further warning&rdquo;, &ldquo;not consistent&rdquo; are not sufficiently strong?  He might consider that the time factor might be included in the discussions of the working party.  The expression &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; reminds me of a commission or a review body and could mean up to 12 months.  If there was a mishap it would be poor consolation to the workers if a letter was issued to the employer saying that that should be rectified without delay.  The Minister should have power to ensure it is done as soon as possible.</P>

If the rules are not complied with, I would not have any sympathy with the employers.  The follow-up action of the inspectorate can be very strong and there is no reason why it cannot be effective.

      <P>If a person were employed doing the lattice work of a bridge which was projecting over water his means of access would probably be walking along a girder which would probably not be a particularly safe one as it would be impossible, let alone reasonably practicable, to provide him with an inherently safe means of access.  It would then be a question of ensuring that there were safety nets under the bridge in which the person would be caught should he happen to fall but this illustration could also apply in the case of roof or steel work.</P>
      <P>There is also the consideration that certain safe means of access or egress would have to be reasonably practicable in the light of current knowledge.  For instance, there is now an awareness of the fact that a person can be safely hoisted up to and down from a place of work in a crane.  In the past that safe means of access and egress would not for obvious reasons be reasonably practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, it may not always be possible to provide a safe means of access and egress.  This is the reason why such means have to be provided so far as is reasonably practicable.  Where it would be reasonably practicable in the light of current knowledge to provide these means&mdash;for example, ladders or gangways to enable a person to examine an electric motor on top of a lift&mdash;then section 12 (1) requires them to be provided and maintained.  In the circumstances I do not think the deletion <Col N="622" /> proposed by the Deputy would be desirable.</P>

      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 53, after &ldquo;place&rdquo; to add &ldquo;conforming to the requirements of access and egress for the disabled&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>I thought very hard about this amendment. We should be very serious about making provision for the disabled.  There is an alleged public sector policy whereby 3 per cent of all jobs are supposed to be held for the disabled.  In all the safety legislation I do not know if there is special provision for safe access and egress for the disabled.  In most buildings, public and private, the needs of the disabled have been totally ignored.  In the design of our streets we have been very negligent and totally insensitive to their needs.  There has been a new approach to this matter.  The Minister is adopting the approach to make it possible for the disabled to work&mdash;people in wheelchairs, the blind and so on.  This might not be the correct section to include these words, but perhaps the working party might consider this matter in greater detail.</P>

I shall have the subsection further examined between now and Report Stage to see if it might be possible to make my intentions clearer, because I too agree with the point made by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister for the Environment has prepared draft building regulations concerning access to buildings for the disabled and the National Rehabilitation Board have made proposals to him in relation to those draft regulations.  There is a committee under the auspices of the National <Col N="623" /> Rehabilitation Board comprising people with specialised knowledge in this area&mdash;the medical, paramedical, architectural, engineering and occupational therapy fields.  Recently the NRB issued a booklet entitled <i>Access for the Disabled: Minimum Design Criteria.</i> The board can give an international symbol in cases where there is suitable access to buildings for the disabled. AnCo can award such symbols.  I have listened to what the Deputy has said and I will have the subsection examined between now and Report Stage to see if it is possible to make the intention clearer.</P>

      <P>In page 11, lines 1 to 6, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) The occupier of a factory or specified premises shall, in relation to noise at places of work take such steps as are reasonably possible to <Col N="625" /> reduce sound levels to the lowest possible degree but if the sound levels are not thus reduced to a level specified in subsection (2) of this section the occupier shall provide all who work within the noise range with personal audio protection devices sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection (2).&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>The subsection states:</P>
    <P>The occupier of a factory or specified premises shall, in relation to noise in the factory or other premises, take such steps (if any) as are appropriate either by reducing sound levels or otherwise, to ensure that noise in the factory or other premises, or in any part thereof, is such as not to be likely to injure the hearing or otherwise adversely affect the health of persons employed. </P>
    <P>I do not think the option should be included. The Minister will appreciate that where audio protection is provided very often those involved will not wear the ear muffs, perhaps because they feel they are a nuisance.  In other words, there is an understandable resistance to wearing such protection, and the subsection as it stands is a let-out for employers because what should be done is to have noise levels reduced to the minimum possible. My amendment would be much more effective from the health point of view because it would provide that at places of work the employer should take such steps as are reasonably possible to reduce sound levels to the lowest possible degree.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 31b, I have provided for the insertion of &ldquo;audio or nervous&rdquo; after <Col N="626" />&ldquo;bodily&rdquo;.  We could take the Ferenka case in which there were very high noise levels and that was a factor towards producing a certain climate in the place, although, of course, it was not the only factor.  The subsection refers to bodily injury but there are injuries to health and to nerves caused by noise which might not be described as bodily injuries.  I have been advised by an industrial medical practitioner that the definition should be extended.</P>

      <P>My legal advice is that the existing term &ldquo;bodily&rdquo; includes &ldquo;audio&rdquo; as well, so the first part of the Deputy's amendment has been catered for in subsection (2) as drafted.  On the question of nervous injury, the medical advice I have is that nervous injury would be difficult to prove or substantiate medically, given a lack of proven relationship between cause and effect, and furthermore to make provisions such as the Deputy proposes could risk making a nonsense of industrial disease prevention regulations because it would bring us into the grey area of psychosomatic illness.</P>

      <P>No. This whole area of noise warrants a lot more attention. Perhaps it is something the working party should examine, because I admit it is a very technical area.  On Second Stage I proposed that we deal with the Committee Stage of this Bill in Select Committee so that we might have the benefit of technical advisers.  I have discussed the question of noise with a few people who know about it.  There is no doubt in the minds of a lot of people who ought to know that high noise levels certainly contribute to nervousness, very definitely to disorientation.  We know the tactics used in the North and elsewhere to torture people through noise.  Noise can have that effect on workers.  In some places it could very well be a contributory factor to poor industrial relations. It is the sort of thing that helps to <Col N="627" /> create tension.  I feel also that it is an area to which we have not had sufficient regard.  Perhaps it is one area the working party could examine in great detail.</P>

If that meets the Deputy's point I have no objection to considering the question of having the working party examine the question of noise.</P>

The knowledge of the cleaner might not be sufficient to make such a decision because, for example, maintenance men might be involved also.

      <P>The focus in both the Factories Act and the Safety in Industry Bill is to secure the safety, health and welfare of persons in employment.  It is because this legislation is concerned with worker protection that it comes within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Labour.  The question of extending that protection to persons other than those employed in factories or specified premises goes beyond the scope and intention of this Bill.  That question needs to be considered in a much broader context than that afforded by section 20, taking into account other hazards additional to those which might be caused by dust and fumes for which protection is given under the Factories Act and regulations made under that Act and for which protection is proposed to be given by this Bill.  It is a question to which the projected working party on occupational safety and health might perhaps address themselves.  Even if the reasons which I have just mentioned for not accepting the Deputy's amendment did not exist I would still decide against it on the grounds that it is too wide.  Persons visiting a premises with an employer's knowledge might not be going to the danger area or it is possible that they may go elsewhere than originally arranged with the employer thus causing the employer, through no fault of his own, to be in breach of the legislation.</P>

      <P>When paragraph (b) of this subsection was being drafted account was taken of the fact that in many cases it would not be necessary to have more than one person outside the confined space.  For that reason the term &ldquo;a person&rdquo; was constantly used on the grounds that its use would not require more than one person to be outside the confined space.  There is flexibility under the paragraph to tailor the number of persons outside to suit individual circumstances. If I accepted amendment No. 45d there would have to be two persons outside in all cases whether they were necessary or not or there would be a breach of the legislation.  I prefer to leave paragraph (b) as it is drafted at present.  As to the two further amendments, if the Deputy wishes me to comment now I will.</P>

      <P>I know of a case where the person outside could not move because he was holding a rope and could not raise a wider alarm.  Some people died as a result.  They were caught inside and were gassed to death.  There was nothing the person could do.  He did not know they were gassed because he was holding on to the rope for dear life. There was nobody else to raise a wider alarm.  I admit that prescribing that there should be two persons all the time could be unnecessary but there is a volume of <Col N="635" /> opinion which thinks all safety measures are unnecessary until there is an accident.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has just said seems to conflict with our interpretation of this amendment.  It would be unreal to expect that an application submitted after the fire or the event took place would be acceptable.  I do not believe a prosecution should be taken under this section, once the application for a certificate concerning the means of escape in case of fire has actually been made.  Perhaps there is no difference between us here.  It is the aim of the legislation to require the occupier to make that application.  Where he has made the application that should be sufficient to satisfy the requirements placed on him by the legislation.  The question of precisely when the application was made by him is not relevant.  Should it so happen that he thinks his premises might possibly be inspected by an inspector within seven days and this possibility causes him to send off his application, so much the better; the threatened or expected visit of the inspector has prompted him to do something.  The important thing is that he has been motivated to comply with the requirement, to have applied for a certificate.  I see no good <Col N="637" /> reason to make compliance an offence, even if the motive for compliance is selfpreservation. There is also the consideration that there might conceivably be some quite legitimate grounds for the occupier having made the application in the preceding seven days&mdash;for example, in the case of a newly opened factory.  In view of the foregoing, I am not persuaded to concede the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a loophole here and we should be closing loopholes, where possible.  The paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>Provided that where an application has been made for a certificate under this section, then for so long, but only for so long, as the certificate is neither given, refused nor deemed under subsection (3A) of this section to have been refused an offence by reason of the occupier not having in force any certificate shall be deemed not to be committed. </P>
      <P>That reads to me as if a person might immediately apply, after an accident, for a certificate and so long as that application was extant, or not decided upon, he was covered, even though the offence occurred before the application was made. The Minister might look at this again to see if there is a loophole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be reassured that there is no loophole in that respect.  If, however, he would be happier, I have no objection to being absolutely sure that there is no loophole on Report Stage.  However, the Deputy can take it that there is no loophole there. This is in relation to the inspection situation, rather than the accident situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 23, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>23.&mdash;The following section is hereby substituted for section 48 of the Principal Act:</P>
      <P>`48.&mdash;(1)  Effective steps shall be taken to ensure that all persons employed in a factory are familiar with the means of escape in case of fire and its use and with the routine to be followed in case of fire.</P>
      <P>(2)  Fire drill, that is to say the procedure to be followed in evacuating premises in case there is an outbreak of fire or another emergency, shall be held in every factory&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in case there is for the time being in force in relation to the factory a notice under this section, in accordance with the notice,</P>
      <P>(b)  in any other case, at least every six months, </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and in addition to the foregoing fire drill held in pursuance of this section shall, in relation to a factory as regards which the manner in which it <Col N="639" /> is to be carried out is not for the time being specified in such a notice, be held throughout the factory at the same time.</P>
    <P>(3) (a)  The Minister may by a notice in writing served on the occupier of a factory require fire drill, that is to say the procedure referred to in subsection (2) of this section, to be held in the factory at such intervals or in such circumstances or manner as may be specified in the notice.</P>
    <P>(b)  A notice under this subsection shall remain in force until it is withdrawn by the Minister by a further notice in writing served on the occupier concerned. </P>
    <P>(4)  A record containing the prescribed particulars shall be kept of fire drill held in pursuance of this section and such record shall be attached to the general register.' &rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This amendment arises again out of discussions with interested parties which took place between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  The easiest way to accommodate the points raised by the ICTU and the IEC was to delete the existing section and substitute a new one for it.  This new section will meet the points raised in the following way: the provision concerning familiarity with the means of escape in case of fire and fire drill will now apply to all factories, as opposed to those where more than 20 persons are employed, or buildings forming part of a factory containing explosives or highly imflammable materials.  As a consequential amendment, subsection (3) of section 48 of the Factories Act, 1955 is deleted. Obligatory fire drill involving evacuation of the permises will have to take place every six months, as opposed to every two months, which was considered excessive. Fire drill, where continuous or similar processes are concerned, will take place in accordance with the terms of the notice from the Minister served on the occupier concerned, in cases where such a notice is in force.  The existing <Col N="640" /> provision about records of fire drill has, of course, been retained.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of my amendment No. 49a, which is being discussed in conjunction with this, was to get away from the idea of having fire drill every two months, or every fixed period.  In my experience as a fire marshal if you fix a day everybody is ready for the fire drill.  It is unreal because when a fire occurs everybody will not be ready.  The thing is not to have this fire drill at fixed intervals.  Having an element of surprise in the fire drill is important because when a fire occurs there is always an element of surprise.</P>

      <P>I understand that the board mentioned consisted of military officers and was set up to report to the Chief of Staff on the operation and development of private schemes involving insurance, savings and so on, for the welfare of members of the Defence Forces and families.  The board were not concerned with military pensions and gratuities which are under the control of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that this was a major board in that sense.  They were a board set up to consider a variety of matters which were of internal interest to the Army.  As I said, the main recommendations of the board were or are about to be implemented.  I do not see why we should lay this on the Table of the House.  It included matters such as increased benefits in both officers and men's friendly societies, savings schemes, which have been commenced, a group assurance scheme for men, which will commence in the near future, and so on.  It consisted of that type of thing and is an internal Army matter.</P>

      <P>In a situation where there is no representative body comparable to that of the Garda Síochána available in the Irish Army and where there are 13,000 public servants involved it is quite a unique situation that a board composed of officers should meet to make various recommendations and that this report would still be regarded as being entirely internal and that in the general interest of an open democracy that report should be broadly available.

      <P>The Minister has very considerable experience of conciliation and arbitration schemes and he knows that these reports are generally available to the trade unions concerned.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces pensions schemes are a distinct superannuation code related to the special needs and conditions <Col N="653" /> of the service.  A noncommissioned officer or private is entitled to pension after 21 years' service and to maximum pension after 31 years' service, irrespective of rank.  Maximum pension represents between about 47 per cent and 53 per cent of pay, depending on rank.</P>
    <P>In the public service generally pensions are not ordinarily awarded before the age of 60, and 40 years' service is required to qualify for the maximum pension which is 50 per cent of pay.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces pensions schemes are kept under constant review in the light particularly of developments in pensions codes applicable elsewhere in the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the qualifications and so on for pensions in the Army do not compare favourably with those in the public service? Surely our defence personnel are entitled to equal concessions with the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>From my examination of the matter I believe that soldiers are probably better off under the pension scheme they have than they would be under the Public Service scheme.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible without disproportionate effort to ascertain the precise number of applications for redress of wrongs pursuant to section 114 of the Defence Act, 1954 submitted to the Minister during the past ten years. It is estimated, however, that the number was about 60.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he has examined the situation in regard to representative bodies and unions in other European Armies, and the precise reasons why such means of making representations should not be made available here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>From such information as I have at my disposal it would appear that certain European countries permit the existence of representative bodies within their armed forces.  In these countries national service or conscription is used as a means of recruitment.  There is no direct comparison, in such cases, with <Col N="655" /> the position in Ireland, which maintains a volunteer army.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to an order made by the Minister for Defence under the Defence Act, 1954, the Chief of Staff is assigned responsibility for military proposals in regard to conditions of service, pay and allowances and retired pay and pensions for members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The conditions of service of members of the Forces are under constant and sympathetic consideration and any improvements which are regarded as warranted are made.</P>
      <P>The welfare of the Defence Forces has been at all times the special care of successive Governments.  Other countries no doubt adopt procedures best suited to their requirements.  In our case the longstanding arrangements for settling the conditions of service of the Defence Forces have worked well and it is not proposed to disturb them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a growing feeling within the Army that it would be entirely beneficial to the morale and discipline of the forces, notwithstanding its constraints relative to security and discipline, that there should be now a parallel structure similar to that of the Garda Síochána and that the Army should in fact have an Army representative body, perhaps of a less flexible nature than in the Garda Síochána, but that it is entirely reasonable to suggest that in 1980 that kind of industrial relations structure should in fact exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of such a feeling.  As I mentioned in my reply, as far as my information goes the armies which permit representative bodies utilise national service or conscription to maintain those forces.  I am not aware of the existence of representative bodies for the defence forces of countries which have volunteer armies such as we have.  I would mention here that the welfare of the Defence Forces has always been the special care of successive Governments and very worthwhile improvements have been made in relation to the Army over <Col N="656" /> the last number of years.  I am satisfied that the system that is being operated at present is satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will consult with local authorities in whose area a military barracks is situated regarding the establishing of a joint housing scheme, built exclusively for army and naval personnel, in view of the lack of housing which presently militates against recruitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Serving soldiers have equal claim on local authority houses with other members of the community in the same category.  The policy of my Department is to supplement the efforts of local authorities where soldiers' housing needs are greatest.  Considerable progress has been made in this matter in recent years.  A scheme of 50 houses was completed at the Curragh Camp early in 1979, four houses were recently built at Arbour Hill, Dublin, and work is well advanced on the construction of 14 houses at McGee Barracks, Kildare, and 20 houses at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa, Renmore, Galway.  Tenders for the building of 12 dwellings at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, are at present under consideration.  The National Building Agency Limited has been asked to proceed with planning for the provision of additional dwellings at that barracks and also at the Curragh Camp, Collins Barracks, Cork, and Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that in the allocation of local authority houses the Army personnel are treated as equal to other members of the community in their applications?  Would the Minister think it much more effective if, say, local authorities in co-operation with the Department of Defence provided serviced sites for Army personnel who would be regarded as within the category of being able to provide their own houses?  Would the Minister consider that housing is a problem which <Col N="657" /> has militated severely against recruitment into the Army and that people in the Army should get an opportunity of being housed in the area where they serve so they can be integrated into the community and their skills be of benefit to the community at large?  Is the Minister aware of the number of Army personnel who are serving in barracks that have to travel to and from the barracks from their homes?  Does he not agree that that is not a very fair or equitable system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a considerable number of questions.  In relation to the first one, I would certainly hope that local authorities are giving equal treatment with other citizens to soldiers in respect of the provision of local authority houses.  Any house provided by a local authority must be let in accordance with the statutory scheme of letting priorities based on the relative urgency of housing needs.  Serving soldiers have certainly an equal claim to local authority houses with other members of the community in which they live.</P>
      <P>I do not feel that the non-availability of married quarters is a deterrent against recruitment or that it militates against recruitment because the vast majority of recruits are young single men.  As I pointed out originally in my reply the purpose of building the houses I have referred to is to supplement the houses built by the local authority but I would very much hope that the local authorities treat army personnel as favourably as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it now official policy in the Department of Defence to make defence land available to build married quarters for the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better put a question down in respect of that. The fact is that houses for the Defence Forces are not built on Defence land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of the Army housing in Dublin is among the worst housing in <Col N="658" /> Dublin and some of it is a cause for scandal?  Will the Minister undertake to have the matter looked at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that some of the houses are not up to standard. I am doing the best I can to improve these houses and to provide further houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>My question asked the Minister to consult with local authorities in order to have a more effective housing drive by the provision of serviced sites for those in a position to build their own houses as well as a housing programme with the local authorities in order to provide proper housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if the suggestion of the Deputy would be the best way to solve the problem.  I have no doubt that the Army are in close contact with the local authorities in relation to providing houses for Army personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>A revision of the organisation of the Defence Forces as a whole provided for the separate development of the Permanent Defence Force and the FCA as combat and local defence forces respectively.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> The FCA are now organised on a Command basis with a special staff in each Command.

      <P>The operation of the re-equipment grants scheme, which was introduced in 1969 to enable Irish manufacturing industry to raise its standards of efficiency in order to compete effectively in free trade, is at present being considered but I have taken no decisions yet as regards its future. Grants for microprocessor-based industries <Col N="664" /> are provided by the Industrial Development Authority under their normal range of industrial investment incentives, which includes, in appropriate cases, assistance towards the cost of new product and process development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have misunderstood my question.  I was trying to get at whether he or his Department had any views on how the overall industrial situation might react to the massive impact of having to introduce high technology into their industries overall, not in the microprocessing industry as such.  I am talking about overall industries having to meet the cost of installing high-technology instruments and equipment in this era.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain grants and incentives available at the moment which in certain circumstances would be available towards the cost of the installation of these kinds of high-technology equipment, but frequently, of course, these are self-financing in the sense that they will often reduce the company's costs.  They are not the kind of equipment in respect of which one would be very anxious to see large grants paid in, but where appropriate grants are paid.  They are paid at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of such studies have been made, mainly abroad and some here, and these are taken into account.  The Deputy should bear in mind in regard to microprocessors that they will impact on us and on our employment situation generally in any event, but we are in the happy position that a significant proportion of that equipment will be built in this country. Since it would come in here anyway it is <Col N="665" /> advantageous for us that quite a bit of it would be practically of Irish origin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in view of recent reports on the bleak outlook for the textile industry, the steps he proposes to take to aid that industry, and if it is intended to make any study of this industry with a view to making it more efficient and profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The textile industry has been the subject of a number of studies and reports over the years.  Furthermore, there is a comprehensive range of State aids available to this industry.  Adaptation grants were introduced at the time free trade was approaching and grants are still provided for re-equipment, modernisation, and for training and research and development.  The services provided by Córas Tráchtála, Fóir Teo., IIRS and the ICC are also available to the industry.  As a special measure to help offset the effects of the British Temporary Employment Scheme, the Government introduced the Employment Maintenance Scheme in April 1978 for the textile industry as well as for the clothing and leather sectors.  The State facilities to help the industry to adjust to the competitive environment in which it finds itself are, therefore, extensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is generally recognised that import penetration from sources outside the EEC is one of the main problems facing the European textile industry, my <Col N="666" /> Department have played and will continue to play an active role in promoting measures which are designed to improve the market situation at home and in other member States; the Department keep in close touch with the industry here in these matters, most of which must, however, be approached on a Community-wide basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Kelloggs cornflakes were manufactured in this country by an Irish company under licence.  This arrangement was terminated by Kellogs with effect from the end of 1979.  The possibility of cornflakes being manufactured in this country in the future on an independent basis is being examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Kelloggs termination of the production of cornflakes here will result in a net loss of 100 jobs, or will do so ultimately? What arrangements is he making to avoid any loss if possible in that? CPC who could produce cornflakes cannot do so because of some conditions in their contract with Kellogs.  Would the Minister have a look at the contract to see if anything could be done to improve the position of CPC in the hope that they might produce cornflakes at an earlier date than they might otherwise be allowed to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement in the Deputy's question about the numbers unemployed is not correct.  The total number of persons engaged in the manufacture and distribution of cornflakes was 90.  All of them have been <Col N="667" /> re-employed in the firm which over the past year or so has diversified into other product ranges.  It may be that some of the older workers concerned will be offered voluntary redundancy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at some time in the future.  It depends on the extent to which the company are in a position to move into further production ranges.  I am very glad to say that the company concerned took this step over the past year or so because there would have been serious difficulties in that factory if they had not done so, and this has now been avoided.  Under the licence between this company and Kellogs the company concerned are precluded for a period of 12 months from December 1979 from manufacturing cornflakes here but only for a period of 12 months.  In the course of this present year they will assess the viability or otherwise of setting up their own manufacturing plant with effect from 1 January 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism if his attention has been drawn to the notice of Irish Cement Limited to their customers that ministerial sanction has been received to increase the wholesale, and therefore the retail, price of cement to take account of recent CIE freight charges, and that this increase will also be charged in the case of customers who <Col N="668" /> collect their own supplies from the manufacturers; if his attention has further been drawn to the unsatisfactory CIE freight service to County Donegal where cement suppliers who use private hauliers or their own transport now find themselves forced to pay charges to CIE which they do not use and that the price of cement in Northern Ireland is approximately £6 per ton cheaper than that supplied by Irish Cement with no restrictions on the method of haulage; and if he is aware of the building difficulties in County Donegal as a result of costs in cement increased by over £21 per ton since February 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in accordance with agreed procedure the recent increase in CIE freight charges was passed on by Cement Limited in the form of increased prices for delivered cement, with effect from 28 January 1980.</P>
      <P>While there is an ex-works price for bulk cement, the same price is charged for bagged cement whether collected ex-works or delivered within a 20-mile radius of the works.  Hence the increase in freight charges was applied to all prices for bagged cement, including collection ex-works.  Cement Limited acknowledge that there are some difficulties with the operation of their special delivery service of bagged cement to County Donegal.  Discussions between the interests concerned are currently taking place on measures to improve the situation.  The most recent information available to my Department indicates that ex-works prices in the Republic at present for bagged cement are over £1.60 per ton cheaper than in Northern Ireland and that Cement Limited's delivered prices for bagged cement in Donegal are not significantly higher than the price in Derry of cement manufactured in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The wholesale delivered prices of bagged cement in Donegal have increased by £15.64 per ton since February 1979, and not by £21 as inferred by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a monopoly situation exists in relation to the importation of coal supplies in the Dublin area.  A similar situation does not exist in respect of distribution, as two thirds of requirements are delivered by bell-men, and the remainder by the principal importer.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any proposals to extend to other parts of the country the monopoly situation existing in respect of importation of coal into the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in reply to previous questions, the situation as to importation and distribution of coal supplies in the Dublin area has been the subject of a number of investigations over the past seven years.  None of these investigations confirmed that difficulties in supplying the market could be attributed to abuse of a monopoly position. Nevertheless, I believe that the supply position could be improved if other interests apart from the present importer were to engage in the importation of coal and I hope that every encouragement will be given to people who may have plans of this kind in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The most tangible form of encouragement that can be given to new interests to engage in the importation of coal within the Dublin area would be the provision of suitable berthage and storage facilities in the Dublin port area. This is primarily a matter for the Dublin Port and Docks Board and my Department have no function here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>There is no evidence of an extension by CDL of their activities into other parts of the country.  However, in the course of a recent meeting with the Minister about price control CDL suggested that because their prices were much lower than those obtaining at other east coast ports, there was a tendency for retailers to obtain supplies from CDL at the expense of importers in other areas.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prudent management of the public finances and improving the climate for economic development are normal priorities for a Minister for Finance when drawing up his Budget. This obligation takes on a special significance at a time of international economic recession, such as we now experience.</P>
      <P>Because the international recession has had a particularly damaging impact on our energy dependent open economy, there is a new burden to be carried today. We must all ensure that this new burden, unwelcome though it may be, will be shouldered evenly by all who can bear it.  A progressive economic policy can only be implemented through the collective commitment and action of all sections of the community.  It must be built on the firm foundation of a caring and sharing society, so that in overcoming the immediate problems, we emerge more determined to achieve a healthy social and economic order which we can all respect.</P>
      <P>My proposals today, and Government policy throughout the year, will be firmly directed towards those ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience of last year indicates that we have found it difficult as a nation, in a period of growing prosperity, to adjust to the new reality of international economic recession.  But adjust we must, and my budget proposals today are intended to encourage that adjustment in our individual and national interest.  The pursuit of social justice in a basically healthy economy, beset as it may be by serious difficulties, has been a guiding principle for the Government in adopting the proposals which I will outline. I hope that they will evoke a <Col N="705" /> positive and helpful response at this critical time in our national development. Our renewed determination, following the dramatic upsets of the past year, to achieve the objectives of equity and a proper balance in our national finances will not yield immediate results in the year ahead, but it will make a major contribution towards positive progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to reduce the balance of payments deficit and the level of Exchequer borrowing.  In seeking to reduce the level of borrowing, the Government have concentrated on curbing the growth of public expenditure, so as to ensure that taxpayers will be called upon to contribute only to absolutely essential services.  We must see to it that the taxpayer's money is used effectively and in a manner that he or she will fully endorse.  This will also ensure that the general burden of taxation is kept to the minimum consistent with economic and social priorities.</P>
    <P>I will return to both of these themes later, but first I wish to review the economic developments in 1979.  These comments will be brief because Deputies have already received a copy of the paper <i>Economic Background to the Budget, 1980.</i></P>
    <P Just="Center">THE ECONOMY IN 1979.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there has been a complete change of circumstances compared with the situation as it appeared this time last year.  Nobody foresaw then the massive oil price increases that were to come later in the year with their attendant problems.  The farming community met serious difficulties during the year resulting in an unexpected fall in their incomes. The pattern of industrial disputes and, in particular, the industrial dispute in the Post Office, which commenced in February and was to last until June, caused disruption of services and interference with private, commercial and industrial life.  A recently published EEC report indicated that, relatively, we lost more man-days through industrial stop <Col N="706" /> pages in 1978 than any other EEC country. Our experience in 1979 can hardly have improved the record.</P>
    <P>So what started off as a year with great economic opportunities eventually deteriorated to the point of serious setback to the targets for growth and financial stability which the Government had set for the year as a whole.</P>
    <P>But performance, although not up to expectations, had its good features.  The growth rate last year at 3 per cent was in line with the OECD and EEC average. There was a further significant increase in employment.  Registered unemployment showed a substantial decline.  If agricultural exports were disappointing, industrial exports performed strongly. They rose by almost 25 per cent in value compared with 1978, while investment grew in double figures for the second year running.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, at budget time last year the expectation was that the balance of payments deficit for the year would be about £300 million.  Present estimates put the deficit at about £760 million, or more than 10 per cent of GNP.  In both absolute and relative terms this is very high and gives serious cause for concern. It is true that higher oil prices were responsible for about £140 million of the increase in the deficit, but it is equally clear that as a community we are living far beyond our means.  Progress towards our targets has been obviously impeded by these factors.  To reach them now we must adjust our immediate individual expectations.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF 1979 BUDGET OUTTURN</P>
    <P>As regards Government finances, the 1979 Budget envisaged an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £779 million, or 10.5 per cent of GNP.  The outturn was very much higher at £1,009 million, or 13.7 per cent of GNP.  A sum of £522 million was borrowed to meet the deficit on the current budget and £497 million was borrowed for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit was £233 <Col N="707" /> million above the estimate, partly because of excesses on public service pay, social services and CIE, and partly because of delayed collection of revenue due to the industrial dispute in the Post Office.  In addition, there was the cost of the PAYE tax concession under the national understanding and also a shortfall in revenue from hydrocarbon oils and car sales.</P>
    <P>The subsidies of £59 million which were received during the year as a result of our participation in the EMS helped to reduce somewhat the impact of these items.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure totalled £1,035 million, of which £1,001 million was for the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>Approximately one-half of the total borrowing requirement was raised through foreign borrowing, including £144 million from the European Investment Bank.  The other half was raised from domestic sources, mainly through sales of Government securities to Irish residents, including the commercial banks.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ECONOMIC PROSPECTS FOR 1980</P>
    <P>When one turns then to the economic prospects for 1980 and the background to this budget, there is no escaping the fact that this is going to be a difficult year, not least because of international factors beyond our control.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months there has been a severe deterioration, related directly or indirectly to oil prices, in the economic outlook.  During 1979 alone the price of crude oil rose by more than 80 per cent and there have been further increases since the end of the year.  Many countries as well as ourselves face strained balance of payments positions, higher inflation and the prospect of significantly slower growth.  The oil importing world as a whole is significantly poorer as a result of the shift of wealth to oil producers.</P>
    <P>The international reaction to these developments is still emerging.  Last year, economic policies in many countries <Col N="708" /> became more restrictive.  It remains to be seen what the pattern of response will be to the oil price increases which have occurred since December last.  There could be a further widespread tightening of policy internationally.  Much as we might deplore this, it is a risk which cannot be ignored.  Even as things stand, little or no growth is expected in the OECD area this year.  World trade could grow at even less than half last year's rate.  There is the strong probability that our main export market&mdash;the U.K.&mdash;will actually contract.  Competition, both at home and abroad, will clearly be intense this year, and there is no prospect of an early improvement.</P>
    <P>When the world economy is faced with a marked downturn, we as an exporting country dependent on foreign markets to absorb half of our production are pulled in the same direction.  But, if we have no real control over external developments, we alone are responsible for our reaction to these events; and there are significant economic factors which will help.  Ireland is an attractive investment location from which to exploit the market of 260 million people in the countries of the EEC.  Last year we were particularly successful in our industrial promotion.  These new and established industries should ensure that industrial exports will increase, even in the face of tough international competition, provided we can keep costs in check.  The outlook for agricultural exports, which are so vital to our economy, is also better than last year.</P>
    <P>However, the fact that there was a further major increase in the price of oil in December last rules out the prospect of any automatic improvement in the balance of payments.  The prospective deficit is so large that policy cannot remain passive; corrective action must be taken.  We cannot afford to let the deficit go on growing.  If we did, inevitably this would require drastic measures from us&mdash;and perhaps not too far in the future&mdash;measures which could cause far-reaching hardship, and wipe out much of the economic advance which we have made in recent years.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="709" /> EEC AND EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM</P>
    <P>We are approaching the completion of our first year's successful participation in the new European Monetary System. The events of the past year have, if anything, reinforced the reasons for its introduction.  The international economy has been buffeted by oil price increases and political instability.  These developments have intensified pressures on exchange rates.  In all of this, the EMS has been an important influence towards stability.</P>
    <P>From our national standpoint membership of the system, and the breaking of the link with sterling that followed, necessitated important adjustments in monetary and financial practices.  The instability of sterling outside the system added to our difficulties of adjustment. The Government are satisfied, in the light of experience during the past year, that our participation was fully justified and that it can help us to increase trade and investment&mdash;particularly with EEC countries&mdash;and to reduce, over time, the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Progressive policies must also be pursued by the European Community to bring about the stated aim of balanced economic development in which the EMS, through monetary stability, can play a significant role.  We are also determined to pursue domestic policies which are consistent with our membership of the EMS and to protect the stability of the exchange rate.  There are no soft options in this direction.  A strong currency depends on the disciplined pursuit of sound economic policies and it is the intention of the Government to do precisely this.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MONETARY POLICY</P>
    <P>Monetary policy in 1979 was formulated with the aim of limiting the growth in credit to a level that was consistent with the protection of the exchange rate and maintenance of external reserves adequacy.  It was considered that the external reserves could be allowed decline somewhat so as to permit <Col N="710" /> an 18 per cent growth in private sector credit.</P>
    <P>The credit policy year runs from mid-February to mid-February and, while figures are not yet available, it looks as if the outturn for the year will be close to the original guideline.  In order to achieve this, however, the Central Bank was forced to take steps to slow down the increase in private-sector credit, which was growing at an unsustainable rate, and to ensure that available credit was channelled to the productive sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>The overall position was eased considerably by increased foreign currency lending by the banking system.  In addition, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company were authorised to undertake certain foreign currency borrowing for onlending to agriculture and industry, respectively.  In October, the Government made arrangements to allow the Trustee Savings Banks to provide an additional £10 million by way of bridging finance in order to ease the position in the housing market where particular problems arose.</P>
    <P>The detailed monetary policy measures for the coming year will be announced by the Central Bank in the near future.  The bank has already indicated that there is every likelihood, on the basis of the information now available, that the guideline for the growth of credit in the coming year will be less than the 18 per cent guideline in force in the year to February 1980.</P>
    <P>The current level of interest rates is high, both by historical standards and by reference to the expectations of many borrowers.  This is but a reflection of world trends at this unsettled time.  In fact, prime lending rates in this country have increased by proportionately less during the past year than they have in any other EEC country.  Against this background, and in the light of the need for a restrained policy here, one cannot be optimistic about the prospects for any early fall in interest rates.</P>
    <P>The exceptionally high level of inflows into the building societies in the past year has meant that they were able to <Col N="711" /> avoid any increase in mortgage rates. Net inflows during the year came to almost £200 million, not far short of twice the previous year's level, and were more than sufficient to finance the societies' lending programmes for the year.  The societies enter 1980 with a high level of liquidity and they should have good prospects of repeating last year's record performance with regard to the number of units financed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Saving and Exchequer Financing</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have given particularly careful consideration in the circumstances of this year to the desirability of encouraging saving in the community.  With a view to increasing the contribution from domestic sources to Exchequer financing, I propose to improve the attractiveness of the Government's saving schemes.</P>
    <P>The rates of interest on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks will be increased by 1 per cent.  Ordinary rates will increase from 7½ per cent to 8½ per cent and Investment Accounts in the Trustee Savings Banks from 11 per cent to 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>I propose also to extend the limits on holdings of Savings Certificates and Indexed-Linked Savings.  These savings media provide the investor with very attractive tax-free returns.  The maximum amount which a person may hold of the 9th Issue of Savings Certificates is £7,500, as fixed in 1978.  I am increasing this limit to £15,000.  I am increasing from £750 to £1,500 the maximum amount which may be held in Indexed-Linked Savings Bonds.  Anyone aged 65 or over can buy these bonds.  I am also increasing from £50 a month to £100 a month the maximum amount which a person may invest in the Indexed-Linked National Instalment-Saving Scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, I intend to increase the prize fund for Prize Bonds so as to enhance their attraction for investors.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Foreign Borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>Foreign borrowing serves to maintain the external reserves at an adequate <Col N="712" /> level, as well as supporting domestic sources in financing the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  The volume of such borrowing will be decided from time to time having regard to the Exchequer's financing needs and the position of the external reserves.  I might add that part of the foreign funds to be raised in 1980 will come from the European Investment Bank and that loans from that source have the particular advantage that we receive the EMS-related interest subsidy on them.</P>
    <P>GENERAL APPROACH TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES IN 1980</P>
    <P>A major constraint on the Government's room for manoeuvre this year has been the need to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Borrowing in 1979, at 13.7 per cent of GNP, was far in excess of that obtaining in most other member states of the EEC.  Central Government borrowing in these countries was generally 3 to 4 per cent of GNP. Roughly half of Exchequer borrowing was to finance current expenditure.  I am determined to ensure that the burden on the taxpayer for debts created to pay for current services will not continue to grow indefinitely.  We cannot ask the taxpayer of tomorrow to pay for the services we require today.  This would be socially unfair and economically irresponsible.</P>
    <P>Borrowing, the balance of payments and the external reserves are all interlinked. Government borrowing allows a higher level of expenditure in the economy, which generates a demand for further imports and adds to the external deficit.  A reduction in borrowing is required in the short-term in order to help reduce the balance of payments deficit to a sustainable size.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Expenditure 1980</i>
    </P>
    <P>The level of social, economic and other services to which the taxpayer contributes has grown inexorably, and the demands for further extensions of these services are virtually unending. However, it is time for us to take a hard look at the position and to accept that <Col N="713" /> services can only be provided if we are willing to pay for them.  The changing social and economic climate requires a continuing re-assessment of existing services. If we are to cater for the pressing needs of today and tomorrow, we cannot blandly assume that yesterday's services must all remain intact.</P>
    <P>As is evident from the Current and Capital Estimates, the Government's aim in reviewing expenditure has been to ensure that taxpayers will be called upon to contribute only to absolutely essential expenditure.  At the same time the Government's objective is to redistribute expenditure, concentrating on the areas of greatest need and potential so that the maximum economic and social benefit is derived from it.</P>
    <P>The process of curbing expenditure involves many difficult decisions.  It also comes up against the constraint that much of Government expenditure cannot be changed in the short-term because of virtually fixed commitments.  It is unreasonable to suggest that such commitments can be significantly altered in any one year.</P>
    <P>The Government have had the difficult task, therefore, of deciding what services could be deferred or curtailed, while providing for the mainteance of essential services and protecting the interests of the weaker sections of the community. Government subventions should be paid only to those who need them and should be designed to achieve the maximum economic and social benefit.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the non-capital services is up by 16 per cent&mdash;from £2,906 million to £3,367 million&mdash;before the additional provisions which I am making today.  However the cost of the non-pay supply services is projected to increase by only 5 per cent, representing a real curb on the growth of expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the promotion of science and technology as major contributors to economic and social development.  Expenditure in this area has been collated this year by the National Board of Science and Technology in a new science budget. Notwithstanding the current difficult financial situation, I have, in the main, <Col N="714" /> increased the provisions for the public sector institutions active in science and technology, in particular the research institutes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Capital Programme 1980</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are conscious of the need to continue to give priority to public investment, so essential for our economic development.  The Public Capital Programme, at £1,154 million, is 15 per cent above the 1979 outturn.  This will enable the overall volume of activity financed by the programme to be maintained in spite of competing pressures on resources this year.</P>
    <P>More importantly, in deciding the individual allocations within the programme, the Government increased the proportion of the Programme devoted to infrastructural development from 29 per cent in 1979 to 33 per cent in 1980, inclusive of an increase of 28 per cent in the provision for telecommunications development.  Some 42 per cent of the programme will be devoted to improving the productive capacity of the economy, including an increase of 22 per cent in the provision for industrial promotion by the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  A further £29 million has to be added for other capital requirements outside the programme, bringing total capital expenditure to £1,183 million.</P>
    <P>Receipts from the European Regional Development Fund assist in financing capital expenditure.  The Government have had discussions with the EEC Commission about the difficulty experienced by member states in getting commitments of fund money translated quickly into payments.  As a result of these discussions, receipts from the fund are expected to increase from £26 million in 1979 to £47 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>Other resources available to defray capital expenditure are estimated at £593 million, leaving a balance of £543 million to be found by borrowing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue Buoyancy 1980</i>
    </P>
    <P>The resources available to finance current expenditure come from tax and <Col N="715" /> non-tax revenue.  Tax revenue, before the adjustments which I will make today, is estimated at £2,450 million, an increase of £441 million, or 22 per cent over the 1979 outturn.  The estimate for non-tax revenue is £571 million, an increase of £196 million, or over 50 per cent, on the 1979 outturn.  Both the tax and non-tax revenue estimates include amounts carried over from 1979 as a result of the Post Office dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Deficit 1980</i>
    </P>
    <P>The estimated expenditure of £3,367 million on current services and the revenue estimate of £3,021 million give an opening deficit on current account of £346 million.  Adding the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes of £543 million, this gives an opening borrowing requirement of £889 million.</P>
    <P>This budget's proposals will involve tax reliefs and tax increases, as well as changes in expenditure mainly in relation to social welfare.  Before proceeding to deal with these policy changes, the presentation of the cost of basic services must be completed by making an adjustment for public service pay.  I should like to speak about pay policy generally before doing this.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Government action can provide only part of the response needed to the problems posed for us.  Success or failure in dealing effectively with these problems will depend critically upon the development of incomes, the climate of industrial relations and a shared community concern.  I am confident that the overall impact of this budget will be seen as making a positive contribution in this direction.</P>
    <P>Centrally negotiated pay arrangements have operated through the whole of the past decade.  Many workers&mdash;including in particular the lower paid&mdash;could not have hoped to do as well without the support of the collective strength of the trade union movement through the centralised arrangements. Increases in pay secured during the <Col N="716" /> decade more than compensated for movements in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>The national understanding, as a development of these centralised arrangements, has been, on balance, worth while.  It has united Government, workers and employers in a comprehensive response to national problems.  It has shown that pay developments cannot be seen in isolation, because they influence the entire economic and social fabric, and because workers' aspirations are rightly not limited to pay alone. Benefits are flowing from the understanding. The discussions which led up to it, and which have continued since, have given all sides a deeper appreciation of each others' aims and of the very real constraints within which all must operate.  The efforts which are being made by responsible trade unionists to secure greater industrial peace is a significant development, deriving in large part from the collective approach to industrial relations which the understanding has fostered.</P>
    <P>This is not to claim that the understanding has worked perfectly.  The Government accepted the pay terms with some misgivings as to the effect they might have on the economy, and only because they indicated restraint in regard to special claims and an assurance of industrial peace.  The extent of special increases and the adverse development of unit wage costs in industry last year gave substance to these misgivings.  Last year, costs here rose significantly faster than the EEC average.  An exporting country like ours, with a large deficit in the balance of payments, cannot afford to lose competitiveness internationally through such increased costs.</P>
    <P>The basic pay provisions of the National Understanding will lead to a further substantial increase in average earnings this year.  Payments due under the second phase will come to about 10 per cent of average industrial earnings. This is even higher than the 9 per cent paid under the first phase nine months earlier.  By international standards these are very high rates of increase indeed. From a strictly economic viewpoint, <Col N="717" /> there would not appear to be scope for any further pay increases this year.</P>
    <P>I am sure that our people now accept that we cannot continue to live beyond our means, nor to award ourselves increases in incomes which are not accompanied by an increased margin of productivity to guarantee the competitiveness of output at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The increases in oil prices have contributed significantly to the cost of living. They have made us and other industrial countries poorer in absolute terms and we have to face the reality that we, as a community, cannot compensate ourselves for this loss simply through increases in incomes.  To attempt to do so will drive up the inflation rate further and will leave less advantaged sections of the community worse off.  This is the unanimous view of the Finance Ministers of the EEC.  Against that background, efforts to provide compensation for the impact on consumer prices of higher oil costs were inappropriate and are even more so now.</P>
    <P>The Government at this stage have an open mind about what arrangements should follow the National Understanding. But the dominant consideration must be that levels of pay should be appropriate to the more difficult economic conditions with which we are now confronted at home and abroad.  Arrangements which ensure this in the interest of our common well-being will be welcomed by the Government. Arrangements which did not could not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public sector pay and pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The growth in the cost of public service pay and pensions is a matter of serious concern.  The 1979 cost, at £1,158 million, represented an increase of 25 per cent on 1978.  About £110 million arose from special pay increases payable in addition to the standard increases of the Pay Agreements of 1978 and 1979.</P>
    <P>The estimates for 1980 include a sum of £1,387 million for the Exchequer cost of pay and pensions.  This includes provision for the second phase of the 1979 <Col N="718" /> Agreement and for the carry-over effect of other increases granted in 1979.</P>
    <P>With the exception of some major groups, most public servants will by now have obtained a substantial special increase in pay in the current series of such increases which commenced in 1978.  I would emphasise again that these special increases are on top of the generous standard increases arising under the 1978 and 1979 pay agreements.  Even in favourable economic circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect that special increases on this scale would take care of any anomalies or inequities as far as public servants are concerned for a number of years to come.</P>
    <P>It is therefore particularly disturbing to find fresh demands for special increases&mdash;some of them very substantial&mdash;coming from groups who have already benefited in the current series of such increases in 1978 or 1979.  I would ask those concerned to consider carefully the consequences for themselves and for the public generally of such unreasonable demands.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there would not appear to be scope from a strictly economic viewpoint for further increases in rates of pay this year.  For that reason I am most reluctant to make provision for further pay increases.  I must, in prudence, however, make some provision under this heading.  I am therefore adding to the expenditure estimates £100 million for pay and pensions.  If, in the event, this provision has to be increased, I am determined that we will not have a recurrence of last year's experience whereby such excess expenditure added to borrowing.  I shall, if necessary, introduce supplementary proposals whether by way of increasing revenue or decreasing services, to cover any excess costs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deductions from expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>I should mention at this stage that I intend to deduct from expenditure a sum of £40 million for unspent balances in the hands of Departments.</P>
    <P>There is also a relatively small saving to be made as follows.  There has been a <Col N="719" /> large increase in recent years in official foreign travel arising out of Ireland's international trading and diplomatic links and membership of various international organisations.  I am concerned to ensure, in the interests of economy, that only essential travel is undertaken and that there is no unnecessary duplication of attendance at meetings abroad, particularly those unconnected with our membership of the European Economic Community.  I have directed Departments to secure the maximum savings possible in this respect.  The amount involved&mdash;about £¼ million&mdash;may appear small relatively speaking, but it is important as an indicator of the Government's intention to keep taxation at a minimum.</P>
    <P>In effect, I have now added a net £60 million to the opening deficit on the current side of the budget.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAXATION</P>
    <P>I turn now to the subject of taxation.</P>
    <P>The overall level of taxation in Ireland, at 34 per cent of GNP in 1978, compared with an average of 40 per cent for the other EEC countries.  This relatively low level of taxation in Ireland has been made possible only by large-scale borrowing over the past five years to finance current services.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed to devising an equitable tax system as between each taxpayer and each section of the community.  It is not possible to allow each section the tax system of its choice, nor can a complex tax system be changed all at once.  The Government will endeavour to ensure that taxpayers will recognise that no one is being disproportionately burdened and particularly that no one, by evasion, passes on his burden to another.</P>
    <P>Steps have already been taken in the last two budgets to improve the position of low income taxpayers, in particular by means of large increases in the personal allowances.  The proposals in this budget will advance the Government's objectives significantly.</P>
    <P>The Government-ICTU Working Party on Taxation have devoted considerable <Col N="720" /> time to devising acceptable and factual bases of comparison of the distribution of the tax burden.  These are but the initial steps in tackling the complexities of the matter.  In order to assist the Government to assess the problem objectively and to design an equitable tax system, the Taoiseach has proposed a full-scale Commission on Taxation.  The Government envisage that the commission would discharge their task with all possible speed and might, by arrangement, provide interim reports on specific tax areas.  Significant changes need not await the conclusions of the commission, as today's budget measures will show.</P>
    <P>Within the obvious constraints that apply this year, my tax proposals should demonstrate the Government's commitment to equity in the tax system in a manner consistent with the economic and social priorities we must pursue.</P>
    <P>INCOME TAX</P>
    <P>I will deal first with personal income tax.  Of all taxes, personal income tax has most notably become a cause of widespread public unrest and dissatisfaction. I cannot in my Budget resolve all the problems associated with income tax but, when I have finished, I hope it will be clear that I have gone a long way towards an acceptable tax system&mdash;indeed probably further than most people would reasonably expect, in the present circumstances.  I am satisfied that the need to give justice and fair-play to income tax payers requires that substantial measures be taken now rather than later.</P>
    <P>In principle income tax is a fundamentally fair tax system.  Its essence is that each taxpayer pays according to his means on a common basis with everybody else in the same position and that those who are better off pay more by an appropriate amount.  The tax code also has a wide range of allowances and reliefs to cater for a varying range of social and family circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is when the tax system is allowed to drift away from the basic principle I have outlined that the public's notion of fairness and equity is offended and disquiet <Col N="721" /> about the tax system begins to mount.  This is an issue which must be faced and resolved.</P>
    <P>There are four main problems to which my proposals must address themselves:</P>
    <P>First of all, in the light of the recent Supreme Court decision, I have to deal with the taxation of married couples, particularly those where both husband and wife are earning.</P>
    <P>Next, I have to tackle the higher tax burden imposed on an increasing number of taxpayers in recent years because income increases have attracted higher rates of tax.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I think there is a need to give further reliefs to the less privileged taxpayers&mdash;those with low incomes, and particularly those with social and physical handicaps.</P>
    <P>Finally, there has been increasing unrest caused by the difference between the basis of assessment applied to wage and salary earners on PAYE and that applied to other taxpayers such as self-employed. These, as a general rule, pay tax based on profits of the accounting period ending in the preceding income tax year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Married Couples</i>
    </P>
    <P>With regard to the taxation of married couples, the Government are satisfied, in the light of recent developments, that nothing less than substantial changes in income taxation will now suffice.  We intend, therefore, to implement our undertaking to alleviate the taxation of married couples.  A narrow approach towards effecting the minimum changes to meet the Supreme Court's decision would lead to unjustifiable discrimination against the one-income family, particularly where a married woman elects to care for the family on a full time basis at home rather than take up work outside the home.</P>
    <P>Even in cases where both spouses are working, their tax liability, if nothing were done, would vary depending on how incomes were divided between them.  There would also be considerable scope for tax avoidance by self-employed and better-off taxpayers, who <Col N="722" /> could now attempt to take advantage of the Court's decision and arrange for both spouses to have an income designed to minimise liability for tax.</P>
    <P>To implement the basic principle that taxpayers with the same income and the same family and social circumstances should pay the same amount of tax, the Government have decided to implement now and in full our longer-term plans for income-splitting.  This means in effect that all married couples, whether with one or two incomes, will have the benefit of double the personal allowance and rate bands applicable to single persons.</P>

      <P>The Government are reinforced in their view that this represents a major and much needed social advance in the tax system by the views expressed by such representative bodies as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The Government believe that the introduction of this principle accords with the general needs and wishes of the community, notwithstanding the cost and the inevitable measure of tax redistribution involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main personal allowances have been increased substantially in each of the past two years and, even if unchanged, would still be higher in real terms than they were in 1977.  However, <Col N="723" /> I am providing a special Schedule E employee allowance of £400 for each PAYE taxpayer in order to improve the tax progression for these taxpayers and also to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally have at present the advantage of paying tax on a previous year basis.  I intend to exclude from this provision those Schedule E taxpayers in a position to control their own remuneration or that of their spouses, for example directors of proprietary companies.  This Schedule E employee allowance is also intended to take account of the case made by ICTU that the present general scheme of allowances discriminates against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. Where an eligible husband and wife are both earning, this allowance will apply to each income.  On the other hand, as a consequence of the introduction of income-splitting, the working wife allowance is being abolished.</P>
    <P>The higher rates of tax&mdash;or tax bands&mdash;now apply at unduly low rates of pay.  This has occured largely because, over the years, the value of the tax bands has not kept pace with inflation. Income taxation has become too progressive.  Relatively high marginal tax rates clearly contribute to inflation and affect the attitude to work and attendance at work.</P>
    <P>I have decided to tackle this problem as effectively and as fundamentally as I can.  I propose, therefore, to raise the income levels at which the tax rates from 35 per cent upwards apply.</P>
    <P>The new rate structure will be as follows: The first £1,000 of taxable income for single persons and £2,000 for married persons will be at a rate of 25 per cent; the next £4,000 for single persons and £8,000 for married persons will be at 35 per cent; the next £2,000 for single persons and £4,000 for married persons will be at 45 per cent; the next £2,000 for single persons and £4,000 for married persons will be at a new rate of 55 per cent; and the balance of taxable income, that is above £9,000 for single persons and £18,000 for married persons, <Col N="724" /> will be taxed at a rate of 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>The special allowance for PAYE taxpayers will have the effect of raising the point of application of the 25 per cent and higher tax bands by further £400, or by a further £800 where an eligible married couple are both earning.</P>
    <P>A male industrial worker on, say, just over £100 a week will get relief of about £150 if he is single and £230 if he is married.  If his wife also works and earns the average industrial female wage, the total relief for the couple will be about £500 or over 20 per cent of their tax bill.</P>
    <P>At present a married PAYE earner whose wife does not work may move from the standard, or 35 per cent rate, to 45 per cent at £122 per week.  As a result of my proposals, this will not now happen until his earnings reach not less than £243 per week.  The corresponding figure for single persons is raised from £100 to £125 a week.</P>
    <P>The new structure, at one stroke, will bring over 180,000 taxpayers, or nearly two-thirds of those at present liable at higher rates, down to the lower standard rate band.</P>
    <P>Tables which are circulated with my Financial Statement will show the relief which is granted to different categories of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It may appear that the distribution of tax relief unduly favours married couples with higher incomes, but this is an unavoidable consequence of observing the Supreme Court decision and of implementing income-splitting in full.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, a relief given to a single person is doubled for married couples. Consequently, unless single persons on relatively modest incomes were to have their income tax burden increased, married couples with high incomes had to obtain substantial tax relief.  The Government were faced with a situation in which the income of the average single male industrial worker had in many cases brought him into the 45 per cent tax band.  To remedy this situation, it was necessary to widen the standard rate tax band for single people&mdash;with a resultant double benefit for married couples.</P>
    <P>The following is an example of the effect <Col N="725" /> of my proposals on a married couple where the husband is earning £8,000 and his wife, who also works, is earning £4,000.  Between them, because both are working, they have an income of about twice the average income for single workers.  In 1979-80 they paid much more than twice the average tax of single persons and the top rate of 60 per cent applied to part of their incomes.  Their top rate of tax will now be reduced to 35 per cent and the amount of tax they pay will be twice that of two single persons each earning half their combined income of £12,000&mdash;their tax will be reduced by over £1,300.  Under my proposals, much the same relief will now be given to a single income family.</P>
    <P>The net result of the Budget proposals will be that the burden of income tax for nine out of ten single people on PAYE will now be less than it was in 1977-78. In the case of all married couples on PAYE, the burden will now be less than at any time since the introduction of the present unified system of income tax in 1974-75.  For married couples generally, the income tax structure will be at least comparable with that in the U.K. and, for the vast majority of taxpayers on lower incomes, whether single or married, it will be significantly better.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Subsidiary allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now come to deal with less privileged taxpayers.  I am concerned that liability to income tax can apply to persons on very low incomes, particularly young people just starting work and casual or part-time workers.  I cannot solve this problem completely but I am happy to go a long way in that direction by introducing complete tax exemption limits for people on low incomes, including those affected by sickness and unemployment. The exemption limits will be £1,700 for single and widowed persons and £3,400 for married persons.  There will also be marginal relief at a rate of 60 per cent for taxpayers with incomes just above the exemption limits.  As a result of this proposal, 75,000 persons who would otherwise pay tax this year will not now do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> A single person on £33 per week will be relieved of all his tax amounting to £146 per year.  A married couple on £66 per week will get full relief of £300 a year.</P>
    <P>The Government are particularly aware of the difficulties and anxieties experienced by many old persons in completing their income tax returns and complying with their tax obligations generally.  In many cases this is out of all proportion to the ultimate liability involved. For this reason, I propose to raise the age exemption limits to £2,000 and £4,000 respectively for single and married persons aged 65 years and over. Special exemption limits of £2,500 and £5,000 will be introduced for persons aged 75 years and over.  These limits will remove 8,000 old persons from the tax net, bringing to 83,000 the number of low-income taxpayers removed from liability.  Marginal relief will benefit many more.</P>
    <P>In 1969, an allowance was introduced to cover the case in which an individual, or his wife, is totally incapacitated throughout the year of assessment and a person is employed for the purpose of taking care of the incapacitated person.  I propose to double this allowance to £330.</P>
    <P>I also propose to increase the allowance for incapacitated children to double the normal child allowance.</P>
    <P>A special allowance of £250 was introduced last year for one-parent families which consist of a widowed person, a deserted spouse or an unmarried parent with a dependent child or children.  This was widely welcomed.  I am satisfied that this allowance fulfils a genuine social need and I propose to double it, to £500.</P>
    <P>The allowance for blind persons has not been increased since it was introduced in 1971.  I propose to double this allowance also to £330.  In the case of a married couple, both of whom are blind, this allowance will apply to each spouse.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Social Welfare Benefits</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have been reconsidering the planned taxation of short-term <Col N="727" /> social welfare benefits from 6 April next, which was provided for last year. The new tax exemption which I have proposed for those on lower incomes would reduce any revenue gain from the effects of making short-term social welfare benefits taxable and, moreover, the new tax structure will improve the incentive to work.  In these circumstances the Government have come to the conclusion that the proposal should not be implemented.  This change in plans will cost £8.5 million in 1980.  The necessary amendment will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In drawing up my proposals I had particular regard to the representations made by ICTU.  In many respects the effects of my proposals on individual taxpayers are quite similar to those of the ideas they had put forward.  Where there are differences, they are not, I feel, major ones.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the changes in allowances, rate bands and exemptions is £131.5 million in 1980 and £227 million in a full year.  Including the decision not to tax short-term social welfare benefits, I have now deducted £140 million in 1980 from the revenue side of the Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Self-Employed Persons</i>
    </P>
    <P>The fourth major element in my imcome tax package this year is to devise more uniform treatment of employed and self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>Self-employed persons are normally charged to income tax in any year on the basis of the profits of the accounting period ending in the preceding income tax year.  In present circumstances, when both incomes and profits are rising rapidly in money terms each year, this results in a substantial advantage to the self-employed compared with taxpayers in the PAYE sector, where tax is charged on current earnings.  It would be in the interest of greater equity if both sectors were brought to an equivalent basis of assessment as soon as possible. While there are considerable difficulties in doing this, I am examining the matter <Col N="728" /> with a view to bringing about the changes that are necessary.</P>
    <P>I have already announced that I am giving a special PAYE allowance of £400 to compensate PAYE taxpayers for the generally more favourable basis of assessment applied to other taxpayers. I now propose also to change the dates of payment for Schedule D tax on self-employed. At present this tax is payable in two instalments on 1 September and 1 January in the year of assessment.  Subject to an exception to which I shall come later, I propose to provide that all income tax other than PAYE will now be payable in one instalment on 1 October in the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>This change will yield £24 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Supreme Court Decision</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I have outlined, my tax proposals for 1980/81 take fully into account the Supreme Court decision on the taxation of married couples where both spouses are earning.  I have extended this principle to all married couples and legislation in the Finance Bill will be drafted on this basis for 1980/81 onwards.  I await the decision of the Supreme Court in regard to the issues recently opened before it to determine the further measures, if any, I might be required to adopt.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Relief in Respect of Residence-Related Work</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year a scheme was introduced, to operate for 1979/80 only, to give income tax relief, within certain limits, for the labour content of expenditure on home maintenance and improvements.  As the implementation of this scheme was affected by last year's postal dispute, I propose to continue the relief for another year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Life Assurance Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have received representations that the £1,000 limit on relief in respect of life assurance premiums, which was introduced in 1974, should be raised.  Due to the restriction to one-sixth of total income on the amount of premiums qualifying for relief, an increase in the limit would only benefit persons with incomes <Col N="729" /> over £6,000, who are already getting substantial tax relief under my Budget proposals otherwise.  However, I have decided that where a husband and wife are assessed as single persons the £1,000 limit should be applied to premiums paid by each spouse on policies on the life of either spouse. Where a couple opt for income-splitting a limit of £2,000 will apply.  This will cost £0.2 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Compensation for Loss of Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me that the existing tax exemption limit of £3,000 in respect of lump sums paid as compensation for loss of employment is too low as it has not been changed since 1964.  I propose to increase the limit to £6,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The taxation of farming profits</i>
    </P>
    <P>Developments in agriculture have generally been very favourable to our farmers since we joined the EEC.  Last year was, however, an exception.  Between 1975 and 1978, farm incomes rose by 76 per cent but in 1979 it is estimated that they fell by about 4 per cent. Proposals made recently by the EEC Commission on price fixing as part of the annual review of prices and on measures to deal with surplus production would, if approved, seriously affect our farmers, particularly those engaged in the production of milk and sugar-beet. These proposals would also seriously affect workers in the related food processing industries.  The Government have already made known their opposition to the proposals and they will continue to oppose them strenuously.</P>
    <P>A strong and developing agricultural sector is basic to the economic well-being of the nation.  Agriculture supports not only those directly engaged in farming but also the many thousands of others working in food processing and in services.  The rapid development of agriculture since we joined the EEC reflects the energy and dynamism with which our farmers have taken advantage of the opportunities opened to them through higher prices and free access to markets provided by the Common <Col N="730" /> Agricultural Policy.  Investment in land improvement and in up-to-date equipment and buildings has grown enormously&mdash;traditional methods are more and more giving way to modern sophisticated techniques of farm management and production.</P>
    <P>There is a growing realisation of the mutual interdependence between the rural and urban communities.  I am anxious that understanding between farmers and workers in general be promoted and fostered.  I am heartened by the recent meeting between the farming organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to develop such understanding and also by the support given by the unions to the recent rally against the proposed super-levy on milk.</P>
    <P>However, the proportion of tax paid by each sector has been, unfortunately, a source of division rather than understanding between them.  Since the introduction of farm taxation in 1974, taxpayers generally have felt that the amount of tax paid by farmers was less than was justified by reference to farm incomes and was not conducive to achieving equity between farmers and other sectors of the community.  It is true that, in that period, farm incomes have risen substantially and the Government last year, after lengthy consultations, announced a revised system of farm taxation to be introduced this year.</P>
    <P>Whatever differences of opinion exist on the appropriate relative share of tax paid by each sector, I believe there is universal acceptance of the principle that the amount of tax paid should reflect the income of the taxpayer.  Where there is a decline in income as was experienced by the farming community in the unfavourable conditions of last year, the estimate of yield from tax must be reduced. To do otherwise would be to add a disproportionate burden of tax to the loss of income already sustained.</P>
    <P>I do not therefore propose to insist that the yield from farm taxation in 1980 be of the same order of £100 million as was calculated before this fall in income emerged.  I am not insisting on a predetermined yield from the scheme that has been announced but I must estimate <Col N="731" /> the likely yield from that scheme as with every other revenue category.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be familiar with the scheme announced last year.  However, I feel I should outline it here again, particularly as I propose to make some adjustments to it.  These adjustments should have little or no revenue implications but should facilitate the operation of the scheme and at the same time take account of the special circumstances of the farming community.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the threshold for liability to income tax will be lowered from £50 RV to £40 RV, making a further 9,000 full-time farmers, or 36,000 in all, liable to income tax.  However, marginal relief will apply between £40 RV and £49 RV, so that a farmer with a holding of £40 RV will pay only one-tenth of his full liability, two-tenths at £41 RV and so on until the full liability becomes payable at £49 RV.</P>
    <P>All farmers who are liable to income tax will be assessed on the basis of their profits as shown in accounts.  I recognise, however, that farmers between £40 and £50 RV entering the tax system for the first time may have difficulty in preparing accounts.  Accordingly I have decided that a simplified form of accounts should be used in these cases.  The Revenue Commissioners, at my request, are consulting with the farming organisations to examine the form such simplified accounts should take.  A new mobile advisory service which I propose to provide for taxpayers generally, and to which I will refer later, should be of special assistance for farmers in this new category.</P>
    <P>As is normal when the income tax threshold is lowered, farmers entering the tax net for the first time will have the option of presenting current year's accounts rather than the normal previous year's accounts.  This option will only apply this year as the Government have decided that the tax threshold for farmers will not be further lowered within the next three years.  I think this is desirable to enable the Government to assess the operation of the scheme as it <Col N="732" /> now stands.  It will also enable farmers to plan ahead without the uncertainty in this area which can sometimes appear to act as a disincentive.</P>
    <P>The notional basis of assessment will be abolished.  The notional basis was introduced in 1974 and was designed to assist farmers who were not used to keeping accounts and in general to ease farmers into the tax system.  It has now outlived its usefulness and can no longer be justified on equity grounds since it allows some of the highest-earning farmers to pay tax on only a fraction of their real incomes.</P>
    <P>As announced, a restriction of capital allowances to 30 per cent of net profit before deduction of capital allowances was to apply where accelerated allowances are claimed.  However, as I am anxious to encourage investment for further development and increased productivity, I have decided that the restriction should be confined to plant and machinery only.  This means that the restriction will not apply to farm buildings or to farm works such as land reclamation or fencing.</P>
    <P>Over investment in plant and machinery inspired by tax avoidance is not in farmers' own best interest; nor is it in the best interest of the community as a whole since the bulk of farm machinery has to be imported to the detriment of our balance of payments.  In addition, there is not a limitless pool of available credit for agriculture and wastefully soaking up an undue amount on plant and machinery which is not sufficiently employed to pay its way deprives other more deserving and productive areas of the necessary funds.  The restriction, which will not affect ordinary wear and tear allowances, represents merely a deferment to later years of part of the extra capital allowances.  It should not affect genuine investment which is so important to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>As regards rates on land, which was another element of the scheme, the Minister for the Environment has already announced that he will shortly introduce the necessary legislation to lower the cut-off point for rates relief under <Col N="733" /> the agricultural grant from £60 RV to £40 RV.  The cut-off point will remain at £40 RV for three years.</P>
    <P>The scheme announced last year provided that full-time farmers would no longer pay their income tax in a single payment on 1 January, but rather in two instalments on 1 September and 1 January in the same way as other Schedule D taxpayers.  I have already announced that a single payment date of 1 October is to be introduced this year for Schedule D taxpayers generally.</P>
    <P>However, if this were applied to full-time farmers, it would mean that they would pay two years' tax in 1980&mdash;their full 1979-80 tax under the existing single-payment date system on 1 January last, and their full 1980-81 tax under the new single-payment date for Schedule D taxpayers on 1 October.  I have decided to avoid this in the interest of equity in their case.  I intend instead to postpone the payment of the first instalment of 1980-81 income tax to 1 October to coincide with the single payment date of other Schedule D taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The resource tax on all holdings of £70 R V and over at a rate of £3.50 per £ RV will be introduced from 6 April 1980.  It had been intended that this tax would have been payable in one instalment on 1 September.  But, in line with what I have already indicated in relation to income tax, I propose that this date should be 1 October.  Marginal relief will apply to holdings between £70 RV and £79 RV.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, I must provide in my budget, as in all other cases, for an estimate of the revenue yield from the farm tax scheme.  Accordingly, the estimated 1980 yield will now be £86 million, consisting of £33 million from income tax, £46 million from rates on land and £7 million from the resource tax.  This compares with £16 million from income tax and £36 million from rates on land in 1979.</P>
    <P>The income tax reliefs which I announced earlier will, of course, apply also to farmers.</P>
    <P>This scheme of farm taxation is designed to move towards equity between taxpayers and indeed between farmers. <Col N="734" /> I think that farmers themselves will recognise that it is in the interest of the farming community generally that farmers with sufficiently high incomes actually pay&mdash;and be seen to be paying&mdash;their fair share of tax from the income which they have.  As I indicated to the farming organisations in my consultations with them, the operation of this revised scheme now being introduced will be kept under review in the interest of equity and in the light of experience of its operation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have received numerous representations on the question of the liability of farmers to capital acquisitions tax, that is gift tax and inheritance tax, on the transfer of the family farm.  Many farmers have been concerned about their possible liability to the tax in view of the big increase in land prices since the tax was introduced in 1976.  Because of this land price rise the market value of many farms has in recent times been substantially higher than their income-earning capacity.</P>
    <P>Despite a tendency lately for market prices to reduce more in line with use value and thereby easing this concern I have decided to increase the upper limit of the special agricultural relief from £100,000 to £150,000 in the Finance Bill, with effect from 1 April next.  This will mean that the market value of agricultural property for the purposes of the tax may be reduced by up to £150,000 for farmer beneficiaries, thereby directly relieving the problem caused by the land price rise.  The cost in the current year of this change will not be significant because of the time lag between liability and payment.  I firmly hope that this concession will act as a real incentive to transfers of farms to the younger generation of the farming community, and thereby promote productivity and increase the income from family farms&mdash;to the benefit of the whole economy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ADVISORY SERVICE FOR TAXPAYERS</P>
    <P>It has been my experience and, I am sure, that of many Deputies that many <Col N="735" /> taxpayers are bewildered about tax and find it difficult to come to grips with the complexity of the workings of the tax system.  This may cause unnecessary apprehension which, in my opinion, can be overcome if the taxpayer could have access to an advisory service.  Some people may not be aware that such a service is already provided in tax offices and is widely availed of.  I have now arranged, in addition, for the acquisition by the Revenue Commissioners of a mobile tax advisory office.  This unit should be ready in a few months and will provide an advisory service for those not resident near tax offices.  I stress that this service will be purely for advisory work, to enable individual taxpayers who need it to have direct access to advice, free of charge.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Stock Relief</i>
      </P>
      <P>Stock relief was introduced as a temporary measure in 1975 in order to assist firms in certain sectors in coping with the effects of inflation on the cost of replacing stocks.  Under present legislation, stock relief is available in respect of accounting periods ending before 6 April 1979.</P>
      <P>The 1979 budget continued the relief for a further year at a rate of three-quarters of that previously allowed.  I have decided that the relief should be continued for a further year at the level obtaining in 1979.  This will cost the Exchequer £3 million in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" />
      <i>Special Incentive for Manufacturing Companies</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1977 Budget introduced an incentive scheme whereby manufacturers showing certain improvements in output and employment could benefit from a special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax.  The scheme, whose terms were made more favourable in 1978, covered the years 1977, 1978 and 1979.</P>
    <P>I have decided to extend the scheme to 1980 pending the introduction of the new 10 per cent rate for manufacturing profits generally.  As Deputies are aware, a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will come into operation as from 1 January 1981 and will run to the end of the year 2000.  Provision will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill to give effect to this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Entertainment Expenses</i>
    </P>
    <P>Considerable disquiet has been caused by the fact that many business concerns are seen to entertain on an unduly lavish scale, ostensibly for the purpose of building up the goodwill required to secure and retain customers.  The stricter test for determining the admissibility of expenditure incurred for business entertainment which was introduced in 1973 does not appear to be having the desired effects.  Unnecessary entertainment not only entails a subsidy from the taxpayer but also arouses a sense of inequity in the minds of those taxpayers who cannot afford to indulge in it themselves.  Accordingly I propose to limit the allowance for business entertainment expenses for tax purposes to 50 per cent in future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Contribution to Taxation by Financial Institutions</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am conscious of the vital role which the financial institutions play in providing for the requirements of industry and commerce as well as individuals. The question nevertheless arises as to whether the contribution to taxation by these institutions is fair and equitable having regard to the contribution being made by individuals to income taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> Intricate problems and interests other than those of the financial institutions themselves are involved and I am at present reviewing the matter.  At the same time, I feel that this whole field might well benefit from the type of close and objective study which could be given to it by the proposed Commission on Taxation. I will consider, therefore, asking the Commission, as soon as it is set up, to carry out such an investigation as a matter of urgency and, if practicable, to deal with the question by way of an interim report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Contribution to Taxation by Other Companies</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have considered, as a general matter of tax equity, the desirability of bringing forward the time of payment of tax by companies in the light of the change now proposed in relation to individual taxpayers other than PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This could be justified in equity, but I am also conscious of the effect which such measures could have on liquidity and investment in present circumstances. While keeping the matter under review, I have decided to defer making such a change for the present.  I have also in mind that it would be useful if the proposed Taxation Commission were to investigate the contribution to taxation by companies at large and I would propose to ask them to include it in their programme of work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Indirect Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is of course no escaping the fact that the income tax improvements and social welfare improvements being announced today must be met from taxation and the only realistic source for the vast bulk of this is indirect taxation. There is no scope through other forms of income taxation or of direct taxation otherwise for raising the amounts involved.</P>
    <P>Pursuing the general social orientation of my proposals, I have concentrated my indirect tax proposals on discretionary expenditure as far as possible.  In this way, the impact will be minimised on the necessities of life, and therefore on households and individuals whose means <Col N="738" /> and commitments are such as to allow of only limited discretionary expenditure.</P>
    <P>There are of course limits to the extent to which the wide range of essential public services can be financed from highly selective taxation, but my purpose has been to travel this road as far as I can.</P>
    <P>The one area where I have felt obliged to tax less discretionary expenditure has been oil products and related headings. Energy considerations, balance of payments considerations, and of course revenue considerations all arise here. The balance of payments and budgetary needs I have already explained.  We simply have to reduce our dependence on highly priced imported oils.  Our pattern of usage of private motor transport in particular derives from an era when our roads and streets were less congested and when the human, environmental and financial costs of our habits were of little consequence.  It is vitally important for economic, social and environmental reasons that we rationalise our consumption habits.  Car-pooling, use of public transport, good driving habits and staggered arrangements for delivery of goods to congested urban and city areas can all play a major role in relieving the obvious problems and ensure that motor transport can once again be an unqualified social and economic benefit for all.  Some recovery of the lost ground of latter years in petrol taxation is clearly called for, together with a greater balance in taxation of oil products generally.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Hydrocarbon Oils</i>
    </P>
    <P>Excise on all of the hydrocarbon oils has not been increased since 1976, and road diesel has remained at its present level since 1969.  I propose the following increases.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Petrol, Road Diesel and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) used in Motor Vehicles</i>
    </P>
    <P>First, I propose an increase of 20p per gallon for petrol, road diesel and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) used in motor vehicles. Revenue considerations demand that no undue encouragement be given <Col N="739" /> to switching away from the more highly taxed petrol.</P>
    <P>The rebate for diesel oil used in buses on services scheduled in accordance with the relevant legislation will be increased appropriately so that bus fares will not be affected.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the special case of handicapped drivers, a concern which I believe the public share. In order to avoid imposing additional taxation on these drivers&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am arranging that the rebate to them will be increased by the full amount of the duty.  In addition, I am increasing from 450 to 600 gallons the annual rebate quota allowed to these drivers.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Other Oils</i>
      </P>
      <P>I have given very careful considration to the effects an increase in the duty on &ldquo;other oils&rdquo; might have on different categories of users, to energy conservation and to the alternative tax measures which might be otherwise required.  I have decided that it would be appropriate, taking all the relevant factors into account, as they affect both individuals and industrial concerns, to propose an increase of 5p per gallon on these oils.  By way of extension of an existing concession, producers with glasshouses of a minimum area of one quarter of an acre and mushroom growers with not less than 3,000 square feet of cultivation area will be rebated 3p of this 5p increase.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue in 1980 from the tax increases on hydrocarbon oils is estimated at £113 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" />
      <i>Private Motor Vehicles</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the light of what I have already said, additional taxation on private motor vehicles also clearly falls to be considered.  I propose that the excise duty on private motor vehicles, including motor cycles, should be increased from 35 per cent to 40 per cent.  This can be expected to result in an increase of about 3½ per cent in the retail price.  The estimated revenue yield in 1980 is £9.2 million.</P>
    <P>The total yield in 1980 from the foregoing proposals for tax increases would be £122.2 million.  This would be far short of what is required to finance the cost of the reliefs in direct taxation so I must turn at this point to what are popularly known as the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;.  In doing so I am encouraged by the fact that these are discretionary expenditures, and expenditures not without their social undertones in some cases.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tobacco Products</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am proposing a tax increase of 10p in the retail price of the packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for cigars and other tobacco products. These increases are estimated to bring in extra revenue of £19.0 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Spirits</i>
    </P>
    <P>An additional 16p tax is proposed in the retail price of a glass of spirits.  This will mean an extra 8p on the normal half-glass measure.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £14.0 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Beer</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of 6p is proposed in the tax element in the retail price of the pint of beer.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £30.8 million in 1980.</P>

      <i>Wine and Made Wine</i>
    </P>
    <P>An increase of 40p is proposed in the tax element in the retail price of a bottle of table wine.  The increase will be <i>pro rata</i> for stronger wines, and for sparkling wines the proposed increase is 80p per bottle.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cider and Perry</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following the restructuring of the excise duty on cider and perry in the 1979 Budget, I propose a modest increase of 10p in the tax element of the retail price of the gallon of ordinary cider.  The change represents an increase of roughly 2p in the price of the ordinary flagon of cider.  The highest strength will bear excise duty at the new rate proposed for &ldquo;made wine&rdquo;, while cider and perry of intermediate strength will be increased by 55p a gallon.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Table Waters</i>
    </P>
    <P>The existing rate of excise duty of 10p per gallon on table waters has not been altered since 1975.  I propose to increase the tax element in the retail price per gallon by 30p.</P>
    <P>The new rate will be equivalent to:</P>
    <P>6.6p on the family sized bottle (1 litre), 2.2p on the 12 oz. can and 0.7p on the 4 oz. mixer.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the effects this increase could have on the smaller manufacturers of mineral waters so I propose to increase the existing rebate provision <i>pro rata.</i>  The new level of rebate will be:</P>
      <P>12.4p on the first 20,000 gallons of output and</P>
      <P>6.2p on the next 80,000 gallons of output.</P>
      <P>The increases proposed for tobacco, alcoholic drinks and table waters is estimated to bring in extra revenue totalling £75.8 million in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> VALUE ADDED TAX</P>
    <P>I consider in the special circumstances of this year and particularly from a balance of payments point of view that some more general constraint on expenditure is needed.  The Government gave careful consideration to the question of some fundamental alterations in value-added tax.  They decided, for reasons of social concern, that the present zero and 10 per cent categories should remain unaltered but that an increase in the 20 per cent rate to 25 per cent would be justified and least likely to cause hardship.  This will take effect from I May 1980.  The additional revenue expected in 1980 from this change is £17.75 million.</P>
    <P>I turn now to other, less general, excise and other duties where an upward adjustment of tax is necessary and appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Televisions and Gramophone Records</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is proposed that the specific duty of £69 on the top category of colour TV sets will be increased by £10 with <i>pro rata</i> increases for all other categories of colour and monochrome sets.  It is also intended to increase the excise duty on gramophone records from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;Cigarette&rdquo; Lighters</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am aware that for some time now there has been a rapid growth in the sale of disposable cigarette lighters.  Lighters are not subject to excise duty while matches are.  Notwithstanding the fact that lighters attract VAT at a higher rate, the overall taxation favours lighters. For this reason I propose that a new excise duty of 20p per lighter be imposed on all lighters.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duty on Cheques</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to increase in the Finance Bill the stamp duty on cheques from 1p to 3p.  The 1p rate has applied since February 1971.</P>
    <P>These three changes will yield an extra £1.6 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Minor Excise Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is a large number of miscellaneous licences issued which bear an <Col N="743" /> excise duty.  They relate mainly to the alcoholic drinks industry and to auctioneering, betting and gaming, as well as to many other activities.  I am having these examined with a view to increasing the duty, where appropriate, in order to bring them up to a realistic level in present-day terms or, at least, to cover the present-day costs of administering them.  I would intend to make the bulk of these changes in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already decided to increase the licence duty on gaming machines.  The proposed new rate is £100 for a full licence for each machine and £25 for a quarter year.  I am increasing the reduced rate licence to £16.50 a quarter, but at the same time extending it to cover Saturdays as well as Sundays and public holidays.  I also intend to provide in the Finance Bill for an increase in the licence duty for gaming premises from £100 to £200.</P>
    <P>I also propose to double the existing rates for firearm certificates.  The new rate, for example, for a shotgun will now be £6.50 a year.</P>
    <P>The additional revenue in this area of miscellaneous licence duties is estimated at £1.2 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>I turn to two further revenue proposals, one affecting outdoor and the other indoor recreation.  I feel I voice a commonly held view when I say that racecourse betting and dancing might be called on to make a contribution to revenue needs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>On-course Betting</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is a wide differential between the 20 per cent excise duty which applies to off-course betting and the 6 per cent levy which operates for on-course betting with bookmakers.  I am having the general role of the latter levy in the financing of the racing industry reviewed but in the meantime I propose to impose a stamp duty of 1½ per cent on on-course betting with bookmakers, the proceeds to accrue to the Exchequer rather than to the racing industry as in the case of the levy.  The benefit to the <Col N="744" /> Exchequer in 1980 is estimated at £0.5 million.  Betting on the tote will be unaffected by this change.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dances</i>
    </P>
    <P>Dances, discos, cabarets, dinner-dances and the like comprise one area which can bear an additional element of taxation.  I am considering the various alternatives which may be open to me in this respect and I would intend to bring forward firm proposals at an early date.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the area of excises, there are two subsidiary matters I would like to mention.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small Brewers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The first is the small brewers scheme which, by way of concession, I am continuing for a further year at a cost of £160,000 in 1980.  The scheme, introduced in the 1978 budget, readjusts the incidence of excise duty on beer so that the smaller producers bear a somewhat lesser rate of duty while the larger producers pay somewhat more.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deferment of Excise Duty on Spirits</i>
    </P>
    <P>The second matter concerns the way manufacturers of spirits pay excise duty. The duty is paid at the end of the month following that in which spirits are released from bond, except for the month of March when the payment may not be deferred.  This catch-up arrangement is a hang-over from the old April to March financial year.  I propose to replace it with a similar arrangement which would operate in December.</P>
    <P>This has the once-off advantage from the budgetary point of view of bringing forward to this year the duty which would have been deferred to end-January 1981.  The gain to the Exchequer in 1980 is estimated at £8.3 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Motor Vehicle Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>My next proposals concern motor vehicle duties and relate back, to some extent, to the duty increases on petrol and oils; they have both conservation and revenue implications.  I propose</P>
    <P>&mdash;  an increase in the initial and annual registration charges for cars of 16 <Col N="745" /> horse power and under from £5 to £10;</P>
    <P>&mdash;  an increase in the charges for motor cycles from £1 to £5; &mdash;  an increase in the annual charge on excavators, agricultural tractors and other agricultural vehicles to £10;</P>
    <P>&mdash;  an increase in the driving licence fee from £2 per annum to £3 per annum.</P>
    <P>The new rates will apply from 1 April 1980.  The extra yield in 1980 from these changes will be about £3.5 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POST OFFICE CHARGES</P>
    <P>The proposals I have presented to the House relate to what is technically described as tax revenue.  I turn now to a matter which concerns the non-tax revenue, namely, Post Office charges.</P>
    <P>In principle, the Post Office services are expected to pay their way but, in fact, they have been incurring a heavy commercial loss.  In 1978 the overall deficit was £19 million and, in 1979, £29 million, notwithstanding the increase in charges in that year.  The deficits would not have been so high were it not for the lengthy strikes in those two years.  The full year effect of last year's increases in charges plus increases in traffic might have been expected to improve the position in 1980; but the increases have been more than eaten up by the sharply rising costs of the services.  At present charges, the overall loss could be £33 million in 1980 and greater still in 1981.</P>
    <P>The deficits on Post Office services have to be met from general taxation.  It is out of the question to expect taxpayers generally to continue to carry such heavy losses.  Charges for telecommunication services will therefore be increased from 1 July next and postal charges from 1 May.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will announce the details later.</P>
    <P>The estimated yield this year from the increases in cash terms is £17 million. <Col N="746" /> They will not eliminate the deficit.  On the basis of present pay and other costs, the commercial accounts will still carry a deficit of about £9 million at end-1980. A further increase in charges cannot be ruled out next year depending on increases in pay or other costs.</P>
    <P>The total of the revenue increases which I have detailed is £289 million. When set against the cost of tax reliefs of £143 million and the net addition of £60 million to the expenditure side of the Budget, I am left with £86 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FOOD SUBSIDIES</P>
    <P>It continues to be the Government's belief that food subsidies applying as they do irrespective of individual need do not sufficiently discriminate in favour of the less well-off sections of the community. We gave very full consideration, therefore, to the question of further reducing them in line with our declared intentions.  However, because difficult economic circumstances impinge most severely on the least prosperous, we have decided, in their interest, to maintain the present levels of subsidy for a further year.  In the meantime, the Government will be actively searching for a more effective way of using the food subsidy funds to help this section of the community.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>While every section of society awaits the Budget with a keen sense of interest, the interest of social welfare recipients is more deeply personal.  It is my purpose in this Budget to maintain the momentum of social and economic development, particularly through a common adherence to acceptable standards in the community.  An adequate social welfare provision is not just necessary in its own right but as clear evidence to the people of a fundamental Government commitment in this area.  Today, I am announcing measures which, despite the difficult background to the Budget, will demonstrate the Government's care and concern for the most vulnerable in society.  These major improvements in the income of the less well-off are a central <Col N="747" /> element in this Budget.  I confidently believe that they will be endorsed as such by the community at large.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Weekly Social Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am happy therefore to announce that, in addition to continuing the temporary increases given last October which represented some 6 per cent on average on weekly rates, there will be further substantial increases in April in weekly rates of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Existing long-term weekly rates&mdash; which include contributory and non-contributory old age pensions, widow's pensions, invalidity pensions and deserted wife's benefit and allowance, and health allowances such as the incapacitated person's maintenance allowance&mdash;will be increased by 25 per cent.  As a result there will be weekly increases of £4.90 and £4.20, respectively, in the maximum personal rates, under 80, for old age pensions contributory and non-contributory. There will be an increase of £8.55 a week in the present maximum contributory old age pension for a married couple both of whom are of pension age and under 80; for a married couple both of whom are under 80 and on old age non-contributory pension the weekly increase will be £8.40.  A contributory widow with three children will get £9.00 a week extra, while a non-contributory widow with the same number of children will get a weekly increase of £8.40.</P>
    <P>Short-term weekly rates&mdash;which include unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit, maternity allowances and supplementary welfare allowances&mdash;will be increased from their present levels by 20 per cent.  For a married man with three children on unemployment benefit this will mean a weekly increase&mdash;exclusive of payrelated benefit&mdash;of £8.40; and in the case of a married man with three children on unemployment assistance (urban rate) the increase will be £7.40 per week.  For a woman on maternity allowance the weekly increase will be <Col N="748" /> £3.40 while for a married man with three children on supplementary welfare allowance the weekly increase will be £7.25.</P>
    <P>Full details of the various increases, together with certain miscellaneous improvements, are to be found in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Compared with the rates of benefit in operation last April, the new weekly rates of benefit which will operate from next April will be on average 31 per cent higher in the case of long-term rates and 26 per cent in the case of short-term rates.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Children's Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>Children's allowances, as an income supplement, particularly for hard-pressed mothers and families, are an important element in the range of our social benefits.  Despite recent speculation to the contrary, it has never been this Government's intention to cut back on these allowances.  In fact, our intention has always been not alone to improve them but to ensure that this improvement went above all to those families for whom the allowances were an important item of income.  For the second year in succession therefore, the Government have decided to increase the level of all children's allowances as from 1 July next.  The allowance for the first child will be increased by £1 per month and for the second and each subsequent child by £1.50 per month.  To ensure that these increases will be directed to those in greatest need, the income tax child allowance will be reduced from £218, as at present, to £195.</P>
    <P>The increase in the Social Welfare Children's Allowance will cost £9 million in 1980 and £18 million in a full year.  Against this there will be an offset of £3.1 million this year and £5.2 million in a full year from the reduction in the income tax child allowance.  The net effect will be that those not liable to tax will of course gain in full from the increases and the biggest gain for taxpayers will be for those in the lower income categories.</P>
    <P>For example, a married couple with 3 children on a wage of £66 per week or <Col N="749" /> less, and who will now have no tax liability as a result of today's measures, will get the full benefit of improved children's allowances which for them will come to £48 in a full year, or nearly £1 per week.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment Assistance for Smallholders</i>
    </P>
    <P>Smallholders in specified western areas drawing unemployment assistance have the option of having their means assessed on a factual basis or a notional basis.  The vast bulk of smallholders are on a notional basis which, in effect, is concessionary both by reference to present levels of farm income and to the means test applied to other unemployment assistance claimants.  The Government have therefore decided that the rates of unemployment assistance paid to persons who opt for the notional system of means assessment will be maintained at their October 1979 level.</P>
    <P>The gross Exchequer cost of the social welfare and health changes I have announced is estimated at £95 million in 1980 and £126.4 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Abuse of the System</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's concern for the needy which has motivated these exceptional increases requires that the benefits be conserved for those who are genuinely entitled to them.  Any abuse will be vigorously and firmly pursued by the Government, but our effort must be supported by a consensus in our society in favour of the necessary actions.  We will not reduce expenditure for the needy because of abuse by others.  Consequently, we will be redoubling our efforts against those who abuse the system.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the Minister for Social Welfare implemented a number of measures to control abuses of the unemployment and disability schemes.  He has set up a special investigation unit and he has strengthened the panel of medical referees.  In addition, closer control of unemployment payments is now possible because of improved liaison with the national manpower service for the placement of unemployed persons in jobs.  Action <Col N="750" /> is also being directed at cases of &ldquo;working and signing&rdquo; and persons whose incapacity for work through alleged illness is suspect.  All cases of fraud will be strongly pursued.</P>
    <P>All of these actions are designed to ensure that the taxpayer's money, intended for the relief of the needy, will be directed to them and them alone.  As we expect the taxpayer to endorse the application of his tax for these social purposes, he is entitled to expect us to see that it is not misapplied.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAX EVASION</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the matter of abuse of the social services.  This brings me to the even graver matter of abuse of the tax system in various forms.</P>
    <P>The changes I have made in the income tax structure represent a major effort to make it a just and equitable system.  It is no less important that the system should be seen to be enforced fairly and equitably.  The vast majority of citizens co-operate in a public-spirited manner in paying their taxes but there is unfortunately a minority in the community who do not act in this way.  By evading payment of taxes they pass on their share of the burden to their fellow citizens who in many cases may be less well-off and less well able to pay tax.  The taxes payable by our community are imposed in the name of the community and are expended on purpose determined by the community in a democratic process. Evasion of those taxes cannot be condoned by specious argument.</P>
    <P>The tax evader, insofar as he engages in deliberate infringement of the law through fraud, misrepresentation and false declarations, can expect the full rigour of the law to be applied against him.  I wish to reassure taxpayers that in all such cases prosecutions will be brought by the Revenue Commissioners instead of their seeking discreet settlements. Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of cases where proceedings were initiated.</P>
    <P>While a person engaged in tax avoidance may feel he is operating <Col N="751" /> within the law, the margin between avoidance and evasion in many cases is no more than hairline.  I would like it to be understood by those engaged in schemes of tax avoidance, particularly schemes which have no real economic or commercial justification, that the operation of such schemes will not be immune from changes in the law.</P>
    <P>There are people who are avoiding paying taxes because their business activity has not come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners.  Last year the provision of additional staff enabled the Revenue Commissioners to set up special enquiry units with an emphasis on outdoor investigation, to uncover traders and landlords and providers of services and others whose business is not on record for tax purposes or whose scale of business is not fully reflected in tax returns.  In recent months 6,150 such cases have been uncovered.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on all persons engaged in business to complete tax returns.  If they do not, they must realise that when discovered, the transactions of previous years will be reopened and arrears of taxes, together with any appropriate interest and penalties, will be fully recovered from them.</P>
    <P>Very considerable changes have been made in recent years in the legal powers of the Revenue Commissioners to deal with tax evasion and omission to provide information.  These powers are now being used by the Revenue Commissioners to protect the interests of the vast bulk of the community who are paying their share of taxation and, if it seems necessary to strengthen the law further, I will have no hesitation in putting forward new proposals for legislation.</P>
    <P>If every wage earner has his tax calculated precisely on his income and deducted at source, surely justice and equity require that the self-employed and professional classes should also disclose their income fully and pay their tax accordingly. As Minister for Finance, I feel an obligation to ensure that all taxpayers receive the same treatment and I will make available to the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="752" /> all necessary resources to implement this principle.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SPECIAL FEATURES</P>
    <P>I propose now a number of measures which, although relatively insignificant in themselves in a budgetary or financial sense, are intended to recognise in an explicit way certain important factors in our national life.</P>
    <P>VETERANS OF THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE</P>
    <P>Because of the role they played in the foundation of the State, veterans of the War of Independence are an especially deserving section of our community.  We have a duty, within our resources, to do whatever is necessary in order to protect them from financial hardship.  I propose, therefore, to provide certain additional reliefs for them and for their widows.</P>
    <P>First, I propose to exempt their military service pensions from income tax in recognition of the fact that such pensions are payable in respect of active service rendered during the War of Independence.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as matters stand at present, payment of special allowances cease on the death of the holder, in contrast with the position of a military service pension. I am now arranging for the payment of a flat-rate annual allowance of £185 to the widows of special allowance holders who would not otherwise qualify for any allowance under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, and with the same object in mind, I am extending the free electricity allowance and free television licence arrangements to widows of veterans who at present stand to lose these concessions on the death of the veteran.</P>
    <P>The exemption of military service pensions from income tax will come into force from 6 April 1980 and the remaining concessions will take effect from 1 July 1980.  The estimated cost in the current year will be £0.6 million and in a full year would amount to £1.1 million.</P>

Táim tar éis an cheist a phlé le hAire na Gaeltachta agus is é ár dtuairim go mbéadh cúrsa tarraingteach ar an teilifís agus ar an radio ina chuidiú mhór don phobal chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus iad a chur á labhairt.  Ba mhaith linn freisin dá bhféadfaí socruithe a dhéanamh chun tús a chur leis an gcúrsa an fómhar seo chugainn agus daoine a thabhairt le chéile ina mbuíonta beaga ar fud na tíre d'fhonn an leas is fearr a bhaint as.</P>
    <P>Beidh comhoibriú á lorg ag Aire na Gaeltachta ó dhreamanna éagsúla mar Radio-Telefís Éireann, Bord na Gaeilge, údaráis oideachais agus eagrais Ghaeilge.  Ó mo thaobhsa de, tá suim £100,000 á cur in áirithe agam le cur leis an soláthar atá ar fáil cheana féin d'Aire na Gaeltachta, i dtreo go mbeidh ar a cumas féachaint chuige nach gcuirfear moill ar an dul chun cinn de cheal airgid.

    <P>Táthar ag iarraidh ar an Aire Airgeadais le roinnt blian anuas cáin bhreisluacha&mdash;nó VAT&mdash;a bhaint de chamáin.  Ní féidir liom áfach sin a dhéanamh toisc cosc ginearálta a bheith i bfeidhm ag an gComh-Mhargadh Eorpach le tamall anuas ar aon rud eile a scaoileadh ó VAT seachas na rudaí nár ghá cáin a íoc orthu sular tháinig an cosc i bhfeidhm.  Ach tuigim cé chomh <Col N="754" /> costasach is atá camáin, agus gur minic a bristear iad, agus tuigim freisin an tábhacht ar leith atá ag dul leis an iománaíocht i saol agus i dtraidisiún ár dtíre.

      <P Just="Center">DEFICIT AND BORROWING REQUIREMENT</P>
      <P>With these minor additions to expenditure, I come to the end of the specific actions which I am taking in this budget. To recapitulate briefly, these changes have all been made on the current side of the budget.  I opened with a deficit of £346 million based on the pre-budget estimates of receipts and expenditure.  My proposals for additional revenue will yield an estimated £292 million, in all, this year.  This will finance £143 million of tax reliefs, £95 million of improvements in the social welfare services, £100 million for public service pay, less £40 million of departmental balances available towards expenditure.  The net result is that the deficit on the current budget emerges at £353 million&mdash;compared with an actual deficit of £522 million last year.  It is my firm intention to resist any attempts by Departments to exceed the limits of the allocations provided for their estimates.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1980 will be comprised, therefore, of £353 million for the current budget deficit and £543 million for capital purposes.  At £896 million in all, or 10.4 per cent of GNP as projected post-budget, it compares with borrowing last year of £1,009 million or 13.7 per cent of GNP.  It is worth noting that this year's current budget deficit at £353 million represents 4.1 per cent of GNP by comparison with a deficit of £522 million, 7.1 per cent of GNP, last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> As Deputies will note, the effect on demand and the balance of payments of the policies underlying this Budget will be achieved through restraint in expenditure, combined with some net increase in taxation.  The result of the Government's proposals will be, as planned, to reduce the balance of payments deficit. Because of a number of other constraints, including in particular the desirability of not damaging the economy's potential for growth and employment, the reduction will not be dramatic but it is an earnest of the Government's firm resolve to bring our external account back into reasonable balance.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</P>
    <P>Responsibility and balance in the management of our affairs underlie this Budget.  These qualities will continue to characterise our economic policies for some time to come.  This does not mean that the progress that has been achieved since this Government came to office is being set aside.  For over two years there has been an impressive expansion in investment, both in the public and private sectors; across the board in Government expenditure, emphasis has been placed on better education, on training and retraining, on raising productivity, on better marketing of our goods and on raising the level of economic performance. The means of continued future progress have been created.  Prudent management of the national finances, rather than putting these gains at risk, is a necessary condition of taking advantage of them and benefiting from them.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to use fiscal measures positively, in line with the needs of development, rather than negatively simply to offset adverse economic trends.  The continuing work of reassessing future expectations for the economy and the identification of policy changes that might be necessary will be guided by this objective.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="756" /> CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>Before outlining the specific budget proposals, I indicated a number of major areas where I saw the need to make substantial progress.  I have put forward my proposals in the confidence that they go a long way towards meeting this need, by implementing income-splitting, by protecting and indeed enhancing the position of low-income households, and by making substantial progress towards equity generally and in particular in the field of taxation.</P>
    <P>Of course I do not delude myself that the budget proposals together with the estimates of expenditure on current and capital account, will satisfy all sections of the community.  At the very best of times, there will exist a conflict between the various demands for increased expenditure on the one hand and for tax reliefs on the other.  I believe that the budget strikes a proper and realistic balance between these competing demands.</P>
    <P>Doubtless there will be critics who will focus on one or other aspect of the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would only ask that the total package of measures should be examined carefully before conclusions are reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who may say that more should have been done this year to reduce Exchequer borrowing.  We were not prepared, however, to allow the need for budget stringency to override the necessity to move towards tax equity and to protect and improve the circumstances of the less well-off, whether in employment or dependent on social welfare.  The initial progress made this year towards bringing our finances into balance will clearly have to be built upon in coming years.  Similarly, to attempt to remedy our balance of payments difficulties in one move would mean forcing the economy into marked recession, and that I am not prepared to do.  This <Col N="757" /> economy, like others, needs time to adjust to the massive increase in oil prices.</P>
    <P>In adopting this gradualist approach I am keenly aware of the continued pressing need for growth in output and employment.</P>
    <P>The Budget will not hit the sources of growth and employment.  Investment, supported by the Public Capital Programme, will continue to grow, as will exports.  The volume of national output will also grow, although less quickly than in 1979, partly because international economic conditions will be more adverse.</P>
    <P>The necessary restraint in public expenditure will not, of course, allow the Government to continue to take the lead, through the public sector, in job creation, as we did over the past two-and-a-half years.  We are at the same time acutely aware of the need to do everything possible to maintain and increase employment.  This is seen in our decision to increase the State's investment in industrial promotion by £30 million this year.  The bulk of this increase is being made available to the IDA and will, we believe, enable the Authority to achieve their target of 30,000 new job approvals in 1980 and so help to guarantee the future employment prospects of our young people.</P>
    <P>We have likewise made a very large provision for infrastructural development, and this investment in our future should similarly stimulate employment creation.</P>
    <P>Consumer prices will, of course, be affected by the Budget changes.  The prices that will rise will, however, be very largely those relating to discretionary expenditure or to energy consumption.  In any assessment of their impact, regard must be had to the very real increases in incomes which will result from the markedly higher social welfare benefits, and the substantial reductions in direct tax liability, which I have announced today. The fact is that in our circumstances <Col N="758" /> we are compelled, for reasons of budgetary balance, and because of our balance of payments deficit, to increase taxation.  Direct tax cuts have to be financed by other taxation; it would be grossly irresponsible and dishonest of us to pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>The need for moderation in income developments remains paramount.  I have already made the point that, as a community, it is not a realistic option for us to compensate ourselves for the rising cost of oil imports.  Equally selfdestructive in terms of competitiveness, and therefore of employment and living standards, would be any attempt to use as a basis for income increases the indirect tax measures announced by me today. These are, in fact, designed to cover the cost of the reforms and benefits contained in the Budget.</P>
    <P>This is a realistic Budget, which recognises that a significant start has to be made on resolving the problems we face.  I believe it will help to point the direction which all of us can follow&mdash;benefits for the needy, opportunity for the able and a conscientious dedication at work for all.</P>
    <P>There is a growing if belated recognition abroad of the interdependence of rich and poor nations and the need to redress the balance in the face of the shifting foundations of the world economy.  I have attempted in the Budget to apply the same principle of interdependence to the situation here at home.  Each of us has a choice in relation to many of the additional taxes proposed today but no one of us is entitled to a choice between community responsibility and self-interest.  If the strong assert themselves at the expense of the weak, we are all diminished and weakened.  If, on the other hand, we agree to accept standards which we can all respect, we will be united in a common purpose.  And we have a common purpose&mdash;guaranteeing the well-being and future of all of our people.</P>

      <P>For the third year running the Fianna Fáil Party have got it wrong.  Having damaged the economy by the publication before the last general election of their manifesto, they have not, after three years, turned around and put it on the road to growth.  This budget will reduce growth from what is thought to be 3 per cent, the Government's own figure, to zero.  It will increase the cost of living for every single person&mdash;old age pensioner, £20,000 a year man, those working and those not working.  It will do nothing to increase the level of employment but it is attacking and damaging our two principal industries, agriculture and tourism.  One would have thought Fianna Fáil did enough damage to the tourist industry last year without renewing their attack through the budget in 1980.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for the information that VAT is included in the 20p increase in the price of petrol. The increase in personal allowances is £131 million and the motorist will be asked to pay £125 million of that.  The increase in hydrocarbon oils plus the increase in VAT on motor vehicles will amount to over £125 million.  Therefore, the Minister is getting the tax reliefs back in entirety from the motorist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about how we debate the budget.  It is time that some attention was given to this matter. Last Wednesday the Book of Estimates was produced, on Friday the capital Estimates and on Monday the estimation of receipts and expenditure for 1980 were produced.  Today we are debating a document introduced by the Minister of almost 100 pages dealing with over £4,000 million worth of expenditure. That strikes me as being a most inefficient way to run the affairs of the country. <Col N="779" /> Most of us in the post this morning got the Swedish budget for 1980-81 starting from April this year and ending next April.  That was produced last December and I presume debated by the Swedish Parliament at that time.  The American Government are at present debating their budget for next year.  The method we use is inefficient and does not give a chance to anyone in the House to assess the budget.  It is brought in on a Wednesday afternoon at 3.30 p.m. and nobody really has a chance to study the Minister's speech or the effects of the budget on various people.</P>
    <P>The social welfare reliefs granted are generous and will go some way towards meeting the inevitable increase in the cost of living which the budget will bring about.  That cost of living increase, as a result of indirect taxes introduced by the Minister, will be 5 per cent on top of the 16 per cent projected for inflation this year.  That means that the cost of living index for mid-May of this year could be in the region of 20 or 21 per cent.  What chance has any Minister for negotiating a wage settlement with a 21 per cent increase in the cost of living already on the table?</P>
    <P>We said on the last budget and in 1978 that the most important concern of any Government is to ensure and maintain the competitiveness of Irish industry. That is not being done by this budget because there is no possibility of a wage agreement that will be in any way conducive to maintaining competitiveness being negotiated later in the year.  That will have effects not alone on the level of public sector pay already budgeted for but the balance of the public sector wage bill from August 1980 through to the following year will also be greatly inflated.  That will affect the budgetary prospects for 1981.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister appreciates, being new to the job, the importance of this element and that a whole series of measures will affect business and competitiveness in the coming 12 months.  He announced an increase in telephone charges, postage, <Col N="780" /> petrol and everything that petrol and oil relate to.  There will be an increase on printing, VAT on motor vehicles and the bringing forward, which will affect the cash flow of many business, of the tax payment period.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in a speech made yesterday the Director General of the Confederation of Irish Industries pointed out that unless something was done to help industry in this year and in this budget, there was a very grave danger that many small businesses would go to the wall, throwing people who are presently employed back on the market.  It is noticeable that the Minister did not&mdash; unless I missed it and I do not think I did&mdash;mention anything about creation of employment in his speech, except as a secondary effect of what he was doing. He said nothing directly in his speech about increase of employment.</P>
    <P>One of the benefits for the community in the stock relief proposal is very real. The Minister's predecessor last year said that because of the reduction in inflation he was reducing it to 75 per cent.  Turning that argument around, the Minister should now be increasing it from 75 to 100 per cent for the current year, which he has not done.  This will be noted by the business community.</P>
    <P>The most damaged section of Irish industry in the last 12 months was the tourist industry.  There is no doubt about it that sensitivity in the Government towards its needs last year was greatly lacking.  The attitude of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to the petrol crisis, the damage done to the tourist industry by the postal dispute and the breakdown in telephone services&mdash;all of these meant that, for the first time since 1972, there was no hope in that industry. Given that, the Minister has now, in his Budget, increased the cost of petrol, oil, postage, telecommunications. All these are matters within the Government's control and they are unconcerned about the effects which this will have on the tourist industry in the coming 12 months.  This is regrettable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  There is far too much <Col N="781" /> noise around the House, please.  We cannot hear anything that is going on. Deputy Barry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister did not take this opportunity, instead of damaging further the tourist industry by the measures introduced in the budget, to introduce special measures to aid this industry, which is of particular benefit to the rural areas.</P>
      <P>The tax reliefs appear to benefit more particularly those with higher incomes. This makes a mockery of the Minister's assertion, in finishing his speech, that the Government were concerned that the less well off people were protected in the future.  Someone with £20,000 annual salary will benefit under the Minister's proposal by, to the best of my reckoning, £1,500, whereas it appears that someone under £5,000 a year who is married and has children will, in fact, not benefit from this budget at all, and indeed, will be worse off, taking into account the level of indirect taxes.  The typical householder with under £5,000 a year will be worse off because a book published yesterday by the Government entitled &ldquo;Redistributive Effects of State Taxes and Benefits on Household Incomes in 1973&rdquo; indicates that people on that level pay a higher proportion in indirect taxes than do people on a much higher level.  People with under £5,000 a year could be paying up to 20 per cent of their income in indirect taxes whereas in the higher level this need only be 11 or 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>The agricultural labourer, perhaps the most convenient example to give, with three children who is, in fact, paying no income tax today, not being in the income tax net, will get no relief but, on average, will pay about £1.75 a week extra as a result of indirect taxation.  This could hardly be said to be a budget which redistributes the wealth in favour of those less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would guess that the Minister is the first Minister in this country to budget for a deficit of £350 million.  He has certainly put a bigger increase on the price of petrol than even the Arabs did at one <Col N="782" /> bite.  The problems in this regard can be traced back, as we have been saying for the last two years, to the lack of responsibility of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to our economy.  As I said, there is no mention in this budget about employment. The concern of many parents over the prospect of getting jobs for their children later on in the year certainly will not be in any way relieved as result of what they read in tomorrow's papers.</P>
    <P>The real damage in this budget is the increase in the acquisition tax levels of farmers.  These, as was indicated when they were read out, are not really sufficient to keep pace with inflation as it was over the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>The most damaging effects will, undoubtedly, be in the prices and income sector.  It should have been quite obvious to the Government that a lot of the trouble they were getting into over the last two years in their general economic strategy was that they failed to get people to appreciate the relationship between exports, competitiveness and wage levels.  On every occasion they attempted, they failed to bring into control, particularly the sectors over which they themselves had control and for which they were directly responsible in the State employment sector&mdash;the ESB, Posts and Telegraphs Department and other State companies.  They have not the co-operation and support from those bodies which would set an example for the private sector and which would allow us to maintain our competitiveness and our export markets.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister stressed that the Government were not, in spite of the rumour I saw in one paper recently, reconsidering our membership of the European Monetary System, but it seems impossible to continue to pay ourselves increase of the level of the last three years, of 19 or 20 per cent, and increases that are budgeted for in the economic background to the budget and in other Government documents published in the last week assessing the wage increases in the next 12 months. We cannot continue to pay ourselves wage increases of that level while the <Col N="783" /> Germans and other fellow members of the EMS pay themselves 7 per cent, and hope to maintain our position within the European Monetary System.  It is in this regard that the budget should be reviewed; from the point of view of prices and wages and with inflation at 16 per cent, assumed for the 12 months ended mid-February, the Government are adding 5 per cent to that.</P>
    <P>By the time the increase in excise duties on petrol and their percentages are added and VAT added to those percentages to cater for the manufacturer, the garage owner, the publican and everybody else who will have the handling of any one of those items that has been increased by today's budget, the level may be very much more than a 5 per cent increase.  We may find ourselves into 20 per cent inflation, the highest probably in Europe, brought about directly by the actions of the Government, a Government which, as stated in another section of the Minister's speech, believe that the control and level of incomes must be brought more into line with those of countries with which we are competing.  Yet, there is no doubt that this budget will have precisely the opposite effect in that regard.  There is no doubt that the trade union movement will want to see the poorer sections of the community being protected.  The people in the lower tax bands will certainly be worse off and the trade unions will seek to have them recompensed for the increases brought about by the budget.  There is no doubt that they will very quickly see that the car owners are paying for the tax relief and that £150 million on top of that will give the amount that the Minister is taking out in extra taxation over and above what he is giving back in relief and that will come out of the pockets of the wage earners. That is bound to be reflected in demands that will be made by the trade union movement for wage increases during the year.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister offering the excuse that these are discretionary expenditures, that it is at the <Col N="784" /> discretion of the wage earner whether he spends or not, and that they should not be reflected in any wage increases.  The fact is that they always have been and as long as they comprise part of the consumer price index it will be quoted in its entirety as a justification for wage demands. Any attempt to restructure the CPI so that these items are not included would certainly be resented.  Perhaps the tax on cigarettes will not evoke too many objections but the 16p increase in the price of spirits is a penal tax.  The Minister might attempt to justify this because we are spending about £1 million a day on drink.  But there is no point in pretending, as is sometimes argued, that the person addicted to alcohol will be cured as a result of this. What will happen is that the alcoholic or the person addicted to drink will consume exactly the same amount of it as previously; he will pay more for it and his family will be deprived of the money. That has been proved over and over again.  Increasing the price of alcoholic drinks by budgetary methods does not win people away from alcohol but rather deprives their families of a certain amount of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has increased the price of wines by 40p a bottle without making any distinction between those in the higher and those in the lower price levels. There is a small wine making industry in the country and by having a flat rate of tax right across the range he is harming it more than imported wine.  Before the Financial Resolutions are passed tonight he should look at the matter again.  The flat rate does not help.  There is a small number of people employed and perhaps in coming years that will become a significant number.  Certainly, the tobacco and drink companies do employ substantial numbers of people whose prospects of employment may be damaged if there is serious interference with consumption of tobacco in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the borrowing level, I am not sure we can have much faith in the Minister's ability to contain it within the limit mentioned in his speech because the <Col N="785" /> same strong language and determined voice were used last year by the Minister for Finance and he was applauded by his back-benchers when he said he was going to bring it down to 10.5 per cent of GNP for 1979.  We all know what happened; it ended up at 13.8 per cent at the end of the year.  I hope the Minister's resolve this year is stronger and that we will see a reduction in the borrowing level for 1980.  The level of borrowing he talks about as having been brought down is about £840 million, about the same as the previous year.  He is aided in this by the carry-over effect of £100 million from the Post Office Savings Bank, unpaid cheques for income tax and unpaid accounts of P and T.  Even at 10.4 per cent it is a level of borrowing that is far too high and one which the country could not carry for any significant number of years.  Given the deflationary effects of this budget, holding it at that level this year may be in question at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful for a number of reasons if this is the only budget we will have this year; not that we will have a formal budget such as was introduced today, but because of the cuts that were made in the Book of Estimates, particularly on the capital side, and they cover a wide range of services, and because of the fact that the employment content of them will not vary&mdash;it is just that the materials will not be there&mdash;there will be nothing for many sections of the public service to do towards the end of the year unless Supplementary Estimates are brought in for many Departments.  The cuts announced this year in the grants for environmental works show a reduction of £3 million and private housing grants are down by £7 million.  All these will damage employment prospects for this year.</P>
    <P>The water supply and sewerage grants are down by £500,000, the local improvement schemes are down by £750,000, the shcool transport scheme is down by £500,000.  Even the allowance to the National Library and the Museum have been cut.  They are small things but it makes a mockery of our commitment in considering ourselves as a cultural <Col N="786" /> people if we are cutting in actual money terms the amount of money available to the National Library and the Museum, which means that in real terms this has been drastically cut.  The grants for sports have also been cut.  Where is the commitment of the Government to youth and sport when they cut the grant from £1.4 million to £1.3 million?  The youth employment grant is cut from £1½ million to £500,000.  All of those are cut in money terms, which means that the cuts in real terms are far greater.  There will either have to be Supplementary Estimates introduced at the end of the year or there will be unemployment right across the State sector.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Supplementary Estimates will be a bit more realistic than some of them were last year.  The Taoiseach was in charge of the Department of Health then.  He was so far out in his estimation of what he would require for last year that he had to look for a further £72 million for his Department. This figure was so wrong that about £25 million was returned.  This is part of the £40 million returned from the Department. I hope the Departmental Estimates this year are a bit more accurate than the Estimate was in that case last year.  It is difficult to see with a deficit still running at over £500 million, unless there is further borrowing&mdash;that is the only other source left if the Minister does not bring in another budget to increase taxation&mdash;how employment can be maintained in the last three or four months of this year.</P>
    <P>While the budget, as is customary, gives and takes and leaves a deficit which must be met by borrowing this year, it does not say at any stage how employment will be maintained.  Deputy Bruton gave a very good example last week when he pointed out that after the Land Commission have paid out wages and salaries they will have only £10 left in 1980 with which to buy land, which is their function.  The Minister did not refer to this in his budget speech.  I do not know if he referred to the employment maintenance scheme in his speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a scheme in existence at the moment that gives £5 a week to people who are employed in the textile industry.  That scheme runs out on 1 April next and unless another scheme is introduced there will be serious unemployment in many of those companies. Would the Minister take note of that? Unemployment is pretty extensive in the textile industry and the profits are extremely tight.  Many companies find it extremely difficult to stay in business. Unless another scheme is introduced <Col N="788" /> before 1 April next there will certainly be unemployment in that sector of industry. As well as suffering the loss of the maintenance scheme they will also be affected by the many increased charges the Minister introduced in the budget.  They will not benefit from the tax reliefs except in their capacity as salary earners from their companies.</P>
      <P>They do not benefit next year from the 25 per cent reduction for increased employment this year because it is related to profits and most of those companies do not make any profit.  The 10 per cent corporation profits tax next year will not benefit them either because they will have no profits on which to pay tax. Those people are in business in a very small way but they have a very high content of unskilled labour.  Those people would find it quite impossible to get work in another area.  Those small firms will be subjected to the increase in the cost of oil, petrol, telephones, and presumably an increase in the cost of the stamp, which was not mentioned by the Minister.  What will the contributions by employers and employees be from 1 April next?  The amount of money provided in the Book of Estimates for social welfare has been greatly reduced. The presumption must be that this charge will have to be taken up by the employers and the employees.</P>

      <P>When the Financial Resolutions are being debated we cannot ask questions about this because it will not be part of the Financial Resolutions. It will come in later as part of the Social Welfare Bill in March.  I am trying to find out exactly what the cost to the employer will be and what will be the deduction from the employee of the cost of making up the money which is not being provided by the Government in the budget or in the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare.  It is quite obvious that that increase will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted that the Minister did not say that the ESB will be relieved of the increase in the duty on the price of oil.  Therefore the rate of electricity will be going up.  CIE are being relieved but every other form of transport is going to cost <Col N="790" /> more.  Every worker who uses his car going to work is going to be considerably worse off.  The average industrial wage at the moment is about £110.  If he has a family of three or four children and has to drive any distance to work he is going to be considerably worse off as a result of this budget.  These are the very people that we are told the Government have as their primary concern, the people who have the first call on their largesse, the people who were to be catered for and who were going to be the recipients in the redistribution of wealth and who are going to benefit as a result of the strategy and the stance of this Government in relation to taxation.  Yet we find that the people in the £20,000 a year bracket will, as a result of the tax concessions here today, probably be £1,500 better off, minus the indirect taxation which might be £300-£500 a year; they are £20 a week better off whereas the person who earns about £110 a week and who has a family will be much worse off.</P>
    <P>Added to that is the damage being done to both the farming industry and to the tourism industry in a year when farmers have found it particularly difficult. When their overall income has increased by 4 per cent in 1979, they are again assaulted.  I suppose there is not much point in quoting the Fianna Fáil manifesto, this infamous document that was the cause of so many of the problems here.</P>

      <P>This makes great reading.  It says that the accounting procedures of the ESB will be examined and brought up to date with a view to reducing the price of electricity and that Government policy will be directed towards discouraging price increases in all areas where they have control or influence. They put 20p a gallon on petrol today.  It says that the National Prices Commission will be carefully and thoroughly examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farming community accepted in good faith the intentions of the Government prior to the 1977 election.  They must be bitterly disappointed that for three budgets running they have been attacked by this Government, singled out for special attention, money taken from them whether it was by the clumsy method of the 2 per cent levy last year or by the various methods introduced this year, particularly the item on machinery; they will not realise until later on in the year how damaging that will be to the development of their farms.  In this year when they can least afford it they have an added number of costs which they will have to bear as well as the increase in taxation such as the abolition of the artificial manure subsidy, the lime transport subsidy, the beef cattle incentive scheme; the 2 per cent levy on beet, beef, milk, grain and so on was introduced and the levy for disease eradication has to be paid by farmers. All these have been introduced by this Government.  This is again going to reduce the amount of money available to farmers as part of their own income.  A <Col N="792" /> lot of damage has been done by the Government to what is our number one industry.</P>
    <P>There will be a great amount of damage done to tourism in the coming year because the costs are bound to go up.  The rates that will be quoted for transport, car hire, hotels and drink will be compared unfavourably with rates in the countries from whom we hope to win tourists.  I see a bleak future for those two industries as a result of this budget.</P>
    <P>More important is the difficulty there will be in getting an acceptable level of wage rounds in 1980 because of the fuelling of inflation owing to the indirect taxation introduced by this Government today.  As I said at the beginning, for the third year running they have got it wrong.  They have introduced the wrong budget at the wrong time because of the road they started out on before the last general election.  We must remember that this is a continuation of the policy that was decided on by members of the present Government when they came to power in 1977.  They never seemed to be sensitive to the economic background to the budget last year.  Last year they said that they did not think the oil price increases would do any great damage.  Today the Minister said it was impossible to foresee at the time of the last budget the effect of the oil prices on the economy here.  Yet at that time when the budget had been read here the oil wells in Iran had been closed for three months, the Shah had fled his country and the Ayatollah Khomeini was in charge there and the Government at that time could not see that there would be any damage to our economy.  No wonder the Taoiseach is smiling; it is because he feels he will be the gainer out of all this. They said that any damage was unforeseeable at this time last year.  Of course it was foreseeable.  It was forseen by every other country in Europe that had inflation rates of approximately half of ours even though they had to pay the same increased price for oil as we have.</P>
    <P>In another one of the pre-budget documents it is stated that the two things that damaged this economy last year <Col N="793" /> were the increase in the price of oil and the weather; Fianna Fáil did no damage to the economy.  If we have a bad summer there will be three factors this year, the weather, the price of oil, which will increase by possibly 60 per cent in 1980, and the budget being introduced here because it will certainly have the effect of reducing our rate of growth, which will be zero.  It will put a lot of people out of employment.  It will increase wages and make many of our goods uncompetitive and this will happen because the strategy adopted by this Government in the last three years has damaged the economy of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the action had already occurred before we came to this budget today.  In both the Public Capital Programme and the Book of Estimates we saw cuts in such areas as housing and hospital buildings.  We saw these cuts take their toll in education.  So what we are discussing here today is the last phase in the pruning programme indulged in by the Government over recent months to correct what is undoubtedly a very bad situation in the management of the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst this budget will be analysed in the days to come, it has to be said at the outset that the budgetary exercise of the Government that has taken place in January and February, the last phase of which we have heard today, carries within it the following effects: petrol will <Col N="794" /> be £2 per gallon before the end of the year; we will have an inflation rate of over 20 per cent; there will be a fall in employment and we will have to face a possible devaluation of the IR£.  These are the implications of today's budget.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that this is special pleading on my part, that it is a politically loaded analysis of what we have heard today.  Let us take petrol which was described as a discretionary item.  Horseback is no longer a common mode of conveyance throughout the country and with the cutback in recent years in investment in public transport a car has become a necessity for a great number of employees.  There is no doubt that, having regard to further possible increases in the price of oil during the year, before the end of this year or even within a few months we will be paying £2 per gallon for petrol.  That cannot be isolated.  It cannot be suggested that this is a luxury item, that it penalises only the Sunday driver.  It will affect employees who travel to work by car and it will affect industry generally.  However the Government may plead conservation, there is no doubt they have added to inflation.</P>
    <P>We are already facing an inflation rate of 16 per cent but there is no doubt that it will rise to over 20 per cent.  One of the ways of financing improvements in the allowances for PAYE earners was to transfer the increases to the area of indirect taxation, to petrol and to the other items that were increased.  There is no doubt that the increases announced by the Minister will have an impact on the cost of living and certainly will have an impact when it comes to bargainning during the summer on another national understanding. The people involved in such bargaining will not be convinced that the increases have occurred in items of discretionary spending.  The increase in the rate of inflation will have an effect on the kind of wage expectations likely to be anticipated this year.</P>
    <P>A fall in employment will occur from cuts in the public capital programme. There will be cuts in investment in education, in hospital building and in <Col N="795" /> schools.  The cut in school building is to be regretted particularly when it comes from a Government who recently welcomed the challenge of the number of young people in our population.  The cutback in education that has been announced will lead to further overcrowding in already overcrowded classrooms.  This is a poor way of meeting the challenge of the number of young people in the population. Expenditure on the public capital programme has not kept pace with last year.  There have been protests from the construction industry with regard to the slow-down in that industry. If a major part of the problem facing the economy is based on a balance of payments difficulty, it is difficult to defend the cuts in building and construction when one considers how little that industry adds to balance of payments problems.  It uses a high degree of native raw material and it has a large labour content.  It is difficult to defend any measures that act as a disincentive to the expansion of that industry in a year that will show little growth in our own or in any economy.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the devaluation of the IR£.  The budget has not tackled the question of reducing our rate of inflation; it has added to it.  Admittedly the difficulties that the people preparing the budget had to face probably made that choice inescapable unless they took more unpalatable measures.  They have added to the burden of indirect taxation and this means that our rate of inflation will be way out of step with that of our European partners.  It is clear that the present exchange rate of the IR£ cannot be maintained if our inflation rate is totally out of line with that of EEC countries.  The old days when we could, in alliance with sterling, mask our balance of payments problems and ride out an impossible situation have gone forever.  We are now tied into the EMS and we are subject to the scrutiny of our partners.  An Irish inflation rate that is double that of other EEC countries will call into question the whole exchange position of the IR£. <Col N="796" /> That is why I say that an inflation rate of nearly 20 per cent will endanger the exchange position of the IR£ and it raises more than a possibility of a devaluation of the IR£ at some stage during the year.</P>
    <P>One could ask what the budget will do in trying to fight our high inflation rate.  I have given my reaction to that.  Another question might be asked with regard to the budget, namely, does it meet some of the demands of the PAYE sector?  The trade unions and the other groups involved have looked for reform of the tax system.  It must be said that the budget has not met those demands.  In the coming months there may appear to be improvements in tax allowances but the absence of an indexation principle is a major omission.  People will be entitled to normal increases.  In addition, if there is another national understanding and if we assume&mdash;as we must&mdash;that the trade unions in a situation of high inflation will be looking for compensatory wage increases, in the absence of an indexation principle it means that those who may benefit from the expansion of the 35 per cent band will be subject to higher rates of taxation.  The absence of a built-in indexation principle means that these allowances, like all allowances by a government in an effort to meet claims from the PAYE sector, will be eroded relatively rapidly.  While the widening of the band is to be welcomed, the absence of indexation means that that forward step will be vitiated.  I do not think that the budget on examination will satisfy those who have sought changes.  It will not meet their demand for reform.</P>
    <P>I welcome the farm resource tax from the point of view of its value to increased production and equity, but by altering the date of payment of farmers' tax it is adding certain difficulties in that area.  I also welcome the abolition of the notional tax system because that was giving rise to a good deal of discontent.</P>
    <P>Before anyone is tempted to congratulate this Government on some of the allowances that they have introduced in this budget it should be realised that the Government in the absence of granting any allowances here would be <Col N="797" /> collecting something like £1,080 million this year.  That is what the taxpayers of the country will be paying out during 1980 compared with £732 million in the previous year.  Without any change here today in the tax system in a reform direction there would be an increase in income tax yields of 47.6 per cent. Whether prevailed upon for reasons of equity or necessity, the Government would have had to meet this demand. They would have been forced to meet the demand for change in the direction of equity, but for a Government who have been given such majority warning by the most extraordinary demonstrations up and down the country they have not really averted similar marches in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>There are some improvements but they will not be lasting, and increased inflation in a year of high inflation will deprive them of any values they may have in these early months for the taxpayer. There are implications in that situation for the Government.  In the benefits of the early months of the year and in the penalties of the later months there are implications of what the Government should be doing in relation to their term of office, but that debate is for another occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government may say that they have in the alteration of the tax bands attempted to meet the demands for reform. I can see that they have, but in the absence of the indexation principle most representatives of the trade union movement on examining those proposals will not be satisfied and we will not have mended the great division which has occurred in the country in recent years as a result of the mishandling of the tax problem by this Government.  They will not have mended the great division which has grown up between town and country which should be ended from a national point of view.  These provisions of today will not end it.</P>
    <P>It was agreed generally that the Government would need to cut their borrowing requirements and they were forced to do so, but the areas chosen for pruning and cutback&mdash;hospital <Col N="798" /> buildings, schools and housing&mdash;were wrong from a social point of view.  The cuts are real cuts, punishing cuts.  When you take into account in the Book of Estimates that an increase, such as for public service pay, must be allowed in all these figures in the Book of Estimates, you will find a figure of less than 5 per cent of an increase.  In a year with the inflation rate that we are expecting that is a savage cutback in the local authority housing area, school buildings and the whole education area, and anyone who has been in any Cabinet attempting to consider the problems and complications of cutbacks in public spending knows exactly the kind of difficulties that one is up against.  The agencies concerned are not accustomed to cuts of this kind.  Tremendous human difficulties will be caused here and we have not seen the start of these as yet.  It may not be appreciated sufficiently at this point of the examination of the budget but it can be represented as a fair statement here that the taxpayer in 1980, if he or she is not getting a full instalment of justice in relation to his or her demands for tax reform, certainly will be getting very poor value indeed for his or her money in terms of tax-paid services during 1980.</P>
    <P>My criticism of this budget is that it does not go sufficiently far in the direction of meeting the demands of the PAYE sector.  Nobody expects that all of these demands will be met overnight. That would not be possible in the circumstances, but this Government have certainly hit themselves by their maladroit handling of a tax situation in years past and they have raised up an insatiable desire for tax reform.  They themselves have created the extraordinary demand that is now there throughout the country and they themselves by such insensitive measures as the abolition of the wealth tax and the virtual abolition of capital gains tax are responsible for the great discontent in the country on tax issues.  My fear from a national point of view is that they have not gone far enough in this budget to meet those demands which now must be met.  If the demands of the PAYE sector for tax reform are not met it is not as if <Col N="799" /> the demands will go away.  It is not even as if it can be confined to street demonstrations.  Instead the demand will find form in high wage claims and in a very unstable industrial relations situation, and none of these things is to be welcomed at a time of great economic difficulty for the country.  That is why the Government will lose the first round in the matter of gaining the co-operation of trade unionists.  They will be unable to convince them that in today's budget as a result of these measures they have moved appreciably and strongly in the direction of reform.</P>
    <P>Cutbacks in investment in vital areas like housing and hospital building should not have been countenanced before this budget.  The main questions asked of the budget cannot be answered satisfactorily. It assists, adds to, fuels the inflation which has taken place already in the economy and which is already as high as 16 per cent.  The cutbacks which have been imposed in the Public Capital Programme in the Book of Estimates will damage the weakest people in our society.  The income tax reliefs will prove unconvincing.  The income tax relief for married couples on average earnings is 20 per cent.  As a result of other measures in this budget already we expect to see the inflation rate this year exceed 20 per cent.  Therefore, tomorrow morning when we examine this budget, when we look at the impact of such things as the increase in the price of petrol, the spiral of inflation added to by this budget, the prospect of more unemployment throughout this year, the danger in which consequently the IR£ in EMS conditions is likely to be placed as a result of these decisions of ours in recent months, we will not be able to say in fairness that this budget of 1980 tackles squarely and in serious fashion all the difficulties we face.  That is why one must record disappointment that the opportunity given here of a new start has not been availed of in this budget.  The budget of 1980 had at least the advantage that there was a widespread public awareness that decisive action had to be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> On looking at some of the facts in this budget it appears to me that we have not met in a sufficiently satisfactory fashion the demand of the PAYE sector for reform, we have added to inflation and we have endangered the present Exchequer rate of the IR£.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is pretty obvious that this drastic increase in the tax on beer and spirits and the consequent huge increase in the price of these products will make wage demands inevitable.  We would all like to see wage demands kept to a minimum.  The Minister, during the course of his speech, said that there could be no further wage demands this year.  I put it to the Minister that he must be living in Greenland or that he must think we are a community of archangels. The vast majority of people will be worse instead of better off after the budget.  The figures show that any person earning less than £8,000 a year will be worse off when he balances the benefits to be gained from the tax concessions against the increased cost of drink, cigarettes, <Col N="803" /> driving a motor car plus the increase in the cost of living which I am told will be in the region of 5 per cent.  Yet the Minister expects that there will be no claim for extra wages this year.  That is wishful thinking.  It is a repetition of last year when we were told that borrowing could be kept to around 10 per cent, when the Minister was told by the leader of my party that that was nonsense and that there was no way borrowing could be kept to that level.  Last year the Minister was told that his budget was a budget of foreign inflation at about 15 per cent rather than 5 per cent, and that is as it turned out to be.  It is not realistic or sensible to tell us that the price of drink will increase dramatically and at the same time say that we will not have further wage demands.  Of course there will be wage demands, the Minister is inviting them.</P>

      <P>The drinking public is being treated exceptionally harshly.  There is no justification for extracting an additional 6p along with what is being extracted already.  It may <Col N="804" /> be said that a person can avoid paying this tax by not availing of the drink, but if everybody adopted this kind of discretionary attitude what would happen? Especially in rural Ireland, people gather in a public house to discuss the doings of the day and to meet neighbours, and the atmosphere is always conducive to friendly discussion.  This is a traditional part of life in rural areas and also in towns, which the Minister is taxing out of existence by this sharp increase of 6p in the price of beer and 16p in the price of a glass of spirits.  Is 16p the net figure or does it include VAT?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That puts the price of a half glass of whiskey in the region of 56p and possibly between 60p and, 70p in lounge bars which charge higher prices.  Was any consideration given to the tourist industry by whoever was responsible for initiating these savage increases?  Does the Minister consider that there will be an adverse effect on tourism?</P>
      <P>Publicans are in general the best unpaid tax collectors in the country.  They collect money without any charge on the State.  It must be borne in mind that a way of life in rural Ireland is being taxed out of existence by reason of the savage increases imposed by this budget.  Most people take a few drinks and they have to pay taxation much in excess of that paid by those who do not take a drink. The Minister proposes to raise £78.5 million extra from the drinking public, about £25 per head of the population in additional taxation.  The Government attitude towards the drinking public is completely out of line.  They are being asked to pay a disproportionate amount in taxation.  Tax on beer and spirits was already high enough.</P>

Has the Minister studied the data produced on this subject and published by the Central Statistics Office which shows the balance of taxation and benefits for different income groups, depending on their family responsibilities?  Alternatively, has the Minister approached the budget irresponsibly, giving income tax reductions of varying amounts which run up to over £2,000 per taxpayer for anybody over £20,000 but which involve no tax reduction for, by way of example, the agricultural worker with the statutory wage of £55.36 who gets no benefit from the budget but has to pay tax increases? I would have thought that before deciding on a budget of this kind the Minister would have examined the data available with a view to seeing how the balance of equity would be served by the budget.  It would appear from the silence that he has not bothered to do that.  He may not even be aware of the data which has been published.  Would the Minister like to indicate his awareness of the existence of this data?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the case of an agricultural labourer who is married with three children.  He is not liable to tax in 1979-80 because, including the £175 allowance, he is not taxable up to £3,029 and his income is nearly £200 below that.  Even if the Government had not given the £175 allowance he would not pay tax. Therefore he gets no benefit but he pays the indirect tax increases.</P>
      <P>I am trying to establish the degree of irresponsibility, or responsibility, as the Minister approaches this.  I am asking a simple question: is the Minister aware of the data published in this respect which is available and has he examined it or taken any account of the effect of this on different income groups?</P>

      <P>These duties, as part of fiscal or excise duties, as a whole will have a very regressive effect but the Minister does not seem to be aware of this.  He does not seem to be aware that the data has been published.  The Minister has shown that for the lower income group, which in terms of current purchasing power, would be about the level of the agricultural labourer, the proportion of income payable in the form of excise or fiscal duties which are largely made up in Resolutions Nos. 1 to 5 amounts to almost 15 per cent.  In the case of people whose income exceeds £20,000 it falls to 4 per cent.  By seeking to substitute these taxes for income tax the Minister has increased the burden of taxation, as far as one can make out from the figures published by the Government, on anybody earning less than £8,000 per year for the purpose of giving £2,000 per year away to anybody with £20,000 per year.  Is that what Fianna Fáil Government is all about? <Col N="808" /> Do they not care enough to examine the figures to see the effect of their actions? That is what I am trying to establish.  It is a legitimate question and the Minister's silence appears to indicate that he is unaware of the data that is available and was published by the Government.  He has entered into the budget giving these tax remissions which give nothing whatever to the agricultural labourer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the taxes the Minister is imposing.  They are strongly regressive being part of fiscal duties or excise taxes the incidence of which is about three-and-a-half times heavier on an agricultural labourer's household than it is on the household of a man earning £20,000 per year.  The Minister has chosen this form of taxation to substitute for income tax.  He is not giving any benefit to the low paid worker because he does not pay tax but he is giving £2,000 per year to those who have £20,000 per year already.  I regard that form of shift in the burden of taxation as regressive and indicating the mentality of the Government.  I am concerned that not alone are they introducing this regressive measure but they have not bothered to find out how regressive it will be or just how far up on the income scale one has to go with the budget before one gets any net benefit for the average household, taking a man, a wife and three children.  It is the failure of the Minister to advert to the existing material to make any attempt to find out the effect of the budget which makes the budget grossly irresponsible.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Does the Minister anticipate that the drastic increase in taxes on beer and spirits will bring a demand for an increase by retailers because they will have more capital tied up in their <Col N="809" /> businesses?  In regard to the taxes on beer and cigarettes I should like to state that as a former Minister who was in charge of Tourism and Transport for a brief period I can recall the uphill battle we fought to promote the tourist industry. We faced all sorts of difficulties such as troubles on our island, doubtful weather and the fact that our alcohol was dearer than across the water.  Last year I spent a short time in Scotland and discovered that the cost of drink there is substantially cheaper.  Today's substantial increase will make drink a luxury.  It will price us out of the tourist market when taken in conjunction with the increase in the price of petrol.  I cannot see any future for our tourist industry.  The director general of Bord Fáilte told us last week that we are in a very sensitive and difficult position.  Now on top of all the other difficulties the Minister has imposed these crippling increases in taxation. In effect, he is telling the tourists that they will need to bring plenty of money with them and will get bad value here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is expecting to raise an additional £60 million in the coming year from those items.  For some time now Government spokesmen have suggested to the public that indulgence in drink and the like was neither good for the spirit nor the body and we were told that the Government intended leading us away from those practices.  However, the Minister is now relying on those old faithfuls to balance <Col N="810" /> his budget.  Is it not true that that negatives the considerable publicity given to the iniquitous practices of indulging in drink, cigarettes and driving? The Minister is depending to a greater extent than before on these taxes.  Can the Minister tell the House the effect these increases will have on the CPI? Although we would like to believe that people will reduce their drinking habits we know that the increases being imposed will mean less money for needy areas of household budgets.</P>
      <P>The process of changing a practice that has been in existence for centuries will be long drawn out.  I refer to the practice in many Irish households whereby money that should be channelled towards such essentials as food, footwear and rent is used to buy drink. Consequently, we regard the practice of increasing drink prices on the scale proposed in order to raise extra revenue to balance the budget to be negative in so far as the whole approach of the Government is concerned in relation to the moral and the social fabric of the community.  The Government at least would like the people to believe that they were being led by this Government into a much healthier form of living than has been the case up to now.  Despite expensive advertising campaigns, more reliance than ever before is being placed on these old reliables.  I trust that the Minister will be able to let me know what will be the effect of these proposed increases in excise duty so far as the CPI is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the implications of these increases for employment in the brewing industry.  I represent a constituency in which there is located a brewery where good employment is given to many people all year round and where there is additional employment in the summer months.  It has become fashionable to try to justify increases of this kind by saying that what is being done is for the good of the community as a whole and for the good of drinkers in particular.  However, experience <Col N="811" /> has shown that increased prices have little or no effect on the drinking habits of people who abuse drink but that they have an effect on the moderate or social drinker who has no difficulty in cutting back on his consumption of alcohol.</P>
      <P>Increases in drink prices affect the tourist trade adversely and this, in turn, affects employment prospects.  I am not suggesting that we should not be concerned in regard to the abuse of drink but that is a matter for the Minister for Health.  Increases of the kind proposed here often have the effect of aggravating a situation in which there is abuse of drink in that the person concerned leaves the household budget short thereby creating tensions in the family which lead only to greater abuse of drink.</P>
      <P>My main concern at this point is to ensure that the level and the standard of employment in the brewing industry is allowed to develop as our tourist trade develops and as people become more sensible in their drinking habits.  I should like to have the Minister's observations on these points.  Tourists visiting the country usually have a limited amount of money to spend and they will not increase that money to take account of increases in prices.  That is why I say that, if prices are brought up to a level that affect severely the moderate drinker or the tourist, the trade will be affected and that means an adverse effect on employment not only in the industry but also in the tourist trade generally.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Pattison, I am very concerned about these resolutions because in my constituency soft drinks and vodka are manufactured. These industries give a great deal of employment. At national level this matter is of grave concern.  About 44,000 to 45,000 people are involved in the brewing distilling and licensed trades.  Because of <Col N="813" /> a number of price increases in beers and spirits in the last few months, there has been a falling off in that business.  This latest increase in beers and spirits will seriously affect the trade.</P>
      <P>Social drinkers will be hard hit by these increases.  The price of drink in Ireland is, in my view, higher than in most continental countries.  How do our prices compare with those in Britain, Spain and other European countries?  I am very concerned about this because there is a danger that people who might come here on holidays will change their minds when they realise that the price of spirits, soft drinks and petrol is so high. Increases of this magnitude could hit our tourist trade.  I could go a stage further: there is a danger that Irish people will decide to go abroad because it will be cheaper than staying at home.</P>
      <P>The price of drink in this country is astronomical.  I am very concerned that the price of soft drinks has been increased. This budget has hit the young person very severely through increases by way of VAT on soft drinks and dancing. There is a grave danger that many of these people may decide to take alcoholic drinks.  Therefore, soft drinks should not have been affected by this budget.  With cut backs in health and education young people have suffered enough.</P>
      <P>An increase of 6.6p. on a one litre bottle of table water has been introduced today. That is a sizeable increase and I believe it was wrong to introduce it.  The manufacture of soft drinks, the brewing of beer and the distilling of spirits are very sensitive trades.  If these increases had been introduced five years ago there would have been an outrage throughout the country.  No matter what the Government think, these are exorbitant increases.  I can guarantee that they will be very unpopular all over the country. They are in excess of what the market can take at present.</P>

      <P>I will take first the last point made by Deputy Enright, which has been re-echoed by a number of speakers.  He said that, if this kind of <Col N="814" /> increase had been introduced five years ago, there would have been an outcry. A number of Deputies referred to the percentage of the total tax in the price of drink.  For the benefit of the House I should give some percentages both after today's budget and the budget mentioned by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>After today's budget the total tax content of the retail price of beer is 47.6 per cent.  In January 1976 the total tax content was 52.7 per cent.  The Deputy will not miss the significance of those figures and dates.  In March 1976 it was 49.3 per cent and in September 1976 it was 48.3 per cent.  In May and September 1973 it was 48.4 per cent.  In significant years, 1973 and 1976 and at specific times the actual duty content was proportionately higher&mdash;in one or two cases it was significantly higher&mdash;than it is now.</P>
      <P>I will deal with spirits now because the pattern is not very different.  The total percentage of tax, VAT included, after today's budget, with retail prices as they are now, is 52.4 per cent.  In May-September 1973, after actions taken by the Government, it was 54.2 per cent and remained in excess of the figure I am talking about for some time.  That is the first point that needs to be clearly put on the record and understood.</P>

I gave my reasons for not going for the other areas.  It has been said that these increases are cruel. <Col N="815" /> Though they may seem to be cruel they are not in any way as cruel as they would have been in some other areas. The Government are satisfied we have gone for the right option.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the point made by Deputy Pattison and others, the effect this will have on employment in the brewing industry.  I have indicated that the incidence in relation to small breweries has been reduced considerably&mdash;we are continuing for a further year to protect the interests of the small brewers, by agreement between the Government and the small brewers, to the extent of £160,000.</P>

      <P>There was some concern expressed about the effects on tourism and I would point out that the duty-free facilities are still available for tourists coming from Britain and elsewhere.  Deputy Enright spoke of comparisons in drink prices between Ireland and other countries from which tourists come.  Retail drink prices, even pre-budget in Britain, in relation to whiskey in particular, compare very closely with the post-budget situation here, and who am I to say what the post-budget situation will be in Britain?  The same applies to most other European countries from which tourists come.  One should not overstate the impact in this respect.  Most European countries have moved in a similar way.</P>

      <P>I am specifically asking about the effect of the duties on drink on households of different income levels. The Minister has suggested that they are proportionate to income.  I am asking him, in the light of the figures in this particular publication, how he can say that when fiscal duties, which consist very largely of duties on drink and tobacco, drink in particular, show such an extraordinary degree of regressiveness, three-and-a-half times as heavy on the less well-off than on the better off.  I recognise that some of this may be due to the effects of tobacco, possibly.  It is arithmetically impossible to see how the fiscal duties could be so regressive if in fact duties on drink, which forms such a large proportion, are proportionate.  I am challenging the Minister's statement which does not seem to be confirmed by the facts available.</P>

I see he is proposing a modest increase of 10p on the tax element&mdash;that is on page 55&mdash;on the retail price of a gallon of ordinary cider. The change represents an increase of approximately 2p on the price of the ordinary flagon of cider.  How does the Minister work that out?  I am not too sure what he means.  A flagon of cider is two pints.  Is the increase in the tax element 10p on the pint?</P>

      <P>What moved the Minister to quadruple the tax on table waters, such a very much larger increase than the tax on alcohol?  One would have thought the balance would have been the other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy, they have not been increased for some time.  In many cases the Deputy has assumed, perhaps understandably, that it all applies to children.  He will be aware that a lot of it is used as mixers in lounge bars and so on, and they have not been increased for some considerable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if it has not been increased since 1975, that is hardly a reason for quadrupling it.  Nothing else has been quadrupled since 1975.  Why pick on table waters?  Surely it would be important to increase the differential between soft drinks and alcohol rather than to narrow it?  Would the Minister tell us what led him to this decision?</P>

      <P>According to those figures, the price of a plug of tobacco would be up by more than 20p&mdash; it could be up to 32p.  We are getting used to price increases in the past months during the lifetime of this Dáil, on ESB, coal, bread, butter, sugar and now cigarettes and tobacco.  To my mind, it is an unfair imposition&mdash;unfair is a mild term&mdash;to ask the smoking public to pay from 20p to 32p extra on two ounces of tobacco&mdash;in the present measurement it would be something less than two ounces&mdash;and 10p on cigarettes.  As I mentioned earlier, speaking on the increase on beers and spirits, the Minister referred to them in his budgetary statement as the old reliables.  I can make the same assertion on the imposition of duty on tobacco as I did on beer and spirits, that those who smoke are paying an undue share of taxation to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach, as he is at present in the ministerial seat, what will 20 cigarettes yield now to the State per packet?  What was the tax on 20 cigarettes before the imposition and how much will it be now, when the 10p is added on?</P>

      <P>It would be a sizeable figure and undoubtedly the Minister, if he genuinely wants people to stop cigarette smoking, will succeed better by this budget than his colleague, Deputy Woods, the Minister for Health, has achieved in sending his packets of &ldquo;Conquests&rdquo; all over the country.  It is disappointing that the Government, <Col N="834" /> who were elected on a prices programme, come to the Dáil midway through the term and impose this extra tax on what many people consider essentials. Smoking is essential for many of our people; it is a source of relaxation. The manifesto on which the Government party were elected in 1977 told the people that there was no need for any of the existing taxes.  We know what happened with rates.</P>

      <P>As a result, we have these Financial Resolutions which will deprive many of our people of the relaxation of smoking and, as I said earlier, the relaxation of having a drink in their local.  I entirely disagree with the impositions on tobacco, as I did with those on beer.  The smoking and drinking public are already paying their fair share towards the national Exchequer and it is completely unfair to hit again&mdash;using the words of the Minister&mdash;at &ldquo;the old reliables&rdquo;, drink and tobacco.  The Minister is a non-smoker and it is all right for him to say that you do not have <Col N="835" /> to buy cigarettes or tobacco.  The term &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; was used.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach what would happen if people were to take his advice? One can only anticipate that they shall. The Minister told us that the imposition on drink, cigarettes and tobacco will rake in for the Government £75 million odd in a twelve-month period.  I am opposed to this imposition as the smoking public are already making their fair contribution towards the central fund.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am back to cigarettes now.  I do not smoke; I never have smoked.  I believe this method of taxing cigarettes is simply a revenue device <Col N="836" /> to get money.  Discouraging people from smoking, if they should be discouraged, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  I am convinced that the direct result of this increase will be to leave less money in the take-home pay of the wage earner. If the husband and wife smoke there will be less money for other things.  If there is less money for necessary commodities the result will be a demand for higher wages.  I think that demand is inevitable after this budget.  That will lead to a substantial increase in the cost of production and our exports will be less competitive on the world markets and our balance of payments, instead of improving, will become much worse.  That is the argument I see against this sort of tax. One can introduce tax on cigarettes and tobacco with the loftiest of motives, saying that people should not smoke and therefore smoking should be taxed.  That would be all right if we were a well-disciplined race.  But experience has taught us that people do not give up cigarettes when they become dear and that it is other things that go to the wall, probably necessities of life, when people have to pay more for cigarettes and drink.  This results in a demand for higher wages.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking and in many respects this is a crazy budget.  We shall have an opportunity of demonstrating that when we come to speak on the General Resolution later.  There are many things in it which are mad economics and which are socially crazy.  The bad appearance has been taken off it by increasing social welfare payments but that is only a measure of the length by which social welfare recipients have fallen behind.  They have been talking loudly in recent times about how hard it is to live and it is a measure of the further inroads that will be made on the social welfare classes by the provisions in this budget.  The budget proposal here does not affect me personally but I think the result will be a demand for wages and on that ground I shall vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A few months after the National Coalition took office in 1973, when the first world-wide oil crisis hit all western governments and subjected all the economies in the world to a strain of a kind which had never been known before because of the rise in the price of a single commodity, the only Government which were supposed to be able to make oil out of the air were the Government in power in this country.  It was no excuse for us that the cost of oil had been trebled and then quadrupled.  All the difficulties which we were obliged to face were of our own making.</P>
      <P>When, in 1974, in consequence of these difficulties, in part to meet the fiscal difficulties and in part as a conservation measure the National Coalition Government imposed at one stroke in one day by one motion a duty of 15p a gallon on hydrocarbons, I can well remember the reaction from the side of the House to which the people have now relegated me.  The sky was going to fall because three shillings a gallon was put on petrol, and a panic was created of a kind which I will not quickly forget. There were queues of cars at the petrol stations, burning up fuel as they inched forward to fill their tanks, with ten or 11 gallons if they were nearly empty and those which were half empty with six or seven gallons in order to save as much money as they would spend on a large whiskey.  That panic was created and exploited to the utmost.  I do not expect anything different from an Opposition like the Government over there.  Deputy Richie Ryan was pilloried.  Three years later he was still being pilloried for having taken more from the motorist than the Arabs had taken from him because of the imposition of a 15p a gallon duty at one fell swoop.  This Government propose to impose, in the middle of a lot of other impositions, 20p a gallon on hydrocarbons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why one can count on the fingers of a small number of men <Col N="844" /> the total human population in this Chamber, between Deputies, officials, the press and members of the public, is that budget debates, whether on budget day or on the following day or thereafter, have turned into ritual dingdongs, predictable battles in which people with padded staves try to thump one another; and nobody expects from the Opposition anything except complaints. Not everything in this budget is bad and everybody knows that; it is designed very cautiously, as cleverly as they left themselves room for&mdash;and that is not much&mdash;to catch the favour of some sections of the community.  I am not going to attack those parts of it, naturally.</P>
    <P>I want to say this much about the duty on hydrocarbons.  To put a duty of these dimensions on a product like oil and petrol at a time when the prime concern of a Government must be to contain inflation, and when the principal component of that&mdash;at least the only component which is within our reach&mdash;is the containment of wage rounds, is absolutely insane; because that increase is going to work its way through the whole economy.  The hydra-headed authority over there opposite me&mdash;Esau is not there at the moment but Jacob is sitting in for him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At any rate Esau has gone to his tea and Jacob is sitting in for him. The net result of their cogitations is that we are going to have 20p a gallon on petrol and oil; and every industry in the country, every manufacturing industry in the country, every distributing business and every private motorist in the country is going to feel the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> Some people manage from hand to mouth and some people change their habits.  I sometimes scrape along from gallon to gallon and sometimes I blow a whole tank full, but the average tank full of petrol is now up by £2 or £3.  That is a very sizeable amount and that is only the ordinary motorist's petrol.  But let us take the case of a manufacturing business, or any kind of a large industry which is dealing with heavy transport, and ask ourselves what is going to be the effect of increases of these dimensions on their oil bill.  It is not going to worry them too long, because not many weeks will elapse before there is a quiet plop behind the door of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and an application for a price increase will fall on the floor there.  The very same thing is going to happen with the distributing trades.  We are going to see, as we have seen before, that increases in costs of this kind are the basis for increases in prices, so that what we are facing here in this 20p demand for an increase in hydrocarbon duty is not simply an increase in that.  What is lining up behind it is a whole row, right across the board of the items which compose the consumer price index, of price increases.</P>
    <P>In addition to that there is the question of the employees.  I am not making a poor mouth for private motorists who do a discretionary amount of motoring.  A lot of people are in that category and if the Government's intent is really part of a serious energy package&mdash;and Esau when he was here earlier this afternoon said nothing about that; it was not part of his brief&mdash;</P>

Far from it.  They are not going to offer it up for anybody. They are going to present the substance of their loss in the next wage demand round, which will be on the Government's desk within weeks.  That is when it is going to be seen.  The Government I was proud to work for got the accolade from Deputy O'Donoghue, who has been disgracefully used as a scapegoat by the present regime in Fianna Fáil, as having been responsible for the healthy state of the economy in 1977 and 1978, for having successfully negotiated a reasonable wage settlement in 1976 and 1977.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be contested that the achievement of a reasonable wage settlement, not just this year but every year, is central to any kind of ordered economic progress.  I am hearing that preached by my own side; I am hearing that preached by the other side; and I have not the least doubt that if Sinn Féin, Gardiner Place, were in power in the morning, it would not be too many months before they would be preaching it too.  The reasons are very simple and rest on the most primitive and obvious of economic realities.  There is one way of making sure that we do not get a reasonable wage round and that is by over-burdening people, by doing something provocative and unbearable and, in particular, by doing it unjustly, by letting off one section who are able to go off and develop winter tans and grinding down the other section.  That is a sure way of making certain that we do not get a reasonable wage settlement.  I do not say that there is any inequity or any unfair spreading of the load in this hydrocarbon duty.  It is going to weigh heavily on all sections.  It will weigh particularly heavily on the PAYE earner living in the country.  A car is not a luxury to such a person, and filling the tank with petrol is a serious matter.  This will figure in the wage demands that will come before the Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are seeing in the 20 per cent rise in petrol prices is an element fed into the inflationary machine; and this will mean a range of price increase applications by firms whose costs have been put up substantially.  Also, it will mean an additional element in the consumer price index and it will be reflected in the wage demands this year.  If the Government can restore the order which the National Coalition achieved in this sphere they will have carried out a major job.  If the <Col N="849" /> Taoiseach succeeds in getting back even half-way to the order achieved by the National Coalition he will have done something that will make me revise my low opinion of him.  The Government are going the wrong way about it it but it is totally in line with the character of that party and I shall have more to say about that during the next day or two in a general debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>An increase of this kind might have been all right given certain conditions. Looking at our trade and our oil import figures I can see the sense in saying we must cut them down, that if we cannot do it one way we must do it another way.  If a rationing system is considered too cumbersome, costly or unreliable or is likely to give rise to too many abuses, I can see a certain kind of a sense in raising the price in order to achieve a reduction. I would not be against such a policy; but it would have to be part of an overall energy policy and, as yet, there is absolutely no sign of this.  This is not an energy policy, and I sincerely hope it will not be represented in the budget debate as being an energy policy.  This is the Government's way of covering the tatters in the financial clothes that are almost falling off the Government.  It is a fiscal rag drawn over them.  It has absolutely no relation to an integrated energy policy and it should not be represented as that.</P>
    <P>It might be defensible if there were a proper road system in this country.  A gallon of petrol will take a person here a shorter distance than in any other country in the EEC.  Occasionally I have to travel out of Dublin and I have been astonished at the state of the roads in the past few months.  They are broken and pitted.  They would be insulting to the Bulgarians; our roads are far beneath their standards.  Three weeks ago I drove to Ratoath and I wondered if I would have to be dug out of the road before I got there.  That is only 12 miles from Dublin.  Yet, these are the roads on which driving is to be made more expensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should get somebody to send a car for him to go back to the west and look after the roads.  The national importance of the private motorist who is held up going to a funeral, as I was, is very slight&mdash;in fact, it is of no national importance. However, for years industry has been saying that the state of our roads adds substantially to their costs and this is one of their priorities when they make applications for Government assistance.</P>
      <P>If our roads allowed traffic to travel at a reasonable European level of speed perhaps one might not feel an increase like this, but the Confederation of Irish Industry say that goods moving on our roads travel at an average speed of 25 mph.  They have worked out&mdash;and I take their figures for it&mdash;that it would cut their costs substantially if they could move goods at an average speed of 40 mph or a little more, as would be the norm in a continental country or in most parts of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the geniuses over there. They cannot jump over their own shadow.  They have the cross of their own political nature to bear, and they cannot do wonders overnight or, come to that, over 16 years.  I do not blame them for not producing overnight a road system that would put us on a level with Belgium, Holland or Denmark. However, where the system is so bad and where it has fallen into a state of disrepair that I have never seen before, I say to them that it is the wrong time to put a duty on petrol which will increase the mileage cost of transport and which will hit instantly industry and the distributing business.  It might be defensible if we had a proper public transport system.  I do not know what the bus service is like in Deputy Flynn's constituency, but I can tell him that if it is <Col N="851" /> comparable with what it is in my area he has double reason to get back there fast and do something about it.</P>

      <P>I do not want to hold the House up, and I am not going to speak much longer, but I am perfectly entitled to talk about the impact which this measure will have on the tourist business.  I am not going too far out of the way in recalling what happened to the tourist business in 1979 in consequence of the mishandling of the petrol business by Deputy O'Malley and the Department over which he then presided.  Personally, I do not entirely blame Deputy O'Malley because he was badly advised&mdash;indeed he was not advised at all.  He did not have enough people who were oilmen or knew anything about the business.  He thought he would strike a posture; and the Government and Deputy Haughey thought they could join in the praise and share the applause for striking the posture of <Col N="853" />&ldquo;standing up to the multi-nationals&rdquo;. They are a long way from that now, with petrol going to be almost twice the cost that it was in April of last year, and the multi-nationals only laughing up their sleeves at them.  Deputy Killilea is very quiet up there, laughing behind his paper handkerchief.  What has he to say about that now?  The multi-nationals were going to be whipped by little Dessie, but he did not succeed in whipping them.  He would not pay the going rate, and so they did not sell him the petrol.  The result was that bookings were lost by the thousand.  Hotels closed down because of the ruin of the tourist season.  We have now got the system under this resolution in which the tourist season for 1980 will go under again.</P>
      <P>I have not looked very much at television this evening or listened to radio.  I suppose I spent about half an hour at it, and I have not yet heard the tourist industry speak their minds about this. They may have done so, but I will be very surprised if they welcome an extra 20p a gallon on petrol.  It is a very undifferentiated 20p.  Strangely enough, there are countries in Europe&mdash;Italy for one&mdash;in the EEC, subject to the same rules as we are, that are able to make special rates for tourists.  Why do we not do that?  Why is that never thought of?  I will tell you the reason.  It is because the English do not do it.  That is the real reason, and the Soldiers of Destiny over there who think they have not produced a budget until they have thrown in a paragraph of kitchen Irish about camáns are too much in the Paddy mould to strike out and do something for themselves. Because the English do not have special concessions on tourism it is more than good enough for us not to have them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney was considered to be a fascist by elements on the far side of the House.  I would like to imagine what would have been said about us if we had in any way closured, or if the Ceann Comhairle elected by the National Coalition majority had closured a debate on the imposition of 15p a gallon on hydrocarbons and oils. It would not have happened, and we did not do it.</P>
      <P>I am not going to take this discussion farther afield.  I am saying simply that 20p on the gallon is going to do very severe damage to our tourist industry.  I am saying, as a corollary to that, that it doubles and strengthens the case to have a special disposition for tourists in regard to petrol concessions; and it quadruples the case when we consider our &ldquo;sundered brethren&rdquo; in the North of Ireland who are always trying to get down and get to know us, as though closer acquaintance with us would make them more anxious to accept unity under our flag.  We try to lure them down here. Have we ever stopped to ask ourselves if we could give them petrol minus the duty element?  Could that be done or would we have to go over to the English and ask them how to do such a thing or is it possible to do it at all?</P>
      <P>That is the kind of Government we have.  That is the &ldquo;style&rdquo; that has been built up by the papers in the publicity exercise in regard to the &ldquo;style&rdquo; that we are to expect now.  If this budget is a sample of that style I do not want much more of it and I doubt if the people would either.</P>

      <P>With respect, I am entitled to anticipate the argument that this is an energy-saving measure.  Of course, it will have a disincentive effect on the consumption of oil and petrol.  A measure like that makes sense only in the context of an integrated energy policy, and this Government have not produced that. Not only have they not produced it, but they have expected applause for measures which purportedly were intended to save energy, such as the reduction of heating in public buildings to a lower level than formerly.  Every Member of this House knows that you do not have to go any further than Leinster House to know that that is being evaded and neglected contemptuously.  Everybody knows that day in and day out we are sweltering in temperatures which are uncomfortable, they are so hot.</P>

      <P>Nobody could have anticipated an increase of the magnitude of 20p in the price of petrol under this resolution.  During the week <Col N="858" /> some of the Dublin papers reported leading bookmakers giving a 20-1 book on petrol going up by 10p or more and this reflects public opinion.  Nobody anticipated an increase of 20p coming immediately after an increase of 10p which was imposed in the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of families now use a motor car quite regularly and this proposed new price will undoubtedly restrict motoring or put it beyond the reach of the low income families.  The motoring public is an important segment of the population, as was recognised by Fianna Fáil when they made a special appeal to the motoring public during the last election by saying that they would not take tax from a motorist, so as to encourage people to change Government. Could anybody who voted for Fianna Fáil in the June 1977 election anticipate this huge increase in this budget keeping in mind the reduction in the car tax? That carrot was dangled before the public in May and June of 1977 and unfortunately a large number of the general public were gullible enough to swallow the carrot and vote for Fianna Fáil.  People using their cars daily could not resist a £50, £60 or £70 tax deduction.  To fill a car with ten gallons of petrol a man must pay £7.52 directly to the State.  I am sure the Taoiseach will be the first to admit that this is a severe imposition.  The private motorist will undoubtedly complain vehemently at the exorbitant rate of duty imposed by this resolution.</P>
      <P>In relation to business, it is necessary to use motor cars, lorries and to hire transport and the increased cost of petrol will undoubtedly be passed on to the consumer here.  Neither the businessmen nor the companies will bear the brunt of this increase but the consumer will have to.  As mentioned earlier by Deputy Kelly, this is bound to give rise to wage increase demands.  The £ was shrinking but it will shrink even faster now because of this budget and it will undoubtedly affect incomes and will give rise to difficulties in the industrial field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot pass over this increase without referring to tourism.  We are <Col N="859" /> paying Bord Fáilte large sums of money to get people to visit us and they are sending agents all over the world.  I do not know whether or not we are getting value for money from the board's activities, but it is not helpful that a gallon of petrol will cost more than £1.50.</P>
    <P>I was not very conversant with duties on heating oil.  In fact I thought there was little or no duty on it because so many households avail of oil to heat their homes.  It is not fair to add to their burden.  As the Taoiseach said, the cost is 74p a gallon as it is and that is a sizeable figure.  It is women who look after household expenditure and it is not fair to ask them to pay an additional 5p on each gallon of home heating oil.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed and I am sure my disappointment is shared by every member of my party as well as by our supporters throughout the country and the public generally.  I have not the slightest doubt that many people who supported Fianna Fáil in the last general election have a different opinion of the Government as a result of this imposition. The timing is most inopportune in view of the many increases in petrol prices during past weeks and months.  It is out of place for the Taoiseach and the Government to ask the motorist for a further 20p on a gallon of petrol and to ask business people to dive into their pockets for a similar amount which, as everyone knows, will be passed on to the consuming public.  I entirely disagree with this resolution.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Government have nothing if not a particularly hard neck in imposing this tax on petrol.  One of the principal planks in the election manifesto of 1977 was the undertaking to reduce the cost of motoring by removing road tax on all cars up to 16 horse power.  Immediately this now historic document was unveiled people said that there would be a tax on petrol which would be more expensive than road tax.  Fianna Fáil responded by sending out the respected man who was then Taoiseach <Col N="860" /> and put him on record as giving a solemn undertaking that petrol would not be taxed.  We know that the removal of tax on cars cost the Government between £30 million and £40 million and we now have today's performance which replaces that tax with a tax which will collect about £113 million from the motorist.  How can the Taoiseach sit there and stand over that performance? He can laugh but he availed of the votes gained by that piece of trickery and availed of his ministry as a stepping stone to his present office.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Taoiseach will be caught out if that is the way he wishes to treat the reneging of a solemn promise given at the last election and treat the House and the country in that light way. They gave away something like £30 million and now they are taking back £100 million.  That is not the end of it because car tax is on its way back.  In the first budget after the manifesto they introduced a registration fee of £5 per car&mdash;they did not call it a tax.  That is now being increased to £10 per car.  This is a shameful performance and one of which the Taoiseach should be thoroughly ashamed.  I am sure the former Taoiseach feels humiliated.  I can think of no other word for it.</P>
      <P>We had a lecture today from the Minister for Finance in introducing the budget.  He told us that a lot of our troubles are due to the cost of oil which, he would lead us to believe, came as a surprise, although of course he knew about the price increases which had occurred in 1974.  If they had been keeping in touch with what was happening in the world when they were drafting the manifesto they should have known the situation.  They took a gamble and it did not come off.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>  When the world economy is faced <Col N="861" /> with a marked downturn, we as an exporting country dependent on foreign markets to absorb half of our production are pulled in the same direction.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about new factories established last year and how successful the IDA have been in attracting industrialists. He stated:</P>
    <P>These new and established industries should ensure that industrial exports will increase, even in the face of tough international competition, provided we can keep costs in check.</P>
    <P>Later in his speech the Minister announced the imposition of a tax of 20p per gallon on petrol, which will drive up costs, and imposed a charge of 5p per gallon on other crude oils which are not used on their own.  Both these increases are calculated to drive up our costs and make us less competitive in the face of tough international competition.</P>
    <P>One would think that different people wrote different parts of this speech and that the Minister had not co-ordinated it. That is a crazy outlook.  The Minister has boasted that he has given income tax payers some relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We will hear a lot in days to come about the boast of the Minister for Finance that he gave concessions amounting to more than £100 million to taxpayers.  I accept he has done that but he has taken back as much in other taxes.  He has increased the tax on cars and the amount of the excise duty.  Surely it is unreasonable to take so much tax from one section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that part of our trouble relates to our balance of payments situation but the effect of these <Col N="862" /> taxes on motorists will be to increase our balance of payments deficit, make us less competitive in world markets and make it more difficult for our manufacturers to sell goods abroad.  The increases are bound to lead to a demand for more wages and that demand cannot be resisted.  I have a better right than most Deputies to be annoyed at the extent of the increase in the cost of petrol because in my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, we do not have a mile of railway line. We have been stripped of our railways and our people who depend entirely on their own transport must now try to cope with this brutal increase.  Is that reasonable?  To the increase in the price of petrol one must add the huge increase in the cost of repairs and there is a greater need to repair cars because of the deplorable condition of our roads.  There can be no doubt but that people will demand compensation for the extra burdens the increase in the price of petrol will place on them.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the increase of 5p per gallon for certain oil will have to be paid by the ESB.  If the ESB must pay that increase there is no doubt that they will pass it on to the consumers because, according to the statute under which they operate, they must pay their way. The result is that consumers who have already had to bear a 20 per cent increase in ESB charges this year must face another increase.  This is a crazy race, it is like a dog chasing his tail.  It is not the way to improve the country's financial position.  The Taoiseach has given the impression that he is the man to get the country's finances right but there is no doubt that the taxes increased today will start another crazy cycle.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in tourism, one of our more profitable industries.  As has been pointed out we are inaugurating new car ferry services between this country and the UK and France but we are taxing our visitors to the hilt as soon as they reach our shores.  We are discouraging them by brutal increases in the cost of petrol and other commodities.  The increase in the price of petrol cannot be regarded as a gambler's throw because <Col N="863" /> we are in a situation where we cannot win.  At least Deputy O'Donoghue gambled that there would be world growth and no increase in the price of oil.  He could have won his gamble if we did not have to face an increase in the price of oil but we are now in a situation in which we cannot win, we are bound to lose.  We are damaging our industrial sector and our tourist industry.  This increase is one of the craziest that has yet been introduced.</P>

      <P>In the course of his first address to the nation following his appointment the Taoiseach emphasised the need for national concern.  He told us to work together for the future of our people and that there was a need for a united effort.  He also told us that we were facing hard times and that if Ireland was to survive we would all have to work as a team.  I welcomed that speech because I felt we were facing a difficult year.  It was my belief that to survive we had to work together.  The Taoiseach also emphasised the need for industrial peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's most emphatic plea was for a reasonable approach to the impending national understanding. I want to protest on behalf of the thousands of workers who commute daily to their places of employment who will suffer a severe blow as a result of the substantial increase in the price of petrol.  Where is the Taoiseach's national concern in that huge increase?  What example is he, or the Government, setting for the rest of our people?  The increase will mean that workers in my area will have to pay an extra £3 per week to get to work.  One must bear that figure in mind&mdash;it amounts to £150 per year&mdash;when one considers the amount of £220 under the new tax system given to a husband and wife.  In that context <Col N="864" /> the net increase will be £70 per year, a little more than £1 per week.</P>
      <P>What will be the impact of this increase on the CPI which, also, is a matter of concern to the workers?  At the end of 1979 inflation was of the order of 17 per cent and I expect that before long it will be of the order of 20 per cent.  The effects of the oil price increases imposed by the Arabs have not yet permeated through the economy.  In such circumstances how can the Taoiseach expect a reasonable national understanding to be reached?  Today we have witnessed a piratical act against the workers.</P>
      <P>I recall that during the Coalition's term in office when there was imposed an increase of 15p per gallon in the price of petrol, many members of the then Opposition referred to the Government of the day as Irish Arabs.  Having regard to statements made by certain Ministers last week and to the price increases outlined in the budget today, one may well ask what type of Arabs are on the Government side now?  One must associate this savage increase in the price of petrol with a road network that I have described elsewhere as a network of duckponds.  The local authorities are in the very difficult situation of facing a year of serious financial stringency.</P>

      <P>I would only make the point that if the motorist is being asked to day to pay an extra 20p on the gallon of petrol, surely he is entitled to a better road network than that which exists.  I am concerned mainly for those people who must commute daily from their <Col N="865" /> homes to their places of work and for whom cars are a necessity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were a journalist I expect that the slogan I would use in my newspaper in the morning would be &ldquo;back to the horse and trap&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach has been generous in regard to the distribution of toothbrushes but we are not likely to have any offers from him of the horses that we will need to transport us after this savage increase in the price of petrol.  This increase of 20p on the gallon of petrol must be considered in conjunction with the increase of 10p a gallon in the price of this commodity imposed during the past couple of weeks and which brings the total increase to 30p, representing £1.52 per gallon.  Twelve months ago the price of petrol was half that amount.</P>
      <P>We hear from the Government side about efforts to bring the two parts of Ireland together but the Taoiseach must know the substantial differences between the price of cars and of petrol as between both parts of the island.  For instance, the difference in the price of a car as between the two parts of the island is in the region of £1,500.  Now, there will be a difference of 33p per gallon in the price of petrol as between the two areas.  This difference represents 25 per cent of the total cost of a gallon of petrol.  Anybody who finds it necessary to travel substantial distances will realise the kind of petrol bill that he will be faced with from now on.  I have estimated that for somebody travelling 1,000 miles per week the petrol bill alone will be in the region of £60 per week.  As a representative from the AA said this evening during a radio programme, there has never before been such a savage increase so far as the motorist is concerned.  This increase has come as a bombshell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only has there been this increase in the price of petrol but there is a doubling of the car registration fee or, in other words, in the tax on cars.  Only two-and-a-half years ago the people now in Government were promising the motorist cheaper motoring.  It is estimated that one in every five people in <Col N="866" /> the country has a car.  In those places referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick and in such places also as Donegal, north Sligo and north Leitrim, people depend for travel either on a horse and cart or on a car but these people are being discriminated against.  I wonder whether the Taoiseach realises the hardship that will be imposed on those people.  There is no rail service in these areas so that the people who live there will be the ones to be hit hardest by these increases.  For practically every household in rural Ireland a car is a necessity.  A couple of weeks ago we were told that the road grants were to be cut by half.  Here again there is a tactic of another kind to hit the motor trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance told us today that the increase of 5p in the gallon of diesel will not apply to CIE but would the Minister not agree that in this regard a concession should be made to hauliers in the west and the north-west of the country?  What about those private bus owners who operate in areas where there is no public transport?  Surely these people, too, will be deserving of a concession of the order of that being granted to CIE.</P>
    <P>I have estimated that for a haulier driving a lorry from Donegal to Dublin and back, the increase in the cost of petrol will mean an extra £15 for the journey.  What is the point in talking about inflation in the light of this massive increase?  Those people who will be hit hardest by the increases are those who happen to live in the underprivileged parts of the country.  There cannot be any justification for such a situation and that is why I suggest that people operating small business in such places should be given the same concessions as are being given to CIE.  I am not against CIE being granted these concessions but where they do not operate the same subsidy should be made available to private bus owners and hauliers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to say a few words about the tourist industry.  I wonder what Bord Fáilte will have to say about this increase in the price of petrol, an increase that will hit very hard at the tourist trade.  I wonder what the hotels <Col N="867" /> federation will have to say when they realise how unattractive it will be from now on for a tourist to bring a car to this country.  Anybody coming from Britain, for example, must realise that he will be paying a difference of 33p in the price of every gallon of petrol he buys while here.</P>
    <P>I estimated that anybody from Britain who travels 2,000 miles to look at the Irish scenery will have to pay an extra £25.  Somebody said that last year the tourist trade was on its knees because of the petrol shortage but what encouragement are we giving to tourists to come here and fill our hotels which are half empty in the summer?  These people cannot afford this extra money.  This Government have not considered the tourist trade, the hoteliers, the guesthouses or the extra money the motorists will have to pay.  I have no doubt that Charlie will not be their darling for too long after this savage increase comes into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement referring to indirect taxation the Minister said he was pursuing the general social orientation in his proposals of concentrating his indirect taxation on discretionary expenditure as far as possible.  This is a very laudable aspiration.  Then he went on to make an excuse for singling out petrol and called it an expenditure which could be regarded as less discretionary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many provisions in today's statement which are unacceptable, unreasonable, irresponsible, irrational, illogical, and I could go on, but the most unacceptable, irrational and illogical of all is this provision.  The reason it is all these things above any other provision is that it is dishonest.  That kind of charge deserved some kind of explanation and the explanation is very simple.  Fianna Fáil, two-and-a-half years ago as an election gimmick, decided to abolish car tax.  In doing so the loss of revenue to the Exchequer at that time was calculated to be something in the region of £28 million for a full year.  That means that in two-an-a-half years, at 1977 costs, revenue lost to the Exchequer would have <Col N="868" /> amounted to something in the region of £70 million.  In one fell swoop that same party who abolished car tax for very blatant political reasons have taken back one-and-a-half times that loss with the stroke of a pen by adding 20p per gallon to petrol.</P>
    <P>The reason I make the charge that this is dishonest is that they failed to say they are taxing cars again through taxing petrol.  That is what they are doing but they do not have the decency to say so. This particular tax, by any stretch of the imagination, is very large.  From the figures given by the Taoiseach earlier tonight a quick calculation tells me that the duty increase in petrol comes to about 75 per cent of what was there before.  The duty increase in &ldquo;other oils&rdquo;&mdash;the term used in the Minister's statement&mdash;which includes all other oils, comes to a massive 250 per cent, from 2p to 5p per gallon.</P>
    <P>Are we living in a banana republic when we can stand up and propose this kind of imposition on a public which is already reeling from increases over the past few weeks in this same commodity? We are proposing an increase of 250 per cent in one commodity and 75 per cent in another.  Because of its magnitude, the 20p on petrol is the one being talked about more than the other imposition on other oils, but 5p on a gallon of oil is, by any stretch of the imagination, a huge increase but relative to what we are facing on petrol it looks small.  Let me tell the Taoiseach, the Government and Fianna Fáil Deputies that that 5p on other oils could have, and possibly will have unfortunately, disastrous effects on our economic future.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be repetitive but tourism is one area on which this resolution will have an adverse effect, from the point of view of increased hotel costs.  I am speaking now specifically of the 5p per gallon on other oils, heating oil particularly, in the case of tourism.  In one hotel in this town tonight I was told it would mean for them an extra £225 per month.  To stay in business that must be passed on to the customer.</P>
    <P>I come from an area where we have to <Col N="869" /> travel very long distances.  In his statement the Minister advised us on the advantages of car pooling and the use of public transport.  That is fine in the ideal situation where people are not dispersed over a wide area and where there is public transport to avail of.  It is completely unrealistic to make these stupid suggestions about car pooling and public transport in Mayo.  The same applies to the west coast and rural areas in general. We do not have the kind of service that is suitable to workers who must commute.</P>
    <P>I live within five miles of a large new industry.  Many of those employees travel 25 and 30 miles to and from work. To such an employee we are talking about £2 or £3 extra per week for petrol. These people must travel over very bad roads, roads of a worsening condition, and their maintenance charges will increase over a short period.  In a very short time the person faced with that reality&mdash;and it is a reality&mdash;when advising his or her union of the type of claim to be entered under a national understanding, if there is ever such a thing again, will have to take this into account. It is a direct extra cost on that person's purse.  And that is only one of the costs.</P>
    <P>The 20p per gallon will affect tourism and the commuter.  The most amusing aspect is that we are told by the Minister that bus fares will not be increased because CIE will be recouped.  Big deal&mdash;recouped by whom and with whose money?  It will be recouped by the people's money because that money must be replaced by the people from whom it is being taken in a crazy roundabout way.</P>
    <P>Statements are being made to mislead what I would have regarded some time ago as an unsuspecting public.  They are not unsuspecting any longer and they will be even more suspicious after this. Last year it took nine months for the terms of the budget to sink in, but the effects of this resolution will be drastic and therefore immediate.  They will be felt across the board by employer and employee alike.</P>
    <P>The 5p extra per gallon will be felt by <Col N="870" /> the ESB.  They must carry this extra cost and by law they must pass it to the consumer. Industry must carry it and for survival sake they must pass it on to the consumer, in other words, their workers. The result is that we will have inflated wage demands in the near future.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I recall the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, speaking on a motion concerning the price of petrol, saying that the European Energy Commission had met in Paris and a suggestion had come from them that the only way to conserve energy, oil in particular, was to price it out of the market: if you price it high enough the people will not and cannot purchase it.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance has been reading that report and if he is accepting that advice as being proper.  Such advice is fine for the person who uses his car for private entertainment, driving from A to B: it is grand to price him out of the market because he is wasting a very important asset which cannot be replaced.</P>
    <P>But I should like to know what percentage of all car users can be put into that category.  I suggest it is very small. There has been a witch hunt to get after wasters, to hound them out, not to let them waste energy.  In order to get at that small percentage of the consuming public, however, here we are penalising people who have no discretion in the matter, the man who must go to work, the man who must haul goods, the manager who must get to his factory or the hotel man who must use his car to try to encourage guests to use his hotel. They are the people we are really hurting, and in so doing we are damaging the economy and doing a disservice to the country.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the increases outlined in Resolution No. 7 will add between 2½ per cent and 3 per cent to the consumer price index.  I do not know how realistic that is, but I hope for the sake of the country that it is less.  If this means a 2½ per cent increase in the price of one commodity, brought about by the action of the Government, it is nothing short of disgraceful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> We have listened to, and accepted as being reasonable to some degree, the suggestion that part of our problems in the recent past has been caused by factors over which this or any Government could not have control.  We accept that still, despite the fact that when the present Government were over here they were very slow to accept the same theory.  As reasonable people we accept that the increased cost of imported oil has a definite bearing on the state of our economy, but here we have this self-destructive attitude just to raise £113 million as quickly as possible, and there can be no evasion, no avoidance: you just pay your money and take your pick.</P>
    <P>The Government have neither the guts nor the honesty to call this what it is: an imposition of car tax by other means. That is what I find most objectionable about this resolution: it reimposes car tax in a much more severe way because by the stroke of a pen it restores the car tax revenue one-and-a-half times over. Added to that, the car registration fee has been doubled.</P>
    <P>The effects which will flow from this kind of imposition are beyond my imagination. I can foresee some of the problems that will arise.  Deputy Kelly referred to the CII, who have done such a great job in the past 12 months to increase exports and hold their foreign markets.  This imposition will have a blunting effect on their competitiveness abroad.</P>
    <P>We have an open economy without control over imports from our EEC colleagues, but by this self-destructive imposition of tax at this time, when the industries we have been trying to protect are so vulnerable, we are putting the knife into the back of these industries.</P>
    <P>There are people in this country sufficiently naive to believe that we have an energy-conscious Government.  If pricing a commodity out of the market is the road to ensuring that one just does not use something, and in so doing one cuts down on its use, this is the way to do it.  I accept that as being logical.  What I do not accept is that it is the right thing to <Col N="872" /> do because we need that commodity and unless we can get it at a reasonable price we must fold up and throw in the towel.  I object strenuously to the imposition of this tax for the reasons I have given: that it will have very adverse effects on our economy and because it is dishonest.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of my colleagues on this resolution.  As spokesman on Tourism, I feel it my duty to speak out against this imposition.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out by Deputy White we in this country, from the point of view of tourism, are now in a situation in which our petrol costs will be 30p more than those of Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  We are really dependent on our natural charm to attract tourists. Tourists were attracted here because on a cost basis it was thought that we were cheaper than anywhere else.  That is no longer the case.  Tourists will have to pay through the nose to come here.  Were some of this revenue to be spent on a massive capital expenditure programme on our roads it might not be so bad but nowhere do I see any indication that any of this revenue will be spent on improving the deplorable condition of our roads.  Indeed, I have said already this evening that by the time the tourist season begins our roads will probably be impassible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;discretion&rdquo; has been used quite a lot.  We are talking now about a discretionary point.  Certainly where most motorists and petroleum is concerned there is no discretion. The ordinary worker in my area, <Col N="873" /> the PAYE payer, who has to travel some 20 or 30 miles to and from his place of work has no discretion.  There is no point in suggesting that he pool with his neighbour because invariably they will be in different jobs working different shifts.  This suggestion might appear to be ideal but does not work in practice. Therefore, straightaway there is initiated another massive inflationary round with huge demands for wage and salary increases.</P>
      <P>Let us take the example of ordinary farming costs.  It may not be fully realised by the Taoiseach that the rise in farm costs will be very substantial.  Of their very nature farm tractors are heavy consumers of oil.  Therefore the farmer's oil bill constitutes a substantial proportion of his costs.  Indeed, this is an additional imposition of 5p on top of the 10p imposed only the other day.  The Minister said somewhere in his speech that it was time something was done about taxing fuels.  Since this Government came into power we have had a tax imposed on fuel every day of the week. This latest increase is particularly invidious at a time when farm prices appear to be stationary if not below what they were.  Viewing the whole spectrum of agriculture, on which industry is based, it means the imposition of massive increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very little reference was made to road diesel, but again in the case of farm costs road diesel will constitute a very significant part when one thinks of the haulage of sugar beet distances of between 60 and 80 miles.  One must question what road hauliers will charge for the haulage of sugar beet in the coming year, what they will charge for the haulage of grain. Indeed, one might well ask what it will cost to co-operative societies to haul all their milk with this latest 20p imposition. Here again we are speaking about vehicles which of their very nature consume a lot of diesel.  In this respect the Government have done a big disservice to the agricultural sector and its repercussions will be very serious for the country as a whole.  It can be seen that many co-operative societies are already in trouble. <Col N="874" /> One of the big problems we must face is competition in the European market place.  Therefore I contend that, with one stroke of the pen today, the Government have done more damage to Irish exports abroad than if they were a competitor from a third country undercutting us on that market.  Straightaway they have put Irish agriculture in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this massive increase would be reconsidered and that relief would be afforded the most vulnerable areas.  I am very fearful that 20p a gallon on road diesel will have a detrimental effect on our economy, especially the farming sector.  In turn, this will mean dearer food for the consumer. Unless the farmers go bankrupt, they will have to charge more; their charges will have to be passed on.  Commodities such as butter, meat, sugar beet and so on will be more expensive because all of these increased costs must be passed on. But with regard to exports, dairy products, processed foods and so on, one is talking already about very tight competition when we will be pricing ourselves out of the market place.  Were the Ayatollah doing it, then we would have some sympathy for the Government, but when the Government themselves are doing it then they are telling our people: &ldquo;You are no longer in the market place&rdquo; because that is what this imposition means.</P>

      <P>Listening to this debate I feel something must be said by a Deputy representing a county like mine, near the city of Dublin, whose population has increased since the last census by approximately one-third.  That increase has resulted from new housing which has developed in the north and west Wicklow.  Many people from Dublin have been attracted into that county, possibly because of the environmental improvement which attracts people who have traditionally lived in an over-populated area such as the city centre. Many people bought houses there because they understood, particularly after the change of Government, that car tax was being removed and that the Government were providing cheap <Col N="875" /> motoring.  I am protesting on behalf of workers who made that decision in good faith and believed that this Government had their interests at heart in reducing the cost of motoring in their first budget and through their manifesto which brought them into Government.</P>
      <P>Wicklow has benefited from its new residents.  However, because of this budget and the reimposition of motor tax by way of the 20p increase on the price of petrol those people are badly let down. They supported the Government in 1977.  This budget has been regarded as a discretionary one.  However, the taxation impositions are not discretionary for the many commuters who travel from Wicklow to their jobs in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We have a rail system that runs down the east coast but there are a limited number of trains.  It is more useful to people in Bray because they are inside the metropolitan area.  When one travels on the roads one sees buses with the seats outside to indicate that they have broken down.  People know that they cannot depend on public transport at present to ensure that they arrive at their place of employment on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making the point on behalf of the people who made a commitment to live in Wicklow.  They have been badly let down and cannot claw back any money. They must buy fuel whatever the cost. This item demonstrates how far the Government have got away from the committment to attack inflation.  Surely the items we have voted on have added more than 2 per cent to the cost of living index.  It has been suggested that this will add an additional 2 per cent to that index. One would have expected the Government to be tackling inflation.  So far out of the seven items we have debated, this has added on a huge amount to the inflationary spiral that will be reflected in applications to the Prices Commission for increases.  Many workers use their cars to go to work and those who do not, use public transport. These costs will also go up.  This budget is a dangerous one and this item has <Col N="876" /> fuelled the inflationary spiral as no other imposition has for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that motoring has been expensive for the past number of years.  Prior to this increase the person travelling to work has had difficulties. I have experience of people travelling from Newcastle West to Shannon Airport in second-hand cars over bad roads.  The roads in my county could not be worse.  It is dangerous at present to drive a car on some Limerick roads.  That is not the worst point.  What happens is that a car gets damaged and constituents approach me and ask how they go about making a claim against a county council for repairs to the car. There is no way they can get compensation once the council have half started a job but have not finished it.  At present if one leaves a car into a garage no matter how small the job one is talking in terms of £40 or £50.  That is too much for a man with a family.  I know people who have come together and travel in the same car.  I had an unpleasant experience where the car they were using was damaged and they were unable to pay the garage for repairs to it.</P>

      <P>I was trying to point out how costly motoring is at present. The price of petrol now puts motoring beyond the pocket of the working man.  I know of cases where people left their employment because it was unprofitable for them to take their cars to work.  They were unable to get new cars.  We all understand how difficult it is to keep a secondhand car.  There is no way we can avoid further expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> I am disappointed with that aspect of the budget.  I have no sympathy with the man who takes out his car at the weekend to see the scenery.  He is able to afford to do that.  I am interested in the man who is trying to get to work.  I remember listening to a Fianna Fáil man who said that unless there was a change of Government in 1979, at that stage petrol would be £1 a gallon.  How right he was.  It costs £1.52 today.  That is a hefty jump.  We have hit workers a very bad blow.  The farming community will also suffer.  It is a bad day for all workers in spite of the fact that an effort was made today to give the impression that everyone got something.  The people I have referred to are unnecessarily penalised because not alone have they to pay for dearer petrol but as a result of Government policy they have only bad roads to drive on.  I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider and accept that he has made one of the worst decisions in his history by increasing petrol by 20p.</P>

People genuinely expected that the change in the set-up of Fianna Fáil might bring about some welcome improvements.  However, let me say, as a rural Deputy, that this measure is a vicious attack on our rural population.  We heard the Minister today saying that a certain discretion could be exercised as a result of these measures by people using oil and petrol.  What discretion have the people in the remote areas of Wexford, as far as utilisation of cars is concerned?  What discretion have <Col N="878" /> people who want to go to the local church, or to Mass?  How shortsighted can people be?  They just look outside the gates of Dáil Éireann at the streets of Dublin or they look at the streets of Limerick, or Tipperary and expect people to use public transport.  The only public transport in Wexford is from Wexford to Enniscorthy, to New Ross and to Dublin.  This is of little value to the people living in The Hook or in other remote areas of Wexford.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where everybody can use public transport.  I live in a remote area of Wexford where nobody can use public transport.  The Minister talked about discretion.  We have no discretion at all in these matters.  We must have cars in our yards to bring us to the church, to town and to the Dáil.  The Taoiseach can hop up on his bus and come here.  Those are the facts.  The 20p <Col N="879" /> on petrol will have a tremendous effect on the overall situation of the people in a rural constituency, but the most damaging effect on the cost of transport, whether it be transport to the beet factory, to the fair, to the mart, or anywhere else will be the 5p on diesel oil.  We, at the moment, as the Taoiseach very well knows, have a very costly transport system and one of the main reasons for that is the condition of our roads.  I am not going to get into a debate about roads, but if this money were being spent on roads I would forgive the Taoiseach but this is general taxation.  The 5p on the price of diesel oil will have a very damaging effect on the delivery of agricultural produce to the factories, the marts and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I promised to be short and I shall be short.  This measure is extremely disappointing and will have serious consequences, whether the Taoiseach likes it or not, or whether he is trying to make himself believe that it will not.  It will also bring tremendous demands from our wage earners because they must get to their work in their cars.  They cannot hop on public transport in Wexford, which is one rural constituency and there are dozens of rural constituencies.  People had reached the stage, due to the economic progress of the country, where they had got a car.  To put 20p a gallon on petrol, the price at present being £1.31 per gallon and make it £1.51 is the last straw.  As the Taoiseach knows it is the last straw that breaks the camel's back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to be called upon at this late hour to speak on the subject of Resolution No. 7.  I have great reservations about this taxation which will have unfortunate effects throughout our society, in that it will increase the cost of living immediately, effectively, and in each and every household.  Its effect in the city area may not be that immediate as that in rural areas where many people at the moment pool transport in order to travel to work. However, it is particularly about urban <Col N="880" /> areas that I speak.  This taxation will increase the cost of taxi fares for people using this mode of conveyance.  It will increase immediately the cost of private travel by almost one-sixth, as regards fuel consumption.  It is a massive increase which is going to affect travel by private cars, motor bikes, and many associated forms of transport and delivery.  It will increase ambulance costs.  The taxation on oil will increase the cost of heating hospitals, schools, Government buildings and administrative offices throughout the country. This overall increase in administrative cost will not be justified by what will be collected on this tax.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects.  One could cut down on the consumption of oil and oil products.  However, we know from our days in the Government of the Coalition that this amounted to a very small percentage of oil consumption.  Petroleum amounted to approximately 7 per cent of the total consumption.  Is the cost of milk deliveries going to go up, or the cost of basic foods, such as bread, to the underprivileged families in the city?  Already we have the spectre where families have to pay a delivery charge for milk, which never happened here before.  Will this charge be increased indirectly because of the increased taxation on petrol?</P>
      <P>Twenty pence is what we used to call four shillings.  I doubt very much that the Minister for Finance, or the Taoiseach, ever thought that they would see the day in this House where the price of petrol per gallon would be increased by four old shillings.  Those Deputies who came into the House approximately 11 years ago could buy an awful lot for four shillings then.  Not only could they buy over a gallon of petrol but they would have enough change, perhaps, to buy a couple of beers in the bar.  That is not the case now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase will lead to a situation of diminishing returns.  People will become fed up with the cost of petrol and of running a private car, with overall expenses, such as insurance.  Taxation is not very much on a car but there are the costs of repairs and so on.  As well as running a <Col N="881" /> car on petrol, you have to buy oil, gearbox oil, oil for the brakes and the cost of these oils is going up.  The cost of running a car will go up a lot more than the 20p which the Minister is imposing on petrol.</P>
    <P>Will the oil for fishing boats go up by 5p per gallon?  The fishermen say that they cannot afford the cost of oil at present. Will it cost more to land fish around the coast?  Will it cost more for the farmer to bring in his harvest, which would result in an increase in the cost of producing wheat for bread and the further cost of the price of petrol to have the bread delivered?  Will the cost of living rise by a massive amount over and above the 20 per cent predicted here by some Deputies earlier on?  I venture to say that it will.  Fuel is necessary to effect delivery of essential goods throughout urban areas and the cost of the basic commodities will increase, perhaps drastically, over the next year by between 20 and 30 per cent.  I refer to a few figures which I have here.  If one wants a medical doctor to call to one's house, the cost, under this budget, is increased by almost 20 per cent, for just one simple commodity, petrol.  Whatever about its effect in the city, this will certainly affect medical services in the country where there is a fee per item for travel and where many doctors can travel distances well over 15 miles to their patients.  This is one immediate effect which will go through the health boards and which will once again increase the cost of living. We have seen there is to be a 10 per cent reduction in the overall health estimate. Where will the money come from?  Is there to be a big diminution of efficiency in the service throughout the country? Reluctantly, I think there will be.</P>
    <P>I think a vital point has been missed in contributions earlier and it is that while there may have been some consideration given to the PAYE workers, I say it is not much of a change in the PAYE system.  Many people have protested&mdash;I do not know what they protested for&mdash;but here in this petrol taxation it is seen that people still have to pay tax whether they pay PAYE, or are self-employed <Col N="882" /> or anything else.  If the £113 million is taken off the PAYE contribution it is here replaced because 90 per cent or perhaps more of this £113 million might well be contributed by PAYE workers.  So, there is no great relief for PAYE workers.  There is only a relief for the PAYE worker who does not drive a car and who does not smoke or drink.</P>

I think the increase in the cost of living will be much higher than the 20 per cent predicted and more or less agreed to generally here.</P>
      <P>One sad thing that has happened since the Minister's budget speech is that some very kind gentleman came into the House and deposited approximately 150 invitations to the Motor Show which is to be opened next week by the Minister for the Environment.  I do not know where this man was during the Minister's speech and I do not know whether we will get into the show next week, whether our invitations will stand.  I have heard that many people have invested in cars over the years and I believe now that cars valued at £5,000 are all being treated at a blanket £2,000 price; they cannot be sold because of recurring increases, both Government imposed and Government sanctioned.  It will not be too long before we see the magic figures of 200p per gallon for petrol under the auspices of our present Minister.  All I can say is that it will be a long time, with the cost of oil here, before we see the Government well oiled again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Sheik Yamani and some of his colleagues have an international reputation for shaking up the whole western world which they well deserve but in fairness to the Minister for Finance he has really out-done them all. <Col N="883" /> The different price increases for petrol and oil which have so much affected the whole western world have arrived at different times but no increase has been of the magnitude of that proposed by the Minister today.  In May, petrol was increased by 11p per gallon; in August by 12p and on the 15th of this month by between 7p and 10p and, to crown it, the Minister imposes 20p taxation on the gallon of petrol today.  This is the greatest increase ever in this country in motor taxation.  It will affect every person in every walk of life.  Every section of the community will be affected, industry, agriculture, tourism, right across the board.</P>
      <P>I read with interest that part of the Minister's speech where he referred to a rebate for diesel oil used in buses on services scheduled in accordance with the relevant legislation which he said would be increased appropriately so that bus fares would not be affected.  I do not know whether it will be the Minister or the Taoiseach who will be replying in a few moments but I would like to know what the position will be in regard to school transport.  I want to know clearly how school transport will be affected, whether or not buses will be affected.  I refer particularly to the private contractors, the people who are tendering to CIE for school contracts.  If school contractors are to be hit with an increase of this nature it will be impossible for them, the members of PAMBO, to meet these increased costs.  It could be an exorbitant increase for such people.  To me, the Minister's speech does not clarify the position.  I should like it to be clarified because I am sure there are hundreds of private bus owners who are anxiously awaiting that information.  It is of the utmost importance to have this matter properly cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also spoke of a rebate to producers with glasshouses of a minimum area of a quarter-acre and mushroom growers with not less than 3,000 square feet of cultivation area and said they would be rebated 3p of the 5p increase.  I am sure the Minister is aware <Col N="884" /> that the pig industry is going through a particularly difficult period.  An enormous number of pigs are being smuggled into the country.  Has the Minister in mind any concessions such as a rebate for people in the pig industry who are going through a difficult time now?  If we are not careful of our pig industry we will face a serious situation when people will be forced out of this industry.  People in this industry are suffering great losses. The effect of this increase will be devestating for them.  I hope the Minister will think seriously about this industry.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to the poultry industry.  This hydrocarbon price increase will have a serious effect on people engaged in that industry.  Tourism will also be affected by this increase, particularly people who bring their own cars into the country.  An increase of 20p on a gallon of petrol will be a deterrent to people considering that type of holiday.  I do not believe the Minister or any member of the Cabinet realise the devastating effect this increase will have for people in the tourist industry.  Motor car sales have been seriously affected by a lot of matters besides petrol increases in which the Minister was not involved, but this increase added to the existing difficulties will be felt for a long time in this industry. As Deputy Byrne said, it is hard to know what kind of reception people at the motor show will receive next week.</P>

      <P>Those two parties in their unholy alliance in Coalition put 15p on the gallon of petrol in December 1974.  As a result of that increase the proportion of duty in the price of a gallon of petrol at that time was 58 per cent.  When this increase goes on, the duty content of a gallon of petrol will be only 50 per cent.  I do not really think that whoever can make the case against the increase in the petrol duty on this occasion, it should be either the Fine Gael or Labour Parties who should take that role upon themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of 15p in December 1974 would be equivalent to 27p now, whereas the increase which is being put on is 20p.  Nobody likes an increase in duty of this sort.  Of course it will cause a certain amount of inconvenience for a number of people and it will make motoring more expensive, but we are not taking the proceeds of this duty and squandering it.  I ask the Opposition Deputies to consider to what purpose the proceeds of this revenue are being put.  We are using them either to increase very generously the Social Welfare benefits or to give very real concessions to PAYE taxpayers.  It is not just a one-sided coin because the revenue which is being raised by this duty is being put to very desirable social purposes. The Deputies should keep that in mind.</P>
      <P>I know as much about the social and economic scene as any other Deputy in the House.  I move around and I am reasonably certain that for the vast amount of motoring done in the country, domestic, pleasure or business motoring, any motorist who wishes to do so can economise sufficiently in the normal week between social motoring, pleasure motoring and business motoring, to save what is involved in this additional duty.  I recognise that there are probably some motorists who use their motor cars to get to work and who may not be able to economise to the full extent of this additional impost.  We should not forget that the average motorist who uses his car to get to work also uses it for social and pleasure purposes.  Even in that aspect of his motoring he should be able with better management and perhaps a little restriction on his movements to save in any week the extra cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputies to look at this in another way.  There is a great deal to be said in the national interest for raising tax in this way.  There is no doubt that as a community for some considerable time now because of the way the price of oil is going in the oil markets, we have been wasteful in the way in which we have used petrol in particular.  Any Deputy who is honest about this would admit that there is in our motoring habits a <Col N="887" /> great deal of unnecessary and even wasteful consumption of petrol.  If we are to look at it purely from the economic point of view any Government would be justified, from the point of view of the balance of payments in particular, in putting on some sort of tax in order to get people to cut down on their consumption of petrol.  Any Deputy who is honest about this will recognise that that would be totally justifiable in the overall national interest having regard to the unprecedented increase in our balance of payments deficit largely as a result of increased consumption of oil.</P>

This imposition of 20p on the gallon of petrol is proportionately less than that put on by the Coalition Government in December 1974.  It will cause some inconvenience, perhaps even a little hardship here and there, but by and large the ordinary motorist can adjust his motoring habits to economise to the extent of saving this amount in his weekly motoring.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  That the duty of excise imposed by paragraph 4 (1) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 236) (Excise Duties on Motor Vehicles, Televisions and Gramophone Records) Order, 1979 <Col N="892" /> (S.I. No. 57 of 1979), on category A motor vehicles, within the meaning of paragraph 3 (a) of the said Order, shall be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 28th day of February, 1980, at the rate of an amount equal to 40 per cent. of the chargeable value, in lieu of the rate specified in subparagraph 4 (3) (a) of the said Order.</P>
    <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that <Col N="893" /> this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927). </P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us the present rate of duty on motor vehicles?  It seems to be 35 per cent being increased to 40 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question down in the Dáil some months ago relative to the rates of duty on different types of motor vehicles and I was told that you could not get a statement relative to each make of car but that on an average the general rate was only 29 per cent.  How then did I get that reply if the general rate is 35 per cent?  That is only a few months back and there has not been any increase in the meantime. Now it transpires that the rate was 35 per cent, so that the answer I received then was incorrect.  In any case, we are to assume from this resolution that the Minister is getting an additional £50 per £1,000 on motor vehicles and that the total he is now expecting from the buying public is £400 per £1,000.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>This kind of rate does not obtain in any other country in the Community and cars are much dearer here in Ireland than in any other of the eight countries of the EEC.  Here, too, there is little justification for extracting an additional £200, say, on a £4,000 car.  What is the VAT on cars?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the figure?  The Minister mentioned that there is VAT of 10 per cent and that is paid separately from the 40 per cent excise duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This duty is chargeable on delivery from the wholesaler to the retailer.  Therefore, that explains why it does not come to 40 per cent plus 10 per cent of the price as he sees it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <P>So there is the 10 per cent VAT on the manufacturer's price and the 40 per cent VAT on the wholesaler's price.  The two together make a sizeable figure.  I would like it to be known by the general public&mdash;apparently many of them do not know&mdash;that cars are subject to this exorbitant rate of duty in this country, the <Col N="895" /> smallest in the Community.  As with previous resolutions, I see no justification for this exorbitant extraction from the general public.  As mentioned earlier, many families require a car now and the State is raking in money.  It was not made too public at the time car tax was abolished in 1977 that the total duty on cars would be 10 per cent on the manufacturer's price and 40 per cent on the wholesaler's price.  I oppose this Resolution No. 8.</P>

      <P>Even on that alone, it is adding substantially to the cost of living and to motoring costs.  It is especially reprehensible when the motorist is being mulcted on petrol.  The unkindest cut of all is in not having something done about the roads.  The Minister for Finance in his budget speech appealed for restraint. We would all like to see restraint in the PAYE, farming and industrial sectors, but the Government are starting immediately to pave the way for another inflationery round.  The Minister will not get much sympathy or restraint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give comparable rates of duty on motor vehicles in the other member states of the EEC?  It seems to me when I read about the cost of a motor car here as opposed to England that we are talking about anything between 25 per cent and 33? per cent dearer than motor cars in England.  The cause of it is that we have such a high duty on motor vehicles. Could the Minister give any indication of duties applicable in other member countries?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfortunate.  It is obvious to anybody reading the Sunday papers that Irish citizens are being substantially discriminated against in the price of private motor vehicles.  It is one of the main reasons why the standard of living in Ireland is lower than comparable standards in England.  I know there is some EEC agreement to protect our motor industry up to 1984, but this resolution will make it even more difficult for the ordinary worker to buy or to replace a car.  People employed in the motor repair industry will also feel the pinch because there may be a reduction in the number of cars being purchased. The 40 per cent level is excessive and discriminates against people who can only afford small cars.  A more justifiable approach would have been to increase the duty on private motor vehicles in excess of 16 horse power.  That would at least protect the ordinary working man. It is an unfortunate aspect of the resolution and this duty is being imposed on the small car owner and buyer as well as on the large car purchaser.  A more discriminating approach favouring the small car owner would have been more appropriate and a more socially just way forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister to some extent managed to evade answering a question put to him by Deputy Murphy. Could the Minister say, when one aggregates the 40 per cent and 10 per cent, what percentage of the retail price of a car is now going to the State through excise and VAT in a combined way?  This is a very simple question which the Minister should have been able to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is roughly about 42 per cent.  Deputy Murphy raised some queries during the course of his speech.  When talking in terms of 40 per cent excise duty and 10 per cent VAT, Deputy Murphy deduced that 50 per cent of the total price accounted for excise and VAT.  That is not the case.  The total would be about 42 per cent of the retail price.  A car costing about £4,000 was mentioned.  At the moment <Col N="897" /> the duty on that would be about £1,300 and now as a consequence of this, the duty will now be £1,428, that is an increase of £128.  The increase is not on the retail price; the duty is payable at the level between the wholesaler and retailer.  In relation to small cars, mentioned by Deputy Collins, the fact is that this is an <i>ad valorem</i> duty.  One pays in accordance with the price of the car at the wholesale stage.  If one buys a smaller car one would pay proportionately less which seems to be the case Deputy Collins is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that no duty should be imposed on cars of under 16 horse power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this apply to all cars, including cars owned by State bodies and local authorities and will cars bought to be used as service vehicles, such as taxis, have to pay this additional cost or will taximen be given a special exemption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been long since defined in the regulations and it applies to all cars including taxis.  It is rather late for Deputy Collins to suggest that small horse power cars should not be liable for excise duty; he should have made that case some time ago.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In the course of his speech today the Minister indicated that it would no longer be possible for the public sector to be the main jobs creator and that the private sector would have to play its part in creating jobs in the foreseeable future.  One of the principal employers in many towns is the garage industry.  That holds for my town in a fairly big way.  It is common knowledge that for the last year or so the garage business has not been doing well; they are finding it hard to make ends meet and to maintain present standards of employment. The increase in the price of petrol and the tax on cars will make motoring very expensive and it will drive people into doing without cars or into holding on to old cars longer than usual. I have no doubt that the end result of this operation will be unemployment in the garage industry.  As a result of this men will be let go in the garages throughout the country.  If we are to accept the Minister's word that the State can no longer provide the jobs that were promised in the manifesto and that these will have to be provided by the private sector, various ingredients in this budget, particularly this tax will make it more difficult for the private sector to continue to provide the rate of employment they have provided up to the present.  There will be more scope on the general resolution to elaborate on this sort of thing. There are many inconsistencies in this budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the impact on employment, particularly in rural garages.  I am also worried about the road safety aspect.  It has been long established that the roadworthiness of a car is a big factor in road accidents.  This imposition will encourage people to hold on to cars longer than they should and discourage them from having repairs carried out.  Motorists will be putting lives in jeopardy by driving cars that are not roadworthy.</P>
      <P>The poor condition of roads is another important factor, although I know it is not covered in the financial resolution. We cannot have cars without roads.  The motorist has received quite a bashing today and that, together with the poor state of roads, will make motoring expensive, unpleasant and dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker in regard to the effect of this tax on the roadworthiness of vehicles.  In recent times sales of new cars have been very slow and in future there will be more second-hand cars and &ldquo;bangers&rdquo; on the roads.  Does the Minister consider that a car is a luxury?  In my area 50 per cent of people in employment must travel to work and in many cases considerable distances are involved.  Has the Minister taken this into consideration and will he allow travelling expenses to be claimed against income tax?  We are trying to encourage people to take up employment and to stay in their own locality.  The result of this policy is that people must travel to their places of employment. The increase in petrol prices <Col N="900" /> together with the increase in the rate of duty on cars will mean a considerable increase in weekly expenses amounting in some cases to £10 per week and reducing to £5 per week.  Driving is a necessity of life.  We could see a situation where revenue from the sale of cars would reduce, thus defeating the Minister's proposals.  Some people may not be inclined to travel to work and may decide to become unemployed, with consequent loss to the State.</P>
      <P>The impact of this duty is illresearched and I would ask the Minister to give it careful consideration before putting it into operation.  Alternatively, he should give special consideration to the working man who must use his car every day and allow him to claim travelling expenses against income tax.</P>

      <P>I have provision in the budget for what I call a special PAYE employee allowance to take account of the fact that allowances in respect of that sector are not seen as being as generous as allowances to other sectors.  Certainly that was included in my thinking in providing this allowance and also the cost of getting to work.</P>

      <P>A television set is an accepted facility nowadays.  If a family instal a television set with a screen which exceeds 24&rdquo; the Minister will get £79 excise duty.  If it is a coloured set he will get £38 in licence duty, making a total of £117 plus VAT, which is a sizeable figure.  The Government are putting their fingers into the pockets of almost every household and extracting a large sum in the case of this single item.  We will get an idea of that sum when the Minister gives the VAT rate on televisions.  Apart from VAT on televisions the Minister will be collecting £117.  That is not fair or just.</P>

      <P>It takes three pages of legalistic mumbo-jumbo to tax mechanical lighters but there is no reference to the amount of revenue the State will get from this wonderful new tax.  Can the Minister give some indication as to the likely revenue in 1980 and 1981 as a result of the imposition of the tax on mechanical lighters?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated yield from the revenue will be £0.3 million.  In relation to the point about legalistic mumbo-jumbo I should like to state that the difference between this resolution and the others is that it is the first time a duty is being introduced on mechanical lighters.  That is the reason why the regulation has to be set out in detail.  On the face of it, that seems to confirm the case Opposition Deputies have been making that we have been looking around everywhere to scrape the reality. I should like to confront Deputies with the reality which is that since 1916 matches have been subject to this tax. <Col N="906" /> The Deputy should be aware that there is a match industry here which is of considerable importance.  The 20p tax on mechanical lighters is estimated to equate, as near as possible, to the existing excise duty on matches of 56.6p per standard gross of 7,200 matches.  It is in the interest of redressing that balance that the tax has been introduced. I have no doubt that Deputies opposite will agree that it was introduced in the interest of protecting an important Irish industry and that on that basis it is justified.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In those circumstances we agree with this resolution but I should like to point out that the improvement in income tax is largely a case of the Minister making a virtue out of necessity.  One of the provisions in this results from the case decided by the High Court and the Supreme Court. Those courts decided that each working spouse was entitled to be taxed separately.  The Government fought their case and when the decision was given against them had no alternative but to tax each spouse separately and give all the allowances one spouse was entitled to.  There has been a certain amount of trumpet and horn blowing&mdash;almost a repetition of the Fianna Fáil ArdFheis&mdash;about the Government extending this benefit to unearned income, whatever that is, as well as earned income. Unearned income was abolished and every student is aware that the only reason the Supreme Court did not include unearned income was because they were not asked to adjudicate on that. The teachers who brought the case to the Supreme Court were only concerned with earned income.  We all know that if the Minister had not treated unearned income, as the Minister described it, in the same manner as he has to treat earned income the State would have been brought before the courts again.  The most junior law student must be aware that the courts would have decided that earned and unearned income should be treated in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that more than £100 million is being given by way of concession <Col N="915" /> on the income tax front but that has already been taken back from certain people who are involved with motor cars.  Many of those who must use cars to get to their place of employment would not have been liable for tax because of their personal allowances or their modest income but they will be paying a form of tax to the Government under the budget to help pay for this tax concession.  This is an improvement on the situation but it is going too far for the Minister and the Government to take credit for implementing something which they would have had to do under a court order.  They must also give a concession because they bungled last year's budget by putting on the 2 per cent tax and then took it off.  In this way the PAYE people were provoked into taking to the streets in their hundreds of thousands.  What is being given, therefore, is either at the direction of the Supreme Court or at the direction of the masses of PAYE people who were infuriated by the way in which last year's budget was bungled, especially by the way in which the Government dealt with the then proposed 2 per cent tax on farmers, a measure that should never have been proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied as is Deputy Fitzpatrick regarding the income tax question.  If I am interpreting the Minister's statement correctly, husbands and wives who are self-employed are being discriminated against.  The Minister has told us that a husband and wife, if they are in the PAYE category, are to be allowed an extra £400 each in respect of tax allowances.  Are we to take it that the couple who are working together in their business or on their farm are not to be allowed this extra amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated here many times, I believe in the concept of private enterprise but if I understand the Minister correctly, couples engaged in a private enterprise such as a shop or a farm are to be discriminated against in terms of the tax code, though in their own way <Col N="916" /> they would be contributing just as much as anyone else to the common good.</P>
    <P>In regard to Financial Resolution No. 13, it is proposed to reduce the child allowance for income tax purposes from £218 to £195, a decrease of £23.  We are told that this change will offset the increase in children's allowances.  A tax-free allowance of £195 in respect of a child is not realistic in today's terms as any parent who has a child at any level of education will confirm.  It is estimated that to maintain a schoolgoing child costs in the region of £1,000 per year. Therefore, the tax-free allowance in this respect should be much higher.  Last year the figure in this regard was reduced from £240 to £218.  The new figure will mean that the tax-free allowance in respect of five schoolgoing children will amount to £975.  This is an aspect of the matter that has been overlooked. Children's allowances, too, are totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Regarding the other point I raised, are the couple who are within the PAYE system to be allowed a total tax-free allowance of £3,030 while the self-employed man and his wife are to be allowed £800 less?</P>

      <P>My query is simple and direct and I expect that the Minister will not have any difficulty in answering <Col N="917" /> it.

Will it be 87 per cent as it was last year or the year before or will it be more than that?</P>

      <P>I shall deal generally with the points raised especially with the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick who said that I was making a virtue out of a necessity and that what we are doing has been forced on us by the decision in the Murphy case.  First, we should put the record right in that regard.  The cost of implementing that decision as given by the court would be £30 million whereas the cost the of scheme I have announced today will be £130 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know, as any law student would know, that if the Supreme Court were asked to decide on the same sort of case in respect of unearned income, their decision might be different.  We can take the law only as it is laid down for us.  The courts confined their judgment very clearly to earned income and in the case in question they ranged over the whole constitutional issue of marriage and the special place of the family.  They referred precisely to earned income.  On that basis it is flying in the face of reality to suggest that we are simply making a virtue of a necessity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to which argument I am replying at this point but I was told I was making a virtue out of a necessity of the Supreme Court decision.  So far I have given one very precise figure to show that this is not the case.</P>
      <P>I will now concentrate on other prospects of the scheme which were not referred to so far.  Nobody presented a case for exemption either in the court hearing or in any submissions, but that is something this Government are doing. That is not making a virtue out of necessity or reacting to pressure.  That exemption&mdash;£1,700 for single people and £3,400 for a married couple&mdash;will apply to a considerable number of taxpayers. That is not making a virtue of necessity, neither is the special PAYE employee allowance of £400.  That is a major element in this new scheme which will be available to married couples, who are both working, as a double allow-ance&mdash;£800. That is a very important characteristic of this scheme.</P>
      <P>It is important to note the broadening of the tax band.  This has been causing concern among a wide section of the PAYE taxpayers for some time, because as I said today, they moved too quickly from one band into another.  The tax bands have been broadened to ensure that this will not happen now.  As a result a considerable number of taxpayers will move from the higher bands even into the lowest band.  That is not making a virtue out of necessity and will have a very real impact on the actual take home pay of workers.</P>
      <P>Under the existing arrangement, after £6,600 of taxable income, the balance was payable at 60 per cent.  Under the new proposal one does not get to the 60 per cent tax rate until after £9,000&mdash;that figure is doubled for married couples.  All along the line whatever is applied to single people has, by definition, to be doubled for a married couple who are both working.  This is a major innovation. Before Deputies imply that this is discriminatory I advise them to study the details in the explanatory table and work out for themselves how real the increases are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> Deputy Murphy said that because the special Schedule E PAYE allowance is restricted to Schedule E taxpayers and not to Schedule D&mdash;the self-employed&mdash;that is discrimination against the self-employed.  Deputy Murphy will be aware that for a considerable time the discrimination&mdash;if he wants to use that word&mdash;worked the other way.  As I said earlier, I am trying to redress various imbalances that exist in this scheme, pending the overall introduction of new comprehensive schemes when the commission look at this.  Self-employed persons are not chargeable for income tax in any year on the basis of the profits of the accounting period ending in that year but on profits made in the preceding year.  Having regard to the increases in wages and, perhaps, because of inflation, obviously that is a very real advantage.  The PAYE Schedule E taxpayer pays tax as he earns his money, one might even say before he gets it.</P>

      <P>During 1978 the Industrial Development Authority approved seven small industry projects, having a job creation potential of 118, for County Waterford.  This level of small industry approvals compares favourably with other counties in the south-east region and with many other counties throughout the country during that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full range of IDA incentives, including <Col N="684" /> specially constructed advance factory units, is available to promoters of small industries in County Waterford. However, the level of project approvals in any county is affected by a number of other factors, principally the urban structure of the county and the willingness of the persons to take the risks entailed in the establishment or expansion of manufacturing ventures.</P>
    <P>As part of their policy to encourage indigenous industry, the IDA in 1979 commenced a promotional campaign to encourage small industry development in the south-east region.  The campaign, which was accompanied by extensive local publicity, involved attendance by IDA personnel at six centres throughout the region, including Waterford city and Lismore, to meet persons who might be interested in establishing small industries. The IDA have informed me that the campaign was very successful and that, based on the provisional results, the 1979 figures for small industry project approvals in County Waterford will show a large increase on the 1978 outturn.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give specific information in respect of the small industries or re-equipment programmes; however new procedures were introduced during 1979 with the aim of reducing as far as possible the time involved in making grant payments to small industries.</P>

Further discussions with representatives of these or other similar concerns will be arranged as necessary. The Irish Goods Council are also conducting <Col N="686" /> a very active campaign aimed at increasing the level of Irish foodstuffs purchased and, to this end, have arranged a number of promotions with retailers including the larger retailing outlets to encourage the sale of Irish produced grocery products.  In addition, IDA grant assistance has been available to Irish food manufacturers for the development and re-equipment of their plants to enable them to become more competitive and thereby avoid job losses arising from import competition or otherwise.  It has to be borne in mind that freedom to restrict imports is constrained by our international commitments and obligations.</P>

The realised figures were 2.196 million visitors and £403.5 million revenue.  The shortfall can for the most part be attributed to a combination of the communications difficulties and the effects of the petrol supply situation up to the introduction of the voucher scheme together with a softening in the economies of some of our main source markets overseas.</P>

      <P>The first two years of the three year programme for the promotion of Irish goods have just ended.

Surveys conducted on behalf of the council indicated that their activities to this had met with considerable success.</P>
      <P>In the second year of the programme the council concentrated on the retail trade to ensure that purchasers would always have the opportunity to purchase Irish.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question suggests that I recently indicated that I proposed to introduce legislation on certain issues.  This suggestion is in line with a reported public statement by the Deputy in which he referred critically, and apparently at some length, to alleged attempts by the Government to restrict bail although, according to him, the garda had never advocated such a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is misinformed.  It is public knowledge that there is a widespread view in the Garda Síochaána that bail laws are so liberal as to create serious problems and that those laws ought to be changed.  Nevertheless, contrary to what the Deputy appears to think, the only Government decision that bail ought to be restricted was a decision taken by the National Coalition Government. I am not saying that that decision was right or that it was wrong, but only that it was in fact taken and publicly announced. <Col N="689" /> Its implementation would have involved a constitutional referendum.</P>
    <P>This Government have made no such decision and I have made no statement suggesting that such a decision is likely to be made either in the near future or at all, though obviously I do not exclude the possibility that such a decision may be made some time.</P>
    <P>Neither did any recent comment of mine express any view about rights of silence and in fact expressions such as &ldquo;the right of silence&rdquo; are used by different people in different ways and, even if asked, I would not have been prepared to express views on the matter.  Similarly, I could not agree to make any comment now as to what proposal, if any, I may put to the Government in that regard nor could I anticipate what decision the Government may make in due course.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a non-contributory old age pension on 18 February 1979 but his application could not be dealt with until after the postal dispute ended.  When the social welfare officer called to investigate his means in October 1979 he discovered that the applicant was an insured person and might be entitled to a contributory pension.

    <P>It has been confirmed that the pensioner has assigned her interest in the farm to her son.  As soon as the deed of transfer, duly stamped, has been <Col N="695" /> received her means will be re-assessed and a revised decision will be given.</P>

      <P>Posthumous payment for six weeks of non-contributory old age pension is only made to the dependent spouse of a deceased pensioner and is not, therefore, payable in this case.  A week's pension is due, however, and a claim form for this was sent to the personal representative of the deceased on 11 February 1980.  When the form has been returned to my Department the amount due will be paid.</P>

I notified the council on 12 October 1978 of my approval to their proposals for the improvement of a section of the route between Ballyvary and Bohola at Knockatemple.

The problem is therefore, largely an agricultural one and I understand that <Col N="698" /> the Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the county agricultural advisory service, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and other interested bodies, are actively engaged in trying to assist the pig producers in making arrangements for the disposal of a substantially increased amount of the slurry outside the Sheelin catchment area.

      <P>The high level of demand for agricultural training can best be met by expanding the facilities at existing agricultural colleges and proposals have, therefore, been made to the EEC Commission for the provision of a substantial number of additional places at existing agricultural colleges as part of the Commission's proposals for the development of agriculture in the west of Ireland.  In regard to Ballinfad College, however, I have recently received detailed proposals from local interests for the conversion of the college to an agricultural college and these proposals are at present being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the Minister for Finance to move item No. 5 on the Order Paper I should like to state that, in accordance with a recommendation made to me by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges following last year's budget, I have to remind Members of the necessity to maintain the strictest confidentiality with regard to budget information circulated to Members in the House prior to its disclosure to the Dáil by the Minister for Finance. Disclosure of any such information in advance of its announcement here by the <Col N="704" /> Minister will be treated as a serious breach of the privileges of the House. This statement is in accordance with the instructions issued to me by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges following last year's budget.</P>
