      <P>Thank you.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to comment on newspaper speculation that the present Minister for Finance may be appointed to the post of EEC Commissioner?

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no formal agenda as such for these meetings.  The European Council arranges to discuss in an order agreed at the start of the meeting, matters of concern, both internally and externally, to the Community and the member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I request the <Col N="499" /> Taoiseach, in a general, constructive sense, for possible measures to help in the very desperate state of our economy at the moment, from the point of view of import restrictions, or something which might help the unemployment situation? Is there anything positive or constructive which he feels might be introduced and accepted as such?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy knows that the Council would not be the place to deal with specific matters of that sort.  The Deputy can be assured that I&mdash;and indeed, as far as I know, many other heads of government&mdash;will be raising the general state of the economy throughout the Community, with particular emphasis on the problem of unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect, if he himself takes part, to have the question of the CAP, which is so important to this country, discussed there, particularly in the light of the attacks on the CAP which have been coming from many quarters in recent months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I shall be&mdash;there and elsewhere&mdash;making it very clear that we are totally opposed to any taking away from the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy.  I shall avail of every opportunity which offers to emphasise the importance to us as a nation and as an economy, of this common agricultural policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>One last question.  Does the Taoiseach anticipate that there will be any discussion regarding the budgetary problems, particularly the 1 per cent limit, bearing in mind again the statement of Lord Carrington yesterday that he saw no possibility of an increase in the present limit of the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly think that, in any general discussion on the economy of the Community, the 1 per cent limit would be something which would arise for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach press for a raising of that limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already indicated our views in various Councils on the need to provide adequate resources in the Community for the financing of the different programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach whether he will be seeking support from any other quarter in the Community on the question of raising the 1 per cent limit?  I assure him of the support of all of us on this side of the House in any efforts he makes in this regard in view of its crucial importance to the common social policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the support from the Opposition benches.  As I have indicated to the Deputy's colleagues, I shall lose no opportunity in pressing our case and, indeed, in my view, the case for the proper development of the Community in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the most recent unemployment figures available for Waterford city and Waterford county; how these figures compare with those at the corresponding date in 1979; and the percentage of the available work force they represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of unemployed registered at the Waterford unemployment exchange at the latest available date and the number at the corresponding dates in 1978 and 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore) Séan Moore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons on the live register at Waterford city employment exchange on 31 October 1980 was 2,336; at corresponding dates in 1979 and 1978 the figures were 1,744 and 1,956 respectively. <Col N="501" /> For the other employment offices in County Waterford the aggregate live register totals on the same dates were 671,416 and 450 respectively.</P>
    <P>As regards the percentage of the available work force represented by the numbers on the live register, the position is, that a figure is calculated and published, on a quarterly basis, only for the south-east planning region.  The relevant ratio for the region at mid-September 1980 was 12.2 per cent while the figure published for 1979 was 9.3 per cent although it must be borne in mind that a comparison of these figures is affected by the changes in the composition of the live register introduced from 1 January 1980.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that the ratio in question, which is obtained by expressing the number of insured on the live register as a percentage of the total insured labour force&mdash;excluding the agriculture, fishing and domestic service sectors&mdash;is based on the location of the local employment office where each insured person is registered.  As this may differ for a significant number of cases from the office where an unemployed person may sign in order to apply for unemployment benefits and unemployment assistance, meaningful results can be obtained only for relatively large areas such as the planning regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that the percentage figure was 12.2?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are considerably worse off than Cork?  Does that figure include people on short time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Short-time and part-time workers are not included in the general number.  That follows a decision of the inter-Departmental committee which reported in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number on the live register on 31 October was 110,921 and the figures for the corresponding <Col N="502" /> period in 1979 and 1978 were almost 83,000 and 92,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if Waterford, and the south-east in general, is the worst affected area other than Donegal for unemployment at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the high incidence of jaundice that has been and is occurring in County Galway; and the steps he is taking or has taken to identify the source of the infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the on-going high incidence of infectious hepatitis in various parts of the county, including Galway.  This has been the subject of discussion with the Directors of Community Care of the health boards and on-going investigations of outbreaks of the condition are undertaken by the Directors of Community Care.</P>
      <P>Infectious hepatitis is a difficult disease to control.  There are two distinct types of the disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.  Hepatitis B is associated with syringes, needles and other intravenous equipment. The use of disposable equipment of this type has considerably helped in the control of this form of the disease.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis A may be caused by a variety of reasons, including poor hygienic practice and frequently there is no identifiable common source.  The infection may be spread from person to person or by some common vehicle such as food.</P>
      <P>The prevalence of the disease underlines the importance of good hygienic practices as emphasised in the National Hygiene Campaign which was run by my Department in recent years and it is encouraging to note that the notified incidence of the disease throughout the country has decreased from 860 cases in 1977 to 419 in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Minister answered Deputy Donnellan's question <Col N="505" /> which was in relation to whether there is a higher incidence than normal in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for Galway have been reduced considerably in 1980 to date.  The figure for 1979 was 50, and to the end of September of this year is 27. On a national basis that would be one per 6,200 approximately of the population. Dublin would be one case per 5,100 of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The reported incidences of the disease indicate that Galway has had a high incidence relative to its population but the incidence per head of the population in Galway is lower than in some other areas, for example, Waterford.  The reported incidences reached a peak in 1979 when they represented one case in 3,355 of the population of the county.  As I have indicated the figure in Galway is falling in common with the national figure.</P>

      <P>There are two situations in which EEC Form E112 is issued by a health board to an eligible person to enable him or her to get medical treatment in another EEC state:</P>
      <P> 1.  in the case of a person who is referred abroad for treatment which is not available in this country and</P>
      <P>2.  in the case of a person who, in the course of receiving treatment for a condition in this country, changes residence to another EEC state.  </P>
      <P>The first situation would not normally arise for maternity services because a full range of maternity services is available in this country.  I am not aware of services being refused to a person in the second situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of detailed information on the consumption of drugs and medicines in the private sector it is not possible to assess trends in recent years with any great accuracy.  From the information available about the General Medical Service it appears that prescription numbers have stabilised.  There was a slight decrease in 1979 over the previous year.  It is too soon yet to say if this trend will continue in the present year.</P>
      <P>Consideration is now being given to further approaches aimed at reducing the level of prescribing in the General Medical Service.  Hopefully any reductions here will be reflected also in private practice prescribing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asks the Minister the progress, if any, that has been made in reducing the level.  I gave the progress in relation to the General Medical Service on which we have definite factual information.  In relation to private practice we have not got that kind of information.  Hopefully there is a parallel reduction in that area.  A variety of steps have been taken.  A series of bar charts was circulated to GMS doctors showing the comparative prices of drugs available under the different therapeutic classes. As the Deputy mentioned, the Health Education Bureau have been undertaking a programme to try to discourage the over-prescription of drugs.  A number of other steps have been taken which may be relevant to a later question.  Steps have been taken through the organisation of seminars and so on to try to reduce the overall level of prescribing.  Other proposals are being considered at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau, in co-operation with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, recently <Col N="509" /> completed a training course for 30 community pharmacists from all areas of the country on the subject of substance abuse, including drugs.  It is intended that these pharmacists will be available within a radius of 30 miles in each health board area to parent-teacher associations and other interested community groups in order to provide education on the proper use of medicines and on substance abuse. Standardised educational material has been developed for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Education on drugs is an integral part of the health education programme in schools.  It has been a feature of courses on teaching skills and practices in health education which the bureau organised this year for 200 primary and post-primary school teachers.</P>
      <P>The bureau will shortly be publishing a booklet dealing with education on substance abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider that some of the education in the abuse of various substances could be extended from the teachers to the pupils? Would he consider sympathetically the suggestion that a special supplement might be included in a future issue of &ldquo;Young Citizens&rdquo;, for example, in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly take up that suggestion.  One of the main aspects those concerned will take into consideration is bringing education on drugs into general education as far as possible, and not separating it to highlight it, because they feel there could be disadvantages in doing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be appropriate for teachers to have some training in this area at the point at which they are becoming trained as teachers and not when they are three, four or five years into the teaching process, when many of their teaching habits and their assumptions will be well-established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be a natural extension of the work the Health Education Bureau have been doing.  In recent <Col N="510" /> times it has been a feature of courses on teaching skills and practices in health education which the bureau have organised for teachers.  I agree with the Deputy that it would be worth while introducing it early in teacher training.  The Medical Social Research Board are carrying out a survey on post-primary children in the Dublin city and county area in relation to cigarette smoking, alcohol, drug abuse and leisure time studies which should provide some useful information.</P>

    <P>It was estimated that the funds required for the Cavan Hospital project in 1979 would be £200,000.  However, due to difficulties with site development works which were then in progress <Col N="511" /> expenditure in that year only amounted to £55,609.</P>

      <P>The question of a grant for the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre was discussed between officials of my Department and the Eastern Health Board. Detailed information was available on the work of the centre prior to the health board being authorised to pay the grant. The grant was given to enable the centre to employ a full-time worker to co-ordinate and develop its work.  The utilisation of the grant will be reviewed by the Eastern Health Board in accordance with the normal procedures relating to grants to <Col N="516" /> voluntary agencies made under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
      <P>I have absolutely no evidence that the grant is being used for any of the purposes mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Family planning is generally accepted as coming within the scope <Col N="519" /> of general medical practice and the primary source of advice envisaged is the family doctor.  The role of the health boards will be complementary to that of general practitioners, being concerned normally with the provision of more specialised information and advice.  I have asked health boards to consider arrangements to ensure that, where they are required, services of this kind are made available.

      <P>It is.  Is the Minister aware that 60 local committees composed of interested people from various bodies in Donegal operate a series of services for the health boards, that one of the areas they administered was the free fuel scheme and that the change will be a risk for the families of recipients in County Donegal who may not always spend the money on the fuel for which it is intended?  Is there any way in which the moneys can be diverted to ensure that the fuel is actually delivered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have given the answer in relation to the scheme as it exists.  The question which the Deputy raises is whether it is desirable to have a voucher scheme.  That scheme arose after fairly long and detailed consideration by the numerous interests involved and after a private study was done in the Eastern Health Board area.  It has considerable advantages apart from the disadvantage that the Deputy mentions.  In that respect he would see from the application increases that obviously it has attracted a wider number of people to avail of the <Col N="525" /> scheme.  The voucher is available for bottled gas and various other fuels.  The only thing I could say at this stage is that we will keep that under review.</P>

      <P>The reason I have not yet implemented the report of the working party on a common contract for consultants is that all the parties to the contract have not yet indicated their acceptance of it.  I have, however, announced that the common contract will be implemented as from 1 April 1981 in the case of health boards and such other hospital authorities as agree to accept it.

In this context, an adult person means a person who is 16 years of age or older.  Students who are 16 years of age or older and who have no means of their own are, therefore, entitled to medical cards.  Mature students who may have <Col N="527" /> income of their own are treated, for purposes of eligibility for medical cards, in the same way as other members of the population: their entitlement depends on their own specific circumstances, including size of income, number of dependants and the extent of certain outgoings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a double week's payment in December 1980 in weekly social welfare payments to long-term recipients.  It is the Government's policy to improve and extend whenever possible social welfare schemes and payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, recently it has been my privilege, as Minister for Social Welfare, to improve the winter fuel scheme and to extend it nationwide and also to remove some of the restrictions on the free travel facilities for old people.  We are particularly concerned to ensure that long-term social welfare recipients &mdash; those who are affected by advancing years, chronic ill-health or the exceptional pressures of widowhood &mdash; can meet the additional expenses which affect us all at this time of year.  Accordingly, I am very pleased that the Government, in the context of the Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development, <Col N="577" /> undertook to provide these additional payments this year.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention, although it is not strictly relevant to this Bill, that a double week's payment is also being provided in the case of persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children, all of which are administered by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The categories who, under this Bill, are being given the extra week's payment are persons receiving old age pension, contributory and non-contributory, blind pension, widow's and orphans' pensions, contributory and non-contributory, retirement pension, invalidity pension, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, social assistance allowances for unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and single women, and occupational injuries disablement pension and death benefit by way of pension.</P>
    <P>Apart from occupational injuries benefit payments, the double payment will be made at post offices on the appropriate day of payment of pensions and allowances in the second week of December 1980.  Old age, blind, widows' and orphans' pensioners will be due payment on Friday, December 12, the other categories on Thursday, December 11.</P>
    <P>The additional sum to be paid will be equal to the face value of the weekly pension or allowance order and will include all increases in respect of adult and child dependants and any supplements which form part of the regular weekly payment.  Certain long-term recipients of occupational injuries benefit by way of pension are paid by cheque monthly in advance.  These will be issued with cheques for December at the equivalent of five weeks payment instead of four.</P>
    <P>The numbers of payees who will benefit as a result of this Bill total 345,000. These are made up of 196,000 old age and blind pensioners, 81,000 widows, 1,000 orphans, 32,000 retirement pensioners, 16,000 invalidity pensioners, 6,000 deserted wives, 8,000 social assistance <Col N="578" /> recipients and 5,000 occupational injuries pensioners.</P>
    <P>In addition, the increase payable in respect of a further 117,000 persons will also be doubled for that week.  These are 50,000 adult dependants, 3,000 prescribed relatives and 64,000 child dependants. The overall total of persons covered by the extra payment will therefore be 462,000.</P>
    <P>The cost of the additional payment is estimated at £8.76 million, comprising £5.35 million for contributory and £3.41 million for non-contributory payment.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that this Bill will commend itself to all Deputies, and I ask for its early passage so as to ensure that the additional sums will be paid in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome the provisions in this Bill which seek to give effect to part of the second national understanding whereby persons in receipt of long-term social welfare benefits and assistance will be given an additional week's payment during the Christmas period.  This is a worthwhile move and, I suggest, one that should not be implemented in the form of a Bill which will apply only to the end of 1980.</P>
      <P>I should have thought that once the principle of paying additional moneys at Christmas to pensioners and social welfare recipients had been established, it would be on a permanent basis.  This legislation, rather than just authorising the Minister to make payments in respect of the December 1980 period, should authorise him and his successors to make a second week's payment available every Christmas from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear that under the terms of a further understanding, or in the absence of a national understanding, this provision might not recur.  This legislation is an indication on the part of all the partners to the national understanding that there is a need for social welfare recipients, especially elderly people, to have additional money to tide them over the Christmas period.  Bearing all this in mind, it would have been better if this had been enshrined in legislation on a permanent basis.  If, in future, times are hard or a national understanding is not achieved, this legislation might not be <Col N="579" /> reintroduced and therefore it would not take effect in any other year.  This would be regrettable and would probably have the effect of making long-term social welfare recipients and pensioners resentful that they had been paid a double week one year and not in subsequent years.  I would like the Minister to explain why this Bill applies only to this year.</P>
    <P>I accept the Bill does not deal specifically with the payment of certain allowances which are referred to in the Minister's statement.  I take it that these allowances will be funded from the general Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare and I assume we will be discussing a Supplementary Estimate to give effect to those provisions before Christmas.  In my view, the Minister has not been fair in his recent comments in relation to having half-yearly reviews of payments to social welfare recipients and his suggestion that the present Government introduced that situation last year. It is well known that when the last Government were in office and inflation was at a certain level, there were twice yearly reviews of Social Welfare payments.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quoted in the press as having suggested that this was the first time this had been done, but that is not correct.  I suggest that when inflation is at the levels we see today and when the cost of living is producing hardship for those in receipt of reasonable incomes, it should be an acceptable principle that the level of payments to social welfare recipients would be kept at least in line with increases in the cost of living. That is not unreasonable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought one of the reasons for introducing this Bill was to give social welfare recipients additional payments at Christmas time because of the <Col N="580" /> high cost of living.  I suggest that these people should be given additional payments to keep the real value of their payments in line with the cost of living. I am not suggesting any more than was contained in the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I am sure we will have an opportunity to do that before Christmas.  This is one of the Government's attempts at keeping social welfare payments in line with the cost of living. I do not think this measure together with budgetary increases would have had the effect over the last few years of keeping social welfare payments in real terms in line with the cost of living.</P>
      <P>I suggest that, rather than have the option situation or a situation where in any one year a particular Minister for Finance or Minister for social Welfare can represent himself or be regarded as a marvellous fellow because he gave a particular percentage increase as opposed to what his predecessor had given, the House should accept that there must be a provision where social welfare payments to long-term recipients move in line with the cost of living.  If this Bill is a small move in that direction, it is to be welcomed but I am worried because it applies only to Christmas 1980.  It should have been enshrined in this legislation as a permanent measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to social welfare recipients this point should be raised: on the last three or four occasions it was necessary to issue new books to social welfare recipients, there were numerous complaints, unrest and dismay on the part not only of the recipients but of those involved in voluntary organisations who worked with the elderly and the disadvantaged.  It appears that, whether the fault lies with <Col N="581" /> the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of the Public Service, who did not provide sufficient staff, or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for their inability to deliver letters at the rate at which our Victorian grandfathers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I let the Deputy make his case but this cannot arise on this Bill.  As the Deputy said, he will have an opportunity to raise all those matters at another stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that if the Minister represents himself as Santa Claus, between himself and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Reynolds, the additional payments may arrive in time for the New Year.  That is not much good to somebody looking for extra money for Christmas.  The Minister said old age, blind, widows and orphans pensions will be due for payment on Friday, 12 December and the other categories on Thursday, 11 December.  He also said that recipients of &ldquo;occupational injuries benefit by way of pension are paid by cheque monthly in advance. These will be issued with cheques for December at the equivalent of five weeks' payment instead of four&rdquo;.  I am delighted with that but I want an assurance that these people will get the money they are supposed to get to tide them over the Christmas period in time to spend it during Christmas 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Past experience can only lead us to suspect that there may be a considerable number of pensioners who will not receive this extra money before Christmas. The Minister has not explained what the procedure is to be; whether it will be by way of a simple notification to post offices to pay two weeks payment on foot of the December 12 chit or whether his Department are to issue automatically five weeks payment in respect of the ordinary December monthly payment. This is very important because, having regard to the delays that can occure, the issuing of additional chits could result, because of delays, in the money not being paid in time for Christmas.  During the past couple of years such delays were very marked.  This situation arose not <Col N="582" /> only because of the postal dispute and the continued effects of that dispute but also because of a shortage of staff in the Department due to a lack of authorisation on the part of the Department of the Public Service in that regard.</P>
    <P>Since the partners to the national understanding have said that social welfare recipients should receive additional money to help them at Christmas time, it is our duty to ensure that that extra money reaches them in time for spending for Christmas.  One cannot think of anything worse than Santa Claus arriving after Christmas.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the provisions of the Bill though I would have preferred them to have been enshrined in permanent legislation rather than on a once-off basis. It is only reasonable to point out that there has been a high rate of failure in having money reach eligible persons in time in the recent past.  In these circumstances the Minister should be in a position to assure us that there will not be any such delay on this occasion.  The easiest way of dealing with the provision would be to notify the paying agencies to pay a double week's money on foot of the chit in question.  The Minister has not dealt with that point but I suggest that the method I am putting forward would be the neatest and perhaps the best administrative way of having this money paid.  I hope that at an early stage this provision will become a permanent part of the social welfare code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, a double weeks money is what is being paid but I shall deal with that later in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to commend the Minister for bringing in this Bill.  It is a measure that we welcome very much because it represents a gesture, albeit a small one, towards the weaker section of our community.  It is important that in the context of any national wage understanding, provision is made for social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with Deputy Boland, I should like to see this provision being enshrined as a permanent part of legislation, <Col N="583" /> being brought in for each year as happens in Britain.  If we could afford that it would be a marvellous gesture towards the less-well off sections.</P>
    <P>A point that my party have asked me to bring to the attention of the House is that quite a number of people who will be on long-term benefits will be deprived of this special payment.  This arises from the stipulation of payment being in respect only of the week commencing 12 December.  I understand that the trade union movement have been in contact with the Department in this regard because, within the terms of the national understanding, anyone who is a long-term recipient in December should qualify. There was no reference to 12 December. Though the Minister wishes to have the Bill passed today, I would ask him to postpone it for 24 hours so that the ICTU might be consulted with a view to having this point clarified.  Also, persons due to retire in the latter weeks of December will not qualify for the extra payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, commend the Minister for bringing in this provision.  The Bill indicates that even in times of recession the Government have their priorities right and are doing a little extra to help the weaker sections.  However, in saying that I am not being complacent because I should like to see much more being done for the weaker sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our society there is a growing evidence of the strongest sections using their strength in order to have their various demands met.  Their demands are often backed either by very strong action or by threats of such action.  At times one is inclined to despair because of these trends and is led to ask the question of whether we are building a society in which the weaker sections must suffer because of the ability of the stronger sections to impose their will on us.  It must cause each of us some concern to think that the blind or the old or some other such group may be deprived in some way because of the approach of the stronger sections.  But I am glad that the weaker sections are in a position to say that the <Col N="584" /> Government are the voice to speak for them.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have the effect of helping the weaker sections during the Christmas period.  Deputy Boland referred to Santa Claus.  It would be my hope that we could have a visit from Santa Claus every week so far as social welfare recipients are concerned but that is not possible.  However, the Bill is an indication of the good intention of the Government so far as these people are concerned.  I am glad that the Opposition speakers have seen fit to commend the Minister for bringing in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland expressed the fear that some people may not receive the extra money in time for Christmas but I am sure that there is no need for such fear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be the means of bringing considerable relief to social welfare recipients at Christmas time. While not wishing to delay the House it may be only fair to reflect on a number of improvements that have been made in this area during the year.  There were the large percentage increases and the various amendments in social welfare payments by way of the budget and now there is to be this double week's payment.</P>
      <P>This extra payment is to be made on foot of the production of the relevant document and I cannot foresee circumstances in which there will be any delay in payment.  On the last occasion any delay that arose was minimal but I understand that steps are being taken to ensure that there will be no delay on this occasion. Therefore, I do not think there are any grounds for the anxiety expressed by Deputy Boland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the list of social welfare recipients, both short-term and long-term, who come within the ambit of this Bill, one realises the considerable progress that has been made in the area of social welfare down through the years by successive Governments.  I note that there is to be consolidating legislation in respect of social welfare.  That will give us an opportunity of clarifying the whole situation in so far as this area is concerned. I know the Minister is deeply concerned and has at all times said that <Col N="585" /> his priority is for the less priviliged members of the community.  The Government have, since 1977, pledged to protect the needy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact that they pledged themselves to assist the needy is not getting away from the Bill, because that is what the Bill is trying to do. I congratulate the Minister on this legislation and perhaps in future the payment will be on an annual basis.  It is only fair to add that it was this Government, the first Government of the State to do so, which allowed matters, other than pay and conditions, to form part of the national understanding. The fact that we are discussing it today and that it has been praised on all sides is a tribute to the Government's approach to the national understanding.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill that has all-party agreement with the exception of one matter, the date, 12 December. Apart from that, there is all-party agreement. The Minister spoke about improvements which have been made, some of which could be even further extended.  The Minister deals here with the position in regard to the free fuel scheme.  Would the Minister say if there will be any extensions made in this matter under the Bill?  From my reading the Minister does not intend increasing the number of people to which free fuel will be given.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this.  It is important that this should be included in the Bill.  While the Minister has increased the money value in regard to the free fuel scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is a humane gesture by the Government.  Fianna Faéil will be regarded as the real socialist party of Ireland because we have always been anxious to bring in innovations to help the elderly, the disabled and the widows.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland raised some points and I shall reply to them.  He said he would like to see this as a permanent feature rather than a single measure.  This Bill, however, is to be considered in relation to this year and has been put to the House in that context.  It was part of the debates <Col N="590" /> which took place on the second national understanding and follows the very substantial increase of 25 per cent given earlier this year to long-term beneficiaries. It will, in that sense, top up this year the benefits which are already being provided.</P>
    <P>The Deputy brought up the question of the health allowance.  These will be provided by regulation and there will also be an opportunity to discuss these matters, as the Deputy suggested, when the Supplementary Estimate for that Department comes before the House.  With regard to the comment he made about the newspaper statement that I had suggested that this was the first time there was an autumn allowance or half-yearly review, I am sure the Deputy appreciated that that is not true.  It is certainly the first time that such an arrangement as this double week prior to Christmas was agreed in a national understanding and it is only in that context that I stated that this is the first time this has happened.  I would not like to convey anything other than that to the House or outside it.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that I have laid the case very fairly and clearly before the House without trying to have any form of undue upmanship involved in it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by the Deputy about the delivery of new books and of the recent difficulties which arose in relation to extra books, I would like to say a few words about that.  There is and there will continue to be a difficulty in relation to the Department of Social Welfare, no matter who is the incumbent at the time.  If, for example, as occurred earlier this year, the budget date is later than normal, this creates special problems for the Department of Social Welfare in issuing a very large number of books with a very large number of different denominations.  It is not possible in that regard to say that there will not be difficulties in future.  If we had approached this measure by attempting to issue additional vouchers of any kind, we would, because of the protracted time involved in the national understanding debates and the time scale left to us to implement the measure, have had difficulties because of the necessary printing <Col N="591" /> of the voucher books in all the various denominations.  It was for this reason that another approach was introduced this time, that is, to pay double on the face value of the particular book for the appropriate date.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for co-operating in this regard because it involves the staff in that Department in the task of paying double on the particular day on the face value of the pension books.  We felt this was the most efficient way we could approach the matter.  Deputy Boland suggested that it might be done that way. That was what was intended to be conveyed in my opening remarks when I said:</P>
    <P>The additional sum to be paid will be equal to the face value of the weekly pension or allowance order and will include all increases in respect of adult and child dependants and any supplements which form part of the regular weekly payment. </P>
    <P>It is in that sense a very efficient administrative method.  I am very grateful to the staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for assisting us in implementing that measure.</P>

      <P>If the Members of the House suggested it three years ago, I am also greatful to them.  I would also like to point out in relation to the system which is operating in respect of this particular payment that if the pensioners, the widows and other beneficiaries call for the benefits on the dates specified, they will certainly be paid on those dates.  I know that in some cases other people collect on their behalf and that will also be covered. We hope there will not be too many people who will not call on the particular date because that could cause difficulties for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but if there are some they will have to be paid later.  The mechanism in this particular case should meet the <Col N="592" /> requirements put forward by the Deputies. We are advertising widely to make sure that people understand the nature of the payments and the dates on which they will be made.  The date chosen is one to provide the moneys in advance of Christmas, which Deputy Boland was anxious to see happening.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell welcomed the Bill. He considered that each national understanding should also cover social welfare and he welcomed this aspect of the present national understanding.  He would like to see this happening each year. However, he was concerned about what he described as many people who would not get the benefit.  No matter what date one chooses the people who come after that date will not be included.  The measure before the House is specifically in line with paragraph 28 of the national understanding which stated that, as a specific measure, the Government would provide double payment for one week in December 1980 to long-term social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>Certainly, I will consider the matter raised by the Deputy but he must appreciate that considerable administrative difficulties are encountered when one departs from a specific date.  I suppose it would be fair to say that the people who have been on benefit for some time should be the principal people to benefit. In fact, all people currently covered will benefit.  I do not see it as a good enough reason to delay this Bill for any time because we must proceed with it urgently to ensure that the necessary administrative measures are taken and completed before the date of implementation.  In respect of some monthly payments the date of implementation will be towards the end of November.  These payments are broken into a number of different cycles and they will commence as early as the end of November.  Consequently, we will have to proceed with the measure. However, I will look at the point the Deputy raised to see if measures might be taken to alleviate the position in relation to people who come into the category subsequently during December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore and Deputy B. Ahern also welcomed the Bill.  They would like <Col N="593" /> to see this measure introduced in future years.  Deputy Moore was particularly glad to see that the social welfare beneficiaries are being looked after at this time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright raised the question of the free fuel scheme and asked if any extension of the scheme was being included.  I wish people would come down to reality in this House as well as elsewhere in the country and recognise that this year I have included an additional 26,000 people in the free fuel scheme.  It is now a national scheme.  We have increased payment on the voucher scheme by 33½ per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The combination of the two schemes will mean that the position of these people will improve considerably this year.  Deputy Leyden welcomed the commitment of the Government.

      <P>Deputy O'Connell raised a point that I did not follow completely. He contended that certain long-term social welfare beneficiaries might not receive a double weeks' payment during December because of the nomination of the 11th or 12th as the appropriate date. I gathered from his remarks he was afraid that, if a person was not a long-term social welfare recipient on that date but qualified as a long-term recipient afterwards, he would not get the double weeks' payment.  I do not know any more about this matter other than what I heard here but I gather that was the gist of his remarks.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the points raised by Deputy Leyden.  I tried to clarify the position in my speech.  The disabled person's maintenance allowance will be covered by the Department of Health and the Deputy will note this in my speech.  Also in the category are the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, the allowance in respect of the blind and the allowance in respect of domiciliary care for handicapped children, all of which are administered by the Department of Health.  I put in this information to make clear to Deputies that these will be covered by separate regulation or order.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland raised a question regarding 11 and 12 December.  There is the likelihood that some people may become eligible for long-term benefits after that date and these people would not be included in the present Bill.  Deputy O'Connell asked if the Bill might be postponed so that this matter could be considered and I suggested in my reply to him that this would not be in the interest of people who are beneficiaries under the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome many of the provisions in this Bill but I wish to raise a matter which should be considered by all those involved.  I believe that the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland should study the amalgamation of the two professions. We have followed the English judicial system to a large extent and the system has worked quite well.  It is also true to say that there would be some difficulties in the event of amalgamation of the two professions.  Senior and junior counsel have been regarded as specialists in particular fields.  In litigation particularly there have been very eminent senior and junior counsel who specialised in probates, conveyancing and other judicial matters.  In many ways the system has been satisfactory.  The vast majority of senior and junior counsel reside in the vicinity of Dublin, while some live in the Cork area and there are various others around the country.</P>
      <P>In the event of amalgamation the manpower involved in some cases would be less.  At present there are a firm of instructing solicitors, a junior counsel and usually two senior counsel on the side of the plaintiff and there are a similar number on the side of the defendant. Amalgamation of the two professions would mean the involvement of fewer people on each side and this would definitely lead to a reduction in the cost of a case.  It would also help to streamline the two professions.</P>
      <P>The idea of amalgamation has been tossed around on occasion but I am not aware that it has ever been studied jointly by the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council.  Such a study could result in the publication of a report to be considered by all sides of the legal profession detailing the advantages and disadvantages of amalgamation and whether it would improve the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill is passed it will bring the law somewhat closer to the people and make it more relevant to their needs. The extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court and Circuit Court will mean a very sizable reduction in the <Col N="597" /> number of cases coming before the High Court.  I hope that as a result of that many more of these cases may be heard outside Dublin than are at present.  The list in Galway, Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny and so on is very extensive.  A reduction in the number of cases in these venues will mean that there will be less people going to the high Court.  Following upon this the High Court could be of assistance to the Incorporated Law Society and to the Bar Council in studying this matter.  That is something that should be looked into at present.  I am not advocating coercion or that some Minister or somebody in the Department of Justice should try to arrange a shot-gun wedding or something of that nature.  But I am advocating that the matter be looked into because it could be of benefit to everybody involved in law.</P>
    <P>Part of my reason for welcoming this matter before the House this afternoon &mdash;and I touched on this the last day&mdash; is that from the date that a High Court case is set down to the date of the actual hearing there can be a delay of from 15 months to a year and a half.  That is a long time.  But prior to the setting down of the case there can be a delay of perhaps three years in the preparation of the case so that from the date of the commencement of the action, that is from the date a person suffers some wrong from which he wants redress, to the date of hearing, the delays can at times be four, four and a half, or five years and this is a very long time for somebody to have to wait to have a case heard.</P>
    <P>This 12 to 18 months period of waiting is impossible to explain to people; they cannot understand why the court system could have a backlog of something approaching a year-and-a-half from the date the case is set down.  A person calls to his solicitor and is told that his case which has taken three years to prepare will take a further 18 months, half the time again.  In the vast majority of cases the people involved are in poor circumstances following injury to the breadwinner of the family or perhaps even his death.  These people have to wait a further year-and-a-half.  This is not good enough.  I am hopeful that this is going to <Col N="598" /> get rid of that backlog with great speed because it is urgent that that appalling backlog is got rid of immediately.  The only people benefiting from that backlog at present are the big insurance companies who can sit back and wait a year-and-a-half for a case to come up.  It can happen that people who are not physically able are forced back to work to try to bring in some money to their homes; perhaps even a person who received very serious injuries has died in the meantime. The insurance companies can sit back and let all that time elapse.  A delay of that nature is something approaching a social scandal.</P>
    <P>This Bill may help to remove that backlog. I hope it will because I have the greatest sympathy for people who suffer injuries and have to wait all those years to have their case decided.  In some cases a very sizeable award is made in the High Court to an individual and the insurance company then lodge an appeal and the case goes to the Supreme Court.  The resulting delay can run into years again, all of this in many instances involving a litigant who is in very poor financial circumstances. All of this is of tremendous importance and I welcome these changes which I hope will remedy and alleviate a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council have drawn attention to one particular matter.  Indeed I welcome their comments in regard to the present appalling conditions of our courthouses around the country.  Our High Courts are satisfactory.  I am not aware of any Circuit Court that is in very bad condition.  Some of them leave something to be desired but overall they are properly heated; in most instances there is reasonable accommodation for consultations, reasonable waiting rooms, reasonable toilet facilities.  But our District Courts are an absolute disgrace.  Quite a sizeable number are in extremely bad condition.  They are held in old dance-halls, old schools, pool rooms, parts of publichouses, parts of GAA clubs or rugby clubs and so on.  When one sees films of courts being conducted behind the Iron Curtain one is shocked at the system those people are operating.  But if one were to visit some of the district <Col N="599" /> courthouses here or to see them on television one would be absolutely appalled at their disgraceful condition.</P>
    <P>I have been smoked out of courtrooms here where a fire would have been lit perhaps an hour beforehand by a member of the Garda Síochána or a caretaker and after a period the courtroom would be filled with smoke which, along with the cold and crowding made it appalling and totally unsatisfactory and much more relevant to the last century than to the present.  I would like to know if the Department of Justice have ever conducted any type of survey of our courtrooms. I doubt it, because if they had and realised the conditions under which justice is administered here they would have taken action long before now.  The Minister has promised to bring proposals before the Government in regard to this matter.  I welcome this promise but I am sorry that he was not more definite in what he said.</P>
    <P>We are now going to bring family law cases into the District Courts.  There will be children involved in these cases and perhaps mothers and fathers who are separated and there will be decisions made, when this Bill becomes law, in these places.  It concerns me greatly that such decisions will be made in the conditions under which our district justices are forced to labour at present.  I would urge that an immediate study be conducted by the Department of Justice, that they would consult the District Justices Association, District Court Clerks and the Garda Síochána, requesting them for a list of the courthouses they consider to be unsuitable for the hearing of many cases. At present many of our courts beg description.  Indeed, I would hope immediate steps would be taken so that difficult family law cases would not be heard in many of these courthouses.  We must remember the sad plight of many young boys and girls of an impressionable age having important decisions taken in regard to their family.  They may have been brought into court by their mother or father and be present when the justice asks some very relevant questions.  This is sad and tragic enough even when such <Col N="600" /> cases are heard in some kind of comfort and privacy, but when they are conducted in the circumstances I have described&mdash; and here I speak from personal experience in regard to these matters&mdash;then we place our judicial system under a strain.</P>
    <P>I go along with a lot of the provisions of this Bill.  At present district justices have a very large number of cases to hear. The extent of their work at present should be brought home to the Department of Justice.  For instance, I believe that over the last five years our Garda force has been increased by something like 3,000 members.  I am giving an approximate figure only.  Has there been any increase in the number of district justices in the past five years?  I honestly do not believe there has been.  It is obvious also that the vast majority of that increased number of gardaí are detecting breaches of the law and bringing such matters before the courts.  That entails a very sizable increase in the volume of work of our district justices in that section alone.  In my view that necessitates an increase in their numbers.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of judges in our District Courts, as in all our courts &mdash; here I am speaking of 99.9 per cent of the Judiciary &mdash; have been exemplary in their conduct at all levels.  It is approximately 12 years since I first qualified and never have I had even the slightest doubt that any justice, Circuit Court judge or High Court judge ever made other than the most honest, straightforward and, in his view, correct decision.  I say that without fear of contradiction.  Our Judiciary have been impeccable in regard to the honesty of their judgments and in their conduct.</P>
    <P>These matters are of immense importance in regard to the extension of the Guardianship of Infants Act and family law matters.  These are cases needing to be heard carefully and diligently without the justice feeling he is being crowded out by volume of work.  I believe this will necessitate an increase in the number of appointments at District Court and Circuit Court levels.  I believe that these family law and other related cases on account of the care and attention they warrant, will necessitate an increase in <Col N="601" /> the number of district justices in order that the justices will be able to give them their full and undivided attention without the feeling that there is a sizable backlog being built up.  The Minister should examine this position very carefully and ascertain whether or not he will take steps in that direction.  I make this case because of the sensitive nature of these cases, on account of the thought and care they warrant, and which I am confident will be exercised by the District Court Justices and Circuit Court judges.  Basically the question of barring orders, the extension of the Guardianship of Infants Act and so on, will be dealt with in the District Court but the Circuit Court may well be involved also.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House also to one very important matter. At present all family law, civil and criminal cases are heard on the same day.  I regard this as totally unsatisfactory.  I am speaking now of country areas and larger towns.  I understand it is somewhat different in cities where there has been a division of responsibilities and where certain justices are assigned especially to family law cases, particularly in Dublin. However, in rural areas at present the situation is that family law cases are heard <i>in camera</i> but at the very commencement of the day's list.  All of the people are summoned to attend on the morning of the court hearing at 11 a.m.  Let us take the case of a wife who has initiated some proceedings against her husband.  I have seen such a case come before a court in a crowded courtroom with perhaps 100 or 200 people present.  In the presence of everybody a District Court clerk calls on Mr. A, from one side and, from the other, Mrs. A, so that it becomes immediately evident to people from the surrounding area that there is some serious family problem involved between the two of them.  Therefore what that couple may have succeeded in keeping an internal family problem is fairly well advertised in those circumstances when it becomes evident that they are experiencing some kind of marital difficulty.  Mr. and Mrs. A appear from two different parts of the building and they go in and are inside for about 15 minutes.  The next case of Mr. <Col N="602" /> and Mrs. B is called and they go to have their case heard.  Everybody present in the courthouse is aware of the marital difficulties these couples are experiencing.</P>
    <P>I see no problem of any magnitude in providing that family law cases would be heard on a special afternoon or day.  This is of great importance to people who wish to have family law matters heard in court. I urge the Minister to ensure that any such matters would be heard on a specified day and that nothing else but family law cases be heard in that particular courtroom during that particular sitting. I want the Minister to set aside a specific period or sitting for the hearing of family law cases.  If he fails to do that I intend to continue raising this matter in the House until I get an absolute guarantee from him that he will accede to this &mdash; not request because I specify that it is a demand.  The existing situation is totally wrong and I am highly critical of it.  If, through lack of finance, facilities or a shortage of judges the Minister deems it necessary to have civil and criminal law cases heard &mdash; I am speaking of contract and tort matters &mdash; at the one sitting along with criminal cases, while I would not be in favour of it I do not think it is of quite the same importance as having family law cases heard on their own on a specific day.  That is important and would be welcomed.  It would meet with the approval of the vast majority of people I have met who have been involved in family law cases.</P>
    <P>There are two matters about which I am very pleased.  I see that there will be an increase regarding judgment debt. That is welcome.  As regards amendment of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, section 28, the £1,000 has been there since 1961. That amount is paid for mental distress suffered by people following the death of some member of the family.  While that amount may have been relevant at the time of the passing of the Act it needs drastic amending.  I note that the Minister has put in £5,000.  While that is a five-fold increase in the 19-year period, and is welcome, I think that on the death of a member of a family I would personally <Col N="603" /> recommend £10,000.  I ask the Minister to consider changing the amount from £1,000 to £10,000.  Such an increase would be of much benefit.  It only arises in connection with the mental distress and suffering of a family following the death of a member.  As the Minister knows, money is no great compensation for the death of a loved member of a family but over a period it may alleviate some of the sadness and hardship that follows.  I very much favour an increase in the amount to £10,000.</P>
    <P>I see that judgments under £150 do not carry interest.  This is debatable if money is left outstanding for a long period.  Even if it is a small amount.  I suggest that, while £150 is not a fortune, it may be a lot to some people particularly if they are short of money.  While a decree is a great encouragement to get people to pay up. I think that if they had the added fear that interest would be charged on the amount in addition to the decree there would be a greater incentive to speed up payment.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter of allowing such payments to carry interest.  It would be no great burden on anybody to have interest charged on such amounts.  It would not cause any great problems to the District Court staff if these judgments carried interest.</P>
    <P>In general, with the reservations I have mentioned.  I think the Bill includes many benefits and improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Enright said.  As regards his point about the £1,000 for mental distress under the Civil Liability Act.  I understand that that amount was to be given a year's trial when introduced.  Nineteen years later it is still on trial.  Disagreeing in one instance with Deputy Enright.  I think that the Minister in his wisdom in providing a figure of £5,000 is naming a proper figure.  On an actuarial assessment £5,000 now compared with £1,000 19 years ago is about correct.  I am not very good at mathematical computations but I spoke to an actuary about this and he said the Minister's figure was about right. However, in support of what Deputy Enright said, we should not have to wait <Col N="604" /> another 19 years to increase the figure from £5,000 to £10,000.  If it is possible, I respectfully suggest that the best way to deal with this matter is to give the Minister some power to increase the figure by regulation, say on a five yearly basis, rather than have to come back to the House to do it by way of legislation.  That would be unnecessary and wasteful of the time of the House.</P>
      <P>In respect of increasing the jurisdiction of the District Courts and the Circuit Courts, in the case of the District Court to £2,500 and in the case of the Circuit Court in regard to contract, tort and other items to £15,000, that is another matter that might also be considered from the point of view of giving these increases in jurisdiction by way of regulation. Again, it is a matter that I have not discussed or considered in depth, but it is a proposal made having regard to the length of time since the last increases were made and the increases now proposed in this Bill.  The last increases, of course, in the Circuit and District Courts were in 1971, so we are discussing these increases in the context of a nine year lag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item which has emerged during the course of this debate is the feeling in the public mind that justice is diluted when administered in the District Court. Our District Courts have been established for many years now and, like Deputy Enright, the Minister and others.  I believe they have served the country well as courts of first instance, whose powers are very far reaching and wide.  All offences, with certain exceptions because of their gravity &mdash; murder, attempted murder, robbery and so on &mdash; can be dealt with by the District Court on a plea of guilty.  The criticism levelled at the court is somewhat unfair.  I was rather surprised to hear the Fine Gael spokesman on law reform make very sweeping charges against either the District Court bench as a whole, or certain members of that bench.  To quote accurately, he said that some of them should not be there.  Deputy Keating holds himself out to be a responsible Member of this House and a responsible public representative.  He makes these charges against people who, <Col N="605" /> in the context of their position, are not able to defend themselves.  If a judge or justice behaves improperly, there is the constitutional remedy for his removal.  If Deputy Keating, as would appear, has information about some district justice, he has an obligation to operate that remedy. In the meantime, he has, firstly, damaged in the public mind the concept of a fair hearing at District Court level. Secondly, his remarks, as they stand, bring district justices collectively into disrepute, since we do not know to whom he refers.  Thirdly, although he is entitled to express constructive criticism, he is entering into a dangerous area in the democratic system.</P>
    <P>The separation of powers&mdash;executive, legislative and judicial&mdash;is well established. To generalise as between these different levels is wrong and dangerous. Deputy Keating has an obligation to establish in the public mind against whom he is making these charges.  Finally, and least important, in comparative political terms the Deputy might end up indicting one of his own Government's appointments. We do not know about whom he is speaking but we do know that he has accused others of being unfair and unjust and he is doing those very things himself. I am not certain if he was referring to members of the Circuit Court bench, but he accused certain members of the District Court bench in a very unfair and unjust manner.  To bring about a balance of fair play he has an obligation to tell us about whom he is speaking and not only that, but in what context he is accusing these people.</P>
    <P>This is not necessarily a contentious Bill but I was concerned when I read the report in the public media.  I had not an opportunity of studying the Deputy's remarks in the Official Report and if I have done him an injustice I shall return to the House and apologise to him, but I do not think that I have.  In the meantime, he should put the record right. I heard a number of comments, not in the Daéil but outside it, in relation to his remarks. The type of comment one heard was, &ldquo;Who is he speaking about?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What cases was he referring to?&rdquo; I certainly did not know about whom he was <Col N="606" /> speaking and certainly could not refer these people to the cases.  It is very difficult to defend that very damaging generalisation. We as politicians have been accused in the same way and when the accuser is challenged he may say &ldquo;Oh, I heard it from somebody else.&rdquo;  or at third or fourth hand.  There is a cloud hanging over the District Court bench throughout the nation and the Deputy has an obligation to dispel that cloud.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that this is an excellent Bill, doing much of what has been called for over the last number of years.  I query the whole system of adjudication of family law as presently known.  For example, the Family Home Protection Act and the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act of 1976, effectively deal with relatively new concepts of family law in this country.  One wonders, concomitant with this legislation, should one have set up a different type of judicial system in the sense that at the moment it operates under the adversary system which, as Deputy Enright properly points out gives rise to all sorts of problems and difficulties. Perhaps we should use an investigative system.  I do not think that the adversary system is the proper one for dealing with family law problems.  A more informal system under the investigative method is, in the main, a proper way to deal with family law problems when they can be dealt with in that fashion. As Deputy Enright points out, using the adversary system we have two individuals on either side of the court and lined up confronting them, is a number of barristers and solicitors and the judge is there to adjudicate on an almost unsolvable problem in the context of, not so much the law, but the emotion which the particular difficulty has generated between the two individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>In the investigative system, there would be an informal hearing in the privacy of some room and I would see a District Court or Circuit Court judge being assisted by an assessor or assessors. An assessor would be qualified in the discipline of psychiatry, psychology, sociology and so forth and be completely competent in relation to the problems <Col N="607" /> confronting the court at that time.  There would be a full investigation.  The matter at present is dealt with in a mandatory way as, unfortunately, it has to be because of the growing number of problems here in this regard.  These are matters for the future.  There are no instant solutions for these problems.  This idea is not new, but it should be looked at.  Perhaps the law, in the context of family law, may evolve in that way.  The greatest sufferers under the adversory system are the antagonists.  The people who are looking for solutions are left with more problems than they had envisaged.</P>
    <P>Another question for consideration is that of court accommodation.  It has been properly pointed out that, particularly in relation to the District Courts in rural Ireland&mdash;this was referred to by Deputy Enright, a practitioner in rural Ireland who knows more about this situation than I&mdash;court accommodation leaves a lot to be desired.  Speaking from my own limited experience in the District Court in relation to family law cases, I can say that the accommodation is primitive.  It is not possible to conduct a proper consultation with a client.  Generally speaking that consultation must take place outside the court room because of lack of facilities. The present system provides a vehicle of gossip for the prurient.  As Deputy Enright pointed out, people do not want to make their problems, particularly those related to family law, public.  If a husband and wife are in disagreement it becomes obvious to those around what is going on.  The prurient are always around in Irish society.</P>
    <P>In today's edition of <i>The Irish Press</i> Enda Wymes made a point in relation to a more informal court system, something which supports my point of view.  Mr. Wymes stated:</P>
    <P>In relation to small claims it is worth recalling that in November 1979 the then Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy told the Daéil that the possibility of setting up a system of small claim courts was then under discussion.  The provision of such courts would be a <Col N="608" /> major advance and would make the law available to everybody for matters on which they might not wish to become involved in the expense and intricácies of the established courts. </P>
    <P>I am glad that the examination in relation to that principle is continuing.  I hope that the Minister will be in a position to introduce legislation in relation to that in the near future.  The inauguration of the civil legal aid scheme was referred to in the course of the debate.  It is a good scheme and is working well.  I would like to see more centres opened but we must bear in mind the availability of cash.  There are other outlets in the social system of equal priority.  The system should be given a chance to operate.</P>
    <P>There has been a general welcome for the main provisions of the Bill.  The Minister may well have to examine the possibility of increasing the number of District Justices and Circuit Court judges. The existing Circuit Court areas are large and, with the increased burden provided for in the Bill on Circuit Court judges, it is possible that those areas will have to be reduced.  That will mean an increase in the number of Circuit Court areas and judges.  One of the reasons the Bill can be classed as good is that it has been welcomed by the various legal groups. There has been a certain amount of criticism of it but a Bill that is not criticised in a constructive way is hardly an effective one.  A number of eminent legal bodies voiced criticism of the Bill and that criticism should be accepted in the spirit intended.  For many years those groups did not take the opportunity to express their views on legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention at this stage to concern myself with the question of the amalgamation of the professions.  That is a matter for future discussion.  However, Mr. Wymes stated:</P>
    <P>I would rather say let us move towards change and perhaps begin by getting rid of the wigs and black gowns introduced to mourn good Queen Anne who died in 1714.  It is necessary to change. </P>
    <P>It is necessary to change, but not to <Col N="609" /> change immediately.  More damage could be done by changing immediately and without thought than by evolutionary change.  The system we have operated in recent years is a good one and has not often been found wanting.  Where it was found wanting the law was amended.  It will have to be amended in relation to bail, particularly arising out of the O'Callaghan decision of the Supreme Court.  That matter will also have to be dealt with in the near future and that is all part of the evolution having regard to social change, social attitudes and social conditions.  When one is talking about amending the law one should talk cautiously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This Bill seeks to increase substantially the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court.  The changes will come into operation six months after this Bill is passed.  By and large the Bill follows the recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  Like the Minister and other speakers, I would like to thank the learned gentlemen who served on that committee for their contribution and their time.  In a very real way this Bill affects rural Ireland.  It affects the District Court, which operates in the remotest parts of the country, and the Circuit Court, which is largely a rural court although, of course, it operates in Dublin as well.  I am casting no reflection on the members of the committee on Court Practice and Procedure because I recognise them as first-class practitioners and busy men who gave their time to the committee, but the committee would have been stronger and more effective if there had been a rural practitioner on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a remarkable fact that there was no rural practitioner on the committee which reported to the Minister.  It may be said that the learned gentlemen of the Bar practise in rural Ireland, and that is true.  Most of the barristers on the committee practise in the city of Dublin and have a far greater experience of Dublin city courts than of rural Ireland courts. There may be people with other legal qualifications on the committee, but I <Col N="610" /> know there were two practising solicitors on it.  Both of them practise in the city of Dublin and, so far as I know, have practised there during all of their professional lives.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not complaining about or criticising the two Dublin solicitors who were on the committee, but it would have been better if, in addition to them, there had been a couple of country solicitors, as they are called, who would know the difficulties experienced by country practitioners and the difficulties presented to country litigants.  That is all I want to say about that.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not interfere directly with the right to trial by jury in civil matters. I want to put it on record that I have no vested interest in the profession at the moment.  I have ceased to practise but I think it is generally known that I have quite a wide experience as a practitioner in the country courts.  I should not like to see trial by jury in civil cases abolished or limited in any way, and certainly not until a free legal aid system has been perfected and made available on a general and liberal basis.  The right to trial by jury stands between the big insurance company and the poor litigant.  It stands between the monied man and the man with little or no money who wants to have his case litigated in court.  About that I have no doubt.</P>
    <P>Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill deal with the extension of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the conferring on that court of jurisdiction in divorce cases <i>a mensa et thoro.</i> The Minister increased the jurisdiction of the District Court from £2,000 to £15,000 and, in doing so, he did not follow the recommendation of the committee, which recommended an increase to £10,000. The Minister proposes to increase it to £15,000 because he has increased the damages which may be awarded for mental distress from £1,000 to £5,000.  These damages for mental distress are awarded in fatal cases only.</P>
    <P>I would think that, even with a jurisdiction of £15,000, the fatal accident cases, or the Lord Campbell Act cases as they are called, or used to be called, which would be brought in the Circuit <Col N="611" /> Court would be few and far between because, if there was any substantial pecuniary loss to a widower or infants, when that pecuniary claim was added to the mental distress, it would obviously put the claim over the proposed jurisdiction or the present jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Speaking from experience, I have some reservations about the jurisdiction of £15,000 in the Circuit Court in what are commonly called running down actions.  If the person risks bringing the case in the High Court and does not get more than £7,500, he is confined to the Circuit Court costs and, even if his award is over £7,500, he must get a certificate from the trial judge before he can get other than Circuit Court damages.</P>
    <P>One reservation I have is that £15,000 for personal injuries can involve pretty substantial injuries and can involve professional witnesses of a very high calbre: consultants in the medical field and perhaps in the engineering field in the case of injuries sustained at work.  I fear will be more difficult for the plaintiff who has no money, and who will be operating if at all as of now under a very limited free legal aid scheme, to get these professional witnesses from Dublin to rural Ireland &mdash; to Cork, even to Cavan Donegal.  It will be much more difficult him to get those witnesses down to those places than for him to get a county surgeon up to Dublin.  For a start, legal practioners in the country will be dealing with professional witnesses in Dublin whom they know very casually and perhaps have only met in the course of the case.  These witnesses will be asked to travel from Dublin with maybe an over-night stay and the case may not be reached and they will have to come back again.  If a person has been referred to a Dublin hospital by his general practitioner or to a Dublin specialist, the legal prctitioner will have to ensure that the witness will be available 100 or 150 miles away from Dublin.  I do not blame the specialists or consultants whose essential commitment is to attend sick people.</P>
    <P>People might say that it is just as difficult get a county surgeon or a county <Col N="612" /> physician to Dublin but it is not, as I know from experience.  Very often the surgeon and the solicitor are on friendly terms and they do a lot of business together.  I used to have an arrangement whereby I could ring up at ten o'clock in the morning and tell the county surgeon that the case was now on and we could arrange to have him there by two o'clock and into the witness box.  The surgeon would be back home before the case was over and that was that.  The same argument can be made for the consultant in the engineering faculty.  It will be difficult to get these witnesses from the city to the country.</P>
    <P>Plaintiffs in claims of up to £15,000 are virtually being deprived of the right to trial by jury.  The Bill does not directly deprive plaintiffs of a trial by jury but plaintiffs in running down actions of any sort, up to £15,000, are being deprived of this right because the appeal from the Circuit Court is to a judge without a jury. For that reason juries are practically not used in the Circuit Court in civil actions. If they are, a subsequent appeal will be made before a judge without a jury.  This will encourage insurance companies, for example, to fight a case that they might otherwise settle.  Very often more justice is done by settling a case as in some instances one cannot be certain who is to blame.  We all know that some judges are known as plaintiffs' judges and others are known as defence judges.  Insurance companies know that as well as everyone else and if there is no jury and they know they are coming before a defence judge they will be more likely to fight than if there were a jury.</P>
    <P>I have doubts about the wisdom of conferring jurisdiction on the Circuit Court in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> cases. Up to now only the High Court enjoyed jurisdiction in that type of action.  I know that in the High Court judges referred issues arising from this type of action to a jury for trial.  The judge had the right to refer issues in divorce actions to a jury. That right will now be taken away from the parties in such an action because there are virtually no juries in civil actions in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>So far as the Circuit Court is concerned <Col N="613" /> the recommendation of the Committee to increase the jurisdiction to £10,000 was the right recommendation.  That recommendation for Circuit Court actions is high enough and it will exclude more of the types of action in which the Dublin consultants is required as a witness. The jurisdiction in the divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> should not have been conferred on the Circuit Court. If I am right in my reading of section 5 it proposes to confer exclusively on the Circuit Court jurisdiction in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i> I know that the High Court has an overriding and overall jurisdiction but the effect of the section is to give exclusive jurisdiction as far as possible to the Circuit Court in divorce cases.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 to 15 increase very substantially the jurisdiction of the District Court from £250 to £2,500.  There is a lot to be said for that.  It always amuses me to hear people talking about upping the jurisdiction of the District Court and in the same breath talking about establishing a small claims court.  I regarded the District Court as a small claims court and it was that when I started practising, when the tort was £10 and contract was £25.  There seems to be a demand for a small claims court and the District Court as established by the founding fathers of the State was certainly a small claims court and performed well as that.  The increase from £250 to £2,500 in contracts in tort, the granting of jurisdiction in various other areas such as the Act dealing with hotel proprietors and family law will increase its jurisdiction enormously.  I have reservations about family law.  It is going too far to give jurisdiction under the guardianship of Infants Act and family law in general to the casual discharge in an informal way of the District Court. There should be proper free legal aid and family law matters should be dealt with in the Circuit Court where there are more facilities and time to deal with them.</P>
    <P>As well as the jurisdiction being conferred on it by sections 6 to 15 there is another Bill before the House, the Malicious Injuries Bill, which also confers jurisdiction up to £2,500.  The Bill provides for its coming into operation after it becomes law.  In one way I welcome <Col N="614" /> that, because sometimes we pass Bills and they do not come into operation until the relevant Minister decides perhaps six months or a year later.  However, I have reservations about this now because new jurisdiction will be conferred on the District Court without any preparation.  As far as I know the Minister had consultations with virtually nobody about this Bill.  He had no consultations with the Incorporated Law Society, whose members will be the advocates and practitioners dealing with the Bill in the District Court.  I would not be surprised if the Minister has to bring in a short Bill postponing the conferring of jurisdiction on the District Court simply because he made no preparation for it.</P>
    <P>Many district justices have jurisdiction over two counties and a substantial proportion of other counties.  I do not know how they or the staff of District Court offices will be able to deal with the enormous increase in jurisdiction being conferred on them.  Further justices and additional staff will be necessary in these offices.  I should like the Minister to tell us what arrangements he has made for that increase in work and what consultations he has had with solicitors and the Incorporated Law Society, who are generally in favour of an increase in jurisdiction. If there is to be an increase it should be an orderly one.  My information is that there has been minimal, if any, consultation with the people on the ground. That is unfortunate because the Bill cannot work unless the people concerned can reasonably operate it.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion here about the Judiciary.  In my experience I have found the Judiciary to be a body of men of the highest intelligence who carry out their functions to the best of their ability and with the strictest impartiality. Nobody has said otherwise.  However, that is not to say I would not prefer to be tried by one judge rather than another. I am not talking about District Court justices, but about men in the High Court.  Certain judges are appointed to certain duties and it sometimes appears after their appointment that they are not suited temperamentally for the duties entrusted upon them.  There is a jurisdiction <Col N="615" />&mdash; it does not rest with the Minister &mdash; to change these judges from one court to another.  In my long experience, either from looking in from the outside or practicing, I have never known any judge to be taken from one court and put into another unless at his own request.  That is a pity.  A person can be temperamentally unsuited for the duties entrusted to him but he may be an excellent judge in another court.</P>
    <P>I have known senior and experienced members of the legal profession to be afraid to go into the court of Mr. Justice So-and So.  That is not good for the administration of justice.  I have known it to be impossible to get even a very senior member of the Bar to go in to make a certain type of application to Mr. Justice So-and-So, which is unfortunate because sometimes it might have been very much in the interest of justice that such an application be made and granted, notwithstanding the fact that the cause for such an application might have been because some solicitor forgot to make a phone call, get a witness in court, or overlooked something else.  Notwithstanding that, the long-term benefit to the client and the public might be that such an application should be made and should be granted.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise with all the sincerity I can command that as long as I can remember this country has been blessed with the integrity, absolute honesty and professional standing of the members of the Judiciary; but everybody is as God made him and it does happen that personalities seem to change sometimes. Personality seems to change once a person comes through a different door into the court and gets into the bench.  It happens, and there is no use in saying it does not.  In those cases perhaps the people with jurisdiction should talk to people like that.  Perhaps they do not realise it. I do not think that Deputy Keating was saying that anybody on the bench in this country since the foundation of the State was lacking in integrity, honesty or professional responsibility.  I do not think <Col N="616" /> that anybody in these benches was saying that &mdash; and I am not saying it &mdash; but I am saying, with special reference to changing judges about, that perhaps it would not do a bit of harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It has been suggested by Deputy Andrews that things like the fixing of the amount which might be awarded for mental distress and jurisdictions in general should be left to the Minister of the day to fix by regulation.  I would be against that completely.  We are dealing now with the jurisdiction of the court and the venue in which cases might be heard.  A matter of such importance as this warrants debate and discussion in the House.  It affords us the opportunity of discussing such matters as we are discussing now, bringing out into the open matters that might need to be brought out into the open by way of public debate.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I urge that the Minister do not take any further rights under this Bill to fix jurisdiction by ministerial order. The only thing that might decide one to say that sometimes it should be done by ministerial order is the length of time it has taken to increase the interest rate on court mortgages from 4 per cent.  We have been asking about this since I was in Government &mdash; indeed, I was part of a Government who should have done it&mdash;but it seems to be impossible to get something done that one would think should be done by a Bill that would not take longer than half an hour in the House.  It is postponed until another Bill is being brought in, and injustice is done. I think I am right in saying that the Minister is now taking power here to alter this rate by ministerial order.  I think that is in the Bill and I do not begrudge him that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all I want to say on the Bill at this stage.  There may be other things that I will say on Committee Stage.  The Minister and the House will note that I have sounded a warning rather than objected strenuously to certain things in the Bill. I think certain things in the Bill are dangerous and that they are not in the interest of the poor litigant, the man with no <Col N="617" /> money, and if what I say is right that would be deplorable in the extreme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick and other Deputies from all parties for their contribution to the debate and their comments on the Bill.  I am indeed glad that Deputies on all sides of the House appreciate the importance of the Bill and welcome it in general terms even if there may be differences on some points of detail.</P>
      <P>Many points have been raised in debate on the contents of the Bill and I suppose it is fair to say, on what is not in the Bill and I will endeavour to deal with the more important general points here. I hope that Deputies will not take it amiss if I do not deal at this stage with the more detailed points which may be more appropriately discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the opening contribution by the spokesman for the main Opposition party on the Bill, Deputy Keating, he spoke at great length about the deficiencies which he alleged existed among the members of the Judiciary, mainly, as far as I could deduce from the context, among district justices.  At various points in his speech he said that he was referring to only a few or a very few, yet in other places his language gave the impression that he did not really mean that and that the deficiencies, faults and even malpractices were, if not commonplace, certainly common enough.  He suggested that this House should, in some unspecified way, be able to exercise some kind of monitoring function over the performance of the Judiciary, and I think that that is what was implicit in his suggestions. He went on to urge that the news media should adopt a critical approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that the courts and the Judiciary are not exempt from public criticism.  However, I must say also that I think it is essential in the public interest that any criticism that may have to be made should take account of the special position of the courts in our society and should, therefore, be confined strictly to what the facts justify.  I regret to have to say that I believe that, despite his disclaimers and the fact that <Col N="618" /> he may not have intended this or intended it fully, what Deputy Keating said is open to be interpreted as almost a generalised attack and will, in fact, be so interpreted in some quarters.  I think that that impression will have been created in part by the very length of his comments on the subject.  Furthermore, I think that in the particular context of his speech, which referred to miscarriages of justice, his suggestion that the news media should adopt a more active and aggressive approach &mdash; I repeat, a more aggressive approach &mdash; was dangerous, indeed, very dangerous.  There is a very important role, certainly, for the news media to play in relation to reports on the administration of justice, but there is one thing that we do not want, and which I believe the community would rightly insist that we would not accept, and that is any form of trial by newspaper. I believe that the Deputy's remarks could be interpreted as encouraging some such trend.</P>
    <P>I accept that an independent Judiciary, free from any influence by the Executive or pressure from any source, is an essential part of a free parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill have come in for heavy criticism because of the lack of suitable courthouse accommodation for family law cases at many venues throughout the country, particularly at District Court level.  It has even been suggested that this Bill should not have been introduced because of this problem.  As I made clear in my opening speech, this criticism is unsound.  The correct approach is, of course, to clear up the difficulties in this area&mdash;and I propose to do this&mdash;but such practical considerations as these should not be allowed to stand in the way of legislating for what is right in principle.</P>
    <P>In other words, the real problem is that existing jurisdiction arrangements make it awkward for many people to obtain access to justice.  We must therefore change the law to make it easy to obtain legal redress.  If by doing this practical problems are highlighted, then by all means let us tackle them.  Let us not, however, put the cart before the horse, as has been suggested we should do, by <Col N="619" /> confining family law cases to the High Court merely because that court happens to have reasonable facilities for the hearing of such cases.  We should not be swayed from doing what is objectively right by the ill-founded arguments of vested interests.</P>
    <P>I accept that at many court venues the court accommodation is less than satisfactory but, as I indicated in my introductory speech, I have in preparation a set of proposals relating to court accommodation which I will be putting to the Government in the near future and which should pave the way for upgrading court accommodation to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>I accept also that many court venues lack facilities, such as separate waiting and consultation areas, considered desirable for dealing with family law business, but I am not satisfied that the volume of this business will ever be such as to justify the cost of providing these facilities at all court venues.  Indeed, a statistical analysis of the 1,744 family law cases in 1979 shows that in the 257 out of 259 venues outside the Dublin area for which figures are available, in 116 venues there was no such case heard; 34 had one case each; 85 had not one case on average per sitting, and another 12 had an average of fewer than two cases per sitting.  This leaves only ten venues throughout the country with two or more cases per sitting. One solution to this problem might be to direct all family law business to one or two venues in each district where the required facilities either exist already or can be provided without too much difficulty.</P>
    <P>I might add that in Tralee and Waterford, where new court accommodation is in course of construction, the necessary facilities are being provided.</P>
    <P>Allied to the physical accommodation question, of course, is the question of how best to organise the use of the accommodation available and of court time.  In anticipation of the enactment of the legislation now before the House my Department have been considering ways and means of improving the organisation of the District Court in order that it may <Col N="620" /> be in a position to cope with the increased jurisdiction which will be conferred on it. Already plans are well advanced for the enlargement of the Dublin Metropolital District Court district in order to provide for greater flexibility in the disposal of District Court business in Dublin city and county.  Plans are also well advanced for the reorganisation of a number of provincial District Court districts in order to relieve pressure on some justices.</P>
    <P>My Department will consult closely with the President of the District Court, the justices, the local legal profession and the Garda to see what further improvements can be made.  Deputy Enright's suggestion that different days be set aside in each District Court area for the hearing of the different categories of business coming before the court and his other suggestions for the more expeditious disposal of court business will be borne in mind when the administrative arrangements necessary to implement the new jurisdictions are being made.  The various interests concerned will, of course, be consulted.</P>
    <P>Provision has not been made in this Bill for additional judges of the Circuit Court or justices of the District Court to take account of any increased workload falling on these courts as a result of the jurisdiction proposals as it is difficult at this stage to forecast the extent of the increase.</P>
    <P>At the levels of litigation prevailing at present, the only certainty is that the workload of the District Court would increase, justifying the appointment of some additional justices and court staff, and that the work of the High Court will be reduced.  As far as the Circuit Court is concerned, however, and still assuming the present level of demand on court time, it appears that any new work falling on the court as a result of the increase in the contract and tort jurisdictions would, at the least, be offset by the District Court taking over the Circuit Court's existing caseload in its entirety.</P>
    <P>However, it must be emphasised that the direct result of the proposals must be to reduce the overall workloads of all the courts since they involve a transfer of cases from courts of considerable procedural <Col N="621" /> complexity to courts of comparatively simple procedures.  The real uncertainty in estimating future demand on court time arises from the successful outcome of the proposals in terms of access to justice &mdash; in other words, the greater ease with which legal action may be taken as a result both of the provisions of this Bill and of the civil legal aid scheme.  I am sure that many Deputies will be aware of instances where difficulties might have been resolved by recourse to the courts but for the inconvenience or costs of taking such action.  It is impossible to quantify the number of such cases which as a result of this Bill will now come before the courts.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant, therefore, to make provision for an increase in the number of the Judiciary until such time as the scale of the increase can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy.</P>
    <P>I propose to introduce an amendment at a later stage increasing from 11 to 12 the number of ordinary Circuit Court judges.  I would like to make it clear at this stage that the proposal is not related at all to the effects of this Bill on the workload of the Circuit Court.  It is related to an existing situation in that court which I will explain at the appropriate time on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies claimed that the lower courts, and particularly the District Court, are ill-suited for the new jurisdictions being conferred on them by section 12 of this Bill.  This section deals with jurisdiction under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  The existing position here is that the District Court already has jurisdiction to make barring orders under that Act for periods of three months and can order maintenance of up to £50 per week for a spouse and £15 per week for each child.  The provisions in this section were made following representations from various women's organisations and increase the maximum District Court barring order from three to 12 months as well as doubling the limits of maintenance awardable by that court.  These representations, seeking as they did to broaden the District Court's powers in these areas, can be taken as a vote of confidence <Col N="622" /> by women's groups in the suitability of the District Court as a forum for hearing cases of this nature.</P>
    <P>The more general question of the establishment of special family law courts and procedures, and the fundamental issue of the suitability of adversary-type tribunals for the hearing of such matters, were raised by a number of Deputies.  I have spoken at length in reply to parliamentary questions on this topic since coming into office, but I think it no harm to cover the ground again in the context of this Bill.  First of all, let me say that the Committee on Court Practice and Proccedure have under examination the question of establishing special family law tribunals and the Law Reform Commission are also considering the best type of structure appropriate to deal with these matters.  Secondly, the proposals in this Bill will go a long way towards making less formalised procedures available to many litigants in the family law area. Furthermore, there has been, and continues to be, substantial expansion in the welfare officer service attached to the courts.  I would also like to point, among other things, to the valuable back-up service available in family maintenance cases, where the District Court clerk can act as &ldquo;go-between&rdquo; for the payment of maintenance.</P>
    <P>Whatever the practical difficulties that have to be faced in relation to the proper hearing of family law cases in any court, I am absolutely clear that there is nothing inherently inappropriate in giving the District Court the widest possible jurisdiction. This matter was specifically covered by the courts committee in paragraph 17 of their 20th report which states:</P>
    <P>these (lower) courts are better geared to cope with the frequency with which several applications in the same case tend to recur because of changing circumstances.  There is also the considerable advantage of local venues and the additional advantage of appeals by way of complete rehearing to the appropriate appellate jurisdiction instead of the present costly and time-consuming system of appeal to the Supreme Court.  If any particular <Col N="623" /> point of law arises in respect of which the opinion of a higher court should be sought the existing statutory provisions with regard to the stating of a consultative case are available to the District Court, the Circuit Court, and the High Court hearing an appeal from the Circuit Court. </P>
    <P>In this regard also I would like to acknowledge that Deputies Enright, E. Desmond and Andrews welcomed the extension of family law jurisdition in the District Court.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies were worried in particular about the implications of conferring jurisdiction in the custody of children on courts which are constitutionally of limited jurisdiction; it was felt in particular that the jurisdiction which this Bill proposes to confer on the District Court might in some way be limited by the constitutional provision.  I would like to reassure Deputy Keating that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that no problem arises in relation to the constitutionality of this provision.  But even if that were not so, I think that I should &mdash; as perhaps the Deputy should &mdash; give some weight to the fact that the recommendation to give custody jurisdiction to the District Court has been made by a committee chaired by the senior ordinary member of the Supreme Court and the membership of which also included the Presidents of the District and Circuit Courts.</P>

      <P>There was a suggestion from all sides of the House that the monetary limits of the lower courts be linked to the consumer price index and that <Col N="624" /> changes should be effected by ministerial order rather than by an Act of the Oireachtas.  This suggestion was considered when the Bill was being prepared, but was considered inappropriate for two reasons, firstly, the inherent importance of the issue which, many would say, justifies the full attention of the Oireachtas itself acting through the legislative process, and secondly, the special constitutional position of the courts which arguably makes it inappropriate in principle that Parliament should seek to delegate to any other authority the right or power to determine the level of jurisdiction of particular courts.</P>

      <P>Something appears to be bugging the Deputy.  I am not aware of what it is, but if I could understand it I might be able to help him.  It has been suggested that a concentration of tort cases in the District Court and the Circuit Court might create difficulties in the provision of the necessary medical evidence because some medical consultants might be reluctant to travel to various venues around the country rather than to the High Court in Dublin.  The committee have said, and I am in agreement with them, that they are not satisfied that there is real substance in this objection because experience has shown that in many of the cases in the High Court the consultants come from outside Dublin.  In cases of road accidents patients are more frequently than not treated in local hospitals and are treated by local consultants save in cases which develop serious complications where it may be necessary, as for example in the case of severe brain injury, to send patients to specialist units in certain Dublin hospitals.  The committee and, while accepting the point that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended dealing with that point later.  In my opinion there was a fairly good spread on the committee and while accepting the point that none of the solicitors on the committee practised in rural parts of the country, there was a strong rural base.  The Deputy knows also that the Incorporated Law Society made a submission on behalf of many earthy rural solicitors who could not be on such a committee and I am sure that the point raised by the Deputy was adverted to in that submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> Turning to the position in the High Court, several Deputies spoke of the delays at present being experienced in waiting for a jury hearing.  The position in the matter is that at 31 July 1980, the end of the legal year, there were 2,434 jury actions and 248 non-jury actions awaiting hearing.  The average delay from the date of setting down to the date of hearing was, in the case of jury actions, 14 months, and in the case of non-jury actions five months.  I might mention in passing that at the end of December 1979, the delay in hearing jury action was 16½ months, so Deputies will realise that there has been some improvement. However, I am not at all pleased that the delays are as long as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to civil jury actions deteriorated in 1979 when because of the postal dispute it was not possible to serve jury summonses with the result that no such actions could be held from 9 March 1979 until the commencement of the Michaelmas Law Term on 1 October 1979.  This accounted for almost seven months of the time lag of 14 months already referred to.</P>
    <P>In addition there is an ever-increasing volume of business coming before the High Court.  During the legal year ended 31 July 1980 a total of 2,342 new jury cases were set down for hearing as opposed to 1,691 during the previous legal year and 1,861 during the legal year before that.</P>
    <P>Although additional High Court judges were appointed in October 1979 the effective strength of the High Court was increased by only one for most of the year because of the absence of Judge Costello on the Whiddy Island Disaster Inquiry.  In addition, Judge Butler died before the end of the Trinity Term and that vacancy was not filled until the end of the Long Vacation.  Nonetheless the court disposed of 1,879 jury cases during the year ended 31 July 1980.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill will have a major effect in alleviating this problem in two important ways: first, by increasing the monetary limits of the lower courts <Col N="627" /> many cases which at present can only be taken in the High Court will now come within the jurisdiction of the Circuit, and in some cases, the District Courts; secondly, by extending the registration and interest facilities currently available in the High Court to all courts, we will encourage litigants to make use of the lower courts where delays are minimal and the court venues themselves are more conveniently located throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another way of relieving pressure on the High Court would be to change the law which permits the transfer of criminal trials to the Central Criminal Court, which is of course the High Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction.  This is one of the courts committee's recommendations which are under active consideration by me and by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern has been expressed by several Deputies about the trial of civil actions by jury.  The present position is that only the High Court has power to try such actions by jury.  The right to jury trial in Circuit Court civil actions was abolished by the Courts Act, 1971, principally because it was a right that was seldom excercised.  It is worth noting that this same Act also increased the tort jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to its current limit of £2,000.  The new <Col N="628" /> level of £15,000 proposed in this Bill has been arrived at partly on the basis of the considerations set in the committee's report and partly to take account of the increased maximum amount which can be awarded in fatal accidents to the deceased's relatives.</P>
      <P>The situation at present is, as the courts committee brought out and as some Deputies have also mentioned, that legal proceedings arising out of many motor accidents may be taken in the High Court only.  This is because of the Circuit Court's present low monetary limit: these range from cases where the serious disablement, or death, of a person with dependants is involved to cases where the damage involved may only be the writing off of a car.  I am sure Deputies will agree with me that the more serious the accident and its repercussions on the victim and his dependants, the more important it is that it be heard in the High Court, where the option of a jury trial is available. On the other hand, in less serious cases where the injuries are not of a lasting nature, where medical and other expenses arising out of the accident are fairly clearly defined, and where the victim's earning capacity is only temporarily impaired, the amount of compensation being claimed is not likely to exceed the Circuit Court's new limit of jurisdiction. Quite often the only point at issue in such cases is whether one or other party to the action is liable.  Such cases can be as well decided by a judge sitting alone as by a jury, but at considerably less expense both to the litigants and to the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that what is proposed in the Bill is appropriate to the nature of the cases concerned.  I would not, in particular, see any merit in providing for the restoration of jury trials for some cases in the Circuit Court.  I am also aware that there is a strong body of demand for the total removal of the right to a jury for negligence cases in the High Court or, in the alternative, for the restriction of the role of the jury to the issue of negligence &mdash; in other words that juries should have no say in the determination of the amount of damages.  This, of course, is a far bigger issue than that raised by the Deputies who spoke on the Bill.  I do not propose <Col N="629" /> to go into the merits of that issue on this occasion.  Clearly it is outside the scope of the Bill at present before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright suggested that the amount awardable in fatal accident cases as compensation for mental distress be unlimited, and that it should be related to the economic circumstances of the relatives to whom it is awarded.  This may, I think, be based on a misunderstanding of the purpose of this provision and its context in the Civil Liability Acts.  The position is that the amount awarded by the judge under this heading is in his discretion, and purely as a gesture on account of the grief of the bereaved relatives; it is, however, in addition to medical, funeral or other expenses, and any damages for loss of earnings which may be appropriate.  Thus, while a judge might determine the same amount to be appropriate as compensation for mental distress in two different cases, the total of the amounts awarded under all heads might be very different, depending on whether the deceased was unmarried and with no dependants or whether he was, for instance, the father and sole means of support of a young family.  It seems to me that the solution adopted in the Bill &mdash; which follows the principle adopted in the 1961 Act, but up-dates the limit &mdash; is the appropriate one in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of &ldquo;small claims&rdquo; tribunals.  I understand from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism that his Department are engaged on a study of the various types of procedures which could be developed to cater for small claims, many of which would arise out of disputes between the retailer and consumer.  I would like, however, to remind Deputies that the proposals in this Bill are a significant step towards making the settlement of small, and indeed not so small, claims, easier.  If we take motor cars, for example, being the biggest &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; item which most people buy, then after this Bill comes into operation disputes involving all but the luxury end of the motor car market can be taken in the Circuit Court, and many second-hand deals will be within the District Court's range. <Col N="630" /> Under present arrangements the District Court would not even be able to take cases involving, say, a reasonably priced electric cooker.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening remarks that it would be, and must be, our intention not to allow the District Court procedures to become more complex and more formalised as a result of the increased jurisdiction under this Bill.  I have every confidence that this will be the case and that the District Court will remain a suitable forum for these quick, informal and inexpensive disposals of small claims.  Whether or not a totally different approach outside the courts system can be justified in the interest of consumer protection would be something on which the study I mentioned being conducted by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism would obviously throw some light.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating suggested that the Bill was &ldquo;a lazy way out&rdquo;.  He seemed to be suggesting that on one hand we were slavishly following some recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, while on the other hand we were ignoring other recommendations. This is simply not so.  As I said in my opening speech, all the recommendations in the 20th report were given the fullest consideration and are being implemented either in exact terms or in the form considered best suited to give effect to them.  In some respects the proposals in the Bill differ from the committee's recommendations and include some additions which are in line with, even though not covered by, the committee's report.  These proposals, together with the provisions based on the recommendations of the committee on their Fifth and Tenth Reports relating to registration of District Court decrees and the interest rate payable on judgment debts, form a carefully considered legislative package which is designed to enable people to use the courts &mdash; particularly the lower courts &mdash; as the forum for settling their differences.  The Bill is designed to make more easily available to more people the remedies which the law provides. It represents a considerable step forward in the evolution of our courts, so that <Col N="631" /> they will be better able to reflect not only the changes which have taken place in the value of money but also the increased awareness among people at all social and economic levels of the significant role which can be played by the courts in resolving family difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other reports of the committee and other recommendations but they would not be appropriate for this Bill.  It is my intention to introduce further legislation to give effect to these recommendations of the committee and related matters, and a good deal of work has already been done in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Section 2 enables the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, subject to regulations, to pay a subsidy to a building society in respect of interest payable to the building society as regards any period commencing on or after June 1977.  What is said there is that the Minister can, if he gets the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay a subsidy to a building society in order to enable that building society to reduce or keep down the rate of interest which it charges to borrowers from it.  Subsection (2) provides that in determining the amount of a subsidy paid to a society under this section regard may be had to all or any one or more of the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P> (a)  the amount of interest payable by borrowers on loans made to them by the society,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> (b)  the amount of interest payable by the society to shareholders in or depositors with the society,</P>
    <P>(c)  such other matters (if any) as stand for the time being prescribed under this subsection.  </P>
    <P>We know the Minister, his predecessor or the Government authorised or paid a subsidy to building societies in order to keep the lending rate down to its present record rate, I think, of 14.1 per cent.  The section we are now dealing with will validate that subsidy which has already been paid by the Minister to the building societies. It is clear from speeches and statements made by the Minister that he considers the present building society rate of 14.1 per cent too high.  The Minister thinks that the rate which building societies are charging at the moment is excessive and should be reduced.  It is beyond the capacity of the public to pay this.</P>
    <P>The number of loans paid by the building societies in 1980 has decreased in comparison with 1979.  Building societies granted 1,215 loans for the month of October 1980 but for the same month in 1979 the five big building societies advanced 1,730 loans.  That means that about 500 more loans were advanced by the building societies in October 1979 than in October 1980.  The amount necessary to build a house is increasing substantially, if we are to take the amount of the loans made by building societies into account.  The average loan paid out by building societies in October 1980 was £17,098 as compared with £14,567 in January 1980.  That is a substantial increase. It is not unreasonable to suggest that that indicates that the price of houses and the cost of house building increased substantially between January and October of this year.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Minister that an interest rate of 14.15 per cent is far too high and is beyond the capacity of the borrowing public to pay.  It is not for me to say whether the building societies should take down their interest rates. They say that the inflow of investment money to them in October is about the same as in the previous month.  That is <Col N="633" /> something between the Minister and the building societies.  It is significant that at the very first opportunity the Minister got he cut off the subsidy to the building societies when he could have left it there and brought down the interest rate, which he obviously thinks should be done.</P>
    <P>The building societies should bring down their interest rate if they possibly can, but if the effect is to diminish the amount of money they have to lend to borrowers that is not a solution.  I would like the Minister to avail of this opportunity to give the House an undertaking that he will restore the subsidy in order to reduce the lending rate of 14.15 per cent.  If, having explored the possibility of getting the building societies to reduce their lending rate, he is satisfied that it would not be in the interests of the borrowing public or house builders for them to do so, we would be 100 per cent with the Minister.  I believe it is clear from all the public statements of the Minister recently that he is satisfied beyond doubt that the interest rate of 14.15 per cent is too high.  I would like to hear from the Minister what he proposes to do about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This section of the Bill is for the purpose of continuing the right to subsidise by the Government, with which I agree.  There are two facts which have come out of all this.  The first is that the Minister and the Government are satisfied that the interest rate of 14.15 per cent is too high.  The second is that the building societies say if they reduce the interest rate they will not be able to continue the number of loans they are giving. If these two facts are accepted there is only one solution, which is that the Minister should use the powers he is now taking to reintroduce a subsidy in order to bring down the interest rate to what he considers a reasonable amount for a borrower to pay.  The matter is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might let us have the figures&mdash;this debate will be continued tomorrow&mdash;for the number of loans issued in the last four or five years up to the end of October in each year.  Deputy <Col N="634" /> Fitzpatrick said that the number of loans issued in October this year compared with the number issued for the same month last year shows a drop of approximately 500.  Naturally enough, the increasing cost of houses means that people borrowing money will be looking for higher loans, which has the effect of reducing the number given.  It is important to compare like with like, so we should like to know the number of loans issued for the same month in each of the last five years.  We will then know if what the building societies are saying is correct. They say that if they do not keep up the interest rate there will not be money enough to continue to give the loans necessary. They say they are unable to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>Figures can prove various things, but one of the things which the recent building society figures seem to be trying to prove is that the building societies in the last couple of months lent much more than they had taken in &mdash; the amount of money being invested in the building societies is much less than the amount of money taken out.  While we usually talk about the big five, perhaps the Minister could have some figures for the other smaller societies which, despite the fact that they are small are taking in a very substantial amount of money.  I would be very interested in having those figures when the debate on the Bill resumes and I will have some further comments to make on the Bill then.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann considers the latest unemployment total of 111,000 for 31 October 1980, announced on the 11 November, to be a massive indictment of the Government's employment strategy and calls on the Government immediately to introduce policies to reverse this disatrous trend. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> This motion of the Parliamentary Labour Party underlines the fact that in the Republic of Ireland at present there is no coherent economic policy.  The present Government do not have any economic planning strategy.  We urgently need a set of national economic objectives. We urgently need effective institutions for economic planning.  These we do not have now.  We urgently need a central economic structure to deal with incomes policy.  This we do not have at present.</P>
    <P>We do not have a co-ordinated strategy of industrial development.  The State sector does its own thing with very few guidelines.  The Industrial Development Authority do their own thing by and large, and let it be said do it rather well. The other State bodies involved in industrial development such as Córas Tráchtála, the IIRS, the NPC, AnCO, all are separate empires with very little central co-ordination at national level between these sectors.  We are promised a national enterprise agency, yet three-and-a-half years towards the conclusion of the present term of office of the Government this body has yet to surface.  Perhaps it will be christened FIDO &mdash; something called a fast industrial development organisation which we will probably see after the next general election.  We need a national development corporation, yet this concept is still quite embryonic.  Worse still, in terms of industrial development we need a detailed regional policy dovetailed into a clear strategy of economic planning throughout the country.  This basic feature we do not possess.  Because we do not have effective economic planning in this country and because there is not a coherent strategy of industrial development, the process of job creation and the maintenance of employment in specific regions have suffered.</P>
    <P>We urgently need a policy towards better industrial relations in this country. We urgently need to extend the present experiment of worker democracy into the private sector.  We urgently need structures to convince workers in key industries that they too have a national responsibility <Col N="636" /> to discharge in their employments.  In many respects, all of this is related to the employment question. We need much better and far less class conscious management training and education in this country.  These characteristics we do not have even in fair measure to meet the tensions of industrial relations quite evident in our economy right through the 1970s.</P>
    <P>Our country does not have what one might call a domestic monetary policy. The Central Bank have their own guidelines. The commercial banks proceed to do their own thing.  The building societies proceed to implement their own policies. Our State-sponsored financial institutions such as ACC and ICC try to do their best but they lack a coherent place in the credit creation framework of the State. This is so because successive Governments have failed to get to grips with the contribution towards economic and social development which our monetary. institutions should be making, and are capable of making, in the national interest. As a consequence employment has suffered and this is mirrored in the total number of unemployed today.</P>
    <P>Our country urgently needs an agricultural development policy.  Four out of every ten productive acres in Ireland make no contribution to national development. Our country needs a policy of maritime development.  Of course to fund such an economic policy one has to have a system of taxation which is capable of making a contribution towards job creation. We do not have a taxation policy in this country.  We have introduced and abandoned so many taxes and so many varieties of taxes in the past decade that there is a rich source of material for 2,000 PhD theses on our taxation system.  As a consequence our whole Exchequer budgeting has gone through the roof with current deficits piling upon deficits together with massive foreign borrowing &mdash; all because we do not have any taxation policy whatsoever in this country.  With almost 140,000 people unemployed, all we have to show at the end of the year is a budget deficit which the Minister is ready to concede is somewhere between £200 million and £250 million.  As a consequence, <Col N="637" /> money urgently needed from current consumption to pay for job creation to meet the social cost of those who are unemployed is just not available any longer.</P>
    <P>Our country needs a transport policy. This we manifestly do not have.  Does anybody know what the future of CIE is to be?  Do we have any policy on road haulage?  Do we have any policy on investment in roads?  Witness the Dublin and Cork transportation problems which alone every day cost the country millions of pounds in scarce economic resources and loss of industrial output.  As a consequence, employment content in industry is directly affected by increased costs and low productivity.</P>
    <P>To cap it all we need political leadership. This we do not have.  Political leadership here is equated with beating Fine Gael to the top of the polls.  We have a public relations Taoiseach.  We have a Taoiseach who believes that whatever people want, irrespective of the consequences of their expectations, people should be given and, of course, he should be seen to be the sole contributor.  Political popularity before policy is the only policy this country has at present.</P>
    <P>There are now 200,000 persons registered as unemployed on this island, 90,000 in Northern Ireland and 111,000 in the Republic.  Reliable commentators not usually given to exaggeration, such as Donal Nevin, say that the true figure for the Republic is probably 140,000 and I agree with that estimate when taking into account school leavers of this year who have not registered but are seeking employment.  I meet them every day.  Of course, their former advocates, like Brother Vivian Cassells, are strangely silent but when we were in office many a statement was made by the said gentleman. This is the highest number of unemployed persons registered in the history of Ireland as a whole.  It is an enormous waste of human resources and a serious loss of industrial production.  There is grave hardship imposed on families which can hardly be measured.  It is an indictment of our economic and social systems.  There is a responsibility on all <Col N="638" /> politicians to awaken public opinion to this fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>One of the major issues facing our community at present is the extent to which those of us in employment are prepared to put our hands in our pockets to pay for the maintenance of those who are unemployed and to pay for job creation costs.  There is no doubt that within our community there is an enormous prejudice against people who are unemployed. There is a great mythology which classifies many of those who are unemployed as persons who are perpetually on &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; or who are simply too lazy to work.  Perhaps the only way to cure some people of this dangerous mythology is that they themselves should be declared redundant and have to sign on in an employment exchange every week and have to register in Manpower, pretend they are going to work while chasing vacancies or have to hang around their homes and streets in despair living on less than half their normal earnings.  I make this point because living standards in Ireland for those at work have improved very substantially in the past decade.  For example, the number of private cars per 1,000 population has increased from 132 in 1970 to 203 by 1979.  One has only to visit a lounge bar any evening of the week to see evident prosperity, high living standards and an apparently unending capacity for consumption.  Despite the fact that there is a real and dramatic improvement in living standards we still have about 140,000 people in the Republic who are seeking work and are on the live register.</P>
    <P>The problem is that higher living standards inevitably fuel higher expectations and any politician who suggests that living standards should remain on a plateau or pause for two or three years to enable the unemployed, the deprived and the elderly to catch up, or at least to maintain their living standards with other sections of the community, is likely to get a sharp reaction from his constituents.  However, the point must be made strongly because there is no point in being in public life if one does not state the hard options and unpalatable truths, irrespective of electoral consequences.  I ask again &mdash; and I <Col N="639" /> was very unpopular with some of my trade union colleagues when I asked this question before &mdash; how many of the tens of thousands who marched outside Dáil Éireann and throughout the country demanding income tax relief are prepared to march for the unemployed?</P>
    <P>The national understanding contains a commitment on jobs for 1980 and 1981. It is not unfair to suggest that now in the middle of November the 1980 commitment is somewhat irrelevant.  For example, moneys which should have been released to local authorities in mid-year are only now filtering through at an exceptionally slow pace with the odd few hundred thousand pounds being given out to local authorities to meet outstanding contractual commitments.  In County Dublin there are 350 approved housing loan applicants, many of whom have been waiting for the past six months and are being crucified on bridging loans. Quite a number of builders are awaiting payment also, but to date the £4 million which is urgently needed by Dublin County Council has not been paid by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that one must view the commitment on jobs contained in the national understanding.  There is a commitment that in 1981 there will be 15,000 net new jobs, that is, an increase of 15,000 in the total number at work in the economy.  Needless to remark, our employment statistics are not produced very rapidly and it will be well into 1981 before we have an indication of whether this target is likely to be met.  However, we know the cost of job creation.  Recent indications from the IDA would suggest that in 1981 the cost of creating a new job will be about £10,000, taking into account inflation, imported inflation, energy cost increases and the impact of the national understanding on construction costs. This means that the cost of 15,000 net additional jobs will be in the region of £150 million.  The principal point in relation to this requirement is that it is all too apparent now that the real hard political nerve does not exist in the Cabinet to divert current consumption and scarce national resources into the area of job <Col N="640" /> creation.  This political will has been eroded.</P>
    <P>We will probably have a by-election in North Tipperary in the early spring.  Our colleague, the esteemed Minister, may be the cause of this by-election and we wish him well.  However, we do not wish to see a situation where Nenagh is to get a new airport and Roscrea is, if possible, to get a new harbour, while Thurles is promised a new helicopter pad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought for a moment that the Deputy was showing some familiarity with the ground. Obviously that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared for anything in terms of promises from this Government.  The Taoiseach will probably go down to Holycross Abbey and announce the lot.  Such is the nature of our political priorities at present.  The Government should undertake for the 1981 capital programme and the budget an exceptional, stringent view of the criteria for productive capital investment and all resources should be channelled directly into the job creation programme. This might mean that further demands from the public sector for more and yet more pay increases in addition to the national understanding, demands from the farming community in north Tipperary for more and more relief against falling farm incomes and demands for 1,001 different projects, valuable projects which are relatively low in employment content, will have to be deferred while we try to get the tens of thousands out of work into productive employment.  These demands may have to be deferred in the national interest.  I throw out these questions. There is little point in having a fat wad of tax free allowance certificates in one's pocket if in the other pocket one has a redundancy notice and a P60 which shows no income.  The choice facing our community is as stark as that.  I fully appreciate that what I am saying will probably not be too popular with very many persons who are in employment in either the public or private sector.  However, the harsh reality in Irish society, as indeed throughout western Europe, is <Col N="641" /> that those who have jobs by and large do not care unduly about those who are out of work even if they are their very own next door neighbours.  It is the job of politicians to make sure that that appreciation and political education is brought about in our community so that there is true reality and true economic appreciation and lack of social prejudice brought about in our community.</P>
      <P>My comment on the Government's budget strategy for 1981 is that all resources must be concentrated on two fronts, productive job creation and our social services so that there will be no cutback whatsoever in these.  There will be an enormous temptation to cut back on areas such as allocations for the health boards.  While I believe that that sector could be far more efficient I am strongly of the view that it should be possible to obtain sufficient resources at national level for productive capital investment without diluting or cutting back our social services as might well be advocated by some right wing commentators in their analysis of the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of inflation and employment generally.  It has been clearly established that our rate of inflation has a decisive impact on employment. It has been suggested in a number of quarters, and notably in the recent speeches of the Taoiseach and the Minister, that the rate of inflation is on a downward curve.  I do not share that view.  I will suggest a number of reasons for the rate of inflation and the money income increases.  We have a situation where within and without the current national understanding money increases continue to be sought and conceded without restraint.  While I am pleased to note that the teachers trade unions will probably accept their revised pay offer I would point out that the net cost to the Exchequer is £48 million.  Good luck to the teachers. Congratulations to the teachers.  The immediate current cost for 1980 will come to that.  Where this money will be found to meet this award only God and the Taoiseach know.  The Minister should be thanking his lucky stars that he may be in Brussels by that time.  We now have a further situation where the Garda <Col N="642" /> Síochána are demanding an increase of about £50 a week, arising in particular from the settlement for psychiatric nurses, prison officers and teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to tell the Deputy what the immediate cost of that will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to hazard a guess.  This pay claim is, of course, additional to previous settlements of pay relativities in recent years and also to the national understanding. Where the money will come from again lies with the Taoiseach.  It is difficult to be critical of the Garda Síochána but one would say that there is clear evidence available that since the Taoiseach took office every other public sector pay claim has been conceded.  We therefore have the most ironic situation where we have a national understanding but no incomes policy.  In relation to the new salary scale settlement for teachers, as there are some 37,000 teachers in the country who will get this increase, the reaction and the number of relativity claims from the other sectors of the public service is going to be quite enormous.  The implications of the non-existence of an incomes policy despite the existence of a national understanding are very grave indeed.  The current national understanding and its application to the public service pay level in a full year will cost the Exchequer £247 million.  Again, I would not like to hazard a guess as to where that money is going to come from.  But there is no doubt that it does have an inflationary impact and an impact ultimately on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason I do not have much optimism about our inflationary prospects is that as yet the August, September and October reports of the National Prices Commission have not been published by the Government.  They were buried because of the Donegal by-election. Where are they?  Why have they been delayed?  I can appreciate that the October report might still be under consideration by the National Prices Commission but there seems little excuse for the non-publication of the August and September reports.  These reports will <Col N="643" /> presumably contain some further sanctions for further price increases.  This will inevitably have some impact on the inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>A third and critically important influence on our rate of inflation will be the level of electricity price increases in the next 12 months.  I understand that when the ESB made their last application to the National Prices Commission it was on the basis of oil costing the board £104 per ton.  I understand that last week the board was paying £140 per ton of oil on the general market because the spot market is gone.  We know that the installations in the Middle East will be at least 18 months out of action due to the damage there.  In these circumstances I would predict that in the not too distant future ESB bills for industry and consumers will probably rise by another 15 per cent.  Therefore, these three factors I have mentioned, the profligate policies of the Government in terms of cash handouts, the money income increases from resources which are not available over and above and under the national understanding and the energy cost increases which are reasonably projected, will have a major impact on employment.  On top of all that we crucify ourselves with the prospect of industrial disputes having an effect on employment.</P>
    <P>Throughout this speech I have called for political leadership.  If this should become evident we are also entitled to call on other sections of the community to exercise leadership.  This includes the trade unions.  In particular we need the support of one group of workers by every other group of fellow workers in society. This means that when and if strikes become necessary &mdash; and I admit that it may be necessary to serve strike notice in any industry but I recall many times when James Larkin Junior said the best strike notice was the one that is never served except in the gravest of circumstances &mdash; then industrial action is directed against the employer.  All too frequently such strikes are attempted to be won on the backs of fellow workers and on the backs of their families.  This kind of industrial blackmail is not trade unionism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> Strike notices should be served only after the fullest consideration for the rights of others in the community, after the greatest possible efforts to resolve the issues and then only after full democratic process within a trade union and after recourse to all other actions or avenues to resolve the dispute.  Otherwise we shall descend into a dog-eat-dog society provoking a repressive anti-trade union and anti-democratic response in the nation's laws.  Needless to remark such industrial disputes have a disastrous impact on existing employment and scare away the prospect of new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>A very clear responsibility devolves on every trade union official, on every shop steward and every trade union member to ensure that the least possible damage is done to their own employment, to outside industry and to the national image when such disputes inevitably occur.  I am sick and tired of seeing disputes occur because personnel management is a last item on the agenda of board meetings. Companies rarely take decisive remedial action at industrial management level until they are suddenly confronted with a critical industrial relations situation and very often it may then be far too late. Therefore the blame does not rest exclusively on one side.  I want to make that quite clear.  However as a trade unionist I felt I should direct my remarks on the trade union side and, therefore, every trade union official, shop steward, every trade union member should ensure that the least possible damage is done to their employment, to outside industry and to our national image when such disputes occur.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the State-sponsored sector because I believe this to be very critical and the employment situation in this sector has begun to deteriorate. A number of bodies have already laid off workers or suspended recruitment. An extremely critical situation has developed in some of these bodies, such as NET.  In the lifetime of this Dáil I have been a member of the Joint Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas on State-Sponsored Bodies.  In this capacity I have been afforded a first-hand opportunity of being appraised of the situation.  I should <Col N="645" /> like to bring some facts to the attention of the House because it appears to me that every member of the Cabinet, with the possible exception of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, seems to be brushing this grave problem under the Cabinet carpet.</P>
    <P>CIE, in its last annual report for 1979, lost £70 million.  Presumably they will lose at least as much again in the year 1980.  The Cabinet have absolutely no transport policy, and are giving no guidelines to the Board of CIE.  The board in turn are unable to convince themselves and their trade union employees of the existence of a national transport policy. Everybody in that area has finished up with their collective heads in the sands of bankruptcy refusing to take drastic operational and policy decisions which might give us a reasonable effective transport system.  The Government, with fundamental political responsibility in this area, apart from the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, trying to start a bus now and again, have done nothing at all.</P>
    <P>NET lost £12 million in 1979 and another £30 million in 1980.  Even if the board get the £80 million for which they are now asking the Minister for Finance, even if the Minister gave it to them in the morning, NET will lose another £30 in 1981.  The situation is as bad as that and is a public scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, we inherited that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They have also had three-and-a-half years in which to do something about it.  That Marino Point project constitutes a public scandal and has major implications for the Public Capital Programme for the next few years.  It would require extraordinarily decisive action on the part of the Government and the new managing director of NET &mdash; whom I wish well &mdash; if alone the 1,500 jobs in Arklow and Marino Point are to be saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sugar company faces a deficit this year which must be of the order of £10 million.  Aer Lingus face a deficit of £10 million projected to March 1981.  One <Col N="646" /> can add to these losses in the State-sponsored sector the B &amp; I where it is reported there will be a loss of well over £3 million for the year 1980.  Of course the Irish Continental Line lost heavily this year as well.  There are other State-sponsored bodies.  I shall not go into the realms of RTE, currently under investigation by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, because it would be improper so to do.</P>
    <P>Those are just some of the very substantial losses in the State-sponsored sector. Indeed that was not the whole picture. In 1978 the borrowing indebtedness of the State-sponsored sector was approximately £1 billion.  On 21 October last the Minister for Finance informed me that that had increased by no less than 70 per cent to £1.7 billion.  Therefore in effect the State-sponsored sector, in order to keep afloat, has been indulging in massive borrowing.  The £1.7 billion to which I referred does not include direct indebtedness to the State.</P>
    <P>It all boils down to what one should do about that critical situation.  It has been suggested that the Government should borrow further abroad but obviously that is not on.  It has been suggested that there should be more direct Exchequer subvention to these bodies.  That means more taxation.  It has been suggested that there should be full economic pricing of their products and services.  This should be possible but, time and again, the Cabinet have failed to face up to the challenge of full economic pricing of many of the price applications of these bodies themselves. I would exempt some bodies, like CIE, which obviously must have a subsidy.  The consequence has been that the cash flows of these bodies have deteriorated to an alarming extent.  The only rational solution is full economic pricing in many areas so as to avoid further major deficits.  Of course that requires political courage.  It may require further taxation but certainly it will mean that there will be a fuelling of inflation to quite a degree in the process</P>
    <P>I shall refer to two or three other aspects.  There is the question of agriculture. One might ask: where will the money come from to meet the IFA <Col N="647" /> demands?  Where will the money come from if rates on land are to be reduced by 50 per cent, with an Exchequer cost of £20 million?  Where will the money come from in the event of the suspension of the £10 million animal disease levy until farm incomes improve?  Where will the money come from if the Government decide to increase substantially the subsidy on lime and fertilisers?  Where will the money come from if the £7 million resource tax is abolished?  I appreciate that farm incomes have declined.  But the hard option facing the Government is that whereas some farmers still have their land, still have an income, though reduced, there are tens of thousands who have no income, no jobs, with little prospect of getting any unless we allocate the money now being demanded to be put into the agricultural sector into job creation in the industrial sector, including the agricultural employment sector.  That is the choice facing the Government.  In some ways it is salutary for the farming sector because by and large they did not pay any taxation throughout the 1970s.</P>
    <P>I believe that if unemployment is to be reduced there must be a rapid expansion of industrial infrastructural investment. If that new industrial investment is to achieve its full potential, the money must be produced out of the Public Capital Programme of 1981 and 1980, geared to that area, and the bureaucracy which prevents those industrial infrastructural services of new telexes, new telephones, new roads, and so on must be pushed aside.  In the files of Dublin County Council there are over 100 industrialists looking for sites in South County Dublin. They cannot get them.  They want to increase employment.  We gave them sites in the Sandyford Industrial Estate. There are now 40 of them there employing 700 people.  We could multiply that by three had we the political will and the Public Capital Programme opportunities of so doing.  Indeed the list of existing and prospective employers willing to move into new areas and expand their factories is available to the Minister tomorrow morning.  The capital allocation of moneys must be done on a very <Col N="648" /> rigid and strict basis.  The buying of electoral support for marginal airports or marginal harbours is a totally cynical response to the real demands of the situation.</P>
    <P>Throughout my remarks I have advocated restraint, moderation and the direction in which public finances should go.  The question is: how do we achieve that restraint?  I do not think we will do so unless we receive some reasonably good example from the Government.  We will not achieve it if the vast majority of industrial workers are convinced that the taxation system is unfair, is seen to be unfair.  Indeed it will not be achieved so long as employees have no real say in their enterprises, when the only time they see a balance sheet is when it is handed to them by a receiver with a redundancy notice as they walk out the door.  We cannot have haphazard industrial relations policies in this country if we are to succeed in the 1980s.  Income restraint can be achieved only when every section of society bears its cost of economic recovery proportionately to its ability to pay.  That may mean issues of capital taxation, income taxation, direct and indirect taxation.  It may mean the total abolition of tax avoidance and evasion, which persist in our society, to carry the ccost of that exercise.</P>
    <P>I believe that the present Cabinet are devoid of political will in that area.  The Cabinet are maimed by the cult of the personality which leads it, by an extravagant situation where the Taoiseach went to Donegal like Adam or Eve, naked and unashamed to woo the electorate.  The campaign was prurient and the Irish people deserve better because, if I may finish with a quotation by Professor Lee in a Thomas Davis lecture, he said that the damage which industrial disputes cause is probably much less than that which is due to the continuing mediocrity of the many economic decision makers whether in the public or private sector &mdash; and I would say to Professor Lee &mdash; the political sector also because in effect that is the import of our motion.  We are moving it in the hope that public opinion will be stirred in the direction of seeking action <Col N="649" /> by the Government in this area before it is too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves the Government's policies to sustain employment in the face of the present serious international economic situation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I first addressed myself to the Labour Party motion I thought that it ignored &mdash; and still does &mdash; certain realities, but before commenting on that motion and on the realities it ignores I should acknowledge that Deputy Desmond's contribution for the most part, apart from some of his comments on the by-election in which for some strange reason he himself took no part, was significant for two reasons.  Whereas Opposition Deputies tend to seek more and more money to solve problems that are all too easy to identify &mdash; we even had a little of that in the previous debate where Deputy Fitzpatrick was suggesting that we should again subsidise interest rates &mdash;Deputy Desmond, it should be said in fairness, took the other view, a generally responsible view although perhaps an unpopular view and acknowledged that it was a question of discipline, restraint and obligation to each other.  He deserves recognition for taking that general view. But having acknowledged that, it does seem at the same time out of tune with the terms of the motion to which the Deputy also appends his name.  The impression one gets from the motion is that the unemployment situation here is solely attributable to failure of Government policy and is &ldquo;a massive indictment&rdquo;&mdash; to quote &mdash;&ldquo;of the Government's employment strategy&rdquo;.  Of course that is not the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is something that we should all face, that our problem is not confined to Ireland.  This is true to such an extent that the President of the European Council has written to his colleagues saying that unemployment within the Community must be the major item for discussion <Col N="650" /> at the European Council meeting in a week's time.  I shall return to that later. It is important that we should recognise that fact and not try to convey impressions of others that the problems existing here are attributable only to failures in this State.</P>
    <P>Despite these problems I should like to reiterate that the Government's commitment to the attainment of full employment remains firm and constant.  It is evident that the setback in the course of the last two years, particularly the latest rise in oil prices, has certainly seriously affected our capacity to achieve that goal within the time scale and phasing we had envisaged.  I say deliberately that the commitment nonetheless remains for a number of reasons, many of which Deputy Desmond has underlined.  In a sense it would be a soft option to drop the commitment because it would mean in a way that there are no disciplines required of the rest of us to ensure that that objective is achieved.  I am very much in sympathy with many of the points made by Deputy Desmond in that context.  I wish I had more time to deal with some of them.  He recognises that some commentators in regard to income tax found that no matter how generous the concessions made last year &mdash; at the taxpayer's expense let it be said &mdash; they were not generous enough.  Some would suggest that I somehow cheated people by not going further back at the cost of about another £50 million.  I prefer Deputy Desmond's realistic and honest approach to the notion that somehow you could pull another £50 million out of the bag in addition to the £250 million already conceded. For that at least he deserves appreciation.</P>
    <P>The employment we have in mind is viable and productive employment which is worthwhile, which satisfies the holder and the community's aspirations on living standards.  If you have non-productive employment merely for the sake of having people engaged in some activity that will keep their hands active and their minds a little less lazy, that is not fulfilling dignity of work that I think the House and the people would require of the Government. Obviously what we must aim <Col N="651" /> for is a programme and an infrastructure in our priorities that will not only generate jobs at the time of these activities but which will generate the basis and foundation for continued development of employment in the future.  That is particularly important for us with our growing population which is of very considerable significance when one considers this question here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that we are aware that we are the essential open economy.  Of all the European economies ours is the one that is most affected.  We must recognise this reality also by external development.  About 55 per cent of our output is sold abroad and obviously a much higher proportion of any addition to output must be exported if it is to be sold at all.  We cannot rely, as we might have done in the thirties or forties, on our own consumers to generate demand for the employment that must be created or maintained for our growing labour market.  More jobs require more output, which in turn must be based on more exports.  This is the logic of the situation. For that reason the setback to employment hopes this year must be seen against the background of the present international recession &mdash; not just so that the Government can take consolation in that but so that everybody involved will recognise realities and not enter into doom or gloom where it is unwarranted.</P>
    <P>This recession, apart from the direct impact it has on us in view of our openness and in view of the increase in oil prices also caused competition in our home and foreign markets to intensify, as producers strove internationally to maintain output in the face of falling demands.  Growth in the OECD area generally this year will be very much less than anticipated.  It has decelerated progressively over the last two years.  That is the international environment in which we must maintain the employment programmes which this motion suggested are beset by Government failure only.  The most recent forecast suggests that the GNP of OECD countries will rise this year by not much more than 1 per cent and the growth in the EEC will be of the <Col N="652" /> same order.  This is of vital importance to us because the growth of world trade, which is now expected to be only 2½ per cent this year, will compare with 6½ per cent in 1979.  There is a stark reality which we might as well face.  We cannot say it is not due to all these outside influences. This motion suggests that it is entirely due to Government mishandling.</P>
    <P>Our performance and the progress that we have made contrast &mdash; and I am putting this very briefly but, nonetheless, it must be stated as another reality &mdash; with the situation which existed when the Opposition had Government responsibility.</P>

The unemployment situation in Ireland then was over twice the average of the European Economic Community.  Now, it is not even one and a half times the average of the European Economic Community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just stated the facts. Deputy Lipper can contribute later.  The record is there and I shall give precise figures.  The unemployment rate in the European Community this year is forecast to rise to 6 per cent, by comparison with that period when it was just over 2½ per cent.  It has been climbing very steadily, to the extent that the impact here would have been all the greater were it not for the actions taken by the Government to offset the very dramatic and damaging impact of these events throughout the whole Community.  I do not think that even these quoted figures capture the severity of the deterioration and the rapidity with which that deterioration occurred.  The latest published statistics show that in the 12 months to September last the rate of increase in unemployment in virtually all developing economies has been staggering.  In the United States, for instance, the rate of increase was over 30 per cent, in the United Kingdom 37½ per cent and in Denmark more than 21 per cent.  The figures also show that developments in Belgium have been such that the unemployment rate there has been-pushed to the highest level of the European Economic Community now and indications are that it will be the highest next year.</P>
      <P>It would have been nothing short of miraculous if we had escaped all these trends.  I am not saying that we achieved that miracle.  To be able to contain the rising unemployment better than other countries with stronger economies than ours in itself has been a very significant achievement when it is considered that it was achieved particularly in the face of an actual fall in demand in our main external market, which is a very important factor here, and a serious deterioration in our competitive position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the position in that main external market, the United Kingdom, be noted.  First of all, apart from the unemployment situation in the UK, the policies being pursued there, however appropriate they may be for the UK &mdash; and I do not want to be taken as commenting on these at this time&mdash; obviously are having an impact on the export outlet which we still seek in that <Col N="654" /> market.  It is still our main external outlet, representing over 45 per cent of our total exports.  One would be foolish to ignore the impact which the restrictive policy there is having on our employment activities and, particularly, on our export drive.  For instance, no other European Economic Community state faces all these factors together &mdash; the openness of our economy, the main outlet and the policies being pursued there and our dependency on imported energy.  No other developed European Community country which I know of faces all of these difficulties to the same extent.  For that reason, we have seen a significant deterioration in our employment situation, which is obviously a serious issue and a problem which the Government are not only tackling, but determined to tackle even more effectively.</P>
    <P>There is the other important factor, which Deputy Desmond touched on.  We have here a labour force growth which is by far the highest of the European Community and will have it in the future. Apart from population trends, the Central Statistics Office recently released an estimate of 20,000 as the net inflow of people into Ireland in the year to April last.  This reflects the relative deterioration in labour market conditions in the United Kingdom, from whence most of that inflow comes.  If one adds that figure to the growth in our labour force, which is twice the rate for the rest of Europe&mdash;our population growth, incidentally, is seven times the rate of the rest of Europe &mdash; one can see all these factors coming together which indicate that undoubtedly the kind of discipline which Deputy Desmond is talking about from the whole Community will be required to ensure that the priorities which the Government will apply will benefit those who may now be unemployed and, in particular, provide opportunities for the young people coming on the labour market.</P>
    <P>I have spoken a little about the European dimension and it is important that I should specifically say what the Government are doing on that.  At the meeting yesterday of the Finance Ministers, I raised this matter as being the major <Col N="655" /> problem facing the Community.  I called on my colleagues to recognise it as such and said that we must not pursue policies independently which can damage the socio-economic fabric in our interdependent economies.  I was both surprised and pleased that, for the first time in the Council of Ministers of the European Community, I got almost an unanimous response from my colleagues that this should be the major item on the agenda for the next European Council.  Some of my colleagues, notably the French and the German, spoke strongly of that need and recognised that Governments cannot pursue policies which would, in a sense, maintain that the monetary disciplines are the only criteria.  The human problem of unemployment, one of the Prime Ministers said, can create a breakdown in public order.  We are, at European level, making our partners aware of how vitally important this is.  This is a very considerable achievement on our part and the Vice-President of the Commission has indicated that the Commission will present the position to the European Council and, in turn, that the Finance Council should then be called upon by the European Council to co-ordinate their policies and formulate them in a way which will tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I turn now to what we are doing at home in this whole area.  Again, I wish to place on record, because it is important, the emphasis in the Government's planning and strategy to deal with the employment situation. Our Public Capital Programme this year represented, in terms of the area for infrastructural development in particular, increases of the order of between 25 and 30 per cent on the allocations over last year.  That was a major and deliberate addition on the part of the Government when drawing up estimates for this year over and above the norm of about 5 to 6 per cent we applied on the current side.</P>
    <P>I should like to illustrate this by reference to one or two of the major agencies. I am anxious to let the House know how we have concentrated on the capital programme and, in particular, the employment <Col N="656" /> agencies in that programme.  The IDA capital programme in 1977 &mdash; the last year the Opposition had Government responsibility &mdash; represented £59 million or 8.9 per cent of the Public Capital Programme. This year the IDA capital programme represents £157 million or 12.5 per cent of the Public Capital Programme. That is just one example of the definition of priorities the Government are pursuing to ensure the maintenance of the employment drive in our economic programme.  The same is true of SFADCo and all the other agencies who will be allocated some 30 per cent more this year than last year.  In addition, the Industrial Credit Company will have a 30 per cent increase over last year.  It is of vital importance to recognise that in absolute terms the 1980 figure for combined expenditure of the agencies I have referred to will be £278 million.  That figure includes £6.7 million announced in the package in the national understanding as a further commitment to maintaining the employment drive.  That package, at a cost of £100 million, directs itself to (a)  the infrastructural base, (b) the employment agencies and to the training agency which is of vital importance particularly with a view to training our young population for the employment opportunities that exist.</P>
    <P>At the outset of his contribution Deputy Desmond read a dull and gloomy litany of the things we do not have.  If faults are due to all the things that we do not have, then all of the partners I have referred to must be in a more serious situation from lack of policies than we are.  It is appropriate that I should not repeat the actions we have taken but I should like to mention the developments which give us room for manoeuvre since I introduced my budget earlier this year. The October trade figures, published today, show that the import excess is continuing to decrease over the trends for last year and each month this year.  I do not wish to make too much of a virtue of that.  I am aware that that is attributable to a number of factors.  But, as I mentioned in my budget statement, that gives the Government, in view of the fact that the payments deficit now looks as if <Col N="657" /> it will turn out at something of the order of £600 million compared with £730 million in 1979, leeway in terms of the adjustment of our policies on the public expenditure side.  I should like to assure Deputy Desmond that in our examination at this stage of our public expenditure we are adhering to the priorities in the Public Capital Programme.  We are curbing to a considerable extent the growth of the current budget.  Deputies come here looking for more and more, asking the Government to subsidise more and more, like Deputy Fitzpatrick a short time ago in relation to the building societies, as if the Government could find the money anywhere, but they should realise that that is all current budget money.  I can assure those who are seriously interested that we will not respond to those requests to add to the current budget but we will respond to the obvious need and demand to maintain activity on the capital programme.</P>
    <P>It is important that I should state that irrespective of the actions the Government may take through public expenditure there are other realities that have to be faced.  In a recent speech I referred to productivity.  Productivity is not confined to working twice as hard at the bench or attending everyday at the bench instead of being absent one day out of five although those are major elements.  Productivity also is very much involved in what Deputy Desmond referred to, industrial peace, better industrial relations. If there is a breakdown in one plant, that affects another plant and productivity suffers, our exports suffer and when they suffer our job opportunities suffer.  There is a crying need for improvement in that area.  Our level of productivity up to 1977 was only about half of that of our partners in Europe, the countries we are exporting to.  Therefore, we must attend at work, work at work and stay at work.  That is a message that those who have any doubts should take to heart when talking in terms of employment.  It is all based on employment. If we do not do those things those who look to us for employment will find that they have been deprived of their <Col N="658" /> right by those who have the opportunity and do not take it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to public sector pay.  It is vitally important that we recognise that if we have a national understanding which, as I stated, was bought at an expensive price, the only way we can make that effective in our national interest, particularly in terms of employment, is to get industrial peace and productivity. There is also another factor in that it should mark the end of the claims that one can expect to face over the next 12 months.  Unfortunately, there are indications &mdash; it may be that it is time all Members stood together on this &mdash; that various special interest groups are queuing up with claims.  In one instance an award was made last year and we are aware that those involved are queuing up for a further award because of the consequences of an award made since then. It is time we all recognised that while we may have special groups in society the consequences of special awards can sometimes have a very general effect. One of the effects is that if people do not show restraint and responsibility those who are not yet at work, our young people, will be the ones who will pay the price for maintaining the relativities, even when people got what they asked for as late as last year.  That is of vital importance and it is a principle which must be recognised.  The Government and I are very seriously concerned about it at this point.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the plan which Deputy Desmond seems to think is absent.  Let me remind him of the problems we had. We did not even have a proper census. Some years ago £1 million was saved by not having a census taken.  That was the most expensive £1 million this country ever saved.  It is not just a question of counting heads.  We had to wait for some time until we got the whole basis that is necessary to prepare a plan for socioeconomic development.  I want to assure Deputy Desmond and the House that we have an investment plan for the economy for 1981 ready to be published within a matter of months as part of the continuing plan for the next few years.</P>
    <P>We differ from our colleagues on the <Col N="659" /> other side of the House.  When they were in Government they told us that, when things were tough, there was no point in planning.  We take the other view.  We have a very deliberate investment plan which will demonstrate the priorities I have indicated.  The Government can plan and can allocate responsibility but, in the final analysis, the real test is the manner in which the public react.  The manner in which this House will react will also be the test.</P>
    <P>If one thing only emerges from this debate I hope it will be that, from now on, when Deputies ask for more and more money day after day for current services, they will ask themselves are they really interested in the employment of our people?  The Government are, and we are determined to maintain our advance towards full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I make the remarks I have prepared I should like to deal with some of the things the Minister said.  I do not altogether disagree with many of the things he said.  The question of employment and unemployment is so important and such a central economic challenge, that it is above party politics. It is a national issue and a national challenge. Nobody does any service to the country by trading in human misery in trying to make it a party political issue. It is not our intention to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy Desmond spoke about the need for restraint and discipline.  The Minister also referred to the frequent requests for more money from all and sundry for all sorts of different projects.  Great expectations were raised by the famous or infamous or notorious manifesto of 1977.  That is the source of much of the evil today.  That is why there are so many demands for extra money for everything.  During that election campaign the Fianna Fáil Party told the people there was plenty of money for everything.  During the lifetime of all of us in this House today employment will be the central economic challenge facing us.  No other issue on the economic front parallels the challenge of job creation.  It is an exciting challenge which can be met, <Col N="660" /> given the right and persistent and consistent policies pursued by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the national understanding was bought at an expensive price.  What he did not say was that the Donegal by-election was bought at an expensive price.  He will not say that the next by-election, whether it is in north Tipperary or anywhere else, will be bought at an expensive price, and that the next general election will be bought at an expensive price.  The price to be paid is not to be counted in millions of pounds but thousands upon thousands of jobs lost.  If our unemployment figures are higher today than ever before, this is the payment for political promises.  Those promises are not being paid for in cash but in lost jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for discipline.  I remember the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, saying on our entry into the EMS that we would need rigid economic discipline, that we would have to settle for the German level of pay increases if we were to survive within the EMS.  The figure he mentioned was 5 per cent.  Within weeks the European election and the local elections were impending and he proposed an increase of 12 per cent which eventually became 15 per cent.  What sort of discipline is that?  What sort of example is that from the Government to the people from whom they are asking discipline?  Here the Minister is at it again.  The people will show discipline when they are given an example of discipline from this House, which they have not been given for the past three-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is higher today than it has even been before at this time of the year.  Never since the foundation of the State has the number of registered unemployed been higher at this time of the year than it is now.  Unfortunately, the figure is almost certain to go over 130,000 in January 1981.  That is a gloomy picture, but it is not the whole picture because it does not include the under-18s, those on short time and those over 65 years of age whom it used to include.</P>
    <P>Does that mean we must face the future gloomily with no prospects of full <Col N="661" /> employment?  I submit it does not.  I believe fervently that this exciting challenge of job creation can be met fully.  It is within our capacity as a nation to meet this challenge and overcome it.  It is an exciting fact that we have the youngest population in Europe.  The Minister said our population is increasing at seven times the rate at which it is increasing in Europe.  That means that in ten, 15 or 20 years' time the numbers available for work will be multiplied by that figure.</P>
    <P>That gives us an idea of how important it is to see the task of job creation as the central economic challenge facing us for the next generation at least.  Nothing should be allowed to inhibit the encouragement of economic growth. Although the Minister and Deputy Desmond did not come up with any proposals they referred to the need for good industrial relations.  The Minister invited all sides of the House to join with the Government in trying to solve this problem of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Labour will be speaking on industrial relations and it is more appropriate to his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael have, over the past two years, invited the Government to join all those responsible for industrial relations.  Our present industrial strife is avoidable; given the right infrastructure, the legal framework and the machinery we can have industrial peace.  Unless we get industrial peace we will not have the optimum atmosphere for job creation. We have published our proposals and invite the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and the Government to join with us in sponsoring the necessary reforms to bring about lasting industrial peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, we must look not only at our regime of incentives to job creation but at our regime of disincentives.  The Minister spoke at length of the percentage of GNP now being spent on job creation and doubtless the Minister's figures are correct.  Yet, we have growing unemployment. Why?  We are spending more and more on job creation but we are <Col N="662" /> losing jobs faster than we are creating them due to disincentives.  The IDA and SFADCo are going a good job in attracting industries but they would do better if we had industrial peace.  I hope they can increase the number of job approvals in the next years.  There are incentives, but we also have massive disincentives.  We tax employment for instance.  Every employer has to pay £13 per week in social insurance contributions for every employee.  Social insurance is necessary and it is the practice throughout the EEC and most advanced western counties to raise it in this way.  Some other countries have a higher employer's contribution. Because this is appropriate in other countries does not necessarily mean that it is appropriate here.  Because of our unique population structure it is not appropriate to tax employment in this manner and this system will have to be looked at with a view to eliminating or curtailing it.  This system is contradictory to the work of the IDA and SFADCo and to the employment incentive scheme introduced by the Coalition Government which is the most productive job creation scheme ever conceived by an Irish Government.  To do this will cost money, but it is not beyond the bounds of creative thinking to find alternative sources of revenue which will not inhibit employment, that will not cost money.  I would be foolish if I were to tell the Minister of State how to do so, so I will let him think if out for himself.  To continue taxing employment is inappropriate in our present circumstances and in the circumstances that will prevail for the next 25 years.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recent national understanding, my party greeted it with reservations.  We have more serious reservations about it now, hardly a month since it was agreed.  That agreement is spurious in parts and shows how unfortunate it is that national understandings are politicised.  The national understanding says that from the end of 1979 to the end of 1980 31,000 new jobs will be created. That figure was produced by the Government and accepted by the partners in the last six weeks.  At the same time it says job losses in the same period will be 24,000.  Therefore the net jobs <Col N="663" /> increase will be 7,000.  Unemployment should be down by 7,000 according to the national understanding, but the figure at 31 October 1980 for registered unemployed is 110,921 and for the corresponding month last year it was 82,892.  That is an increase of 28,000 although the national understanding says that there will be a decrease of 7,000.  That means that the Government's estimates are out by 35,000.  That cannot have been a mistake, just a month or two ago when the Government misled the trade unions, the employers and the country.  It means that the grounds for the national understanding are null and void.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the national understanding also said that an education White Paper would be produced on 14 November. That has passed and there is no White Paper.  The Government have reneged on two major commitments of the national understanding.  Their jobs estimate is out by 35,000.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate - Television Licence Fees</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Television licence fee increases are necessary because of the financial situation RTE find themselves in.  The station is currently facing a loss of something in the region of £600,000-£800,000 a month. This is a very serious situation and one that cannot be allowed to continue.  RTE were faced with two choices.  One was to cut back existing services and the other was to increase licence fees.  We on this side of the House would be totally opposed to any cut back or diminution of RTE services.  We would be anxious to give the station every encouragement and assistance to expand if possible.  It is a national service and it is important that the people involved in it are happy in their work and in the knowledge that there will be no cut backs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second choice was to increase fees <Col N="664" /> and that is what has occurred.  The Government consented to an 18.5 per cent, or £7, increase for a colour set and 17.5 per cent increase for a black and white set.  These increases are necessary and I admit that.  They are necessary because there are over 90,000 people who have unlicensed television sets.  Of that figure I understand that somewhere in the region of just under 70,000 of those sets are colour which is an indication that the people who purchase them are not that badly off.  The remaining 20,000 sets are black and white.</P>
    <P>The present cost of a colour television licence is £38 and if these 70,000 sets were licensed the revenue that would be brought in would be £2½ million.  That would be more than what will be brought in by the 18.5 per cent increase in licence fees.  The increase will bring in £2¼ million, although the Government say it will be £3 million.  There would be additional revenue if the remaining 20,000 black and white television sets were licensed as well.  The position is that either through negligence, apathy, laziness or a combination of all three, the Government have failed to take any effective action on this front and have failed to curb the situation.</P>
    <P>There are occasional efforts made by the Government, such as the TV spongers campaign, about once a year to try to bring in revenue but there should be a constant effort by them to ensure that everyone has a licence for his television set.  In many instances there are poor people who are paying licence fees and are subsidising well-off people who have not bothered to get a licence.  It is wrong and the Government should have taken action long ago.  An advertisement on TV states that people will be brought to court and if they are convicted for not having TV licences their names will be published in the newspapers.  I read a lot of local newspapers and I do not know when a person was brought to court for not having a licence.  The Government should conduct a campaign to ensure that people pay licence fees at all times.  It is vitally important.</P>
    <P>RTE have had to cut off some Irish programmes because of their financial <Col N="665" /> position.  These programmes were Irish made, enjoyable and involved many Irish actors, producers, technicians and so on. We are now faced with more imported canned programmes.  Some programmes that are at present on our national television service are of such a low standard that if they were put on in a hall, theatre or lounge bar in a country area they would have to close after a few nights if the proprietor had not the sense to recognise their poor quality.</P>
    <P>If the Government had taken the initiative in this regard and ensured that everybody paid his licence fee there would be many more programmes produced here.  There are many aspects of Irish life which are not presented on RTE because RTE are curtailed in what they can do.  We have some brilliant comedians and performers.  Many of our people are top class in their spheres.  It is only on an annual basis that we see many of them on television.  Some of them are Maureen Potter, Des Keogh, Rosaleen Lenihan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is something which the Government must tackle and the revenue must be made available for promotion of such programmes.  &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;, one of the finest programmes that I can remember seeing and was most enjoyable, was dropped from television some time ago.  It touched on many important social aspects of not just rural Irish life but all aspects of Irish life.  It incorporated many delicate matters and matters which people shied away from and it was an in-depth study of life in Ireland.  I am certain that the cost factor had a lot to do with the removal of this programme, but it was a mistake to remove it and this is evident when we see some of the programmes that replace it on the television service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have a major responsibility to ensure that the Authority have <Col N="666" /> the necessary financial resources so that our people who are involved in the broadcasting service, the theatre and many other such aspects of life in this country are given their opportunities of advancement. Because of the financial constraints in which RTE find themselves they are not going to be able to allow Irish programmes to be produced.</P>
    <P>The increases in the cost of licence fees could have been avoided if action had been taken in time by the Minister and his Department.  They should have taken that action a long time ago and unless it is taken in the not too distant future the situation is going to get worse.  A further danger in this matter is that many people who have always purchased their licences, in many cases with a certain amount of hardship, are going to find the payment of the licence fee so much greater a strain because of the extra £7. If they see approximately 90,000 people getting away without paying their licence fees will they not then say, &ldquo;A neighbour of mine has not paid his television licence fee for two years and I do not see why I should bother either&rdquo;?  People may be tempted in this way.  The Government on the one hand have not taken action to prevent people from escaping paying their licence fee and on the other hand by increasing the fees are making it much more difficult for people to pay the licence fee.</P>
    <P>I have been looking through an old file which I have in regard to RTE.  Going back to 1977 I see that RTE made a profit of something in the region of £1 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At different times licence fees have been increased, but in this instance the Minister and his Department have been aware that a sizeable number of people were not paying their licence fees and they should have taken action long before now to ensure that people would pay <Col N="667" /> those fees.  The Minister and his Department will have to look seriously at this whole question in the coming few weeks and they will have to come into this House and explain whether they have remedied the situation in regard to the payment of licence fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Enright in condemning the price increases and I ask the Minister if he can give us any explanation as to why it is absolutely necessary at a time when we have been told that there is going to be a serious curtailment in the number of programmes being produced by RTE and in the number of home-produced programmes. Surely this is a further restriction in the coverage by RTE not just of programmes in general but of the home-produced material in particular.  There has been a clamour from all types of associations, cultural and otherwise, in this country for the past number of years for an increase in the proportion of home programmes being shown on our national television service and the cuts announced recently mean a reduction in the amount being produced and also a general reduction in the number of hours of transmission by RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister why the system of collecting licence fees is not improved. There seems to be a peculiar arrangement between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who are the Minister's responsibility, and RTE, again the Minister's responsibility, neither of whom seems to be answerable to the other.  Why do the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have to collect the licence fees? Why can this duty not be given to RTE themselves, or otherwise why not make some alternative arrangement so that the <Col N="668" /> rate of licence fee collection can be improved?  I understand that at the moment some 800,000 homes in this country have television sets but the number of licences taken out annually is something like 630,000.  Therefore, there are something like 170,000 defaulters at the moment.  RTE would not have financial difficulties if this situation was improved.  If the number of non-licence holders was eliminated completely there would not be any financial problems at the moment.  The Minister might give serious consideration to the fact that the system by which the licence fees are collected is seriously wayward in some regards.  If RTE were given control over their own resources &mdash; and this would be one of their resources &mdash; matters could only improve.</P>
    <P>Another question being asked throughout the western half of the country is whether they are expected to continue to subsidise people in the eastern half of the country.  It seems unfair that people who have only RTE1 and RTE2 should have to pay the same licence fees as people who have a choice of five channels. The Minister might make reference to this.  Are we going to see a situation where the relaying of transmissions from the BBC and ITV are to be extended to include the other half of the country?  It seems most unfair that the eastern seaboard and the northern counties within the State have access to this reception from the North of Ireland or from Britain and that no provision is made to extend the service to include people in the western half of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea) Mark (Jnr.) Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to point out to Deputy Enright that the arrangement of day-to-day programmes is a matter for the RTE Authority.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has not got a statutory function in this respect, as members of Fine Gael are well aware.  I wonder if the purpose of Deputy Enright's recommendations in regard to programmes is to suggest a bigger increase in licence fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised the Opposition raised this matter on the Adjournment because, <Col N="669" /> looking back on the history of licence fee increases I find this attitude hard to reconcile with the performance of the Coalition. From the establishment of the television service on 31 December 1961 until 1973, three increases were authorised. In that period the fee was increased from £4 to £7.50.  Between October 1973 and April 1977, the Coalition reign, there were no fewer than four increases: the fee for a mono set, black and white, rose from £7.50 to £18.50.  A colour licence fee of £15 was introduced in October 1973 and was increased to £31 by April 1977.</P>
    <P>By contrast, the licence fee increase that will come into effect on 1 December next will be the first general increase authorised by this Government.  The increase sanctioned from 1 December 1978 was attributable solely to increased costs arising from the introduction of RTE 2 and flowed directly from the decision of the previous Government to establish a second television service.</P>
    <P>The increase announced recently is the first real increase attributable to the increased costs in the broadcasting service generally.  When we look at the figures on the Coalition days and today we must remember that today there are two television services and three radio services. Per day the cost of the licence fee to the public is 12p, in contrast to the price of one daily newspaper, 20p.  Among 12 countries in Europe we are in the lower half.  I would point out to Deputies Enright and Deasy that the cost of the TV licence per day is 3p cheaper than a bar of fruit and nut chocolate.  We can contrast that increase with the 50 per cent increase sanctioned by Deputy Enright's Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is 50 per cent in one go&mdash;£31 to £45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is from £38 to £45.  It is a pity that the Fine Gael spokesman on consumer affairs saw fit to come in here without knowledge of the most elementary facts in regard to the matter he chose to raise on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reports in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 16 November, <Col N="670" /> Deputy Enright, the spokesman on consumer affairs for Fine Gael, alleged that the Government have failed to tackle the problem of television licence evasion.  I should like to put on record the performance in this area.  In July 1977 there were 581,000 licences current and outstanding, including 140,000 colour licences.  At the end of October this year there were 630,000 licences current and outstanding of which almost 300,000, or 47.6 per cent, were colour licences, representing an overall increase of 8.4 per cent in the number of all licences and 14 per cent in the number of colour licences.</P>
    <P>In the newspaper reports to which I have referred, Fine Gael also attacked the proposed increase in the licence fee. I should point out that the increased revenue to be generated by this increase in fees will be substantially less than RTE sought in the current financial year.  The decision to allow the increase was taken after most careful consideration of the application.</P>
    <P>Returning to the spongers, this year two drives have been introduced to reduce the level of evasion.  In the campaign carried out in April and May almost 180,000 homes were visited and 37,000 unlicensed television sets were detected. The second campaign is in progress at the moment and the results so far indicate that it will be equally successful.  In the first week more than 8,000 unlicensed and incorrectly licenced sets were detected and almost 10,000 original licences were purchased.  We have set a target of 650,000 licences this year and it looks as if this will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright accused us of not having brought licence evaders to court. During the Donegal by-election summonses were issued in County Donegal against people with unlicensed sets&mdash;that happened the week before the election. Deputy Enright should not therefore be under any illusion about the seriousness of our attitude to spongers.  We will not tolerate evasion.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of our determination to reduce further the level of evasion, the development of a computerised system for television licence records is at an advanced stage.  When this system is <Col N="671" /> in operation it will streamline considerably the licence fee collection process, in regard to which Deputy Enright suggested there should be an alternative method.  House to house inspections, however, will continue to be an essential part of the process to get at determined licence fee evaders, and in this connection I want to pay a special tribute to the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who are engaged on this work, which at times can be thankless and unpleasant.</P>

The initial reduction of £1 a week operated for three months and was increased to £1.50 from April 1978.  The reduction of £1.50 continued until the introduction on 6 April 1979 of the pay-related social insurance system.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 250,000 persons benefited by the reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 and 302 together.</P>
      <P>A capital programme for the modernisation of prisons and places of detention has been in progress over most of the past decade and is likely to continue over much of the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It envisages a modernised central prison to accommodate about 400 at Mountjoy; modernised prisons, each to accommodate about 100, at Cork and at Arbour Hill; new custodial accommodation for 60 women at Wheatfield, County Dublin; new high security accommodation  <Col N="538" /> for 120 at Portlaoise, new places of detention for male juveniles at Wheatfield and Cork, to replace the existing Saint Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>Work on Mountjoy commenced in 1973.  New accommodation for unmarried staff has been built, new water and electricity installations provided, certain perimeter works done and work carried well forward on new units to cater for admissions and for visits.  The prison has to continue in operation while modernisation is in progress and work is likely to continue for several years to come.</P>
    <P>Work to transform the former Military Detention Barracks in Cork into a modern prison commenced in 1972 and is expected to be complete by 1982.  This prison has also to remain in operation while modernisation is in progress. Work, of the same nature as that in Cork, commenced on Arbour Hill in 1972 and should be complete in 1982.  The prison has been in operation since 1975.</P>
    <P>Site work commenced this year on the new high security prison in Portlaoise. Work on staff accommodation is about to commence.  Perimetering and service installations are planned to commence in 1981 and construction of the custodial buildings in 1982.</P>
    <P>Work on the new women's prison and on the place of detention for male juveniles at Wheatfield commenced in September 1980 and is expected to be complete by 1985.</P>
    <P>Design work on the place of detention for male juveniles in Cork is well advanced and site preparation work will commence shortly.  Work is expected to be complete by 1985.</P>
    <P>In addition to the projects outlined, Shanganagh Castle was acquired in 1968 as a place of open custody for about 50 male juveniles and has been fully developed by the provision of educational, occupational and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Loughan House was acquired in 1973 as a place of open custody for male juveniles over 16 years of age.  Although it now temporarily accommodates a younger age group of delinquent juveniles, pending the completion of a secure special school by the Department of <Col N="539" /> Education, development of the property&mdash;water, sewerage, heating, electricity, staff accommodation etc.&mdash;as an open place of custody for an older age group continues and is expected to be complete by 1982.</P>
    <P>Shelton Abbey near Arklow was also acquired in 1973 as an open place of custody for about 40 adult males.  A great deal of development still needs to be done to bring Shelton Abbey to its full potential.  Design work is in hand on water supply and sewerage.</P>
    <P>A new unit for the industrial training of about 100 selected and custodially reliable prisoners was commenced in 1971 at Glengarriff Parade, Dublin and began to operate in 1975.  An extension to expand its facilities is expected to be complete by 1982.</P>
    <P>In longer term, Limerick Prison and Portlaoise Prison need to be modernised, but the security requirements in both these places necessitate a deferment of the work.  Adjoining lands have been acquired in Limerick to enable modernisation to be undertaken in due course.</P>
    <P>Land has also been acquired this year at Hart's Corner, Phibsboro, Dublin, on which to locate a training centre for Prison Service personnel and houses for married staff, to replace staff houses fronting Mountjoy Prison, which are now beyond economic upkeep.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the reconstruction of existing custodial accommodation or on the construction of new accommodation is reckoned in the same way as expenditure on any other public sector building project and as far as I am aware the question of &ldquo;earmarking&rdquo; of funds cannot arise in advance of the annual estimates which require the approval, first of all, of the Government and then of this House. It is of course clear that approval by the Government of funds to commence a capital project implies an intention on their part to continue to approve of its funding to completion in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Purpose-built custodial accommodation is very costly to provide and can vary greatly according to size and the level of <Col N="540" /> security needed in a particular project. An approximate indication of cost is that it can range from between £75,000 to £150,000 per custodial place.  Apart from accommodation and security installations, outlay must cover the cost of services engineering, as well as the health, education, work-training, chaplaincy, catering, recreation etc. facilities.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to say what some projects will cost.</P>
    <P>Modernisation of existing accommodation costs considerably less than new purpose-built accommodation.  It is estimated that the cost of modernising Cork and Arbour Hill will, in each instance, be about £3,000,000.  The total cost of developing Loughan House as a place of open custody will be about £2 million and the total cost of the training unit in Glengarriff Parade just over £1 million.</P>
    <P>The detailed breakdown of expenditure sought by the Deputy could not be assembled in the time available but it is being compiled and will be communicated to the Deputy as soon as possible. The information already to hand is as follows:</P>
    <P>Capital and maintenance expenditure is not separated for the years 1970/71 to 1972/73 viz. 1970/71, £151,854; 1971/72, £337,857; 1972/73, £488,971.  Separate figures for capital expenditure are available for the subsequent years viz. 1973/74, £842,916; 1974, £1,287,073; 1975, £1,460,848; 1976, £857,191; 1977, £765,163; 1978, £1,920,145; 1979, £1,850,915; 1980, £3,900,000 (expected).</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of a visit by a garda to the chairperson of the National Flatdwellers' Association on 4 November 1977 and if he is aware that there were subsequent visits by the Garda to this person's flat and that on 10 August 1980 a further visit was made by members of the Garda to this person; whether this visit was made with the authorisation of the Commissioner and with his knowledge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that, as a matter of principle, I do not propose to disclose whether a particular visit or other action by members of the Garda Siochaéna was or was not carried out with the personal authorisation and knowledge of the Commissioner.  That is entirely an internal Garda matter and one which is in any event irrelevant in the context of the question.  Members of the Garda Síochána are authorised by virtue of their office to carry out a wide range of duties and functions without reference to their senior officers and do so in practice every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the substantive aspects of the question, I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 3 November 1977 members of the Garda Siochaéna searched a flat occupied by the chairperson of the National Flatdwellers Association on foot of a search warrant issued in accordance with law.  I am informed that the <Col N="542" /> Garda seized certain documents during the course of the search, and that later some difficulty arose about the return of the documents when the person concerned insisted on giving a receipt for them in a form that was not acceptable to the Garda Siochaéna.  This resulted in some further visits by the Garda to the flat.  When the person subsequently agreed to take the documents and give an itemised receipt for them they were returned to him.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that the person referred to made a formal complaint against members of the Garda who visited his flat in the course of routine inquiries on 10 August last.  This complaint has been investigated by the Garda authorities who say they are satisfied that the Garda members concerned did not exceed their authority in performing their duties as members of the Force on the occasion in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle underlying the whole system of income tax personal allowance is to graduate the tax by giving relief to broad categories of taxpayers.  Relief is in general given by a deduction of a fixed amount and not by reference to actual expenditure incurred in different cases. An example of this would be the child allowance, the amount of which does not purport to represent the cost of maintaining and educating the child.</P>
      <P>To give relief for educational expenses would be against this underlying principle and would generate demands for all sorts of claims arising out of personal or domestic circumstances of the taxpayer with very grave consequences as regards yield of tax and problems of administration.</P>

      <Col N="546" /> The Commissioners of Public Works could deal with flooding of the Flesk River only by means of a comprehensive scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, for the Laune catchment as a whole.  The Laune catchment is included in the priority list on which the national arterial drainage programme is based but it would not be possible at this stage to say when a drainage scheme for it might be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have no function in the matter of payment of compensation for damage caused by the flooding referred to.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give the information requested in the hypothetical case quoted in the first part of the question.  Precise information about a variety of personal circumstances of both parties would be necessary in actual cases in order to determine the eligibility of a retiring farmer for the benefits available under the Farmers' Retirement Scheme. For example, an upper limit of 45 adjusted acres normally applies under the scheme and intra-family transactions qualify for benefit only in certain limited circumstances.</P>
      <P>In regard to part (b) of the question, the income of a beneficiary under the Farmers' Retirement Scheme would be counted as means for the purpose of qualification for social welfare non-contributory pensions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the amount of social welfare  <Col N="564" /> non-contributory pension payable to any retired farmer under the Social Welfare Act, 1980, who has assigned 99 acres of a former holding of 100 acres, having a land valuation of £100, to a member of his family at least three years previously, having no other cash income in 1980 and having no legal property other than one acre of land in a rural area and a small dwelling having a valuation not exceeding £20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the income of the person concerned does not exceed £6 a week he would be entitled to a non-contributory old age pension at the maximum rate, which is at present £21 a week.  I should stress, however, that it is not possible to be certain of the position in a hypothetical case and that the amount of pension payable in any particular case can only be determined by decision of a local pension committee following a means assessment carried out by a social welfare officer.  I would suggest that if the Deputy has an actual case in mind the best course of action would be to get the person concerned to apply for a pension and have a formal decision given in his case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the weekly rates of social insurance contributions now in payment to the social insurance fund by employees and the amount of contribution deductible for income tax purposes, in the form of a reply to a parliamentary question of 4 April 1963.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A system of fully pay-related social insurance contributions came into operation on 6 April 1979.  Under this system contributions are calculated on a percentage of each employee's earnings from insurable employment up to a ceiling of £7,000 in an income tax year.  The earnings are those assessable to income tax, that is, gross earnings less allowable superannuation contributions, and liability for contributions arises on each individual payment of earnings to an employee.</P>
      <P>The standard rate of employee contribution which applies to the vast majority of insured persons is presently fixed at 4.5 per cent, which includes a 3.5 per cent social insurance contribution and a 1 per cent health contribution.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the PRSI system, direct income tax relief on the employee's social insurance contribution was discontinued.  However, to compensate for this situation, account has been taken of the extra income tax charge to an employee in calculating the employee's social insurance contribution and an appropriate reduction has been made in the rate of contribution.</P>

The period for the exercise of such options finally closed in September 1979 and consequently it is not now open to the county council to award a pension to his widow under the scheme.</P>
