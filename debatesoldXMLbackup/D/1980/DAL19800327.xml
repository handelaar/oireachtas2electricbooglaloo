      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from what the Taoiseach said last Tuesday that he would be making a short time available for a statement in this House about the assassination of Archbishop Romero in El Salvador.  I think that matter has been overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not say anything of that nature.  Of course I share the Deputy's horror at the assassination and I grieve with world leaders generally because it was a great tragedy but I did not have any plans to make a statement to the House on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely thought the House should put on record, as has been done in many world assemblies, the outrage felt in this country about this awful event.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the imminent appointment of further Ministers of State would the Taoiseach allay the anxieties and fears of the staff and students of the National College of Art and Design&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not raise this point.  I appreciate his concern but the Chair is only concerned with what is in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach gave an undertaking on Tuesday that if the budget was concluded he would make time available to discuss the Government's policy on Northern Ireland.  Has he considered the matter further or is there any significance in the fact that more Ministers are speaking on the budget?  Is this intended to prolong that debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Government are anxious that the debate on the budget should be concluded as early as possible.  Since the exchange in the House to which the Deputy referred took place, we have had an approach from the Labour Party Whip about the debate on foreign affairs generally and we propose to endeavour to facilitate the holding of such a debate.  One suggestion is that we might bring forward the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs to have a general debate on foreign affairs.  The matter is now being discussed between the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we discuss matters relating to Northern Ireland under the heading of Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no political significance in that.  I already explained it offers a suitable occasion for doing it. The Labour Party suggestion was for a <Col N="841" /> debate on foreign affairs generally and I suggested that occasion could be availed of if Deputies wished to discuss Northern Ireland affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Taoiseach what approach has been made by the Labour Party.  I am asking him if he will make time available for a discussion of the Government's policy on Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach explained the position adequately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, by agreement, I can make some comment on the announcement just made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such agreement, and there can be no debate on an announcement without prior agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is no prior agreement.  I understand Deputy FitzGerald's position in this matter.  I would have been very happy to have brief comments from the Leaders of the Opposition Parties on these appointments but unfortunately we were not able to come to an agreement for such a procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would like to make the position clear, in case he is put in the wrong light.  Announcements <Col N="843" /> are not subject to debate. Prior to 1947 announcements were not even necessarily made in the House.  At the request of one of my predecessors it was arranged that these announcements would be made for the purpose of the record, but without any debate because no Dáil agreement is necessary.  There is no motion before the House.  They come under the same heading as any other announcement to the House; they are not much different from the Ceann Comhairle announcing a Message from the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When the last announcements were made, while it was suggested there was not a precedent, eventually it was agreed statements could be made, and statements were made, thereby establishing a precedent.  I understood that to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair when that happened and I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would have taken the same line.  If there was agreement, the Chair would reluctantly have accepted it on the grounds that a precedent was not being established.  If we are going to have debate on every announcement we could have them frequently because announcements are made frequently in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach sought to have a departure from what has taken place before yesterday and I refuse to agree with the Taoiseach's proposal that the leader of Fine Gael and myself could speak for ten minutes and he would be given the right to reply for five minutes. That would have been a departure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently what is at stake here is not the rules of this House, not the rights of the Opposition, but the Taoiseach trying to nail down this House as he has every other Department over whom he has control.  He has no control over me or this party and we are not prepared to go along with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is not accommodating anybody.  The Chair is upholding what is the firmly established rule that has always been observed. I ask the Deputy to seat himself now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not observed a short few weeks ago.  There is no objection from this party if the Taoiseach wants to get up and speak for an hour or two hours to justify what he has done this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We insist on the right to be able to comment on what the Taoiseach has done.  Your interpretation of what is an announcement debars us from our rights and our responsibility in this House.  You have changed that from a statement to an announcement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion that precedent was established and I do not understand in what circumstances it is being disestablished now.  There was some argument about it at the time and finally agreement was reached that there should be comments from leaders of the Opposition.  I do not understand by what process the right thus established in this House is being extinguished or at whose insistence or why the precedent is being eliminated at this stage.  I protest against that because the matter was settled on that occasion, not without argument and a brief statement was made.  He did not speak for long, and there are no grounds for going back on it.  If the Taoiseach is anxious to speak on the subject, he has the opportunity to do so.  I see no difficulty about that.  Indeed, I thought he was going to say something about the appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is not concerned whether this is of convenience to the Taoiseach.  The last occasion was accepted exceptionally by the Chair and the Chair made it clear that it was not establishing a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall anything of the kind.  On the contrary, what was established was a precedent and the rights thus established should not be extinguished so lightly at anybody's insistence, even on a proposal of the Taoiseach.  If the Taoiseach wishes to speak on this, as the leader of the Labour Party has said, I am always willing to hear him.  We have established a right to comment on the appointments made and I would like to exercise that right briefly.  I would have exercised it with more brevity than the time taken up so far to oblige the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the anxiety of the Deputy that there was some question of an agreement, but as far as the Chair is concerned I have no notice of an agreement and I am compelled to adhere to the ruling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no agreement the Chair must follow precedent as <Col N="846" /> on the last occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>You made a ruling that there would be no debate.  I am not seeking a debate.  I am seeking the right to comment on the appointment of five Ministers of State.  Surely in a democratic parliament I have that right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the ruling of the Chair to be confused by people claiming to be deprived of democratic rights and so forth.  All Standing Orders are laid down and it is the duty of the Ceann Comhairle to interpret them as they have been interpreted. That is what the Chair is doing. There has never been nor was ever intended to be a debate on an announcement. Whenever the House agreed that there should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my position clear for the benefit particularly of Deputy FitzGerald in this matter.  I was anxious that the leaders of the Opposition <Col N="847" /> would have an opportunity to comment on this matter even though it is technically an announcement and might have been made outside the House. There is no compulsion on me to make this announcement in the House. Nevertheless, out of courtesy and in an endeavour to have all important announcements made in this House, which is my policy, I was hoping that I could make an announcement and have an agreement whereby the leaders of the Opposition parties would have been enabled to comment.  The proposal I put forward was agreed by the Fine Gael Party but Deputy Cluskey of the Labour Party refused to go along with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we had no option but to leave the matter to the Chair.  As far as we are concerned, we would be anxious that the Opposition parties would have an opportunity to make some brief comments on the appointments. The Opposition parties already had an opportunity to discuss this matter fully when this legislation was introduced.  Notwithstanding that, I recognise that the leaders of the Opposition parties might wish to comment briefly this morning and I would have prefered to go along with that if an arrangement could have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has quoted me.  I would have no objection if the Taoiseach were to take five hours in speaking on trying to justify the announcement or statement he has made here this morning in relation to the creation of five new Ministers.  He could spend all day.  I accepted that I would be restricted to ten minutes but I was not prepared to go along with the Taoiseach changing the rules to suit himself.  I know that he has done it elsewhere successfully with civil servants and other people who could not defend themselves.  I can defend myself and my parliamentary right. I can defend democracy, and I will.</P>

For my part, I would be happy to <Col N="849" /> concede that, but there is no agreement on it.  That being so, I do not feel that the Taoiseach would or should wish to use his request for the right of reply, and the failure to agree to that, as grounds for departing from the precedent set and agreed on the last occasion, which would give us the right of comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order, 1980,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 19 March, 1980.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that in 1977, when the Second Stage of the Worker Participation Bill was being moved in Dáil Éireann, the House was told that it was not possible at that time to determine, in advance, the sizes of the re-constituted State boards in question.  The view was that it would not be appropriate at that stage to prescribe board sizes in the Bill as it could limit the discretion of the Government Ministers concerned.  It was felt to be desirable and appropriate that the Ministers should have discretion in determining the size of the boards to take account of the appointments to the boards of members elected by employees. The solution adopted was to allow the new board sizes to be prescribed at a later stage by affirmative order.</P>
      <P>For that purpose Section 23 of the Act empowers the Minister for Labour, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and other appropriate Ministers, to prescribe by order&mdash;in relation to each of the State bodies designated in the Act&mdash;the number of members or directors of the reconstituted boards, including the number of employees to be appointed following an election by the workforce.  Where the total number is a multiple of three, elected representatives must constitute one third; otherwise the proportion of elected representatives must be rounded upwards to the number which is next above one third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of Section 4 (4) of the Act, a draft of any order to be made under Section 23 requires the prior approval of the Oireachtas by way of affirmative resolution of each House.  The intention <Col N="852" /> behind that provision was to ensure that there would be no diminution of the authority or responsibility of the Oireachtas in determining the appropriate size of the State boards concerned.</P>
    <P>The present order, which has been laid before the House in draft, is designed to comply with the requirements of section 23 of the Act, insofar as two of the seven State bodies are concerned&mdash;Aer Lingus and Córas Iompair Éireann.  The effect of the proposed order is that, as and from the date on which it is made, the size of the boards of these bodies will be fixed at twelve members, of which four&mdash;that is to say, one third of the total&mdash;will be elected by the workers for appointment under the Act.  This will standardise the increase in the board sizes of all designated bodies as a previous draft order was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in July 1978 in respect of the other five State companies.</P>
    <P>I have also included in the draft order provision for the similar alteration of the board of Aer Linte as required under Section 28 of the Act.  This section, which was incorporated into the Bill at Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann on 26 January 1977 stipulates that employees elected to the Aer Lingus Board are to be appointed to the Board of Aer Linte also.  This arrangement is necessary because even though Aer Lingus and Aer Linte are two separate legal entities, there is a long standing procedural arrangement whereby the boards of the two companies meet jointly and operate as one enterprise.  In effect, it provides that where, under Section 15, the Minister for Transport appoints a successful candidate to the board of Aer Lingus he must at the same time appoint that person to the board of Aer Linte.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be pleased to note that with the appointment of the successful candidates in Aer Lingus and CIE, following the forthcoming elections, the scheme will be fully implemented in all seven designated State bodies.</P>
    <P>I believe that the introduction of employee directors has brought some <Col N="853" /> positive elements into the operations of those companies where elections have already taken place.  Since directors have only been on the boards of the five companies where elections have already taken place for about a year on average, I would not, at this stage, risk general conclusions on the success of the experiment. So far, the indications I have are positive.</P>
    <P>In the first place, employee directors have had a favourable reception from their colleagues at all levels of the enterprise. Their intimate knowledge of the company's operations has, if anything, improved boardroom decision making. Communications upwards and downwards in the enterprises is being reassessed and there has been added stimulus to the development of sub-board consultative structures.  Also, the experiment has shown that inter-union co-operation can extend across craft and occupational barriers.</P>
    <P>These are tentative but positive results.  I am continuing to have the operation of the Act and its development monitored and have arranged, with the active co-operation of both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers, to have a report from the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions, in association with the Irish Productivity Centre, on the impact and effectiveness of the legislation.  The information gained from this project will be particularly useful in developing future policy in this area and extending the scope of the Act to other State bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I welcome this motion but I am deeply dissatisfied with the delay in bringing it before the House.  The Worker Participation Bill was passed in 1977 and it covers seven semi-State bodies five of which have had worker directors for some time but Aer Lingus and CIE have not.  I am distressed that things take so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to appear to be carping <Col N="854" /> but the question of worker participation is much more urgent than the sedate attitude of the Minister would suggest.  If we had wider worker participation there would be a significant diminution of industrial strife.  It is significant that in the countries of Europe where worker participation is at an advanced level the gross domestic product per worker is much greater than ours and the number of man-days lost due to industrial disruption are less than ours.  In 1976 the gross domestic product per worker for the Netherlands was $19,709; West Germany, $18,159; Sweden, $18,156; Norway, $17,496.  Then one comes to the two black sheep of industrial relations, UK and Ireland, UK, $8,972 and Ireland, $7,767.  The situation is completely reversed as regards work days lost due to strikes.  The average for the year 1976 to 1977 was Ireland 870 work days lost per 1,000 workers; UK, 704; Norway, 120; Netherlands, 96; West Germany, 30; Sweden, 18.  The evidence is clear.  We need to hasten worker participation and not just in State enterprises or at board level.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the development of sub-board consultative structures.  That is jargon to me. What we need apart from participation at board level especially in companies like CIE is participation at all levels in sections, garages, departments and regions.  Not only do we need it in State enterprises but also in private enterprise. We need it in public Departments and local authorities.  In the case of the latter two, it would have to be in a form that would be consistent with political democracy and control but that should not be impossible.</P>
    <P>Industrial democracy is called by different names in different places.  It is sometimes called co-determination, as in Germany.  Sometimes it is called worker participation.  In Fine Gael we would like to call it work place democracy to indicate our determination and strong belief that participation is not confined to industry but is the way of the future at all work places.  We should be hastening <Col N="855" /> fast towards industrial democracy.  By that I do not mean that we should rush into anything.  Our policy, which was approved a year ago this week at the Ard Fheis, is to set up as soon as possible after we come to power a worker participation agency to actively pursue the introduction of full worker participation in the four areas I mentioned&mdash;private enterprise, State enterprise, public service and local Government and health services.  There are different models of work place democracy in different countries. Different models suit different countries because of different economic structures and histories, for example, in the case of Germany compared to Sweden.  We would hope that the worker participation agency would create several different models of industrial democracy in each of the four sectors I mentioned on a pilot scheme basis so that after a reasonable length of time there could be informed discussion on the best form of work place democracy for us.</P>
    <P>Apart from the European statistics I quoted, the time for the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; mentality has passed.  That mentality pervades every work place and is at the root of our disastrous industrial relations record.  That is not something that has just cropped up since Deputy Fitzgerald took over that Department although it has been very bad in recent years.  We have been at the bottom of the league for too long.  That need not be.  One of the major components in changing it is by having advanced forms of worker democracy.  The &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; mentality needs to be broken.  Worker democracy is one way of breaking it and, depending on the form, it can completely eliminate it.  We do not want &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; but just &ldquo;us&rdquo; working together, as we call out industrial relations policy document just published.</P>
    <P>We want to get rid of the multi-status work places where the general operatives arrive at 8 a.m., the skilled workers at 8.30 a.m., the office girls at 9 a.m. and the bosses at 10 a.m.  They all go to different canteens and even different toilets. We want what we call single status work <Col N="856" /> places where all workers, whether they are in the board room or on the shop floor, work together.  We do not see why there should be any differentiation between pension rights or leave entitlement. In CIE and Aer Lingus there are different leave and pension entitlements, depending on the status of the worker.  Is it any wonder that we have such bad industrial relations?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to those problems and that suggests to me that enough thought was not given to those subjects.  I hope the reports published in today's newspapers that the Minister will publish his paper today on worker participation are true.  It has taken the Minister three years to prepare that paper.  Our paper on work place democracy was published one year ago. It is worth underlining that there is a great deal of resistance to industrial democracy at present.  I can understand that but I cannot see the ultimate wisdom of that resistance.  Some of the more enlightened employers have already advanced a long way down the road of work place democracy.  I am aware of one major concern in this city where there is an advanced form of work place democracy and worker participation. However, by and large there is a great deal of resistance among management. That is a crying shame and it flys in the face of the facts and statistics.  I do not think it is the only factor contributing to the higher domestic product per worker and the greater number of work days lost in Ireland compared with Great Britain but it is a major one.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem that the trade unions in reality are not very keen on worker democracy because they are a little afraid of it.  They do not know how to cope with it.  That is why we have proposed the establishment of a worker participation agency to help worker-directors and worker-participators at lower levels play a full and informed part in the enterprise of their employment. There will be a need for training, research and back-up facilities and we propose to provide those in such an agency.  There may be resistance to <Col N="857" /> worker democracy but it should be remembered that there was resistance to political democracy just 100 years ago. It has taken a century to achieve that political democracy and we must remember that there was great resistance to it.  At that time there was a lot of talk about the dangers of the masses having votes and now there will be a lot of talk about the unsuitability of workers having control or a say in the operations of their place of employment.  If we are to be a progressive and free society we have got to move as fast as possible so that labour has a parity of influence with capital in the work place.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Government's White Paper, even if it is not issued today, but I believe the time for talking has come to an end.  There has been a lot of talk but no action on many fronts.  We want action in the area of work-place democracy, in the area of improving job prospects, job satisfaction and in the human fulfilment of our people at work. That is the only way we are going to bring about a meaningful and lasting labour peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to welcome this Bill on worker participation.  It is essential in substantial semi-State bodies such as CIE and Aer Lingus that employees, who number almost 23,000 should have an important input and involvement in the decision-making processes of those boards.  I have a personal interest in the Bill because, prior to my election to this House, I spent 25 years in the service of CIE.  As an employee of that concern I can assure the House that the provisions of the Bill are long overdue.  Deputy Mitchell felt they were overdue since 1977 but in my view they are overdue for the last 20 years.  Through lack of a proper national transport policy or plan the effectiveness of any CIE proposals did not account for much because of the lack of worker participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the workings of CIE over the years and give my opinion on the areas where the company fell <Col N="858" /> down.  The Minister did not mention anything about sub-boards in CIE, but consultative committees at area and district level have been in operation in the company for many years.  At such committee meetings workers were involved with middle management in group discussions on matters relevant to their work place, their way of living and improving the system.  Fruitful discussions took place but, unfortunately, such committees did not have much power.  The introduction of worker participation will create a better atmosphere and improve the industrial situation in the board's concern.  Staff have been very patient down through the years with the inactivity, indecision, lack of concern for their future and the many hit-and-miss alleged transport policies submitted to Government who allegedly attempted to take up the challenge of providing a transport service second to none in Europe.</P>
    <P>As a CIE man I should like to express concern on behalf of my former colleagues about one aspect of the makeup of CIE boards throughout the years.  I and my colleagues in CIE for many years had to endure the presence of political nominees on that board, many of them with no interest whatever in the development of our national transport system, although they were supposed to be representing the interests of the workers, the taxpayers, the community at large.  Indeed, many of them engaged in enterprises running contrary to their position on the board of CIE.</P>
    <P>This order will be effective in CIE only if the Government realise the urgent need to introduce a transport plan.  If there is not a determination to provide a proper transport plan for the eighties this order will have very little effect on the viability of our transport service.  CIE workers have always been concerned at the failure of successive Governments to produce a proper policy on national transport.  Nowadays we have an energy crisis, a crisis which will not go away tomorrow, to add to the problem.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly worker participation on these boards will improve the boards and <Col N="859" /> their relations with workers and the public generally.  Until now workers had been on the outside looking in.  Now they will have a say in management and as far as CIE are concerned their experience in regard to transport generally should make a big contribution.  I am looking forward to their involvement.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday night, when the Government were accused in the House of reneging on a proper policy in respect of CIE, a Deputy from the Government benches pointed out that CIE got a subsidy of £56 million last year.  I do not think that is sufficient.  I appreciate that money is scarce but unless the Government are prepared to adopt a plan for substantial national investment this undertaking cannot be viable.</P>
    <P>With worker participation we can look forward to a better industrial climate in CIE.  Workers as well as the general public for years have been concerned about the many industrial disputes there at a time when worker participation at board level could have contributed to harmony.  Top level decisions were being made without consultation with the workers, who found it impossible to endure such a situation.  I hope that this new system will mean that CIE workers can look forward to a sound future for themselves and their families instead of being the brickbats and the football of the public in the matter of redundancies and industrial disputes.  In the past when there were talks of lay-offs it was always the platelayer on the line and the porter in the goods store who suffered.  I look forward to better industrial relations from now on.</P>

      <P>The legislation under which this order is being made was introduced to give worker participation or democracy to State enterprises.  It has been operating for a couple of years and it is time we had a look at its effects. When the legislation was going through I was not entirely happy that this was the best way to achieve democracy in industry because I thought there was an element of lip service being paid to the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> It is easy to elect people on boards, but in modern enterprises boards can be very remote from the executive, the people responsible for day to day decision making.  We hoped that by worker participation we would get better industrial relations, but on examining the record I do not think we have achieved that to date.  Greater participation by workers is a step forward.  I know this is confined to State enterprises because we have control over such enterprises, but even at that level we are not doing enough.  What has happened in relation to worker participation at shop floor level other than the election by the workers of a number of people to the board?  The nature of the boardroom can isolate those elected from the workers unless there is some feedback from the board to the workforce.  In the absence of such a feedback of information the whole concept of worker participation will disappear. Lines of communication must be developed from the workforce to executive and board level.  Most of our problems have been due to a breakdown in communications and the almost total absence of dialogue.</P>
    <P>We must not think that this measure will cure all our industrial problems.  We must inject money into the area of industrial relations in order to improve the climate and to provide the necessary aids for those involved in negotiations.  The Department can play a very positive role in aiding trade unions in the development of the concept of worker participation. Industry today is getting larger, multinational companies proliferate and State enterprises are expanding.  The worker tends to lose his sense of identity and he must be given the feeling that he is participating in an industry and is not just a number or a cog in a wheel.  He must be given a sense of dignity.</P>
    <P>While it is laudable to provide for the election of workers to the board, we are not being altogether sincere in our approach. It is an easy way to convince ourselves that we are doing something positive, but the problem of industrial relations is far too serious for such self-indulgence. The Department of Labour <Col N="861" /> should apply themselves to the task of getting workers involved and should also ensure that management are trained to respond to workers.  When negotiations take place between workers and management it often seems that they are entirely separate entities who are completely divorced from one another, even though both sides are working for the same enterprise and should have a common interest in furthering its activities.  To hear them talk across the table one would swear they were bitter enemies.  This is a sad feature of industrial relations and we must try to break down the barriers. Management must be responsive to the needs of workers who must be given responsibility and not looked upon as disposable units of production.</P>
    <P>It is that attitude which creates suspicion. Management, particularly personnel management, is a buffer in the whole area of industrial relations.  It should basically be on the side of the worker because then we would be getting a response from the worker through personnel to the executive and the board. But in many cases the board is not aware of what is happening on the shop floor.  So we have workers on the shop floor who are involved in the industry. They can be involved in some part of the State and there may be disputes going on in some other areas which he, as a worker, is not fully aware of because the lines of communication are not good.  If he is not aware of it, the fact that he is sitting on the board is not much use because in many cases personnel are covering up problems instead of letting them come to the surface earlier so that they can be dealt with.  Is that the role of personnel management?  Personnel officers seem to be obsessed with the idea that it is.  I believe that as a country with no great industrial hang-ups we should adopt a much more enlightened approach in the whole area of worker participation, but we do not because there is an attitude in middle management that the worker should be kept in his place, that middle management know exactly how to control the affairs of the country and that really the worker would not <Col N="862" /> know very much about that so that he should not be consulted or allowed to participate.  It is all right to put him on a board, he will not have much say there at the end of the day about what happens because most of the decisions relating to day-to-day operations are made at middle management level.  The board does not know about them until the trouble is caused.</P>

      <P>With respect, I would hope that there is middle management and personnel management in those companies.  There are times when one would wonder if there is because there is so much trouble in them.  I am not referring to individual companies because if one mentions CIE, for example, one could go on for a day about the problems and the lack of worker participation. The fact that they are planting a couple of guys at board level in such a vast company is of no use unless we get at the nitty-gritty of worker participation because that is what we are talking about.  We are talking about worker participation.</P>

      <P>My concern is to keep within the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping within the argument.  We can talk about CIE. We all know the track record of CIE. But is this going to solve any of the problems in CIE?  I do not think it is. The Minister can be asked what is he doing and he can say that he did this or that he did that.  That is fine so far as it goes but as long as we fail to grasp the nettle we will have problems.  As I said before, putting workers on boards is like starting to build a house at the roof; that is not the way most people start to build. That is why I do not think this is the way to approach this problem.  I know it has gone on; it was the Coalition Government that brought it in and I am not scoring political points one way or another here because the matter is far too serious for that.  But it has given me an opportunity to put a point of view across the House.  I have put this point of view before.  I am not satisfied that this is enough and I will continue to say that it is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must, if we are serious, give workers an opportunity to participate in their company.  We hear a lot of talk about responsibility to shareholders and about capital and so on.  But one must consider that an employee is giving the best years of his life, his skills, to that company and why should he not have rights at all levels to ensure that his interests and the interests of the company are looked after, because all these interests are interwoven.  There seems to be an impression that there are lots of pigeon holes and a lot of different entities doing their own thing and building their own walls and having their own attitude to the company.  But that is not what worker participation is about.  It starts at the floor and it goes right up to the board and the lines of communication should be open so that when problems arise and there is discontent, at whatever level, there is a line of communication right through and no buffer, like a personnel department, trying to keep it back so that it will not erupt, because it will <Col N="864" /> erupt eventually and then there will be strikes.  I am not against what the Minister is doing.  I am just putting my point of view across.  We must take this whole area of industrial relations seriously.  When can we look forward to the day when workers will have a share in private industry, a share in wherever they are employed?  It is only when we start evolving across the board a scheme of worker participation that we will come to grips with the whole question of industrial relations.  This is the basic reason this motion was introduced&mdash;to endeavour to see what could be done in order to give workers a stake.  At the time we felt that, unless we gave workers responsibility there would be much more industrial strife.  However, that was one aspect of it only.  This problem is not being followed through and, unless this is done, there will be a continuance of the turmoil in industrial relations, particularly that experienced last year, something of which none of us, as legislators, can be proud.</P>
    <P>Neither are there any short cuts to success.  My party brought out a comprehensive document on industrial relations. We should like to see some response from the Minister and the Government in this whole area, to see just how serious they are in coming to grips with a problem that has been allowed to continue since they came into office.  There has been exhortation on television but that is useless without a positive blueprint for a policy of worker participation.  Mere exhortation with no formula for success will not work.  These are the types of cosmetic exercises to which I am totally opposed, that workers will see through and will reject.</P>

      <P>I shall conclude by saying that I accept the order before us this morning but I am disappointed that nothing has emanated from the Government in the whole area of worker participation. We have had promise after promise since 1977 but no action taken. The earlier we have some response from the Minister and his Department the better. Otherwise we will drift into another period of industrial unrest.  Indeed this motion will not at all solve the problems in the two companies we are talking about.  The Minister should catch on to himself, get on with the job, bring in the appropriate formula to deal with this problem, and, if he does not, he knows what to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and acceptance of the order.  In regard to the reference, I think it was, by Deputy Mitchell to the time lapse between the introduction of the Bill and the introduction of this order, as I explained in the Seanad yesterday, I have maintained close liaison with both companies since 1977 in order to assess the prospects of arranging the elections. When I brought in the order in 1978 I should like to have included the other five companies, bringing the whole seven together.  But of course that was not possible because, when that order was made in 1978&mdash;fixing at 12 the board sizes of Bord na Móna, the B and I, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, the ESB and NET&mdash;I found that consultations between management and unions had not <Col N="867" /> reached the stage, in Aer Lingus and CIE, at which decisions on board sizes could be appropriately made.  I am of the opinion that it is now opportune and desirable that elections under the Acts should be held in these two companies.  I should say that in Aer Lingus a worker participation study group, which had been formed by the trade unions, had lapsed in the period since 1978 as a result of industrial unrest.  The study group has been re-convened for some months now and is preparing proposals on participation structures appropriate to below-board levels.  I agree entirely with those who said that structures below-board level are important.  Indeed Deputy J. Ryan emphasised that and I agree with him.</P>
      <P>Obviously, because of the short time it has been in operation in the five other bodies to which I have referred, while we cannot yet be positive of the beneficial effects of the board representation&mdash;because of myself and my Department keeping in touch with the situation there in addition to the study being carried out by the IPC on behalf of the foundation and to which I referred in my opening statement&mdash;indications are that there is greater anxiety to set up the sub-board structures and to improve communications.  Indeed Deputy Mitchell referred to a statement of mine in regard to communications as being jargon.  That indicated to me his lack of appreciation of the most essential and important thing in all of this area, which is good communications.  Unfortunately, they are not always good enough in Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might deal now with a few points raised.  There was for example the agency idea raised by Deputy Mitchell. Perhaps I should refer first to the newspaper report he referred to and confirm that I am laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas today the discussion document on worker participation, which of course was one of the commitments in our manifesto of 1977 and part of the Government's commitment in the national understanding of last year.  My hope is that this discussion document, <Col N="868" /> setting out many options, will stimulate worthwhile discussion and awareness not alone within both sides of industry but also among the public at large and that they will take an interest, will discuss it and make submissions.  In that way I believe this will be a major development and improvement in the whole industrial relations scene.</P>
    <P>This order I am making today merely enables me, as envisaged in the 1977 Act, to set up the boards of the two State companies to which I have referred.  It will mean that when their elections have been held the seven State boards named in that Act will be able to have the elections over.  An average of about a year, as I said, is the existence of worker directors on the other five State bodies.  I am not prevented from extending further within the State area but it is desirable and probably realistic to have proper examination of the experience within those seven bodies before a final decision is taken as to what is the best way, whether there is room for improvement or in what other shape this idea may be extended.</P>
    <P>Preliminary examinations have been made in the five State bodies where the system operates.  It is obviously a very early stage as the first year would probably be the year when all sides are learning and, when new departures are being introduced, that year can be the slowest year.  I should compliment the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who have made backup services and training for State board directors available.  I look forward to attending a seminar in the not-too-distant future involving some of those people.</P>
    <P>I referred to the agency idea put forward.  I referred to the discussion document.  I am establishing a Worker Participation Advisory Committee composed of representatives of ICTU and the FUE and other experts.  The committee will report to me on the best way of advancing worker participation.  Very useful work has been done in this sphere. At times the lack of knowledge among Deputies in this respect amazes me when <Col N="869" /> they suggest that nothing is being done. Obviously, they do not familiarise themselves with what is happening.  This is true particularly as regards Deputy O'Brien's contribution.  I am surprised that a Deputy who appears to express interest in the subject is not aware of the many things going on.  Very useful work has been done in this area by labour management service of the Irish Productivity Centre to whom I have previously paid tribute.  They have now five specialists available to advise companies about participation assistance such as work councils, works organisations and so on.  This is an ongoing process and it is performing very commendable work.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Deputy Ryan on the need for the sub-board structures to which he referred.  I said this when in opposition when my predecessor introduced the 1977 measure.  As I indicated this morning, I think there is greater awareness because of the presence of directors on the boards&mdash;I realise it is sometimes a long way from the boardroom to the shop floor&mdash;that there is room for middle management involvement structures.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. Deputy O'Brien did not appear to keep on the rails entirely and perhaps I should briefly, with the permission of the Chair, make a few points on some of what he said.  On the eve of the Ard Fheis, presumably, it is understandable that he would want to make a little play because his spokesman would be getting publicity over the weekend.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan did roam to some extent which would entitle me to reply to him. Basically I wish to thank Deputies for their support.  This is only a step enabling elections to be held in those two bodies.  If it improves communications and if it encourages and develops structures at various levels of management.  I think it will be seen as a step in the right direction.  However, I might agree with Deputies who have said that much remains to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the mass hysteria and euphoria associated with the introduction of the budget has receded the people have had an opportunity to look in a cool and calculated way at the implications of the budget.  It <Col N="871" /> is the universal opinion that they are now totally disenchanted and disillusioned with the budget.  As it was the first budget of the eighties people were justified in expecting that something new and original would emerge, something that would motivate people, particularly young people and galvanise them into action especially after the great build-up to the budget with meetings of a consistorial nature at Barrettstown Castle. People waited with bated breath for this great, monumental document, the first budget of the eighties.  They were totally disappointed.  The budget was noted for its mediocrity, with the Minister for Finance doing nothing more imaginative than falling back on the old reliables, petrol and tobacco, to get the extra finance needed.</P>
      <P>To me it seems that the dead hand of the manifesto dominates the budget, although there are attempts at present by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to distance themselves from that manifesto.  Deputy O'Donoghue and the Tánaiste have stated in the House that the same political and economic philosophy of the manifesto that brought them into power still holds sway and was the basis for this budget.  This budget has led us nowhere.  It is totally inadequate to meet the pressures and solve the problems of the eighties.  There is nothing in it for the youth and there is nothing to encourage employment in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to be generous to the Minister.  Social welfare recipients came out quite well as a result of this budget. Most payments have been increased by 25 per cent.  With inflation and prices rising to perhaps 22 per cent, in real terms they may be better off by 3 per cent at the end of the year.  Of course they needed this new increase to compensate for the many price increases they were subjected to in the past.  They were shell shocked and numbed by the daily rises and by the many mini-budgets which were introduced virtually daily since the beginning of the year and immediately prior to the budget.  We have been told that telephone and postal charges will also be increased in the immediate <Col N="872" /> future.  Therefore, I have no doubt the benefits of these generous increases will be eaten into by inflation and rising costs and by the end of the year these people may not be very much better off.  Still, we must recognise the Minister's good intentions in this regard.  This is the only aspect of the budget I find pleasing.</P>
    <P>A few points dealing with social welfare payments have been brought to my attention over the last few years. Irish citizens who worked in America and decided to retire to Ireland and who are in receipt of social security from the US, are not eligible for the ESB allowance or free television licence. These people feel they are being isolated. The Minister might look into this matter because there cannot be too many people involved.  As a gesture of goodwill he might extend this very worthwhile scheme to them.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly was brought to my attention recently.  An Irishman married here, went to England, got a divorce but his wife did not know anything about it. He died and she was told of his death. She applied for a widow's contributory pension but was told that as she was not a widow she was not entitled to a widow's pension.  In my view a great injustice was done to this lady, especially as our Constitution does not recognise divorce.  This is another area the Minister could look into and, exceptionally, grant widows' contributory pensions to such women.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme is operated by certain local authorities but, in my opinion, it should be operated by all local authorities.  A necessitous person irrespective of where he or she lives needs help.  The present voucher of £1.50 is totally inadequate and should be increased.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss disability benefit.  I know a gentleman who has been in receipt of a disability benefit for at least 11½ years.  After a year or two on this benefit, such a person should be automatically entitled to an invalidity pension.  This would help to cut down the workload in the Department.  At the moment <Col N="873" /> this man has to submit a monthly certificate to the Department, taking up the time of the doctor and the civil servants. When it is obvious a person will never work again, having furnished adequate medical evidence to the Department, that person should be given an invalidity pension.  This would cut a lot of unnecessary work and bring more efficiency into a very hard pressed Department.</P>
    <P>All Deputies know people drawing unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance who are offered temporary work but are afraid to accept it because it might upset their claims.  They know from experience it will take them a long time to get back into full benefit.  As a result, they refuse this temporary work. If the system were simplified and geared to encourage recipients of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance to take up temporary work. there would not be so many calls on the Department and that would substantially reduce the number of unemployed.  The Minister could give time and attention to that point also.</P>
    <P>Deputies receive complaints from people in receipt of supplementary social welfare allowances.  From time to time they have to visit social welfare officers in Victorian offices and have to divulge their private and personal affairs in public.  Proper facilities should be available so that these people can discuss their personal affairs with the social welfare officers in private.  This is another area the Minister might look into.</P>
    <P>The Simon Community are not receiving the benefits to which they are entitled. They are charged the same electricity rates as guesthouses and hotels. This is unfair.  The Department do not appear to appreciate the great work the Simon Community are doing for unfortunate people.  Every help should be given to help reduce costs.  This would be one simple way the Department could alleviate hardship and allow badly needed funds to be put to better use.</P>
    <P>When local authorities are compiling <Col N="874" /> their housing lists no recognition is given to single elderly men and women.  In Tipperary town we have the sad case of four or five single, aged, homeless men, sleeping rough.  This section of people should be put high on a list of priorities and it should be mandatory on local authorities to make a certain amount of houses available for a proportion of these unfortunate people.  At no great cost to the State the Minister could look profitably at those five or six suggestions and I hope that he will, perhaps in the financial statement or at some future date, introduce legislation to comply with some of these suggestions.</P>
    <P>I come to the section dealing with PAYE.  On a first reading it would appear that the budget had been more than kind to the PAYE sector but on reflection and reading the small print we find that the single person, the self-employed, the housewife and the married man on a salary of £7,000 or less come out less well in this budget.  As time elapses and people have the opportunity to study the small print, it will be found that the income split was a bonanza to the double income family who did come quite well out of the budget.  However, most Irish households are in the lower income bracket from £7,000 per annum down and when the figures are worked out it appears that if they are any better off as a result of the PAYE improvement it is only minimally.  This has been brought home to the PAYE workers.  It must be obvious from the figures the Minister quoted in his budget speech that last year he got £732 million in income tax and this year he hopes to raise £977 million, an increase of 33.5 per cent or £245 million.  Anyone must know that the money must come from somewhere and that the impression that the PAYE sector are getting off lightly is completely illusory and false.  The Minister has worked a sleight-of-hand as regards that sector.  Of course, he had to make a virtue of necessity and he did respond to the tramp of marching feet around Government Buildings but the end result is that the poor PAYE worker has to subsidise the rich.</P>
    <P>These improvements will help to make <Col N="875" /> deeper the division between urban and rural Ireland.  Unfortunately, in the recent past the PAYE worker has been turning against the farming community. It is unfortunate that both sections cannot see that they are complementary to each other, and the Government have not been helpful in this regard.  They have played off one section against the other with the result that there is this deep division between the urbanite and the farmer living in rural Ireland.  As a result of this division between industry and farming, attention has been drawn away from the crucial issues and time and energy are taken up in this useless difference between the PAYE worker and the farmers.  As time progresses the PAYE workers especially will see that this budget has not been the bonanza they were led to expect and that they will be no better off materially, particularly those people under £7,000 per annum, than they were last year, especially when we take into account the expected 22.5 per cent inflation and the increases and the mini-budgets which no doubt will appear between this and the next official budget in 1981.</P>
    <P>I seek in vain through the pages of the Minister's statement a commitment to the youth of Ireland.  Great lip-service has been given to our youth.  Undoubtedly they are the greatest asset we have. At the moment approximately 1,000,000 Irish youths are under the age of 18 and half our population are under the age of 25.  That is a frightening thought, but from a positive point of view these people are our greatest asset, with the enthusiasm, drive and energy that our youth can put into our country and its economy, provided they are handled properly and adequate provision is made in the budget to meet the needs of this huge mass.  Unfortunately, I see no commitment at all in the budget to meeting the problems that this huge number of Irish youth will create even in the short term, let alone the long term.  What should have been central to any budget in view of that great number of Irish youth is a policy for job creation, but we learned that in the Department of <Col N="876" /> Labour there has been a savage cutback in the employment maintenance scheme which was so popular.  In 1979, £8 million was allotted to it and this year that has been reduced by more than half to £3.5 million.  The work experience programme faces a cut-back of £1 million.  Last year the amount given to that scheme was £2.8 million, this year it is £1.8 million.  The National Hire Agency allocation improved from £200,000 to £500,000, but in the grant-in-aid for the youth and sport organisations there has been a reduction.  This shows the utter hypocrisy of the Taoiseach and the Government when they speak of their commitment to youth.  By their deeds you shall know them.  When they have an opportunity to live up to their promises to do something for the youth of Ireland through the budget they cut back savagely on schemes that were there primarily to help the youth to gain employment experience and to get them jobs.</P>
    <P>I need not mention the crisis facing us in education, especially in relation to the voluntary secondary schools.  We are told that this autumn a number of these schools will be faced with closure because it is utterly impossible to continue to give the level of services at the miserable pittance in today's terms that they are receiving from the Department of Education.  There are approximately 500 such schools catering for 180,000 youths.  With the pressure for new schools, for rooms and positions, unless this question of education is tackled seriously by the Minister we will have a crisis not in the long term but in the immediate short term in the teaching of numbers of our youth.</P>
    <P>When we look through the Minister's statement for some commitment to art and culture again we are disappointed bitterly.  It is regrettable that after 60 years of self-government it must be stated that Irish cultural institutions have seen remarkably few additions and we are living still with institutions designed in the 19th century when cultural needs were more modest and Dublin was a provincial centre.  It is quite staggering <Col N="877" /> that not a single major building has been added to our cultural institutions&mdash;the National Gallery and its fine extension has been the sole exception&mdash;nor are there any publicly announced plans to meet the needs of any of these bodies. The pessimistic conclusion must be that not only are these buildings now inadequate in condition, in scale, in accommodation and in exhibition space and staffing, but that there is no evidence that the State is even aware of the extent of these deficiencies or has any plans to reduce them even in the long run.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the absence of new buildings, the absence of official thinking and planning for future needs in the cultural sector is more staggering.  It is a self-damning indictment of official negligence under past Governments. Above all else, the appalling performance of the Department of Education in the cultural field is painfully evident. To this day, arts and culture still play a peripheral role rather than commanding a more central position in the school curriculum.</P>
    <P>This neglect of our artistic and cultural heritage is an affront to the youth of Ireland and can no longer be tolerated.  Three generations of Irish youth have left our schools artistically and culturally retarded.  The sad findings of the 1961 report by the Scandinavian Design Group, <i>Design in Ireland</i>, that the Irish schoolchild is visually and artistically among the most undereducated in Europe are as true today as when published 20 years ago.  What an appalling indictment of our educational system and 60 years of independence.</P>
    <P>What is now urgently needed is a searching examination by the Department of Education of their role in cultural affairs and a deep commitment towards rectifying, even at this late stage, the injustices perpetrated on our unsuspecting youth.  This commitment must be backed by adequate financing to ensure provision for training of specialist teachers in arts and crafts, for in-service training of primary teachers, for proper <Col N="878" /> facilities in schools and for the purchase of art materials and so on, together with a host of consequential changes.  In view of the pending pressure on education financing in 1980 it is absolutely vital that the status of the arts is not once more placed in a peripheral or subsidiary position.  All, however, is not doom and gloom and it would be highly remiss of me on this occasion if I did not mention the role that the Arts Council have been playing.  It is encouraging to note that in this year's Estimates the Arts Council have got a rather substantial increase in funding.  The Arts Council have played a magnificent role since their institution in 1951.  They have continually, in my estimation, pricked the cultural conscience of the Irish people and their efforts at long last seem to be bearing fruit.  I particularly welcome the recent announcement by the Department of Finance&mdash;although there seems to be some misunderstanding about it and I should be glad if the position were clarified here in the House&mdash;that under the Income Tax Act of 1967 a giving of money is eligible for tax relief when applied towards activities approved by the Arts Council.  I sincerely hope that businesses and private individuals would avail of this facility to help the council and encourage them to sponsor our talented youth in whatever cultural activities they wish to pursue.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael have a cultural policy and are committed to creating a stimulating environment for the promotion of a healthy artistic and cultural climate.  We believe that in the youth of Ireland we have a great reservoir of latent talent waiting to be tapped and that, with proper advice, guidance and financing, with proper direction and encouragement, Irish artists can once again stride Colossus-like across the cultural scene as their predecessors did in the literary fields at the beginning of this century.</P>
    <P>The recent finding of the chalice at Derrynaflann, or Killenaule, or, as <i>Time</i> magazine calls it, the Tipperary Chalice draws attention once more to the plight of our National Museum.  With conditions <Col N="879" /> there already reaching crisis proportions it is unbelievable in this year, in the knowledge of the various reports of the Board of Visitors, that in the Estimates there has been a massive cut-back of 15½ per cent.  It must be very obvious that the Government are writing off this national cultural asset and that the demise of a museum must now be in sight.</P>
    <P>The National Museum has been so much in the news in recent weeks that too much comment here might be superfluous. It is at once the most neglected of all the cultural institutions and one where the provision of an adequate building will at today's prices unfortunately be the most expensive.  The last two decades have witnessed a remarkable development of museums everywhere in Ireland and, indeed, on the Continent, the erection of additional major national institutions, the creation of new or more specialised museums and a revolution in display technique.  The National Museum has, unfortunately, fallen continuously behind.  The gap now between the actual and the attainable is truly vast.  In fact, the National Museum is unique in Europe among museum institutions. It is the only one whose floor space, staffing and visitor attendance have all fallen off over the decades.  On all scores, it is now much worse than it was in the twenties.  The responsibility of the Oireachtas is peculiarly involved because it got some of its accommodation in the twenties from the Oireachtas. Even the addition of some 10,000 feet of rented accommodation for office and exhibition usage in a new office block will not bring it back to the position before the twenties.</P>
    <P>Its staffing is inadequate and below former levels.  It is deficient in conservation staff; and the insufficiency of laboratory space and staff is alarming, relating to a bygone age rather than the needs of a living and growing institution which our National Museum should be. The building is out-dated for exhibition purposes.  Apart from the reported dry rot and dampness there is evidence of further deterioration in the building.  The <Col N="880" /> offside storage space suffers from the same deficiencies so that not only is the museum inadequate but the survival of non-exhibited items is at risk.</P>
    <P>The neglect of the museum has been so total and so little has been done to meet its needs that a major reappraisal is now urgent.  I support a recent claim for a public inquiry because nothing less than that will help to resolve its many difficulties.  This appraisal will have to be carried out in the knowledge that the provision of adequate museum facilities is not cheap.  A long-term solution will be moderately costly, approximate to that of a middle-sized hospital.  The museum needs more staff and conservation facilities.  This needs to be spelt out.  Accommodation is a complex issue.  The museum, as the institution confined to major collections of great artistic, cultural and monetary value, needs a new building on another site or the retention of the existing building combined with another building containing both substantial exhibition space and office and laboratory accommodation.</P>

      <P>The report makes dismal reading.  It indicates the Government's total lack of commitment and concern for this great national institution.  As I wish to comply, as I have always done, with the wishes of the Chair, I urge the Minister to do something while there is still time to preserve the museum.</P>
      <P>The magnificient finds at Derrynaflann or Killenaule, County Tipperary, highlights the need for another look at the National Monuments Act, 1930, which was amended in 1954.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Minister for Finance indicated that he hopes to introduce towards the end of the year a new National Monuments Act.  I assure him that he will get every co-operation to ensure that the new Act will safeguard our national monuments. There is a danger that with the enthusiasm engendered by the recent finds some over-enthusiastic and amateur archaeologist will go prospecting in the hope of finding treasures similar to those found recently. The Minister by way of announcements on television and radio should instruct people as to the rights of landowners and the exact legal position in regard to these monuments so that they will not be vandalised.</P>
      <P>The recent &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; exhibition in London was an outstanding success.  I commend all who were responsible for putting on this fine display. It has done a lot to dispel the unhappy image the British people have of Ireland in view of the tragic circumstances in the North.  It allayed doubts and showed that we are not all barbarians.  We can be justifiably proud of that fine exhibition.  It would be impossible to put on the full exhibition in Ireland but a lot of good would come if some sections of it could be put on display in Belfast and in Dublin.  We have more in common than we have in difference with the people in the North.  Our cultural and artistic ties would be a meeting point for the two communities.  I urge the Minister to think seriously about running portion of it in Dublin and Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to learn from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is hoped to negotiate cultural relation treaties with more countries.  At present we have them with only two countries. France and Norway.  I was surprised to learn from the Minister that he intends in the near future to negotiate further <Col N="883" /> treaties with European countries, especially members of the EEC and particularly Germany.</P>
    <P>The Wood Quay issue was disastrously handled by the Government. That site is of immense importance in the study of urbanisation in western Europe. It presented a unique opportunity for the Irish people to learn about the development of out capital city from its earliest beginning.  To destroy it before systematic excavation took place was to rob all Irish people of an irreplaceable part of their culture and heritage.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the time limit was further extended to enable more excavation to be carried out but the whole issue is a sad reflection of our regard for our heritage and past.  If new legislation is to be introduced concerning national monuments adequate provision should be made to ensure that such areas are not handled imcompetently in future with a great loss to our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>The Newgrange sites, although off the beaten track, have attracted numerous visitors and few will deny that their preservation and restoration have been a valuable contribution to our cultural heritage.  They have provided an added attraction for our tourist industry.  How much more valuable would the proper excavation of Wood Quay have been? Would Georgian Dublin have been pulled down and the city emptied of residents to make way for monstrous office blocks?  We should call a halt and declare that the Wood Quay site must not go.  Are we not entitled to one beautiful vista, the view of the cathedral above the river, and could we not have preserved Wood Quay as a source of national pride and satisfaction?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget does not do anything for tourism.  There is no doubt that as a result of the British budget yesterday we have lost our ability to attract British tourists to Ireland.  The unnecessary and massive increases in the cost of petrol, drink and cigarettes will not make this country more attractive.  It had been hoped that this year we would gain £314 million from tourism but I do not believe we will reach that figure.  It was hoped that tourism would increase by 7 per cent but in view of the increase in the price of petrol that figure will be reduced to 5 per cent.  We are in competition with countries such as Spain which enjoy a sunnier climate and as a result we must give incentives to tourists to come here. Tourists compare the price of certain items before deciding to travel abroad. British tourists will be aware that they will have to pay £1.50 a gallon for petrol compared with £1.32 in their country; 61p for a pint of beer compared with 46p; £8.20 for a bottle of Scotch whisky compared with £5.70 in the UK.  The difference in the price of cigarettes is to our <Col N="885" /> advantage in that 20 cigarettes in the UK cost 74p while in Ireland they cost 67p.  We must remember that many people depend on the tourist industry for a living and a lot of school-leavers find temporary employment in that industry. If we want to maintain the work force in that industry we must investigate the possibility of giving tourists a petrol subsidy. On the point of entry into the country tourists should be given coupons to subsidise the cost of petrol.  A lot of money has been ploughed into the development of hotels and the improvement of guest house accommodation, mainly in rural areas, over the years.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the top nine inches of our soil is our most valuable asset, much more valuable than the minerals that may be found deeper, or the oil off our coasts.  However, in this budget the Minister for Finance has been totally insensitive to the plight of our farmers, particularly by the introduction of the resource tax for which there cannot be the slightest justification.  The Minister has referred to equity and the PAYE workers.  By all means extend equity to one sector, but why impose such an unjust tax on the farming community.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister is aware of the attitude of the two farming organisations to the resource tax as well as to the multiplicity of other levies and taxes since Fianna Fáil came into office.  On top of that the Government abolished subsidies on food, cheese, artificial manure and lime.  In the manifesto, that ill fated document which Fianna Fáil are afraid to hear about, farmers were given a commitment that the notional system of taxation would be retained, and in complete defiance of that undertaking the notional system has been suspended.</P>
    <P>In Tipperary South Riding 1,125 farmers will be liable to pay the resource tax and 2,612 farmers will be introduced to taxation.  The resource tax is being based on the PLV system which generally has been accepted to be totally inequitable and which is more than a century old.  Even the payment of rates <Col N="886" /> based on that system is accepted to be inequitable.</P>
    <P>Irish farmers are being assailed inside and outside the country, at home by these further levies and in Europe by the super levy on milk surpluses, by a reduction in the beet sugar quota and the suspension of beef intervention from April to August.  This comes at a time when the farmer never needed confidence more.  I have been speaking to them since the budget was introduced and I know many of them were seriously contemplating getting out of farming, particularly those engaged in dairying. They feel that their contribution to the Exchequer is not appreciated.  They are being lampooned and victimised in order to give a sop to the PAYE people.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a rural constituency and he must know that 1979 was a disastrous year for Irish agriculture.  In real terms farmers' losses were about 28 per cent.  This year there is a proposal in Europe to give them an increase of 2.4 per cent when they are seeking 7.9 per cent as an absolute minimum.  It is doubtful if they will get more than the 2.4 per cent at a time when inflation is rising to a rate of 22 per cent and when the inputs into farming are increasing in cost.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I urge the Minister to have another look at the resource tax and to avoid the oncoming, standing confrontation with the farming communities with consequent loss of time and energy in what would be but a futile confrontation with the Minister for Finance.  I hope he will do everything possible to avoid such a confrontation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1980 budget must be judged differently from all previous budgets.  Circumstances and general conditions in the country have changed. and the Government have changed. They are a Government elected with the biggest majority in our history who came to office committed to curb inflation and unemployment, to abolish car tax and rates on private houses and to give a subvention to the first-time buyers <Col N="887" /> of new houses.  The Government are composed of a party who did not acknowledge that there was a world economic recession between 1974 and 1977.  They flatly rejected that the inflation in those years was due to external factors, dearer oil and dearer imported raw materials.  During their two-and-a-half years in office they have not attempted to deliver the promises of the 1977 manifesto.</P>
      <P>Food subsidies on basic food items such as bread, cheese and butter, which were introduced by the Coalition in order to reduce the cost of living for the lower paid and the less well off in our society, were withdrawn.  The ESB bill in 1977 was £46; in 1980, before the proposed 10 per cent increase announced in this morning's newspapers, it is £174.  If this is the Government's idea of curbing inflation I do not know what to say.</P>
      <P>The price of an average three bedroomed semi-detached house rose from £11,000 to £22,000, an increase of £11,000.  Consequently it is outside the reach of any young married couple. What good is the £1,000 new house grant?  Surely it should be at least £3,000 to keep up with inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More and more farmers were brought into the tax net.  On a principle of taxation equity, this would have been acceptable to farmers; it would have been in accordance with the manifesto.  But there is discrimination regarding capital taxation, with capital allowances restricted to 30 per cent against 100 per cent in other sectors.  In relation to capital acquisitions tax the amount claimable was raised from £100,000 to £150,000 although land values have increased by 400 per cent since the main threshold relating to the family farm was introduced.  The Minister has refused to revise the threshold in line with the consumer price index.  To sum up the budget in relation to farmers, they now have a number of taxes&mdash;income tax, resource tax, rates on land.  They also have increased tax on petrol, 20p a gallon plus VAT making an increase of 22p a gallon on petrol and 5p a gallon on diesel.  Tax on petrol will not <Col N="888" /> be a conservation measure because it will not suppress consumption.  On the contrary it will add to the costs of manufacturing industry, of the transport industry and of agriculture generally. Manufacturers and hauliers will pass on the increased cost to their customers thereby adding their little bit to inflation. But the farmer will be called upon to absorb the extra cost unless Brussels give a similar price increase.  The first ever budget proposals by any Government which failed to be implemented because the injustice of the proposals and provoked such public outrage that the Government had to abandon it was the 2 per cent levy on farm output.</P>
    <P>We see already the cost of the election manifesto regarding the building of local authority houses, the upkeep of our roads, the provision of services and so on.  The increases in the cost of building materials, road material, fuel and oil over the past 12 months have been in the region of 25 per cent.  How the Government propose to build houses and roads and maintain services with a 10 per cent increase over last years' figures is beyond comprehension.  What is comprehensible is that fewer local authority houses will be built, that our roads will be in a bigger mess than ever and that there are fears of mass unemployment among local authority employees.  Can the Minister give any guarantee that the essential services run by local authorities will be maintained even at the low level they are at present?  It appears that the present Government will leave a legacy of bad roads and bad houses to the next Government, which will be Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>In the normal way people who think they have been overcharged for goods can go to Priceline offices throughout the country and make an official complaint. In relation to CIE this is more difficult. There is however one avenue open to dissatisfied CIE passengers.  Under the Consumer Information Act the Director of Consumer Affairs is obliged to ensure that the public get accurate and true descriptions in advertisements. CIE's advertisements give the impression that one can travel in comfort and <Col N="889" /> in safety.  My experience would prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murray, the Director of Consumer Affairs, should check out the accuracy of the CIE advertising campaign. On 18 March I travelled by train to Dublin from the west.  The train was crowded and there were 64 passengers in the compartment in which I travelled. There was no heating whatsoever and some of the windows were in such poor condition that they could not be closed, although it was a bitterly cold day.  I felt sorry for the ticket checkers who were subjected to so many complaints from passengers.  The treatment of the general public by CIE is nothing short of an insult, particularly in the west.  The incident I describe is not an isolated case.  In mid-February I had occasion to travel by train to the west and conditions were somewhat similar.  Again the train was crowded and the passengers complained of the cold.  Only two of the four lights in the compartment were operating and passengers were unable to read.  These conditions are disgraceful.  Why is it that such trains operate in the west?  Those in use in the south are a little better.</P>
    <P>This is a dreadful budget.  Again there are to be increases in postal and telephone charges.  The service in the west is very poor and it is almost impossible to get through by telephone to any part of Ireland.  Even local calls are difficult.  The postal service is abysmal and it can take as long as six days for a letter from Roscommon to reach the village of Tulsk.</P>

      <P>In the dying days of the budget debate we have an opportunity to review the details of the budget in an objective fashion away from the heady days of tension and excitement in the House.  We also have an opportunity to look at the Book of Estimates and see the Government's intentions for the various Departments during 1980.  This debate also provides an opportunity to look at the economy and the performance of the Government since they assumed office in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> Trying to give an objective opinion of all these factors, I am driven to the conclusion that this is a dishonest budget.  It fails to tackle the basic problems of our economy and does nothing whatever to stimulate the growth needed to provide jobs for young people or to deal with the problem of rising prices.  It fails to take measures to tackle the problem caused by the fact that we are living beyond our means.  There were heady promises in the 1977 manifesto under all these headings and these were repeated by the new Taoiseach in the few public statements he has made since he assumed that office.  I looked forward to this budget on the basis that the mistakes of the past few years would be set aside and there would be a new approach to solving the problems of our economy, but the budget has failed to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>There were promises in the manifesto about reducing State borrowing but these promises, like so many more in the manifesto, have not been kept.  The result is that year by year we have taken on debts of hundreds of millions, mortgaging the future of the country to be repaid by future generations.  The national debt had risen by 31 December 1979 to a figure in the region of £6,500 million and this does not reflect the full picture, despite the enormous increase of over 50 per cent since this Government assumed office.  One must also bear in mind that, in addition to the national debt, a huge sum is owed by the local authorities, a sum of the order of £1,120 million. Furthermore there is an unquantifiable or unquantified figure which is related to the capitalised sum to pay the inflationproof pensions of the public service. Despite a request to the Minister for Finance, I have not been able to get the exact figure.  These commitments must be met and many people feel they must be taken into account in assessing the true picture.  Finally, there is the huge debt of the semi-State bodies, which is not included in the figures.  We are faced with the fact that borrowing has been increased to an alarming degree and that the budget, while doing nothing to reduce the rate of borrowing, will in the <Col N="891" /> current year add at least £1,000 million to the existing figures.  Nobody interested in the future of the nation can look with equanimity on such housekeeping.</P>
    <P>There have been cuts in the Estimates in a number of areas but there has not been an honest attempt to streamline our national finances and assess the major item of current expenditure, that is, the payment of the public service, which accounts for approximately 50 per cent of the entire current budget.  The Government should have the political courage to tackle this problem and consider whether we are getting full value for money.  Is productivity in the public service increasing? Are the people who are doing such excellent work being let down by a number who are not pulling their weight?  We must look at the biggest figure in the account.</P>
    <P>No attempt whatever has been made to do this or to make any suggestions as to how this figure might be streamlined. In fact it is fair to comment that the much trumpeted employment efforts of this administration since 1977 have been devoted largely to adding on a further load to the public service, thousands of extra people, without, as far as I can see, any clear assessment of the benefit of so doing to our economy, forgetting altogether the fact that a job created in one year in a non-productive sector in such a situation, will involve the State in paying the salary of that person for the rest of their working life and their inflation-proof pension thereafter.  I make the positive and constructive suggestion that in future this Government must take a hard look at this whole sector.  Indeed the efforts made to add to that problem rather than streamline it do no credit to this Government.</P>
    <P>What are the other main factors concerning people about our economy? There is no doubt in my mind that the problem of rising prices is one that constantly affects our people, particularly those on fixed incomes, those in the lower-income bracket.  Many of these people were affected by the promises of this administration made prior to the 1977 General Election.  They believed <Col N="892" /> what they were told.  They felt the glossy manifesto produced contained the answer to that problem and in their substantial numbers, created very largely on such promises, they voted this Government into office.</P>
    <P>The House may recall the impact of the programme outlined in that manifesto which was to lead to a reduction in prices in 1977 of 1 per cent, in 1978 of 2 per cent and in 1979 of a further 2 per cent.  What is the reality? As a result of the policies of the Coalition Government inflation was down to around 6 per cent in 1977.  Let me be honest and say that some contribution was made to that reduction by the budgetary measures of 1977.  But, by and large, the effort to reduce the figure to 6 per cent in 1977 was almost totally the result of the policies of the last Government.</P>
    <P>Therefore, looking at the problem objectively, I suggest that this is the base line.  How can one view Government performance on prices in that context?  I have to say that their performance can be termed only as disastrous; each week, almost each day, there are different price increases, and the result is that, even prior to the budget, we were back to double figure inflation, 15 per cent to 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>What would one expect from a Government introducing a budget, a Government supposedly committed to the concept of slowing down the rate of inflation?  One would expect a budget that would make some effort towards reducing that appalling figure.  What do we find?  We find certain proposals in the formal budget presented in this House. Outside that formal budget, in announcements made by different State and semi-State bodies, a series of price increases and a series of proposals in the budget unfortunately&mdash;and I take no pleasure in saying this&mdash;will result in a huge inflation rate here this year.  There are disputes among economic experts as to what exactly will be the figure.  I do not pretend to being an economic expert&mdash;I do not intend to enter into that dispute&mdash;but, even on the Government's <Col N="893" /> own admission, this figure is now predicted at being over 20 per cent.  The Leader of our Party feels that unfortunately it will be somewhat higher.  How can any Government face the people of this country and introduce a budget which will have the effect, not of reducing the rate of inflation or of slowing down the rate of price increases but rather of increasing them to such an extent?  Have they any conception of the burden this places on our people?  Have they forgotten so much their contact with the ordinary people so as not to realise what this will mean to every household?  On that score&mdash;and again I take no pleasure in saying so&mdash;this budget is a total failure.</P>
    <P>Next one must look at what is perhaps an even greater problem facing the country, that of unemployment.  Again, looking back, there were the promises of the reduction in the figures involved, the commitment to a programme, the impact of which would constitute a reduction in unemployment figures in 1977 of 5,000, in 1978 of 20,000, in 1979 of 25,000 and, in 1980 of 30,000.  How could anyone interested in the future of this nation not vote for such a programme?  Yet disillusionment has now set in, as it is quite clear that the Government have neither the will nor ability to deliver on that particularly important commitment. One might have expected that a budget would have provided substantial ground to enable that problem to be tackled, or even halt tackled.  This budget does nothing of the kind.  In fact the estimates of moneys for youth employment programmes, work experience programmes and so on will do the very reverse.  Unfortunately we are faced now with unemployment which may&mdash;I hope not&mdash;run into six figures before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I suppose the other major worry people had in regard to their personal situations&mdash;and highlighted by the protests and marches&mdash;was that of their difficulties in regard to PAYE tax.  While we must remember that, as Members of the Dáil, we are included in that sector and I suppose should have greater sympathy, <Col N="894" /> I have no doubt, particularly in the lower paid bracket, these people had a very serious grievance.  We had the Supreme Court decision which forced certain actions on the Government.  We anticipated that there would be a major alleviation of the lot of those people, particularly the lower paid, in the PAYE bracket.</P>
    <P>What is the result of the budget? Changes were made that clearly can only be termed cosmetic because the net result is that anybody earning less than £8,000 will, in fact, overall pay more tax in 1980.  How can a Government pretend to have any social philosophy if that is their solution to the problem particularly bearing in mind that people in the £15,000&mdash;£25,000 bracket will gain from this budget?  The tax benefits they get will outweigh the increases, in normal terms, in indirect taxation on personal expenditure.  Surely, while in cherishing all citizens of the State equally we cannot discount people earning £25,000 a year, the major concern of the Government if there are to be reliefs should be that they must be distributed in the lower brackets and thereafter the middle brackets.</P>
    <P>These are some of the major grounds on which I term this budget to be a failure and even term it to be a dishonest budget because of the hope and promise held out to all of us that these serious problems would be effectively tackled.</P>
    <P>One can assess the budget in the context of the efforts we make in different sectors.  I am particularly mindful of its effect on the farming population.  The position of our farmers up to relatively recently was one of having to contend with the cheap food policy of the United Kingdom.  Because of our entry to the EEC, because of the sterling efforts of the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, there was a degree of confidence aroused in the agricultural community which was unprecedented.  In my own area, and I am sure members of the House can vouch for it in their respective areas, form the amount of development taking place not only on the agricultural level but in looking after <Col N="895" /> the wives, giving them a share of the benefits and improvements in houses, it was quite clear the farmers felt that they could face the future with confidence, invest in that future, improve their land, put up buildings, put down concrete and generally plan for the future.  This confidence has been largely shattered in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that this Government should hold the farmers in such low esteem and give the agricultural sector such low priority.  Do they not realise the benefit to this nation of a prosperous and confident agricultural community?  Do they not even see for themselves the huge benefits brought to our balance of payments, the huge exports contributed by the agricultural community?  The Government's efforts seem to be almost deliberately designed to shatter that confidence with the result that we now have an agricultural sector starved of finance for development, paying enormous interest rates on whatever moneys they borrow in the past for development purposes and threatened from week to week and from year to year with a different series of levies and taxes almost all of which are totally unrelated to their income.</P>
    <P>That is the real inequity and injustice of these measures.  The Government approach has contributed to a shattering of the confidence of our farmers and has resulted in a situation where I believe there will be a considerable slow down, if not a full stop, in agricultural development. I do not say farmers should pay no tax&mdash;that would not be an honest approach. I believe farmers should pay a fair share of tax like everybody else but I certainly object to measures which will result in farmers paying levies and taxes totally unrelated to their income.  If there is justice and equity in taxation measures surely we must look at the basis on which other sectors of the population pay tax.  Generally, taxes are based on income&mdash;the more you earn the more you pay.  That is generally a fair system. If one accepts that as the manner in which taxes should generally be paid, as the basis for taxation, how can one <Col N="896" /> justify taxes which bear no relation to income? How can one justify the various levies imposed by the present Government? Are they afraid or unable or unwilling to produce a fair tax system? Apart from the 2 per cent levy last year we had a series of other levies so that farmers told me that there were, I think, five levies being taken out of their creamery cheques.  Many of these are very small farmers with valuations of approximately £8 or £9 whom in any situation I could not see as being liable to income tax because their incomes would not bring them anywhere near the tax bracket.  The Government are totally misguided in their approach.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister is not aware of the levies that were imposed. I will tell him what happened to some of the levies and he can pick out what he is interested in.  The artificial manure subsidy, the lime transport subsidy and the beef cattle incentive scheme were abolished.  The 2 per cent levy, the levy for disease eradication, the dairy inspection levy and the CBF levy were introduced. Is that enough or does the Minister want more?</P>

      <P>If the Minister is unaware of these facts he should go back to his own area and ask his constituents.  I have seen these cheques with these reductions.  The Minister need not try to cod me, the House, or the country about what this Government have done to our farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider, to the extent that he has influence in the party, the damage being done not just to the farmers but to the economy by the shattering of the farming community's confidence since this Government came into office, compounded by the weakness of this Government's approach in Europe.  The result is that any farmer who could face the future with confidence when Deputy Clinton was Minister for Agriculture now does not know if he will even be able to meet his bills in the year ahead. That sector has to be looked at and the performance of the Government in this area has to be assessed.</P>
      <P>Another matter unrelated to that sector but which has to be considered of major importance is this Government's record in industrial relations.  We all know the damage that can be caused to our economy when there is industrial strife.  Open promises were held out to the people that there would be dramatic changes and that Fianna Fáil would virtually remove industrial strife.  What has been the record of this Government? Since they came into office there has been an increase of 200 per cent in the number of man-days lost owing to industrial disputes.  The figures for 1977 were 442,145 man-hours lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>From what document is the Deputy quoting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from a document I prepared based on the details given in reply to a parliamentary question.  In 1978, 624,266 man-hours were lost.  If that was not bad enough, the figures for 1979 were 1,427,000. That is the barometer of Fianna Fáil's <Col N="898" /> performance in the area of industrial relations since they assumed office in 1977, despite a promise in their infamous manifesto to show special concern that good relations would exist between workers and employers and for the attainment and maintenance of industrial harmony.  It is quite clear that in that very important area the Government strategy has been a total disaster, one that puts this country at the very bottom of the European league, or, unfortunately, in the context in which they prepare these figures, at the very top.</P>
      <P>One would have expected that this budget would have given the Government an opportunity to improve the situation.  Do the Government expect an improvement in industrial relations when, because of a combination of increases in indirect taxation and income tax concessions, there has been a reduction in the standard of living of those earning under £8,000 a year?  I genuinely believe that this type of strategy will not make any contribution to industrial harmoney.</P>
      <P>There is one other very special area that concerns me and that is the commitment of this Government to provide aid for the Third World.  In a time of financial constraint it is very easy for us as a nation to take the easy way out and to say that the people in Lesotho, the Sudan or Tanzania will not have much impact on electoral results here and if our development programmes have to be cut back there will not be much reaction. This does not show a Christian concern and I believe that in the national interest it is ill-advised.</P>
      <P>As a result of cut-backs in foreign aid our development programmes to the Third World have been substantially affected and our credibility in developing nations has been severely affected.  What is even worse, the commitment given by this Government when they supported the United Nations resolution and the resolution of the EEC Council of Ministers has been reneged on.  This Government are doing a severe disservice to this country by putting the knife into foreign aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> What are the facts?  There were some increases under the heading of official development but the Government can claim no credit for them.  They were obligatory as a result of our membership of certain international bodies&mdash;the United Nations, the EEC, the completion of the Lomé Agreement and membership of the World Bank.  What is the performance of the Government in regard to non-obligatory payments?  A cut of 38 per cent.  I do not know that my arguments against the Government would convince them to reverse what I think is an appalling stand on this issue.  Perhaps worse than the cuts under this heading is the fact that the previous commitments of the Government&mdash;this Governement and the last Government&mdash;have been reneged on.</P>
    <P>The efforts to reach the international commitment of .7 per cent of GNP on a planned basis which had been started by Deputy FitzGerald when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;and which, in fairness, had been followed up by Deputy O'Kennedy when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;are now gone, and this is the worst aspect of the Government's foreign policy in this area at the moment.  This was made clear in the Dáil by the present Minister in reply to a question by me on Tuesday last when he indicated that he, and presumably the Government, were reverting to the 1973 policy of paying as our resources permit.  That was the policy prior to 1973 which resulted in a level of foreign aid of pitiful dimensions. The Minister may look at me and say &ldquo;So what?  We will get by with that.&rdquo;  If that is the Minister's attitude, obviously he is unaware of the real problem, nor is he aware of the recommendations of the Brandt Commission and of the evidence which was adduced by that commission which shows that it is in the interests of this nation and of all developing nations of the world to pursue a policy of aid towards the developing world.</P>
    <P>In that situation the Minister would be unaware of the fact that, for instance, between 1973 and 1977, in the <Col N="900" /> developed world five million jobs were created because of exports to Third World countries which came about through foreign aid.  Obviously that type of statistic is not known to the Minister even in relation to our own country.  If we have to talk about self-interest and the benefits which we derive in promoting foreign aid, there are the evidence and arguments which prove that apart from the moral aspect, which should be the main one.  We believe as a Christian nation, in that context, it is in our interest in developing our economy to do what we can by way of development aid.  The result of the cut-backs would be a total loss of credibility.  It would mean a cutback in the plans for development in the four main countries of concentration.  Our name was good in the Third World as that of a non-colonial power and of a nation which threw off the yoke of colonialism and forced its independence thereby giving rise to a feeling of sympathy and understanding in those nations which were in a similar situation.  But as a result of the cut-backs that good name is now damaged, and unless the Minister and this Government are prepared to reestablish the name originally established by Deputy FitzGerald and developed by Deputy O'Kennedy when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, this nation will suffer in its own economy.  Whatever one's motivation, it is clear that business does result from foreign aid contacts. This Government are very short-sighted if they do not realise that it is on that basis they must assess the situation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in examining this budget one has to accept that it is a totally dishonest one.  It is totally in keeping with the performance of this administration since they assumed office in 1977 on foot of the manifesto which made so many promises which have resulted in so many shattered dreams.  I do not propose to bore the House with the litany of broken promises, but it is important that we remember them for reasons which I will explain hereafter. When we remember the promises about the abolition of ground rents and matters <Col N="901" /> of a similar nature, it is not just the fact that the promises have not been kept that is the real difficulty.  When one holds out hope and promise to a people one is fuelling the process of cynicism and disillusionment when those promises are not kept.  That is happening inexorably in this country in the present day.  There is the realisation among the people that they were conned in 1977.</P>
    <P>As I am an Opposition spokesman one would expect the natural reaction on my part to be &ldquo;Well, tough luck on Fianna Fáil, they got found out, they got caught&rdquo;.  However, that is not my prime reaction to this situation.  Democracy is a fragile institution.  When people become disillusioned and cynical, inevitably their thoughts turn to alternatives to the democratic system.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have done irreparable damage to that situation in this country because of the disillusionment and cynicism so widespread throughout the country today resulting from their nonperformance in office and from their broken promises.  That is the real danger and my real concern is that this administration do not even realise that. Their concern, presumably, is concentrated on cosmetic changes here and there in an effort to lay the groundwork for a further electoral victory, not seeing further than their noses.  It is clear that the people of this nation will not fall again for that kind of approach.  Behind it all there is the whole question of honesty in politics and the results of dishonesty. A Government who are so short-sighted and have so little vision that they do not appreciate that, are in danger of doing irreparable damage to this nation and to the democratic institutions in which we in this House believe. This is a totally dishonest budget.  It will do nothing to tackle the major problems which affect our economy, will result in further loss of confidence and lead even further to the general spread of disillusionment and cynicism affecting this country&mdash;largely as a result of promises made by this Government party, largely as a result of their performance since they assumed office.</P>
    <Col N="902" />
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the Minister's speech on introducing the budget of 1980 which will go down in history as the time when a Government turned their back on, undermined, and attempted to emasculate their unpaid army of tax-collectors throughout the country, namely small shopkeepers, publicans and those who, over the past number of years, have collected tax for successive Governments here.  With the stroke of a pen and in one brief paragraph the Minister in the part of his speech which relates to the taxation of self-employed persons, has taken the carpet from underneath the livelihood of practically every marginally existing small, self-employed businessman.</P>
      <P>I represent an area which is a constituency of small shopkeepers&mdash;the Smithfield and Cabra areas of this city&mdash;businesses which have been handed down from generation to generation. Here, in this budget the Government, for the first time, are asking this army of self-employed businessmen and solid citizens who make up the population of our island of small shopkeepers and small landholders to pay taxes during the current year of business.  He is asking a person in this category to do the impossible, to pay taxes, not only on his profits of last year but on his profits of this year.  I was very surprised that the Minister used such simple language when introducing this anomaly in his budget.  It makes no sense whatsoever to anybody who understands an iota of the Queen's English.  It would be impossible for any businessman to know how much profit he will make during the current year and to pay income tax on this alleged profit on 1 October of the current year.  We will take an example of a year dating from 1 April, 1980 to 1 April 1981.  A self-employed businessman will have to pay tax on a projected profit for those 12 months, all of it, on 1 October, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people who have contributed to the debate since the Budget was introduced may have overlooked the significance and the dangers implied in this section for many of our people.  Not <Col N="903" /> only is the Minister attempting to change the payment of tax in two equally divided amounts on 1 September and 1 January and to have it all paid on 1 October in one year for the previous year's profit, but he says in his speech under the title &ldquo;Taxation of self-employed persons&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The fourth major element in my income tax package this year is to devise more uniform treatment of employed and self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>Self-employed persons are normally charged to income tax in any year on the basis of profits of the accounting period ending in the preceding income tax year.</P>
    <P>What has been said so far by the Minister is entirely logical but&mdash;and I continue with the quotation:</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, when both incomes and profits are rising rapidly in money terms each year, this results in a substantial advantage to the self-employed compared with taxpayers in the PAYE sector, where tax is charged on current earnings.</P>
    <P>This sentence has me, as member of this Dáil, confused.  Admittedly, one does not necessarily have to be a member of this illustrious House to be confused, but it certainly has caused a great deal of confusion.  Tax cannot be imposed equally upon everybody.  Many feel that PAYE contributors were possibly being taxed at an unjust rate. This system of taxation was effective in collecting taxes.  However, a week in the year of the PAYE person whose wages are paid every week and the stoppage made from those wages, is a totally different kettle of fish from the position of a self-employed businessman, who is compared here by the Minister to a PAYE tax contributor.</P>
    <P>A business may differ in the amount of money it takes in from one week to the next.  Many businesses are seasonal. The publican's business is a very seasonal one and yet a small publican down the country, or in my constituency in Cabra, will be asked now to pay, not <Col N="904" /> as heretofore on 1 September and 1 January income tax on his previous year's profits, but on 1 October 100 per cent of his income tax for the preceding year and for the current year.  The publican or the shopkeeper must look into a crystal ball, with the help, no doubt, of the Revenue people, and say &ldquo;I shall be making so much profit in 12 months's time that I can pay my income tax on 1 October this year for money that I am going to make in 12 months' time&rdquo;.  The poor man might not be alive in 12 months' time.  His business may well have faltered and the bottom may have gone out of his business.</P>
    <P>As I have said, for decades the small businessman has been collecting VAT and turnover tax, and he has been stopping PAYE, social welfare contributions and other money from his employees.  In other words, he has been the unofficial unpaid taxpayer for successive Governments. And what is his reward as we go into the eighties?  The Minister for Finance comes here in February and announces that he will make every self-employed person who made or who did not make a profit in the current year pay tax in advance of profits in order to make more equal the tax method as between the PAYE and the self-employed sectors.</P>
    <P>I submit that this is reversing the role completely.  It is putting an unfair onus of taxation on the self-employed, the backbone of our community as we know it.  Asking anybody to pay tax in advance of his known income is ridiculous. It is the worst injustice I have seen any Minister for Finance impose.  I will quote further from the Minister's budget speech in relation to taxation of self-employed persons:</P>
    <P>I propose to provide that all income tax other than PAYE will now be payable in one instalment on 1 October in the year of assessment.  This change will yield £24 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>The amount of £24 million is a magical figure in the history of the National Coalition Government of whose supporters I was a backbench member.  That <Col N="905" /> Government introduced the wealth tax which was scheduled to return a lot less than £24 million.  I think it cost more money to try to collect it than was actually collected.</P>
    <P>Here we see the Minister attempting to collect £24 million in income tax from the self-employed people.  I predict that in attempting to do so the Minister will rapidly come up against the law of diminishing returns because many people will realise there is not a profit left in working for oneself here.  I could not imagine that the Minister would move so far to the left in his political approach as to tax private enterprise.  Private enterprise has always been the backbone of our society.  It started from the bottom up with the small shopkeeper, the small self-employed businessman, the professionals who do not throw any load on the State, the vocational groups.</P>
    <P>Here is the first big mallet to be used by a Minister for Finance, a man who in his previous capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs attempted to interfere with the freedom of individuals here, the sporting groups.  He attempted, unfortunately with a certain degree of success, to intimidate the IRFU, one of the bastions of the traditions of this country, an organisation that straddles the unfortunate political border we have, an organisation which do not recognise any stigma in our Thirty-two Counties.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs the Minister for Finance attempted to intimidate them into recognising his view as to who should be allowed in here to play rugby. A mixed racial team was travelling over from South Africa to play the four countries in these islands, and before a Cabinet meeting had taken place the Minister said that the Cabinet had decided this mixed racial rugby team was not welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister's pattern has been consistent in every senior office he has held&mdash;he has attempted to do something to minimise the degree of individuality and initiative that might be asserted by individuals in the fields of commerce, sport and culture.  He is not the <Col N="906" /> progressive thinker our Minister for Finance should be.  Here we have the Minister attacking our smaller, weaker business people for the sake of £24 million.  He has reached the stage when he will see diminishing returns in revenue.  A small businessman, a taximan or a shopkeeper thinking of opening another premises or of expanding a little more, finds that the budget which brings us towards the end of the century is, as sure as the bell is ringing for Question Time at the moment, ringing the death knell of the small private entrepreneur. This is an unfortunate budget, a sad budget.  A Minister who would do this is wishing trouble on himself.  He is entering a field of taxation with which he is not familiar.  He is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but inside the nut he will not find anything left to collect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission have carried out a number of surveys of the relative prices of motor vehicles in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  As indicated in the Commission's monthly report for January 1980, the most recent survey related to prices in February 1979 and the results showed that on average the retail list prices of a selected range of 23 vehicles were 25 per cent higher here that in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>This difference was accounted for in the main by the differences in the rates of fiscal charges applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it seems ridiculous that the cost of <Col N="908" /> vehicles and motor car parts in the Republic are so high mainly because of the additional duty collected by the State here?  Is the Minister also aware that recently his Government put an additional 5 per cent duty on?  Is there any justification at all for doing that in view of the difference in prices as between the Republic and the North?  Furthermore is the Minister aware that a motor tyre manufactured here and sold in the Republic for £36 can be bought in Northern Ireland for £13?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the last example given by the Deputy is correct.  If he would like to give me details afterwards it could be checked out but inquiries have been made from the manufacturers of motor car parts, including tyres, here who sell on the home market and also in Northern Ireland and the selling price of the firm concerned is the same to both markets.  The difference in fiscal charges as between here and Northern Ireland cannot account for a differential of the kind mentioned by the Deputy and I can only assume that it refers to some other make or is in some other way not comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer the second part of the question?  Is he prepared to agree that the difference in the cost could be reduced substantially if this State reduced the fiscal charges on the cars coming in here?  Is there any justification for increasing them by 5 per cent recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is no doubt whatever that the greater part of the differential in price could be removed if the fiscal charges here were reduced. As the Deputy says, so far as fully assembled motor cars are concerned there was an increase of 5 per cent in the excise payable on such cars here in the recent budget.  But that is perfectly justifiable.  The figures for imports of motor cars into this country over the past two years in particular is exceptionally high and is having seriously adverse effects on our balance of payments. The level of motor car ownership here seems to be exceptionally high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that cars assembled here are costing as much as the imported cars?  Is he not aware that there is some kind of a racket going on whereby the cost of motor vehicles in this State is the highest in western Europe.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a means of collecting revenue for the State; it has traditionally been so.  I would remind the Deputy, without wanting to make anything out of it, that the Government of which he was a member maintained the fiscal charges on motor cars at what I believe is probably one of the highest rates in western Europe.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Both advertisements arose out of the activities, in relation to offers of motor insurance, of a particular individual. Since the matter is at present the subject of court proceedings, initiated by the <Col N="912" /> Garda, I regret that I cannot go into detail on this.  However, arising from more recent information a further notice is being inserted in the press making it clear that the individual in question is not authorised to issue insurance under the Insurance Acts and Regulations.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputies and the House generally would wish me to repeat in the strongest terms that members of the public need to treat with caution any offers of insurance cover from sources not already known to them or whose bona fides cannot readily be verified.

      <P>There is a public register of those who are licensed under the 1936 Act to carry on motor business.  During recent months we have published in the newspapers advertisements pointing out that certain companies who hold themselves out as being licensed to transact motor business are not in fact so licensed.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only regulation of the type mentioned by the Deputy that I am aware of is Article 8 of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973. This provision requires wholesalers or retailers to furnish to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices a statement of the terms and conditions on which goods were purchased abroad and imported for sale in this country.  The monitoring of the operation of the provision is a matter for the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, from whom I understand that the provision is not being observed.  One of the reasons for the inclusion of this provision is not being observed.  One of the reasons for the inclusion of this provision in the order was that it was considered that the order would <Col N="914" /> otherwise adversely discriminate against Irish suppliers who were required to furnish the examiner with a statement of their terms and conditions of supply. However, under the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1978 this requirement on Irish suppliers was amended and the relevant provision now is that a statement of terms and conditions need only be furnished at the request of the examiner.</P>
      <P>The question of the effectiveness of this provision, and indeed other provisions of restrictive practices grocery legislation, is at present the subject of discussion with various interests in the distributive sector.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Toole</b> asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism if his attention has been drawn to the number of independent retail grocers in Ireland who have gone out of business in the past five years, if so, if he will outline his policy in this area and the steps he is taking to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Though up-to-date official statistics in the matter are not available, I am aware generally that over a period of years past the number of independent retail grocers has been declining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years past, policy in relation to the retail grocery trade&mdash;and retail distribution generally&mdash;has been concerned with the elimination of restrictive practices and the stimulation of increased efficiency.  Inherent in this policy is the premise that the public expect&mdash;and are entitled&mdash;to have a choice between the services offered by the independent retail grocer and those offered by branches of multiple retail outlets.  Thus, the aim of legislation in this area, such as the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and Orders made thereunder, is to stimulate a healthy competitive environment in which the various forms of retail outlet can develop.  However, I recognise that problems for the independent retailers continue to arise and in this connection. I recently had discussions with certain of the interests immediately concerned. Arising from these discussions I understand that the interests in question are to examine further and in more detail certain aspects of the proposals being put <Col N="917" /> by them before me for consideration. Further discussions in the matter are envisaged and decisions on future action must await the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he has already been furnished with accurate information on this by some bodies who have had discussions with him in this regard, and that from the statistics furnished to the Minister there were approximately 7,000 retailers between 1976 and 1979 who have gone out of business?  Is the Minister not concerned at this&mdash;a situation in which 7,000 families have been forced out of business?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Moneys are allocated <Col N="922" /> for the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs through the vote for the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism in the same way as for other offices also funded by me and independent in law in discharge of their function such as the Office of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, the Restrictive Practices Commission and the Registry of Friendly Societies.</P>
      <P>However, the provision of moneys in a Vote does not of itself constitute authority to spend.  Furthermore, section 27 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, provides that &ldquo;the expenses incurred by ... the Director in the administration of this Act, shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;. The requirement to procure the sanction of the Minister for Finance is not unusual and I do not expect that this will constitute an undue constraint on the activities of the director.</P>

There are provisions in a number of other statutes also which permit the imposition of corporal punishment by courts but such a punishment has not, under any of those statutes, been imposed by a court for many years.</P>
      <P>Apart from the statutes in question, there are of course numerous provisions on the Statute Book which are in practice obsolete for one reason or another but they create no practical problems and they are not formally repealed until a suitable opportunity presents itself when other relevant legislation is being enacted.

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the plans, if any, to introduce legislation in the area of law reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there would be likely to be any general agreement as to where, if anywhere, a line could be drawn between what the question refers to as legislation in the area of law reform and other legislation. All legislative proposals, with the exception of consolidating or declaratory provisions, set out to change the law and most, if not all legislation that I would be likely to be introducing could, in my view, be regarded as &ldquo;law reform&rdquo; in any reasonable sense of the term.  I also believe that some legislation introduced by other Ministers would likewise fall within any reasonable definition of the term.</P>
      <P>On the question of legislative proposals generally, I refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 27 April 1978&mdash;Volume 305, column 1709&mdash;to a question put down by him.  In that reply I dealt in some detail with the question of the announcement of proposals for legislation in my area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>There are, in fact, numerous legislative proposals at various stages of preparation in my Department but, for the most part, it is not practicable to put a time-scale on their production.  Besides, it is not practicable to seek Government approval for legislative proposals until they have reached the stage where the proposals, even though not in the form of a draft Bill, have at least been set out in sufficient detail to enable the Government to give a decision in principle on them.</P>
      <P>I have already, at various times, referred to legislative proposals that I hope to bring before the House reasonably soon and, I hope, before the end of this year and perhaps much earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One important Bill will deal with extensions of the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts.  I hope and believe that this will be a substantial contribution to an improvement in, amongst <Col N="929" /> other things, what is generally referred to as family law.</P>
    <P>I have also informed the House&mdash;though from some subsequent comments, one would be excused for thinking I said the opposite&mdash;that, in conformity with statements I had previously made more than once, I can confidently predict that by the end of this year I will be introducing a Bill to abolish the tort of criminal conversation and certain other torts, while at the same time indicating, by the presence or absence of other proposals in the Bill, what the Government's attitude is on the question whether a new form or forms of action should be recommended to Parliament.</P>
    <P>I have also already indicated that I was concerned about certain aspects of the law of rape, while at the same time being conscious of the problems inherent in devising legislation that would grant the maximum protection for a witness that is consistent with the right of a defendant to all that is inherent in the concept of a fair trail.  I believe that I have made sufficient progress to be able to promise with considerable confidence that I will be introducing legislation within the present year and my objective will be to improve on that, as I regard the matter as being of special importance.</P>
    <P>I also expect to have legislation introduced in the very near future to enable two international conventions in the field of arbitration to be ratified but this may not be a matter which would come within the intended scope of the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of other issues that may or may not mature within the present year but what I have mentioned are the items that I am most confident of having ready.</P>

There are parts of the law with which I am very unhappy, particularly those relating to teenagers and drink and occasional licences which are being issued in their thousands and are a cause of concern to many.

      <P>Since the beginning of this year two offenders escaped from Mountjoy Prison.  The escapes occurred on 21 January and 6 February.  In each case the escapee was a member of a work party outside the prison.  The offender who escaped on 21 January is still at large.  The other escapee was rearrested by the gardaí on 15 February and returned to Mountjoy Prison.  I do not consider that any comment from me is called for in relation to these escapes. Allowing certain types of prisoners to work outside prisons is commonplace here and in other countries and is done in acceptance of the risk that there will be an occasional escape.</P>

In accordance with the scheme, the establishment of law centres is a matter for the board with the consent of the Minister for Justice.  I have already given my consent to the board's proposals for the establishment of two centres in Dublin and one each in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Sligo. This represents the board's thinking on what is the best practical approach to getting the scheme operational as soon as possible.  It includes, incidentally, one more centre&mdash;the Sligo one&mdash;than was recommended for the initial phase in the Pringle report.  It is not a requirement of the scheme that a person who wishes to apply for services must do so at the nearest or any particular centre.  Accordingly, it is open to the board to provide services to persons resident in County Donegal and elsewhere, and who qualify under the scheme, at any of the centres to be established.</P>

The Pringle Committee who studied these problem areas for a number of years made recommendations that a number of centres be opened in the first year and the board went beyond what was recommended to them and they included Sligo. The board were established only recently, as the Deputy knows.  They had their first meeting since Christmas, some time in mid-January.  In fairness to them they have to be complimented for the speedy and efficient way they set about providing a much-needed service to the community.  I hope that the service which the Deputy sees now beginning to appear in the areas we have named will also be in County Donegal and in every other county.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to draw one item to their attention, and that is that Sligo is just slightly nearer to Dublin that it is to the northernmost part of Donegal.  That fact seems to have escaped so many people in this city and in Government offices over the years.</P>

I suggest that he is quite free to get in touch with the Civil Legal Aid Board and to make his case to them, as they have a chief executive and an office set up.  I am sure the Deputy would be welcome to communicate with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="936" /> for Justice if the report of the investigations into alleged irregularities in the allocation of Cork County Committee of Agriculture scholarships in 1978 is yet available and, if not, when it is hoped to make it available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first make it clear that the Garda investigations in the matter referred to are concerned only with the question whether any evidence is available that would justify the institution of criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Early last year, the Garda received certain allegations suggesting that, in the award of Cork County Committee of Agriculture scholarships in the previous year, a criminal offence was or may have been committed.  The Garda investigated the matter but their investigations did not disclose any evidence of a criminal offence and that ended the matter at that stage as far as the Garda were concerned.</P>
      <P>Further allegations or complaints concerning the matter were received by the Garda a couple of months ago as a result of which further investigations have been undertaken.  Those further investigations are still in progress and, while I am not in a position to say when they will be completed, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that it is hoped to have them completed shortly.  If those investigations disclose any evidence that might justify proceedings for a criminal offence, the Garda will, in accordance with normal practice, submit their report to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, of course.  If a criminal offence has taken place, if something criminal has happened, the Garda during the course of their investigations would turn that up.  As the Deputy knows full well, they would submit their case to the Director of Public <Col N="937" /> Prosecutions who would institute proceedings in the matter.  Perhaps we are at cross-purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were so, the Deputy would have to direct his remarks and his attention to the Minister for Agriculture.  I would be concerned only with anything criminal.  If there were irregularities within whatever Act the county committee of agriculture are operating, then the Minister for Agriculture would have the responsibility there, as the Deputy will appreciate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to the crowd disturbance that occurred at a <Col N="938" /> recent concert given by the Boomtown Rats; if the gardaí on duty there were invited into the concert compound, or were made aware or became aware of the disturbance; if so, the action taken and the number of arrests made; if he will outline the date, venue and circumstances in which gardaí took action in similar incidents over the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The concert in question took place in private grounds, namely the grounds of Leixlip Castle, and the Garda Síochána were not asked to provide assistance or to be present. The Garda, who had heard of the concert through publicity in the media, contacted a representative of the group concerned who said that they themselves were making all necessary arrangements for stewarding or marshalling within the grounds.  This is not unusual, though if a Garda presence had been sought&mdash;as is sometimes done for events attracting large crowds&mdash;it would have been arranged for on a repayment basis. However, a Garda presence would not necessarily have prevented such disturbance as apparently occurred and, even if a Garda presence had been sought, primary responsibility for proper stewarding and the maintenance of good order generally must rest with those organising such an event.</P>
      <P>Gardaí were on duty in the vicinity of the grounds to deal with traffic control and other such matters and to be available near at hand to assist in dealing with any disturbance if such should develop and their assistance was needed. They were not, however, informed of any disturbance and they did not themselves become aware of any.  Their only information in the matter came from reports in the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda have likewise not been involved in stewarding at any of the other similar open-air concerts that have taken place in the last five years, though a purely token Garda presence was arranged for locally in some cases.  In all cases, as in Leixlip, there was a Garda presence nearby available to be called on <Col N="939" /> if needed.  However, as far as the Garda are aware, no disturbances occurred at any of those other concerts and accordingly the question of their taking any action in such cases did not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971, the question of disciplinary action against a member of the force is a matter for the commissioner.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that, following completion of the criminal proceedings in this case, the commissioner directed that an investigation into disciplinary aspects of the matter be carried out under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971.  That investigation is not completed.  A separate issue is the complaint that other members of the force who were present in their official capacity declined to intervene.  That, too, is the subject of disciplinary inquiries.</P>
      <P>In the normal way, I would have to make the point that disciplinary proceedings are internal Garda proceedings and that it is not the practice to make any statement about them even when they have been completed. However, it may be that special considerations will apply in this case in that there have been two sets of legal proceedings and a court adjudication. Accordingly, while I cannot say what issues may arise in that regard at a later stage, it is open to the Deputy, when the disciplinary procedure will have been completed, to put down a further question, and I shall then consider what, if anything, it may be possible to say in the light of what has meanwhile transpired.</P>

May I ask the Minister, accepting the law and the constraints under which he acts, would he not consider that the time involved in completing the investigations has been reasonably long enough?

He appealed <Col N="941" /> the conviction, but withdrew his appeal on 28 January 1980.  An investigation into his actions, from a disciplinary point of view, was commenced on 3 January 1980, but had to be suspended when he gave notice of appeal against the District Court convictions.  Following withdrawal of that appeal, the investigation was resumed on 6 February.  I am assured that the investigation will be completed as quickly as possible, as we would all want it to be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="944" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to recent riots.  There was a riot on 10 February last.  There had been none before that since 31 October 1978; and that one was the subject of two statements in the House&mdash;one on the following day, 1 November, 1978 and the other on 15 November, 1979, which taken together gave as full an account as it was feasible to give.</P>
      <P>As regards the riot on 10 February, the facts appear to be as follows: it began at about 11.30 a.m. when the inmates were on outdoor recreation.  A number of them suddenly rushed towards a waste disposal bin which contained bricks, stones and rubble from building operations and they began to throw this material at prison staff.  Reinforcements were called in and inmates who were not involved in the disturbance were conducted to their cells.  All or most of those who were involved then ran to a garage which adjoins the recreation yard.  They broke into the garage and proceeded to smash garage equipment and to damage a car which was there for repairs.  At about 12.30 p.m. prison officers gained entry to the garage and took those concerned to their cells.</P>
      <P>During the riot, ten prison officers received injuries.  Three of them required hospital treatment.  Fifteen inmates were injured.  Seven of them required hospital treatment.  Both prison officers and inmattes whose injuries did not require hospital treatment were treated by the medical officer in St. Patrick's.</P>
      <P>Thirteen out of the 15 inmates who were injured and who were known to have taken part in the riot were subsequently transferred, on the recommendation of the Visiting Committee, to Mountjoy Prison.  The other two happened to be due to appear before a court on unrelated matters and their cases were dealt with by the court accordingly. Those 15 constituted at least the great majority of the group who rioted, if not the entire group.  At all events, no others have been identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the disturbance the Garda Síochána were asked to conduct an investigation. That is still in progress.  The <Col N="945" /> function of the Garda in this matter is to collect any evidence that may be available and that might justify the institution of criminal proceedings against anybody.  It may be taken that when their investigation is completed they will submit their report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Parallel with the Garda investigation, which is concerned with, and only with, the question of possible criminal proceedings.  I arranged for a full internal investigation to be carried out by an officer of my Department. This investigation also is still in progress.</P>
    <P>The question asks for the reasons for the riot.  Since it is so difficult for anybody to say, except on the most superficial level, why even a single individual has behaved in a particular way, not to mention a group of individuals, I assume that what the Deputy means to ask is whether there is known to have been any particular factor that, so to speak, sparked it off.  The answer is &ldquo;no&mdash;the prison authorities are ont aware of any&rdquo;.  There are, of course, factors that obviously come into the picture. Inmates of penal institutions are people who, generally speaking, are less likely to be disposed to confirm to rules and regulations than would a group of similar size chosen at random from among the general public.  Moreover, all of them are of course being detained against their will and, for personality or other reasons, some find that more difficult to accept than others.  Furthermore, among them there are likely to be some who will want to achieve positions either of leadership or of notoriety by trying to organise activities directed against the authorities in the institution.</P>
    <P>Another fact of some relevance is that, while many of our penal institutions compare very favourably with corresponding institutions in very many and probably most other countries&mdash;and this is a fact despite all the propaganda we hear to the contrary&mdash;St. Patrick's undoubtedly falls short of what is needed, and that is why a new institution is needed and why a site for it has been <Col N="946" /> acquired, as I have already explained on various occasions.  I would expect that a new building with better facilities would reduce the tendencies towards riots or other disturbances that show themselves from time to time, but I do not suggest or expect that it would eliminate them.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion that details of any such riot should be publicised at the earliest opportunity.  I could not accept such a proposition without qualification in so far as it speaks of publication at the earliest opportunity. Very often one of the prime objectives of persons who riot in places of detention, and incidentally of outside groups who have been known to encourage them, is to secure publicity for propaganda purposes and to underline the morale of those who have the difficult job of maintaining safe custody and control.  The propaganda is on the lines that, if a riot occurs, there must be reasons for it&mdash;this of course is vaild&mdash;and that those reasons must of necessity have something to do with serious deficiencies in the system, a proposition which is not valid but which, when repeated often enough, may be believed at least by some.</P>
    <P>A related objective, at times, is to undermine the running of other places of detention and, if possible, to encourage sympathetic disturbances in them.  Inmates of those institutions have access to the news from radio, TV and newspapers, and publicity not only can forment unrest but is often sought for that very purpose.  At worst, in the eyes of the people responsible the Minister for Justice and the staff involved in the day-to-day running of the institution will be put on the defensive&mdash;we get the usual calls for a public enquiry into the system, and so on as if the system were something secret.</P>
    <P>Since this is the reality we have to contend with, the position is that if every time some disturbance were to occur I were committed to issuing an immediate news item about it, I would from a practical point of view be actively encouraging disturbances and playing into the hands of propagandists. <Col N="947" /> On the other hand, there is no question whatsoever of concealing information that a riot has taken place.  I could not do that even if I wished to do so, which I do not.  Even if information did not otherwise come out, it would be given in the annual report.  In practice, however, information about any disturbance invariably reaches the news media in a fairly short time, often within hours and as far as I know always within days, and questions are invariably put by the news media about it.  By then there is at least a prospect that information can be given with less damage to the maintenance of good order because by then a calmer atmosphere is likely to be prevailing.</P>
    <P>I deliberately use the phrase &ldquo;less damage&rdquo; and not &ldquo;no damage&rdquo; for the inescapable fact is that any publicity plays into the hands of some of the people concerned, even though from other points of view some publicity is clearly desirable.  What I am not willing to encourage or assit is the provision of what I might call instant publicity.</P>
    <P>Finally, the question asks if I am satisfied that there will be no recurrence. I am not.  I could not possibly guarantee that there will not be future disturbances in St. Patrick's or, for that matter, in other penal institutions.  What I can say is that there is always a full review after each disturbance and measures are taken so far as possible to make a recurrence more difficult.  However, any such measures must be severely limited by other considerations.</P>
    <P>A policy such as is operated here, of humane containment and ready access by those in custody to facilities for recreation, education, welfare and the like involves the acceptance of risks to the maintenance of custody and control. Those risks are accepted in the full knowledge that it is inevitable that some of those in custody will exploit the situation, just as we operate a liberal system of parole in the full knowledge that there will be times when a prisoner will not honour the conditions of his parole.  I <Col N="948" /> think it is better to continue this policy than to introduce the sort of regimes that would be necessary if we were to try to keep the risks of abuse to an absolute minimum.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider it to be a wholesome situation when basic factual information from the Department relating to a disturbance of the magnitude which in this case resulted in 25 people being injured, is concealed, not propagated, circulated or publicised until such time as rumours had got around and then the information had to be elicited from the Department?  How does he see that unwholesome situation jelling with what happened in previous incidents when the Minister himself came forward with comprehensive details of what happened within a day or two days of the occurrence?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mistaken. The incident he is talking about, the riot, took place on 31 October 1978 and on the following day I was asked to make a statement in the House.  I made a short statement because I did not have the facts.  At the beginning of my reply I said that on 15 November, two weeks afterwards, I was in a position to come into the House to give a fuller picture.  I did that.  The Deputy should appreciate, perhaps more than many, that it is not feasible to make a statement on what happened, how it happened, how things came about, on the day after or two days after.  The Deputy used a word, and he withdrew it having used it, the word &ldquo;conceal&rdquo;.  I cannot be accused by anybody in this House of concealing anything as far as prisons are concerned. I think the Deputy will agree that I brought a breath of fresh air into the prison service with my appointment as Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had referred before Question Time to the position we find ourselves in in this country regarding the freedom of the individual.  The successive policies of different Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Fianna Fáil have attempted to interfere with the freedom of individuals in the Irish Rugby Football Union, the people who make up the membership of the clubs, the following of those clubs, and the supporters and participants of this sport throughout this country&mdash;an excellent and healthy sport.  Successive Government policies have attempted to interfere with their freedom in playing their sport.  This is not the type of society we want here.  We have seen the present Government interfere with individuals selected to participate in their sport overseas. <Col N="960" /> We have seen the present Government, on the one hand attempt to give money out to sporting organisations to improve their facilities, to generate enthusiasm among up and coming athletes to participate in the Olympic Games and then, at the same time, with their tongue in their cheek, try to impair the enthusiasm for participation in this year's Olympic Games in Moscow.  The people of Ireland have said in a recent survey that they do not want any Government interference in the sporting organisations here.  They want the freedom of the individual retained to its optimum where individuals can, under the Irish flag, compete in Moscow, where individuals wearing the jersey of the Irish rugby team can compete internationally abroad with the highest section of their sport.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is asking us to pay tax and he is using part of that tax and giving it to the Minister of State for Education to give to sporting organisations here, recycling that money to encourage participation in sport, the Minister should be sincere.  He should not be kowtowing to the whims of left-wing organisations in this country and in other countries, the fair weather sailors of protest, the rent-a-crowd pseudointellectual left-wingers that are prevalent in this city.  Fortunately for many other Deputies they do not exist in many other parts of the country.  Once there is an international sporting occasion of any significance this rent-a-crowd element appears on the scene to indicate that there is some terrible injustice taking place in the sporting world. We have seen the Government interfere with an international tug-of-war competition in Dundalk a short time ago; we have seen them interfere with an international golf competition down in County Kerry; we have seen them attempt to interefere with the freedom of our organisations for the promotion of sport in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was elected in 1969 it was the first time that the Taoiseach had appointed a Parliamentary Secretary with responsibility for sport and given an allocation of money for the promotion of sport.  In this budget the Minister refers to an allocation for sport.  I am addressing my remarks to the moneys which will be collected when this budget and the Finance Bill have been passed.  These moneys have been recycled and paid out to sporting organisations for the promotion of sport, for the training of athletes, for the stimulation of physical education here. That is what this budget is for and I am addressing myself specifically to that part at present.</P>
      <P>The year 1980 is a tremendously important year for many of our athletes; it is the year of the Olympic Games.  It is the first time the Olympic Games have ever been held in a communist country and we see the Government, on the one hand, giving money to sporting organisations to improve their facilities, the fitness of their athletes and, on the other hand, attempting to discourage them from participation.  Many athletes and people are confused.  They do not know what the Government's stance is.  They seem to think that the Government do not want them to go.  It should go out from this House that we do not want any interference whatsoever in an individual's freedom to participate in any sporting organisation throughout the world.  We have never heard the Government give out when our athletes, like the UCD soccer team, went on a tour of Red China.  They were encouraged to go.</P>

      <Col N="962" /> I will move on from the tour of Red China by the UCD soccer team.  But it is a peculiarly schizophrenic attitude for any Government to have to pretend to promote sport with financial gifts, on the one hand, and then attempt to interfere with two of our biggest organisations, on the other hand, our International Olympic Committee and the Irish Rugby Football Union.  I hope the Government can find better things to do with their time than interfere with these organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Let there be no doubt about what the present policy of the Government is.  Nobody appears to understand <Col N="963" /> it.  One day the athletes are encouraged and the next day they are discouraged. Sometimes it would appear that there is a dichotomy of views among certain Ministers but this does not just apply to the Olympic team; it applies to the Irish Rugby Football Union who appear to be the lame duck and the organisation that the Government are aiming all their venom at.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the present bank interest rate increases which have been proposed by the associated banks.  We have read in the past few days that they wish to increase the interest rates for business people by 3 per cent.  We have read pleas of people to the Government to interfere and ask the Central Bank to negotiate with the associated banks to limit this to about 1 per cent or 1½ per cent.  I spoke earlier about the self-employed people and about the way the Minister wishes to change the time schedule for payment of tax to 1 October.</P>
      <P>I neglected to refer to the fact that the self-employed person cannot any more register himself as a PAYE person of his own company. This is a totally retrograde step.  The self-employed person will have to pay tax in advance of making his profit.  Most small businesses in this country have traditionally been run on overdrafts and bank loans and the increase in interest rates which is about to take place is due mainly to Government policy.  How many of these businesses will be viable during the next few years when Government policies have been effectively introduced into legislation?  Certainly I would not like to be a small self-employed businessman in this city in three years' time under this Government or to be a rugby player, hoping at the same time to go to the Olympic Games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government appear to be against personal initiative.  In 1977 we thought a great stimulus would be given to initiative, to the self-employed and to job creation, but the opposite has happened. I had hoped that the Minister would <Col N="964" /> have second thoughts and reread his statement.  The last nail has been hammered into the coffin of the self-employed in this city and throughout the country, just to appear to satisfy the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector got nothing from the budget because only the method of tax payment has been changed.  Instead of paying tax on their wages and salaries they will now pay that extra tax on commodities. It is an insult to the IQ of such people&mdash;and everybody in this House pays tax under the PAYE system&mdash;for the Minister to say that they will pay less tax and will have more money in their pockets.  The essential commodities and services such as fuel and transport will cost much more and the tax has been merely transferred fron one system of payment to another.</P>
    <P>What encouragement is there for expansion? The Minister did not even mention an increase in the allowances for bank interest, motor car depreciation and capital expenditure.  It is accepted that inflation this year will certainly reach 20 per cent, yet the amount of interest which qualifies for tax relief is still about £2,500, the same level as eight years ago.</P>
    <P>Money values have deteriorated so much that one would need a slide rule to keep up to date with the devaluation of money, not to mention the further devaluation due to our entry to the EMS. The Irish pound is worth only about 90p against the £ sterling and about 95 per cent of small business transactions are in sterling.  These transactions may constitute only 50 per cent on volume of financial transfers but they are of great importance to small businesses.  Imports have now risen in cost by at least 10 per cent because of the devaluation of our currency against sterling.</P>
    <P>There is a quagmire on the Border affecting people doing business in the Six Counties.  I am a member of a board which has employees in the North and the banks there refuse to handle the Irish pound which is paid to employees living there.  The break with sterling was not wise.  Is it wise to continue the rift?  Did <Col N="965" /> we rush in too soon to the EMS and should we now consider getting out?  A responsible Minister would look at these questions and not spend his time pursuing dead policies of a pogrom nature against sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>I refer to yesterday's editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> which pointed out that two years ago bank interest rates were about 10 or 12 per cent.  They have now risen to 17.5 per cent and if the banks have their way there will be a further increase of 3 per cent.  Many of us can remember going to a hire purchase company for money to buy our first car or motor bicycle and anyone who borrowed at an interest rate of 21 per cent would have been committed to an institution.  Hire purchase money was blood money.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, anyone paying back money on an instalment basis is paying an effective rate of 40 per cent.  Did we ever think we would see that?  If an 18-year-old university student wants to buy a motor bicycle that is the interest rate he will have to pay.  That is what the experts say, and this will increase by a further 3 per cent up to over 45 per cent when one takes into account that it will be 3 per cent on 17 per cent on the normal overdraft lending rate.  Therefore the cheapest money available to any business in this country will be at 21 per cent, possibly next week or even when we leave this House this evening.  Then, of course, in regard to the most expensive money, the sky is the limit.  Unfortunately under this Government the pawn broker is coming back into his own; he is here to stay in this city for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>When the Minister said he saw the light at the end of the tunnel&mdash;in introducing this budget&mdash;he must have been looking backwards watching the entrance to the tunnel, seeing the light there, because nobody in this House can see any light at the end of the tunnel; in fact it is so dark one could imagine being in a bottomless pit.  We have shown that the housewife or her husband cannot afford to borrow money or if they do, that they are put to the pin of their collar attempting to repay it.  We have shown <Col N="966" /> that the Governemnt have given no consideration to increasing existing allowances against any commitments the breadwinner may have, be it mortgage or anything else.  Then there is the ever-increasing cost of food.  I heard the Minister answering a question yesterday to the effect that the importation of food to this country had increased by one-sixth in 1979, up to almost £300 million that in an agricultural country.  We know where this food is coming from and where the relevant revenue is going&mdash;to the large, multi-supermarket owners based overseas who have their cartels of supplies, their ranches of vegetables and so on, sending them in here in large containers to be distributed to the poor unfortunate housewife who must pay for all of their economies and efficiencies.  The cost of travel has increased, as has the cost of clothing, heating, of basic medicines, household cleaners and other commodities.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing itself has increased dramatically, by 30 per cent, during the past 12 months.  Then there is the cost of schooling and ancillary expenditure, sport, books, uniforms and so on.  Householders are being attacked not only by the demon of inflation or by the diminution in the quality of family life here but also, unfortunately, in a negative sense by the Government, in that there is no help forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The budget has not made any significant improvement in the situation of the married man with three or four children who may have a large mortgage, a personal overdraft in the bank, except that it has afforded him some additional income tax relief.  Firstly, however, he must earn the income and, secondly, this income tax relief will be of no great help with the current inflation rate.  If we could predict accurately that the rate of inflation this year would be well over 20 per cent prior to the increases announced in the budget, we must ask ourselves what has happened today, 28 days later. We have seen bank interest rates being increased further.  We have seen electricity charges going up a further 10 per cent, something affecting every <Col N="967" /> household because, thanks to previous Coalition Governments, we all now use electricity.  At best the budgetary provisions might keep people on a par with inflation but, bearing in mind the rate at which costs appear to be increasing, I predict that our standard of living will deteriorate drastically, as we have seen happen to our neighbours in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I question the wisdom of a budget increasing payments to those who do not work to such a level that they would be almost as well off on the dole as they are working a 40-hour week.  Possibly the Government have taken away the initiative to work.  The trouble of going to work, of providing food at work, of travelling there and back, of clothing oneself for work, ending up approximately 10 per cent better off in monetary terms on a basic wage per week than ones next-door neighbour who is unemployed acts as deterrent to work and should be questioned.  It might well constitute an immoral approach to the ills of our society.</P>
    <P>Effectively people are being encouraged&mdash;not intentionally, I accept &mdash;through welfare payments and the dole not to get up and go to work in the morning.  Any human being would prefer to remain in bed until the afternoon rather than get up at 7 or 8 o'clock on a cold winter's morning and go out to work.  What is the reward at the end of the week?  Approximately a 10 per cent financial benefit over ones unemployed neighbour who has all the ancillary benefits of a medical card, free school books, no travelling expenses, who has the advantage of having hot meals at home while the labourer may have to travel some 10 to 15 miles to a building site, stand at a bus stop on a cold morning for a long time, have a cold lunch, perhaps not getting anything else to eat until 7 or 8 o'clock that evening, noticing very little improvement in his material gains.  This should be questioned.  Social welfare benefits should be given to the genuinely needy, to widows and orphans, not to healthy, able-bodied men <Col N="968" /> who may make a consious decision not to go out to work.  A system should be devised by the Government under which those people who deliberately and consciously refuse to go to work, refuse jobs offered them&mdash;we have all seen this in our constituencies&mdash;should be drafted into a work force and brought to sites, beaches, canals or bogs and made do a day's work.  If you are going to pay an able-bodied, healthy man £60 a week he should be asked to do something for the State in return.  Otherwise, it kills the spirit of those living near such people.  It also kills the spirit of children in the house who watch the father staying in bed all morning, roaming around the house for the day, perhaps going to the pub, but never short of cash.  The Government should have the courage to do something about this ailment affecting our society.  The work group could take the form of an unarmed work corps in the military forces.  There are many possibilities.  It could also be in the form of an unskilled type of industry. The more one thinks about it the more possibilities arise for such a work force.</P>
    <P>I wish to say something about the astronomical increase in the cost of our health services.  Ten years ago we spent approximately £50 million on our health services.  Now the figure is a little under £600 million.  When the health boards were being introduced we knew they would be monsters, that they would gobble up money as quickly as or even quicker than you could provide it.  It does not take a genius to predict that once again there will be a deficit in the health board budgets and that next December we shall have to take Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Health to finance these deficits.  For years we have known that these boards are cumbersome, bureaucratic and over-elaborate.  The Eastern Health Board is the largest health board in these islands, larger than any in the UK.  In the UK, health boards have been shown by the McKinsey advisers to be failures.  One of the best examples of bureaucracy gone wrong was when McKinsey were brought in to advise on the setting up of the UK health boards and their financial structure and <Col N="969" /> ten years later had to come back and advise the Government on where McKinsey's advice was wrong in the first place&mdash;a lovely business to be in.  It was the health boards that brought them back.</P>
    <P>We have seen the expenditure of our health boards increase from £50 million to £600 million in ten years.  Obviously, the Government should have a subcommittee in the Department of Health to investigate this expenditure which is certainly not going to the patients.  There has been little or no improvement in health care in the past decade.  We have had one or two hospitals built in Cork. We have seen a long overdue investment in the Beaumont hospital on the north side in Dublin.  But as regards equipment, we spent, I think, four or five years haggling to get a body and brain scanner for one hospital at a cost of £300,000.</P>
    <P>Do we suffer too much in the health services from duplication in administration? Is there an unfortunate grinding of gears between the Department of Health, the health boards and the old health authorities?  With the increase indicated in the recent census in the Dublin area, the Government would be well advised to take another look at the size and structure and the administrative complications of the Eastern Health Board, the greatest consumer of funds in the service. The personnel of these services are dedicated men and women of the highest integrity, tenacity and ability; but where a structure is too big it cannot be made work efficiently no matter who is controlling it.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention telephone service problems and the failure to implement certain promises made by Governments that the service would improve.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are a disgrace.  Reports travelling from one firm to another are delayed; confusion reigns supreme.  The excuse for inefficiency that is constantly used is that there is a strike or go-slow in the Department. We have not heard of any progress by Fergal Quinn or Michael Smurfit in this area except that one of them had difficulty in getting a telephone <Col N="970" /> for his office and I think the other could not find his office.  There is little point in whitewashing the situation.  Deputies here know that by the weekend half the telephones in the House do not work. They are overburdened and staff have to come in at weekends and oil them or gear them up for the following week.</P>
    <P>It is with reluctance I speak on this budget of 1980.  I warn the self-employed to read it with interest and I would ask the Minister to look at the ominous section of it relating to Schedule D tax under which he wishes to collect £24 million from the self-employed.  Once more he is creating a most unfair anomaly as regards those in our society who have the initiative, energy and ability to create their own livelihood. This should not be regarded as a liability or defect in our society but should be encouraged rather than discouraged.  A country that attempts to tax its businesses out of existence is taking the heart out of our society.  It is wrong to tax people so heavily that they lose initiative, to send that tax money throngh the different machines of Government and attempt to redistribute it when it has lost about 20 per cent of its value in the process.  That is what is happening and it is one of the greatest mistakes the Government have made.  They are absorbing more and more money into the jaws of administration where it is being chewed up and devalued before it gets to the intended recipients.  We should seriously consider what is the maximum amount of tax a person should pay, if there should be a blanket of 10 per cent of income paid in tax so that at the beginning of the year a person would know that if he made £1,000 during the year he would have to pay 10 per cent of that in tax.  There should be a simple format. This book, <i>Budget 1980,</i> is very complicated.  There are many different methods of collecting tax and many things are taxed in so many ways that if one wanted to make things more difficult one would need a new Minister, a Minister for Complications.</P>

      <P>I wanted to ask the Government, through the Minister, to clarify the attitude of the Government towards the participation of Irish athletes in the Olympic Games.  That is a simple question.

The Minister of State has been very dedicated to promoting sport but if he gives as much attention to the Olympic question as he did to my last sentence everything will be amicably resolved.</P>

      <P>I was surprised there was such a song and dance about the social welfare increases, 25 per cent in some cases and 20 per cent in others.  With the present rate of inflation these increases will soon be insufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to make a special case in the near future to improve the situation of people living alone.  A widow in receipt of a non-contributory pension gets £15.80 and this will be increased by 20 per cent.  A person on unemployment assistance and living alone <Col N="972" /> must exist on £13.15.  These people have to provide food, clothing, heat, light, rent and all other essentials.  Everyone must agree these allowances are inadequate and this area requires special attention.  I could dwell for a very long time on social welfare payments but I will not delay the House too long.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare the inadequacies of the services provided by his Department.  That Department is not and has not been functioning for quite some time and the service is deteriorating by the week.  The Minister is active around the country promoting new ideas in health and social welfare but I suggest that he spend some time in his Department examining the day-to-day mechanics of the Department in relation to the payment of benefits.</P>
    <P>From experience I know one cannot get in touch with them by telephone.  The unemployment exchanges throughout the country cannot get a reply from 786444.  If one gets a dialling tone the phone is not answered.  If one complains to the Minister's office one is told it is a matter for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because they service the switchboard, which is operated satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get information about a complaint.  I had a case this week of a man who is waiting three weeks for his social welfare payments.  I was told his certificates had not been received.  He told me he delivered the certificates by hand to Store Street and still he did not get his social welfare benefits. This is not an isolated case.  I could give many instances of this type of thing.  I have on my books today 12 cases of people waiting for benefits and I am finding it more difficult to get any service from the Department.</P>
    <P>Again I ask the Minister to spend time in his Department to improve the operation of the social welfare schemes.  In the long term he should look into this problem and have the system changed so that payments can be made at local level so that people can claim their benefits at their local exchanges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> I want to refer to the disgraceful bank rate.  Because of the high interest rates farming, industry and all sections of the community are suffering.  In these times when profits are hard to come by, these high interest rates are not encouraging industrialists or farmers to borrow.  I condemn the kite flown during the week by a spokesman from one of the commercial banks seeking a further 2½ to 3 per cent increase in interest rates.  The current rate is 16 per cent.  A large number of people can make arrangements for only small loans, and for people who cannot make other arrangements the banks make a further 6 per cent surcharge, bringing the repayment to 22 per cent.  The 3 per cent on top of this which the banks are looking for brings it to 25 per cent and this is disgraceful and should not be considered.  Over the last few years the banks have made phenomenal windfall profits and these should be channelled back to the people either through extra taxation by the Government, through allowances to people who have accounts and must pay interest, or through any other way that can be brought about so that the people who provide these profits will benefit from them.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the £70 interest on savings which is tax free.  This at present is a joke.  It is encouraging people to take evasive action in relation to tax.  People are being advised by all lending agencies, whether they are commercial banks or not, and even by some of the State bodies to take action to evade tax.  People who save from their earnings, who have paid tax on these earnings, should get special consideration in relation to the tax which they must pay on interest earned on these savings.  If people make savings and invest them and then invest the further savings which they make on the accrued interest on those savings, they are paying tax four and five times on the same money.  That should be looked at and action taken to bring about relief and also to encourage saving among the community.</P>
    <P>I could talk about the telephone and postal services but I do not want to do <Col N="974" /> that this evening.  Instead I will refer quickly to some of the housing problems. The Exchequer is not in a position now to provide sufficient finance for house building in respect of either local authority houses or SDA loans.  We must encourage people to save in order to build their own houses.  This matter has not been given sufficient thought by successive Ministers for Local Government and for the Environment now.  I read in the Estimates that the cost of providing houses is now an average of £600 a year per tenant in subsidy.  This takes into consideration that a lot of houses are on very low subsidy and that gives a clearer idea of the subsidy required to provide houses at present.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister for the Environment to launch a campaign to get people to build their own houses.  First of all, sites must be provided.  This operation is carried out by certain local authorities but not on the scale at which it should be undertaken.  A campaign should be undertaken to sell the idea of saving to young people who are the ones who have the spending power and who spend a lot of money before they come to marriageable age when they must have houses.  If they were encouraged to save for their houses there would be a good response.  This is not just a matter of putting an advertisement in the papers or the Minister making a speech exhorting young people to save.  I envisage a high-powered advertising campaign to bring about the idea of saving for houses.</P>
    <P>As well as that special consideration in relation to tax allowances for people who save for house building and a special savings scheme could be set up where this money would be channelled into where it could be used by the Exchequer until required by the people wishing to build their houses.  The moneys channelled into this could be given to the savers tax free.  In other words, they do not pay tax on it and the Exchequer could have the use of this money at a small interest rate.  With a scheme of this nature large numbers of people in the <Col N="975" /> country would be only too willing to save for house building and would be grateful to the authorities for suggesting this to them and channelling them into this type of situation so that they could be housed when they would be married.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to health.  I am very disturbed at the amount of funds provided for health this year in the regional health board in my area.  There is a reduction of £1.5 million to maintain services at 1979 level.  This amounts to a reduction of 5 per cent on the Estimates required to maintain services over the nine-month period which remains.  There are only a few very small areas where these savings can be made.  These are in lighting, heating, prescriptions and food. Nobody would suggest that savings should be made on heat, lighting and food but these are the only options open to the board.  I am afraid that if these options are taken and savings made we are going to have major problems in health over the next two-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>I will make one protest in relation to health before I sit down.  In the southeastern area we have received only £20,000 for the coming 12 months out of the capital allocation for health.  This is unfair and discriminatory.  I hope that we shall never again have the situation where one health board is discriminated against to such an extent.</P>

      <P>I should like to speak now, for a very short time, on Irish agriculture.  The Budgets of 1980 and 1979 will be remembered by the Irish farming community for many years to come.  In the 1979 Budget, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy George Colley, brought in the infamous 2 per cent levy, which had serious consequences for our agriculture.  It was a great error on the part of the then Minister.  That error has not alone been equalled, but surpassed, by the bringing in by the present Minister for Finance. <Col N="976" /> Deputy O'Kennedy, of the resource tax. I draw the House's attention briefly to the fact that, at that time, Members on this side of the House, in Fine Gael, members of the IFA and of the ICMSA and all the farming organisations warned the then Minister that he was making a great error in bringing in the levy. Nevertheless the Minister persisted.</P>
      <P>I have here before me this evening the returns of livestock enumeration up to December, 1979.  Those figures from the Central Statistics Office, issued by the Government Information Service, are the saddest reading that I, as a Member of this House since 1969 have seen in regard to Irish agriculture.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will ask me why and I shall tell him that, in these figures, cows are down in number by 33,000&mdash;a drop of 1.7 per cent.  Dairy cows are down in number by 10,200.  Other cows are down in number by 23,000.  Heifers in-calf are down by 17,500, a drop of 5.2 per cent. These cows are divided into different categories, total heifers, dairy and others.  Dairy heifers are down 16,000, a drop of 6 per cent.  These dairy heifers in-calf are the future of our dairying industry and they are down by 16,000. That is a frightening figure.  Bulls are down in number by .7 per cent.  One year old and under are also down in number. There is a very fractional increase of .6 per cent in total cattle, because there is an increase in 2 year olds and upwards and there is a marginal change as well in one year olds.  Overall, the situation in regard to cows and heifers in-calf is very serious.</P>
      <P>Total sheep are down in number by 58,000, a drop of 2.4 per cent.  Pigs for breeding are down in number by a total of 2.6 per cent, but gilts in pig are down by 23.8 per cent, which is a massive decrease.  Those are frightening figures for the future of our agriculture and ones which the Government should take note of at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>I have here a report in regard to vegetable production.  In 1974, there were 10,310 acres of vegetables growing. In 1979, this had dropped to 7,196 acres and, as far as I am aware, the figures for 1980 will be down even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> Imports of fruit and vegetables into Ireland in 1970 were £2.29 million.  In 1979 that figure had increased to £4.8 million, plus another £3.3 million for frozen chip potatoes.</P>
    <P>I further draw the attention of the House to imports of food into Ireland, which went up from £158 million in 1975 to a total of £318 million in 1979. Basically, the position in regard to cattle production gives cause for concern.  The situation in regard to pig production is nothing short of alarming and that in regard to sheep is, also, very serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, stated that farm incomes in 1979 were estimated to have fallen by about 4 per cent.  In regard to cattle, sheep and pigs, the whole area gives cause for concern.</P>
    <P>Regarding sugar beet, there are problems with the EEC with regard to the annual Price Review, which problems are causing concern.  The position as regards vegetables is very serious and in barley production, surpluses also cause difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> On almost every front, farming is faced with a difficult situation.  Unless the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance take serious note of the position of Irish agriculture, we shall be faced with a grave situation in one of our most important industries.  At this late hour, before the Dáil adjourns for Easter, I have one request to make of the Minister for Finance and of each and every Member of the Cabinet, that is that they seriously consider withdrawing the resource tax.  I can assure the Minister that a lack of confidence among the Irish farming community led to a lot of the figures I have mentioned.  Farmers were upset and annoyed and felt that the levy was a mistake.  The resource tax, if persisted in, will lead to a farming community faced with a serious situation and a serious drop in income.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 April 1980.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the further steps, if any, he intends taking to protect sites of archaeological and historic interest in view of the recent major discovery of objects of great historic value and interest, and of the manner in which objects were found; in particular if he will introduce legislation to prohibit the unlawful use of metal detectors and similar devices, and to impose heavy penalties for the unlawful use of such devices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing national monuments legislation contains quite specific provisions for the protection of sites of archaeological and historic interest.  Under the National Monuments Act, 1930, it is an offence to excavate or dig, without the permission of the Commissioners of Public Works, in or around any national monument which is in the care of the commissioners or of a local authority.  It is also an offence to dig, or excavate, without permissions, in or under any land&mdash;not just the sites of national monuments&mdash;for the purpose of searching generally for archaeological objects.  Anyone convicted of an offence under the relevant sections is liable to be fined, and where the interference is with a site in the care of the commissioners or of a local authority, the Act provides that a term of imprisonment may be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The question of whether additional powers need to be taken to prevent unauthorised interference with archaeological sites is one of a number of matters being considered in connection with new legislation which it is proposed to introduce for national monuments.  The threat posed by metal detectors is receiving special attention in that regard, as also is the desirability of having substantially increased penalties for anyone engaged in illegal searching for archaeological objects.</P>
