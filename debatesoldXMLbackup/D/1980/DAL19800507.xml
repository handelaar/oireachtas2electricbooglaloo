      <P>These amendments more than any of the others tabled by the Minister highlight the way in which the Bill was rushed into the Dáil in a totally unprepared way.  It is my duty to protest that any Minister should come before the House in such an unprepared way especially since the Bill before us is so important.  There were more than a <Col N="899" /> hundred ministerial amendments to the Bill.  Surely this situation indicates the carelessness with which the Minister has approached this subject.  If anything, his behaviour is the antithesis of safety.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendments but I would point out that the Bill has had an exceptionally long gestation period.  However, what we have now is the result of a good deal of negotiation between the Department, the trade unions, the ICTU, the employers, the various working parties and the Opposition parties here.  Admittedly, about two years ago we were of the frame of mind that perhaps the Bill should have been withdrawn but the Minister has been amenable and this party have been in a position to put down somewhere between 40 and 50 amendments.  Fine Gael, too, have tabled amendments to the Bill.  While there has been some difficulty in coming to grips with individual amendments, the Bill is now in its final Stages and it bears no resemblance to the document that was put before the House originally.  This is a healthy situation. Our spokesman on Labour, Deputy Ryan, cannot be here this morning but in his absence I can tell the Minister that we are happy with the progress being made now and hope that the Bill will be completed within the next few days and its provisions put into effect as soon as possible.  This legislation has been pending for a number of years.  It will be a vast improvement on the existing state of affairs because the legislation that is in use in this regard is very much out of date.  On that basis we welcome the multitude of amendments the Minister is putting before us this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed this whole matter with the ICTU and while we adopt our own view on legislation we are acquainted with the view also of the employers on the matter.  It is important that the Bill is not delayed further because if it is not completed before we start discussion on the Finance Bill it might be difficult to have it completed before we begin the Adjournment Debate at the end of June. <Col N="900" /> Consequently, we are happy to facilitate the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to the discussion on these amendments and to underline one of the points that have been made.  People who have been following the progress of the Bill will not be under any misapprehension about the source and the direction of many of the amendments.  The one we are dealing with bears a strong family resemblance to an amendment that was moved by Deputy Ryan for this party but withdrawn by agreement.</P>
      <P>The basic point one would like to make about the amendment is that it refers to other amendments also and indicates that in so far as this Bill is concerned the House is behaving in the way in which it rarely behaves, that is, as a legislative assembly.</P>
      <P>There are times when the Minister must feel, and with some justice, that he can never win, that if he brings in a Bill which is not amended he is accused of steamrolling it through the House whereas if he brings in a Bill and amends it subsequently he is accused of having come to the House unprepared in the first place.  We would prefer the latter course of action because it indicates that the Members of this House are not mere rubber stamps, that the House is more than just a sounding board for grievances and it acknowledges the rights of Members and their competence in regard to any legislation brought before them.</P>

      <P>Could I take this opportunity of thanking both Deputy Horgan and Deputy Desmond for their comments.  I believe safety in industry is a very important aspect of our industrial life.  In introducing this Bill, having prolonged discussions with both sides of industry and listening very carefully to the comments and points raised by Deputies, there have been many amendments but it is our duty as a legislature, and it is the Minister's duty, in an area as important as this that every line of the Bill should be checked at every stage. <Col N="901" /> Many of today's amendments are the result of points raised by Opposition Deputies during Committee Stage.  I was prepared to bear in mind some of those points and having considered them felt that introducing amendments covering those points to some extent, and in some cases perhaps going a little further, would have the effect of strengthening the Bill.  This is what we should all strive for, particularly in an area as important as safety in industry.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of the Minister arises out of Committee proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Where a request is made of an occupier pursuant to subsection (6) of this section and the name of the person by whom the relevant plant was sold or otherwise supplied is within the knowledge of the occupier of whom the request is made, then if such occupier fails to comply with the request he shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under amendment No. 17a at Committee Stage, Deputy Mitchell proposed that failure on the part of an occupier, under section 9 (6), to give an inspector the name of the person by whom the plant was sold or otherwise supplied should constitute an offence.  My amendment is designed to meet the Deputy's proposal, in other words, to confirm what I have been saying, that in an area as important as this every consideration should be given by me and my Department to what we believe to be a helpful suggestion at any stage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An addition has been made to Deputy Mitchell's formula in this case.  The occupier's refusal to supply the inspector with the name will be an offence only if the name is within the knowledge of the occupier, that is, either he knows it or he <Col N="902" /> could find it out, since it would clearly be inequitable to penalise an occupier where he genuinely did not know the name or where he was unable to find it out.  To prove in court that the occupier refused to give the name should be relatively easy but to prove that the name was not within his knowledge may not necessarily be so easy.</P>
    <P>As no monetary penalty has been provided in relation to this offence, nor did Deputy Mitchell require such a provision, section 101 of the Factories Act 1955&mdash;&ldquo;Fines for offences for which no express penalty provided&rdquo; will apply.  The maximum monetary penalty for an offence under that section is being increased by virtue of section 56(g) of the Bill from £20 to £100 and the further fine is being increased from £5 to £10, not exceeding £600 in all, for each day on which the offence continues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) where a person enters the confined space or the other place, there shall be provided and maintained a suitable means of raising an alarm should the person, while inside the confined space or the other place, get into difficulty,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to accommodate points raised by Deputy Mitchell on Committee Stage.  The first <Col N="904" /> amendment relates to amendment No. 45e tabled by Deputy Mitchell on Committee Stage.  He proposed that a method of raising a wider alarm be provided in cases where a person had to enter a confined space.  In meeting him on this, my amendment has been drafted to permit such a means of raising an alarm to be either a person or a device.  This is because, depending on the nature of the fumes in the confined space, it could be either dangerous or, indeed, impossible, for a device to be used inside the confined space.  In such circumstances the interests of safety would dictate that another person should be provided outside the confined space to give the alarm where necessary.</P>
    <P>The second amendment arises out of amendment 45f, again tabled by Deputy Mitchell on Committee Stage.  As suggested by the Deputy, this amendment will require any person holding the free end of the rope outside the confined space to be trained and practised in the use of the breathing and other apparatus and in a method of restoring respiration. The same requirement will also obtain if a person, as opposed to a device, is provided as the means of raising an alarm under the new paragraph (d) should the person inside the confined space get into difficulty.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to meet the point raised by Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 53a on Committee Stage.  He proposed that at any given time an adequate number of the persons employed at the factory or other premises should be familiar with the suitable means to alert the local fire brigade in case of an outbreak of fire, which regulations under section 27 (3) may require to be provided.</P>

    <P>These amendments are designed not only to accommodate Deputy Mitchell on the points raised in his amendment No. 60d on Committee Stage, that is that the safety representative be informed of an inspection before the inspection commences, but also to improve on his proposal by applying that same requirement in connection with the safety delegate as well.  This will make for a consistent approach since both a safety representative and a safety delegate are entitled, on request, to accompany an inspector on a tour of inspection&mdash;with the exception, for reasons for which I already explained on Committee Stage, of a tour of inspection specifically to investigate an accident.</P>

      <P>When discussing Deputy Ryan's amendment No. 76 on Committee Stage I assured him I would examine it further before Report Stage to see to what extent I could meet him on it.  Deputy Ryan had proposed that occupiers of the premises coming within the scope of section 39 should have to prepare a safety statement, irrespective of the number of persons employed in those premises.  As the section is drafted at present there must be 20 or more persons employed in the premises before the preparation of a safety statement is required.  After careful consideration of the Deputy's point, while I feel it would be neither appropriate nor necessary to burden very small employers with the requirement, I am prepared to reduce the number of persons employed in the premises by half, in other words from 20 to ten, and the Deputy will agree that this is a reasonable compromise.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to welcome this Ministerial amendment.  I am sure the Minister will understand when I say that many amendments put forward on Committee Stage are, to some degree, like arguments put forward at a negotiating table in that they are negotiating positions. While the amendment we introduced on Committee Stage was to require a safety statement for all enterprises, regardless of the number of people employed there will be recognition that the law of diminishing returns might apply and that the problems of small businesses in meeting this requirement might outweigh any possible advantage to be gained.  In the light of that and of the fact that even small businesses which are not covered by this section will have to comply with other aspects of the Bill we accept the compromise the Minister has offered to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The law on safety here is a veritable jungle.  It is covered by several Acts, many parts of Acts, a host of Ministerial orders and hundreds of regulations and exemptions, all of which have the force of law.  As far as I am concerned this Bill is but a further piece of the incomprehensible jigsaw.  That is my major criticism of the Bill.  If it is to be a stop-gap measure then we accept it, even welcome it, but I am afraid that this half measure will postpone indefinitely&mdash;notwithstanding the setting up of the working party&mdash;the bringing before the House of a comprehensive safety at work Bill.  This Bill has been delayed here for two years.  A total of 18 months elapsed between the conclusion of Second Stage and the commencement of Committee Stage.  That showed a lack of preparedness on the part of the Minister.  It is my belief that it was thrown on to the floor of the House soon after the Government came to power for lack of any legislative programme.  That is highlighted by a number of facts.  One of those facts is the number of amendments the Minister has tabled to his own Bill.  Some of the amendments introduced by the Minister today did not have anything to do with the amendments put down by the Opposition on Committee Stage.  That highlights the fact that the Bill was introduced without much care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two other facts highlights the lack of care in bringing the Bill before the <Col N="910" /> House.  In preparing my brief for this Bill I was amazed to find that the National Association of Industrial Medical Officers and the Faculty of Occupational Medicine had not been consulted by the Department about its contents.  That highlights the carelessness with which this legislation was thrown before the House.  That carelessness manifests itself in a bigger way in the major omissions which a number of Members tried to highlight.  The lack of consultation with the concerns I mentioned was unforgivable. The omissions of the Bill are due in many respects to the lack of consultation with those bodies.  I hope that the bringing before the House of comprehensive safety at work legislation will not be delayed although my fear is that it will be long-fingered, notwithstanding the setting up of the working party.</P>
    <P>The Bill is notable for its many omissions. The principal Acts governing safety are the Factories Act, 1955, the Offices Premises Act, 1958, the Boiler Explosions Acts, 1882 and 1890 and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.  In addition we felt that the Act dealing with dangerous substances of more recent origin also governs safety.  Those Acts cover different areas and we also have the various Acts dealing with shops, public health and sections and provisions in other Acts such as the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, which cover conditions of employment.  Under the Factories Act alone more than 120 different detailed orders, regulations and exemptions are specified.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that we are on Fifth Stage and during the course of the debate on that he is confined to what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Bill is very confined.  The orders, regulations and exemptions I mentioned are still current and have the force of law and there are, in addition, provisions of international law and agreements which have like force.  Given the number of Acts, regulations, orders and agreements that cover the different aspects of safety and <Col N="911" /> health at different places of employment one might consider that no aspect of work or place of employment was left out.  However, all this legislation, covered and policed by the factory inspectorate, does not cover transport, agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, offshore installations, research laboratories, hospitals, clinics, dental surgeries, canteens, hotels, restaurants, places of entertainment, pubs, portable shops and stalls, the Army, the Garda and so on.  The Bill is deficient.</P>
      <P>It was because we felt it was deficient that we called on Second for its withdrawal and its replacement by a comprehensive Bill which would not only consolidate and co-ordinate all existing legislation but could be extended to cover, without unnecessary distinction, all persons at work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing that the Bill should not be passed because of its deficiencies.  It should be withdrawn and replaced by a comprehensive one which would not alone consolidate and co-ordinate existing legislation but extend without unnecessary distinction it to cover all places of work.  Such a Bill would replace complexity and confusion by clarity and simplicity, both of which surely constitute prerequisites for laymen to understand and implement it. The Principal Act is the Factories Act, 1955&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been enormous advancement in technology since the passage of <Col N="912" /> the Principal Act.  Indeed the advancement made in technology in those 25 years has been greater than in any previous 100 years in history.  What is needed now is a comprehensive Bill to match those technological, cultural and social advances.  It would be better that this Bill would not be passed.  It would be better to await a proper, comprehensive Bill rather than support this one which is &ldquo;ad hoc-ery&rdquo; at its worse.  Ad hoc additions to existing legislation merely add to the complexity which in turn leads to non-enforcement and, rather than being the friend, is the deadly enemy of safety. This matter was dealt with in the United Kingdom in 1974 when the British Parliament enacted their Health and Safety at Work etc.  Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that this Bill has been extracted entirely from the British Act.  Indeed the British Act is an excellent, overall one of the type I believe that is needed here.  For that reason I am puzzled that the Minister did not go the whole way and copy the entire British Act rather than extracting parts.  The enactment of the British Act was the result of the Robens Committee set up in 1970 which was representative of employers and trade unions both of whose commitment and involvement are essential to the success of all safety law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The employers and trade unions were not involved in this Bill before it was introduced in this House.  There have been consultations since but none before the Bill was tabled. I am comparing that fact with what happened <Col N="913" /> in the United Kingdom when the Robens Committee, representative of employers and trade unions, was set up. Normally that type of committee is associated with delay but the expedition of the Robens Report and, more importantly, of the British Government's reaction to it and the enactment of legislation should have been an example to our Minister for Labour in this very important area.</P>
      <P>Since these points were raised on Second Stage I am glad the Minister has seen fit to concede them.  After the enactment of this Bill there will be set up a working party on safety.  We have heard of chicken and egg situations but this is ridiculous and the lack of consultation has been sharply criticised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who gave adequate testimony to their dissatisfaction&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a Second Reading speech.  That Stage has long since passed.  We are now on Fifth Stage and speakers are confined to what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Bill has been improved somewhat in Committee it remains sadly deficient.  I can only plead that it will not be used to delay the extension of further consolidating legislation to all places of work, not alone that but an extension to cover the safety of citizens who live in the vicinity of work places which are potentially dangerous. That is another deficiency in this Bill.  I can give an example in my constituency of how this Bill does not cover safety adequately, where there is a factory utilising a lot of lead, having magnificent safety precautions within the factory itself, as is required by legislation, but where the people living within the vicinity are polluted by lead because there is no protection in law for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another sad deficiency in this Bill is its lack of dealing with the responsibility of individuals to abide by safety procedures, to use safety equipment and wear safety clothing as required by law. The question of individual responsibility, <Col N="914" /> the psychological resistance of many people to observing safety procedures, wearing safety clothing and so on has been the cause of many an accident.  Individual responsibility for observing such safety procedures and precautions should be the major mission of this Bill. We should require employers to provide all sorts of safety equipment, protection against noise, dangerous machinery, substances and so on, but we should also address ourselves to the problem of normal human resistance to the use of such safety measures.  The Bill is particularly deficient in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also deficient in the sense that is does not involve sufficiently the trade unions in the area of safety.  I should have hoped that the Bill would have aided the trade unions in having their own safety officers, people who would vet every collective agreement being formulated by unions at different work places thereby ensuring that the interests of safety and health are not rendered subordinate to those of&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot continue to make a Second Reading speech.  I am sorry.  I do not want to curb the Deputy's desire to deal with matters but it is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is a much larger role to be played by the individual and by the trade unions in the whole area of safety.  Had the Minister made provision for the trade unions themselves to appoint safety officers that would have constituted a major step forward in the context of a Bill such as this.  This is a serious omission from the Bill which would have improved greatly the safety of people at work.  I should like the Minister to tell us that our fears about the putting of further safety legislation on the long finger are unfounded and that the working party which he announced on Committee Stage following our protest on Second Stage will report expeditiously. He should set a time limit for that report, based on whose findings he should bring before this House a further Bill concerning safety at work.  If we urgently apply ourselves to the task we <Col N="915" /> may save life and permanent injury.  This is not a trivial matter, although it is not the sort of thing which makes headlines every day.</P>
      <P>I will finish by making another major criticism of the Bill which I made also on Second Stage.  The Bill does not seek to update provisions regarding cleanliness at work.  It is a matter of great shame for me that we as a country seem to accept filth and dirt which in many work places lead to accidents.  Standards are far too low throughout industry, commerce and every aspect of Irish life.  Here was a glorious opportunity to take major action in regard to cleanliness and tidiness and the Bill is deficient in its failure to deal with this matter.  One has only to stand on any city street to see the dirtiness of commercial vehicles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the whole question of cleanliness and tidiness is very much connected with health.  We are a filthy dirty country.  The Principal Act of 1955 dealt somewhat with the subject but this Bill, while purporting to update the Principal Act, does not address <Col N="916" /> itself to the whole problem of the lack of cleanliness and tidiness.  It is sufficient to stand on any street in this city&mdash;or, in the Minister's case, in Cork city&mdash;to see filthy commercial vehicles on which children have scrawled &ldquo;please wash me&rdquo;.  These vehicles come from factories which very often are similarly dirty.  Filth and dirt are enemies of health and safety.  I would urge the Minister to deal with this and other problems I have mentioned when the next safety Bill comes before the House.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for including on Report Stage some of the amendments which we moved on Committee Stage, but it would have been a little more graceful if he had accepted our amendments.  I accept Deputy Horgan's point that it is a step in the right direction. I hope that Parliament will be allowed to improve Bills which come before the House by making constructive suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill illustrates both a paradox and a dilemma.  The paradox is that as administrations, civil service Departments and trade unions, attempt to increase the necessary protections available to workers, particularly those in dangerous and high risk industries, the degree of complexity of the legislation required in order to enforce adequate standards means that this legislation becomes increasingly inaccessible in a real sense to the workers whom it is supposed to protect.  If there is an accident at work the trade union concerned will naturally become very upset.  On one such occasion not long ago in my constituency the response of some members of the trade union concerned was to say that in future all members should have a copy of the Act in their back pockets. With the best will in the world, to inflict a copy of an Act like this on the shop floor worker is less than useless, yet at the same time protection must be provided and written into the Act and it must be reasonably enforced.  The dilemma is what to do about this difficulty and how to ensure that adequate safety standards are observed and that <Col N="917" /> shop floor workers are aware of their rights.</P>
      <P>I should like to express regret in relation to the fact that we have not yet had from this or any other Department under any administration any Act written in English.  We have followed the British system which involves a highly specialised legal language which attempts to cover virtually all possible occasions and exceptions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the language of the Bill which is very germane to my point.  I do not propose to take up the time of the House unduly. The language of this Bill in common with the language of other Bills owes more to the grip of the legal profession upon the parliamentary process than it does to any other single factor.  I can only express the wish that once in a while some administration in this country will abandon this British precedent and adopt the United States precedent of attempting to write legislation in language which is understood by the people to whom it is supposed to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that, because of the inadequacies and incompleteness of the Bill it should be withdrawn.  As Deputy Mitchell said, it is better to have it than not to have it.  We should be aware of any idealism or utopianism which would prevent us from doing anything until we got the whole thing right.  In that case we would never do anything at all.  We would never be satisfied that we had done everything absolutely correctly.  In relation to what I said earlier about the complexity of the Bill and its various provisions, it is clear that when the responsibility of the Dáil in relation to it is completed that of the trade union movement begins.  It is not just the Minister's inspectorate and Department who will have the major job of securing its enforcement.  On the shop floor, trade unions, shop stewards and members will have to play some part in <Col N="918" /> ensuring that the provisions of the Bill are adhered to.  I am confident that this responsibility will be taken up by and large within the trade union movement in the spirit in which the trade union movement, in the shape of congress, has already contributed in no small way to the improvement and development of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that such important legislation has taken so long to go through the House.  In so far as time has been devoted to improving its provisions and making them more water tight, and hopefully preventing further serious accidents at work, we cannot complain.  We welcome the Bill as far as it goes.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider publishing on an annual basis, if his advisers are not too overworked as it is, a brief annual report on actions taken under the Bill and on exposing the way in which the Bill has or has not been successful. This will be a useful way, without the prodding of Parliamentary Questions, in which the Minister and his Department could help to keep safety in industry in the forefront and in the public eye and attention.</P>

      <P>I am proud and pleased to have had the opportunity of guiding this legislation through the House.  There are many people who deserve to be thanked for the final format in which the Bill has gone through.  No Bill got so much attention and no legislation received so much consultation and so many hours of consultation with the people who have most contributed.  The staff of the Department, both administrative and technical, deserve tremendous thanks and credit. The trade union movement and employers organisation deserve to be thanked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Mitchell read the Bill&mdash;I cannot blame him for that because he was speaking on Second Stage when he was speaking on what should have been in the contents of the Bill.  He referred to some omissions which were not correct.  The medical adviser in my Department gave tremendous <Col N="919" /> time and attention to the preparation of this legislation.  Deputy Horgan raised the point about the best way of bringing the Bill to the attention of workers, employers and trade unions. Attention needs to be drawn to the importance of the Bill and what is entailed in it.  I will have a clear, concise and simple summary of it drafted to which I will give wide circulation.  That is important and I accept that it should be put in simple language that can be understood by the people affected and concerned with the administration of safety.</P>
    <P>It is too easy and simple to talk about safety as not being something that has to be looked at day by day, week by week and month by month.  We must realise that this legislation is not the end where safety is concerned.  As I outlined on Second Stage it is needed.  The staff of the Department, both administrative and technical&mdash;by technical I mean factory inspectors&mdash;were aware of the need for updating the existing legislation.  There was acceptance by both sides in industry that it was needed.  I agree that more remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that a review body or working party would be set up as soon as the Bill passed through the Oireachtas.  Subsequently I said that I had made arrangements and contacted the parties to say it was my intention to set up such a working party on the whole area of safety and what should be done regarding it.  A more comprehensive Bill would have taken more time and the need was and is there for this legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Mitchell's suggestion of slavishly copying the UK. This may be fine for Deputy Mitchell or his party but I do not believe in it.  I believe, as a Minister of an Irish Government, that we should not slavishly copy anybody particularly a system or a country like that.  We have a Government, a trade union movement, an employers' organisation and people who can decide what is best for our country and should not be slavishly aping, following or continuing to look up to <Col N="920" /> people across the water.  If that is the philosophy of Deputy Mitchell I am disappointed. I hope it is not his party's philosophy.  It is not mine; never was and never would be and never was my party's.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell went across the board to areas outside the Bill.  He referred to individual responsibility not being provided for.  He is wrong and I cannot be blamed if he did not read the Bill.  I should like to refer the Deputy to part II, section 8, where he will see in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) the reasonable care for his own safety and health, and that of any other person who may be affected, that a worker is expected to take.  Obviously the Deputy did not read that part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> He referred to cleanliness, and I refer him to the 1955 Factories Act, Part II, section 10, where he will see a general provision for cleanliness in factory premises.  It all has to do with health.</P>
    <P>They are the few points I wanted to make.  Deputy Mitchell said he had not sufficient notice that the Final Stage was being taken today.  It is normal to take Report and Final Stages together.  Having said that, I wish to thank Deputies for their contributions, and I ask Deputy Quinn to convey to Deputy Ryan my thanks for the useful points he made.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I had said practically all I wanted to say about this section, and I must confess I said it more than once because every time I said what I had wanted to say the Minister of State got up and answered something else, and it became necessary for me to engage in some repetition.  To summarise briefly, I am against the section because of its retrospective provisions which will operate through regulations made by the Minister in respect of things that were done in anticipation of the appearance of the Bill as far back as 10 or 12 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I queried how the Local Government auditor had overlooked payments made and pensions granted without authority obviously in anticipation of authority being granted by this Bill, and the Minister of State told me that the auditor did not make any complaint to his Department. That surprises me all the more.  I imagine that the Local Government auditor was&mdash;&ldquo;tipped off&rdquo; would be an offensive term&mdash;informed that a Bill would be introduced <Col N="922" /> to regularise these payments, pensions and schemes.</P>
    <P>I object to that method of doing things.  It is wrong and I think it could lead to the descent of the slippery slope. All this could have been avoided if in 1969 or 1970 a small enabling Bill had been introduced to regularise matters pending the introduction of the more comprehensive Bill we have today.</P>

      <P>I will comment on the point made about the Local Government auditor.  He or she is independent.  The Government had intended to bring in legislation to regularise these proposals and there was not a comment from the auditor to the Department. I think that point should be cleared up.  I overlooked making the point yesterday.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about bringing in an amending Bill some years ago.  The commission which dealt with this matter looked into all this and they were making changes so rapidly that if a Bill had been brought in then it is possible these proposals would not have been validated.  The Deputy will appreciate that an enormous amount of work went into this Bill, which will regulate all future schemes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with the point about the auditor and that he agrees it was a point well made which needed explanation. Obviously the auditor had known that enabling legislation was on the way. Otherwise he would have been amazed that some of the decisions made had been taken.  I do not believe the auditor read in a newspaper that this legislation was on the way; I believe a formal communication was made to him and received by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These accounts are audited every year and it amazes me that the Local Government auditor did not query them if not every year then every other year and that he did not query delays in validating these actions taken by local authorities.  I <Col N="923" /> do not think I am making a mountain out of a molehill in this respect.  I have dealt with it at some length because I think it should be ventilated.  I am not sure whether a formal communication was sent to the auditor to the effect that he could overlook these things.  If such a communication had been sent to him I would have expected him to have made a query every time he audited the accounts as to why the Bill had not been introduced.</P>
    <P>If the Government were not acting on a formal, direct communication from the Department of Local Government, they must have been acting on some sort of informal communication that the thing was all right.  If that were the position, it is much worse&mdash;even alarming.  If the local government auditor could take an informal OK for this sort of action, he could perhaps take the same informal explanation for other things.  This is the reason I am raising this matter and I am not yet satisfied that I have got a full explanation.</P>

      <P>I move amendemnt No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 42 to 49, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a)  Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Minister shall not exercise the power conferred on him by section 2 (1) (a), section 2 (5) (a) or subsection (1) or (2) of section 3 of this Act so as to apply to or in respect of a person conditions which, as compared with the conditions which are affected by the exercise and which were in force in relation to the person immediately before such exercise, are less favourable, unless such application is dependent for its effect on the exercise (whether before or after the passing of this Act) but a person of an option.</P>
      <P>(b)  The restriction contained in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply in relation to the exercise by the Minister of any of the powers therein mentioned where&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> (i)  the persons to or in respect of whom the conditions are applied in consequence of the exercise of the power comprise a class or description of persons specified for the purposes of this paragraph in a scheme or schemes or in regulations made under section 2 or 3, respectively, of this Act, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the said conditions, or any one or more of them, are to apply to or in respect of such persons from a date which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  is specified in the scheme or regulations and which as regards a particular person is not later than that on which the person became a person of the said class or description, and</P>
    <P>(II)  is not earlier than, in case the said conditions relate to the provision of pensions for the widows, orphans or other dependents of persons of the said class or description, the 1st day of January, 1970, or in any other case, the 1st day of June. 1978.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section preserves existing rights of a pensionable person.  Since the Bill was drafted I am legally advised that subsection (4) might give rise to difficulties of interpretation.  The amendment is, accordingly, purely a drafting amendment to clarify the subsection and remove any doubt concerning its application.  To put the amendment in context, I refer to the purpose of the subsection.  The position is that changes in superannuation conditions having been agreed with several interests may be taken to be improvements over the conditions they are replacing. However, it can happen, particularly where a package of new conditions is being introduced, that an employee may consider that some feature of the package may be less favourable in the circumstances of his particular case than his existing conditions.  To ensure that the conditions of any employee cannot be worsened, it has been the practice, when introducing new conditions, to afford <Col N="928" /> options to existing employees to remain subject to their existing conditions. Newly appointed persons becoming pensionable after the revised conditions have been introduced are not afforded options and such revision conditions apply in their respect from the commencement of their service.  It is intended that the same situation will apply when future changes are being brought into operation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) (iv) precludes the Minister from making any provision in a scheme or regulation under the Bill that would affect to his detriment the superannuation conditions already applicable to an employee save where such employee exercises an option to have the revised conditions applied to him.  The amendment is simply to clarify the position in regard to newly appointed pensionable staff.  Two categories are involved. First, it involves persons who entered the service as officers after the widows' and orphans' scheme was made compulsory and who were not given an option.  The amendment will make clear that the scheme can be applied to them without an option.  Secondly, it involves persons who entered the service on or after 1 June 1978 and who had the new superannuation pension scheme applied to them without an option.  The amendment will validate their position.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Subsection (4) as drafted states that no new scheme or any amendment of an existing scheme shall worsen the conditions enjoyed by any person at the introduction of this scheme unless the acceptance or application of the new scheme depends on an option.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister now states he is taking away the proviso at the end of the subsection making it dependent on an option and that the new section will simply read that the conditions of a person cannot be worsened.  I do not know <Col N="929" /> if that is the correct interpretation.  The new subsection is less favourable to employees than was the old subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is more unfavourable than was the previous proviso but I should like to point out that the working party agreed to this.  The provision in relation to the widows' and orphans' scheme is purely precautionary.  On any reasonable basis the scheme introduced in 1969 must be regarded as a benefit.  It is possible that some person appointed after 1 January 1970 might challenge it on the grounds that contributions have to be paid and, therefore, might challenge any scheme made under the regulations.  What is being sought here is to validate what is being done at the moment.</P>
      <P>Apart from the question of the widows' and orphans' scheme, the effect of the amendment will make it clear that changes in conditions can be made without the necessity of an option provided the person is appointed to the relevant class of employee on or after the operative date of the new conditions and, in any event, after 31 May 1978.  To put it another way, persons appointed before 1 June 1978 will not be affected by the amendment except in relation to the widows' and orphans' scheme.  Persons appointed on or after that date will be affected and it will be made clear they will not have a right of option in relation to the new superannuation revision scheme that was put into effect on 1 June 1978 on a compulsory basis in accordance with the recommendations of the working party.  Although that revision scheme represented a major overall improvement and although it made clear to all the persons appointed after 1 June 1978 that the scheme would apply to them compulsorily, it is possible that under the Bill as it stands some person might challenge the scheme.  The purpose of the amendment is to put the matter beyond doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I received representations from people in the country in relation to the Bill and I attempted to move an amendment but I was informed that it would incur possibly additional expenditure and therefore would be ruled out of order.  The general question I wish to raise on the section dealing basically with regulations and schemes is: what provision, if any, does the Minister or the Department envisage making for a person who has been in the public service for at least five years&mdash;the five years would be a minimum period; that could be variable&mdash; and has paid in contributions and then opts to leave the service? He may have ten years of contributions. Is the Minister in a position to say that the powers are available under this section to enable a Minister, either himself or one of his successors, to draw up regulations which would enable a person in the position that I have described to cash his contributions and take them out <Col N="933" /> with him?  I am really talking about transferability of superannuation contributions. I understand that if this person leaves in advance of the pensionable age the contributions are locked into the pension scheme and cannot be transferred to another pension fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are perhaps talking in a vacuum because the Minister has quite properly decided to leave much of the footwork to the working party since it is of a complex nature.  Would it be reasonable to assume that what is at issue here is transferability of pension rights from one sector of employment to another?  The umbrella within which this would naturally fall is the whole question of a national pensions scheme.</P>

We are going along with the working party who have been meeting on this matter over a number of years and we are awaiting their report.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I raised the question on the new subsection (4) as to who will determine whether or not a new scheme is less favourable than an old scheme and I was told the courts would decide that.  If that is so, I am satisfied on that point but I wonder if the provisions of subsection (2) which are very far flung and which provide that if any question arises under or by virtue of the making of regulations, that question shall be decided by the Minister and the Minister's decision shall be final.  It appears that a question as to <Col N="934" /> whether a new scheme is more or less favourable than an old one is something arising under or by virtue of the making of regulations because the new scheme, as I understand it, will be made by regulation.  If it is to be held that the decision whether a new scheme is more or less favourable than an old one is to be made by the Minister I will be very unhappy about it.  It is really an appeal to nobody, not an appeal at all.  The scheme would be settled by the Minister on the recommendations of his advisers.  It would be an appeal against the Minister himself being decided by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Act in any parliament in a country can be doubted or it can be brought to the courts as unconstitutional, but we are happy about that section.  It is based on the 1976 Act. It was put to the Attorney General of the day.  He was of the opinion that it was in order; in other words, that it was not unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am sure it was advised by the Attorney General of the day as, I am equally sure, was the question of whether the income of the husband and wife could be aggregated for the purpose of income tax.  That operated for years and years, come Attorney General, go Attorney General, but when it came to the Supreme Court they found the whole thing was unconstitutional.  Therefore I make no apology for raising this sort of question here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the making of regulations generally and we must bear in mind that this Bill when it becomes an <Col N="935" /> Act will operate through regulations. Section 5 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>(a)  Any regulations made by the Minister under this Act may provide for the determination by the Minister of questions arising under, or by virtue of the making of, the regulations and may provide that the decision of the Minister on any such questions shall be final.</P>
    <P>If it is held by the courts that the Minister is exercising a judicial function, it is unconstitutional.  There is no doubt about that because there is no appeal to anybody from it.  He may decide these questions and there is no appeal to any court.  If it is held that he is acting in a judicial capacity, that is unconstitutional. It goes on in subsection (2) (b) in so far as any scheme made by the Minister under this Act may provide:</P>
    <P>(i)  for the determination by a Minister of the Government specified in the scheme or by a person of a class or description so specified of questions arising under or by virtue of the making of the scheme,</P>
    <P>(ii)  for the determination by such a Minister or by a person of such a class or description so specified and for the determination by the Minister of any other such question,</P>
    <P>(iii)  that a decision pursuant to the scheme on any question shall be final.</P>
    <P>That is a very far-reaching authority. There is every likelihood that the courts, in their present mood of thinking and in their present approach to the rights of citizens to resort to the courts over the head of the Executive, would hold that that provision is unconstitutional.  There is an argument in favour of what the Minister says.  There is no argument in regard to subsection (2).  The regulations may provide that the questions shall be decided by the Minister, and that is final. I was afraid that the same interpretation might be put on subsection (4)&mdash;in other words, I was afraid that the question of <Col N="936" /> whether a scheme is less favourable or more favourable than a previous scheme might be decided by the Minister.  Taking subsection (2) and subsection (4) together there is nothing to prevent the Minister, say, drawing up the regulations to provide that whether a scheme is less or more favourable will be decided by the Minister.  If that were to happen I would be anything but happy.  As a matter of fact the Minister might very well think of introducing an amendment on Report Stage which would exclude from the provisions of section 5 (2) the right of a Minister to provide by regulation for the decision by him as to whether a scheme drawn up was less or more favourable.  I would be much happier if the Minister would consider that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

Different minds will be brought to bear on it and future Cabinet Ministers and Ministers of State will not be bound in any way by the debate taking place in the House now.  I suggest that the Minister exclude the right of determination by the Minister whether a scheme is less or more favourable, and he should write that into the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That is straight.  I do not want to get into a legal and constitutional argument as to who is right and who is wrong.  This Bill and its drafting were approved by the former Attorney General in 1976.  As everybody knows, under our Constitution any person has the right to contest any Bill or any Act in the courts.  Our country is very democratic, thank God.  I cannot say, nor can anybody else or any <Col N="937" /> Government, which Bill or which of its provisions is going to be taken into the courts today.  According to the best legal opinion we have, we are satisfied that this Bill is in order.  Anyone can take this up as a constitutional issue in the courts. That is why there is no need for anything of the nature that Deputy Fitzpatrick is talking about to be written in on Report Stage.  It clearly says that the Minister shall not exercise the power conferred on him in section 2.  The local authority make decisions on the amounts and any individual or group of individuals who are not happy can appeal to the Minister.  Since this Bill was given to me I have studied it and discussed it with a lot of people and everyone seems to be happy with it.  I do not wish to get into a legal wrangle with Deputy Fitzpatrick on these highly technical matters but on the best of legal opinion I am informed that the Bill will stand up and that it is all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I concede that the Minister has an argument in relation to subsection (4).  One interpretation would be that an aggrieved person would have access to the courts and I hope that this interpretation would stand up.  I was afraid that the Minister in drawing up regulations under section 5 (2) would make provision for deciding by himself whether or not a scheme was more or less favourable.  That would be quite unacceptable. I am not happy with the right taken in subsection (2) about which there can be no doubt and no argument. The intention here is to give the Minister the right to adjudicate on all questions arising on regulations made by him and to make that interpretation final.  There can be no argument about that; it is as clear as a pikestaff.  That is the meaning of subsection (2) in laymen's or any other man's language.  There can be no appeal from the Minister's decision on these regulations to somebody else except through the courts.  It is not reasonable to authorise the Minister to draw up regulations and then confer on him the right to decide on the interpretation that should be put on those regulations <Col N="938" /> and to say that no appeal should lie from the Minister.  There is no use in saying that that is a legal wrangle or anything else.  It is a clear expression of what is in subsection (2) and it is going too far.</P>

Applicants in any of these schemes still have the right to go to the courts if they wish.</P>

There is no appeal to anybody else because it says that all decisions &ldquo;pursuant to the scheme on any question shall be final&rdquo;.  The decision is meant to be final and it is meant to deprive a person from going to the court.</P>

Any section of this Bill can be brought to the courts if a person so desires.  However I am satisfied that this Bill will stand up.

The Minister is right in his general statement that anyone can bring anybody to court but he need not get <Col N="939" /> much of a hearing.  Subsection (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Any regulations made by the Minister under this Act may provide for the determination by the Minister of questions arising under, or by virtue of the making of, the regulations and may provide that the decision of the Minister on any such questions shall be final.</P>

      <P>(iii)  that a decision pursuant to the scheme on any question shall be final.</P>
      <P>Let us be rational about it.  That simply means that the Minister may personally or through an agent decide any matter arising from or in connection with the making of a scheme and that any such decision made by him shall be final.  That is plain language and there is no appeal from that.  The words &ldquo;that a decision pursuant to the scheme on any question shall be final&rdquo; mean that the decision made by the Minister or his agent shall be final.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This section saves rights already enjoyed by local authority employees and provides that those rights cannot be taken away from them.  I raised on Second Stage a general question arising out of the right of ladies employed by local authorities to retire on marriage or to opt not to retire on marriage.  I understand that there are a number of views on the rights of such female employees.  Some take the view that if they want to opt to retire on a lump sum they must do so within a specified time.  Others take the view that they can remain in employment for a long time and then decide to retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this section, which <Col N="941" /> saves rights to which employees are already entitled, it is essential that there is a liberal interpretation of what rights people are entitled to or what rights they enjoy under existing regulations and schemes.  I should like the Minister to deal with this question which, I agree, I have not yet dealt with fully.  It is the right of married women to continue to work in the service or to retire.  When must they opt?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with marriage gratuities.  Under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, a female employee of a local authority who completed at least five years' pensionable service became eligible to receive a marriage gratuity.  Having ceased to hold her employment by reason of her marriage before the removal of the ban on the employment of married women she had to resign on marriage to qualify for a gratuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> She must have had five years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  When the ban was lifted matters were not as clear.  Where a girl continued in employment for some time after marriage before resigning and seeking a marriage gratuity in such cases it is a matter for the local authority concerned, having regard to the legislation, to determine whether a gratuity should be paid, that is to say, they must satisfy themselves, all other conditions being fulfilled, that the resignation is by reason of marriage. Otherwise, no gratuity is payable.</P>
      <P>This position has not altered except in the case of girls who have opted to come under the 1977 revised scheme of superannuation conditions recommended by the working party in substitution for their existing conditions.  Under the terms of that scheme the local authority have no discretion in the matter as the scheme spells out precisely how long a girl may remain in employment after her marriage if she is to remain eligible for a marriage gratuity on resignation.  That clears up some of the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to emphasise the seriousness of the lowering of the limit for rates relief in the current year from £60 to £40 and to point out that this change will cause much undue hardship. Even at this late stage the Government should rethink their policy in this regard. I have never before witnessed such despair and lack of confidence and such a feeling of hopelessness as are evident now among the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reduction in the level of rate relief will have serious consequences in the current year.  On Monday last at a meeting of the county committee of <Col N="946" /> agriculture in my county, speaker after speaker from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, denounced the present state of agriculture.  Assertions were made that many farmers, especially those in the £40 to £60 valuation bracket, are on the verge of bankruptcy.  Never was it more inopportune to remove a relief which has been in existence for many years.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on 4 March the Minister told us there were many thousands of farmers who will be affected by this reduction in relief. In my own county 673 farmers are within the £40 to £60 valuation range. These are the very people who are being hit hardest by the recession in agriculture.  Many of them will be unable to meet their rate demands for 1980.  I have before me a table of the rates they will be expected to pay because of the removal of this relief.  The increases to be paid by those in the £40 to £60 bracket are enormous.  A man with a valuation of £59 will have a rates increase of £389; a farmer with a PLV of £40 will pay an extra £300 rates.  The actual rates to be paid will be considerably higher.  A man with a valuation of £59 will have to pay a rates bill of £762 and a man with a valuation of £40 will have to pay £516 in rates.</P>
    <P>The original intention of rates relief on agricultural land was to help struggling farmers, particularly those in the lower valuation bracket, but now all that has gone by the wayside.  Not alone are they now liable for taxation, resource tax and levies, but they are being hit by the removal of rates relief on agricultural land.  That could not have happened at a more inopportune time.  I have never seen people experiencing such difficulties in paying their bills.  In Ballsbridge today one will see that the people selling agricultural equipment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am referring to the people in the £40 to £60 valuation bracket. Never have I seen such despondency, such inability to meet bills and but equipment and such despair for the future as at present.  I do not know how anyone could introduce a Bill which would penalise the people in this category.  In Dungarvan mart this week calves were being given away for nothing because of the depression in the cattle trade.  The people in the calf trade and the trade for young cattle are mostly in the £40 to £60 valuation bracket.  The collapse of the agricultural industry which is happening before our eyes is being accentuated by a depressive measure like this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment told us last week that this Bill was to relieve farmers as regards payment of rates.  I am saying it will have the opposite effect. This Bill penalises them.  They are not getting something which was previously granted to them.  To introduce this Bill this year is a retrograde step.  The year 1979 was bad enough for agriculture when the figure was reduced from £75 to £60 but to reduce it further to £40 in 1980, a year of real depression, is the utmost folly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than thankful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his guidance.  This Bill is a grave mistake. The Minister is aware of the situation. This section provides for the continuation of primary and supplementary allowances for 1980, 1981 and 1982. Valuations have been reduced from £60 to £40.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter because if this Bill is passed it <Col N="948" /> will further damage the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance dealt with this matter in his budget speech.  He pointed out that in 1979 farm incomes fell by about 4 per cent.  That was an open admission by him.  Other farming commentators said the drop could have been in the region of 10 per cent, 15 per cent or even as high as 20 per cent.  This section will further aggravate losses already being suffered by farmers and if the Minister continues with it an already serious situation will be worsened.  Is the Minister aware that if this section is retained, an even larger number of farmers will be involved?  Is the Minister aware that the incomes of farmers in 1979 dropped by between 4 and 20 per cent?  Sadly, it appears that that drop in income will occur in 1980.  This is part and parcel of a method by the Government to bring in handy revenue.  There is no difficulty about collecting such revenue, it is a mathematical proposition of multiplying out the method of bringing in the revenue.  It is also very easy to collect such revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is making a grave mistake. The farming community went through a bad year in 1979 but this section will affect them up to 1982 because the amount they will have to pay in rates will be substantially increased in coming years.  This is part of a package designed to extract as much money as possible from the farming community in the handiest way possible.  The Minister should withdraw it.  A leading member of a farming organisation last weekend warned us that there would be a doubling of rates for farmers in this category.  Is the Minister aware of the impact such an extraction of money from the farming community will have?  We are all aware that some years ago if there was an increase of £1 in rates there would be widespread discontent in the farming community but this section means a doubling of rates paid by thousands of farmers.  Under this all-embracing section those in possession of Land Commission holdings will be included.  Extending the net to bring in additional taxation <Col N="949" /> from farmers is unwise.  We must bear in mind the changes that have taken place in recent years such as the 2 per cent levy, the resource tax and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position may be conveyed to people living in urban areas that the withdrawal of reliefs in this case is the withdrawal of a relief that was being given to well-off farmers, those who can well afford to carry on without such a relief.  It is important, therefore, that I should set the record straight as to the exact income position of those who are <Col N="950" /> suffering a reduction of relief in this case. In doing so I will not be drawing attention to tendentious figures produced by the IFA or any other group that has the job of making a good case for the farming community.  I will draw attention to figures prepared by the Agricultural Institute, a State-funded organisation recognised internationally as being scientifically dispassionate and not concerned with making a case for or against anybody.</P>
      <P>The reality is that on average the people from whom reliefs are being withdrawn under the Bill, those with farm valuations of between £40 and £60, do not have increases of £8,000 or £20,000 per year.  The average income of those with a valuation of £40 is £4,000 per year.  The average income of people with valuations of £60 is £6,000 per annum. People on PAYE will realise that an income of £4,000 a year is not a large income; it does not put one in the category of being a rich rancher, or a rich farmer.  Yet it is precisely those people in this income category who are having the reliefs made available to them under successive Governments withdrawn under this Bill.  It is directly as a result of this Bill, and under no other budgetary measure, that I made the assertion, and make it again, that there are a very large number of farmers affected.  The position is that the farmers so affected will be paying more tax, including rates and income tax, than their PAYE counterparts would pay on the same income. Therefore this Bill is introducing over-taxation of a certain sector of the farming community.  I shall give figures to uphold this claim because it is a claim which most people, not familiar with the figures involved in this Bill, will find it very difficult to accept.  Most people believe that the farmer is not paying his fair share and will not do so even as a result of this budget.  I assert that the smaller farmers encompassed by this Bill will be paying not less than their fair share but more than their fair share.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish merely to draw the Minister's attention to some figures to illustrate what will be the impact of this section.  Let us take a farmer with a valuation of £40, his average income on that valuation&mdash;based on farm management survey figures produced by the Agricultural Institute&mdash;would be £4,000. Assuming a rate in the £ of £11, which is about average, the total taxation he would pay on that income would be as follows: £484 in rates and £10 in income tax, making his total tax bill in the year 1980 £494.  His PAYE counterpart with an income of £4,000, if married with two children&mdash;and this is the assumption in both cases&mdash;would be paying £245.  In other words, as a result of this Bill, a farmer with a valuation of £40 will be paying more than twice the amount in tax, including rates and income tax, of his PAYE counterpart on an equivalent income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall result of this Bill is that the burden will be borne much more heavily by the smaller than by the larger farmer.  Let me cite the example of a farmer with a valuation of £100.  His average income would be about £10,000. His total tax bill would be as follows&mdash;again assuming he is married with two children&mdash;£1,210 in rates, £350 in resource tax and £1,108 in income tax, making a total of £2,668.  His PAYE counterpart&mdash;again married with two children and having an income of £10,000&mdash;would pay £2,243 in income tax.  In other words, the farmer with a £100 valuation would be paying just about 19 per cent more than his PAYE counterpart, more but not that much more, whereas the farmer with a valuation of £40 with an income of £4,000 per year would be paying 102 per cent more, or more than twice as much as his PAYE counterpart.  Even taking resource tax into account the gap between the farmer and the PAYE person on similar incomes, as a result of this Bill, will be far wider in the case of the smaller farmer.  The smaller you go the larger will be the gap between what the farmer and the PAYE person pays.  That is on the basis of income statistics published by the Agricultural Institute, <Col N="952" /> not produced by me off the top of my head in order to prove a case.  I believe that this is completely unjust.  It should be borne in mind that the larger farmer probably will have an income against which he can set his income tax liability. Therefore he is not so badly affected. But the amount of income tax being paid by a small farmer with an income of, say, £4,000 or £5,000, with normal personal allowances, would be very low, because he does not have the income and will not be able to set off his rates payment against his liability.  In other words, his rates payment will be far larger than the amount of income tax he would be paying under the normal code. Therefore, while the larger farmer will be enabled to avail of the concession under which rates can be set off against the payment of income tax&mdash;introduced as part of the Government's election manifesto of 1977&mdash;the smaller farmer affected by this Bill will be unable to avail of that concession, which compounds the situation for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that in my constituency of County Meath 1,425 farmers will be affected by the abolition of relief under this Bill.  In fact it is the third most seriously affected county in the country&mdash;Cork and Limerick having a larger number of farmers in the <Col N="953" /> category.  Anyway, in County Meath 1,425 will be affected, or more than one-third of all the farmers in that county will, as a result of this Bill, have a doubling of their rates.  That is a serious situation.</P>
      <P>Obviously the removal of that concession will lead to a large increase in rates for the farmers concerned and this rate is based on valuations assessed in the middle of the last century by a gentleman named Griffith.  Since then agricultural conditions have changed greatly but there has been no re-valuation of the land to take account of those changed conditions.  Therefore it will be seen that the provisions of the Bill will operate very unjustly as between the different categories of farmers throughout the country.  For instance, I am aware that there is one county where, on average, the incomes per head derived by the farmers are three times as large for each £ of valuation as they are in another county.  Yet the rates are more or less the same, depending on the situation in a particular county.  But a divergence of 3:1 in the actual income derived per £ of valuation is grossly inequitable.  To increase a tax system resting on such an unjust base is to compound and aggravate an existing injustice.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask what the Minister's policy is in relation to the valuation of land.  Is he in favour of revaluing land?  If there is to be an increase in rates, I would have thought that the farmer who has five children should get a larger relief against rates than a farmer who has no children.  It seems completely unfair that a farmer with a large family will pay exactly the same rates as a farmer with no family at all and I would ask whether the Minister is prepared to introduce some form of personal allowance system to allow people, farmers or otherwise, who have large families to get some relief on rates to take account of the responsibilities they must meet from what they earn on the rated premises, as against people who have fewer responsibilities and for whom the increase in rates may be a minor issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The effect of section (1) of this Bill is to take away relief in respect of rates from all farmers with a valuation between £60 and £40.  That relief has been enjoyed by these farmers since 1939.  In fact, until the present Government assumed office all farmers enjoyed relief in respect of rates on agricultural land.  In 1978 the present Government abolished that relief on all holdings having a valuation in excess of £75 and thereby saved £7 million in grants.  In 1979 they abolished relief in respect of rates on agricultural holdings having valuations down to £60 and in that way they saved another £2 million, making a total saving of £9 million.  I should like the Minister to tell us what saving will be effected by the further reduction of the qualifying valuation from £60 to £40 this year.  I posed the same question on Second Stage but we were not given the information.  There is a lack of confidence in the farming community and farmers do not know what the future holds for them.  They are being attacked at home and abroad and it is deplorable that a further reduction in rates relief should be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rating system has been acknowledged by all Governments as an inequitable and unfair system of taxation and we must bear that in mind when we are extending it fully to some thousands of farmers.  The system takes no regard of the ability of the rated occupier to pay, whether he is a wealthy man or has only a small income.  Secondly, the yardstick by which rates are collected is anticipated.  As Deputy Bruton said, it is based on the Griffith valuation which commenced the valuation of land in 1850 and concluded in 1865.  It is well known and accepted that it was antiquated and out of date before it was finished and that there is no relation at all between the earning capacity of the land and the valuation put on it.  For example, one of the counties which I represent, County Monaghan, has one of the highest valuations in Ireland, equal to or higher than that of County Meath.  The explanation given is that flax was grown in Monaghan about 1860 and the land <Col N="955" /> was regarded as very suitable for the production of this crop.  As we know, flax has not been produced in this country since the last war.  That is an absurd system of taxation imposed on the agricultural community which is now being extended.</P>
    <P>Why are the Government proceeding to extend rates on agricultural land at a time when they have set up a commission to inquire into agricultural taxation? Why not await the report of that commission? Before they have an opportunity of producing a report, the Government introduced this Bill to bring thousands more farmers into the full rating system.</P>

It represents over 11 per cent of all road grant allocations notified to local authorities this year and maintains the significant improvement made in the level of grants available to the council since 1976.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme which enables local authorities to provide subsidised sites for private housing for disposal to certain categories of applicants, including those referred to in the Deputy's question at prices in general significantly below their market value has been operated by my Department since 1967.  The effect of the subsidy is that sites can be disposed of at prices of up to £500 less than the cost to the authorities of acquisition and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the enactment of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1977, which came into force on 16 May 1978, and prohibits the creation of new ground rents, such sites were disposed of on a leasehold basis, by way of outright <Col N="964" /> purchase or on an instalment basis and the ground rent charged was purely nominal.</P>
    <P>Since 16 May 1978, sites may be disposed of only on a fee simple basis.  The value of the site may, however, be included in the normal house purchase loan advanced by local authorities under section 39 of the Housing Act, 1966, subject to the amount of the loan not exceeding the maximum loan limit fixed from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>An increasing number of people are availing of the scheme. Since the Government increased the loan from £9,000 to £12,000 there seems to be an upswing in private development. For the first four months of the year there has been an increase of 22 per cent in new house grant applications.</P>

In view of the restrictions placed on the scheme that has been operating since 1969 as a result of his Government's legislation, will he consider introducing new proposals to enable local authorities to subsidise the cost of sites to qualified applicants in excess of the current restrictions?</P>

Inspections with a view to the approval of ordinary house improvement grants are proceeding as well as inspections in cases where notification of the completion of work has been received.  Because of the very large number of applications received prior to the termination of the house improvement grants scheme on 21 January and the unprecedented number of applications received subsequently, inspection delays are inevitable.

The Cabinet Minister yesterday indicated that after a conversation with the Minister of State they had mutually agreed that certain applications after the closing date would be considered.  Since the money involved here is neither the Minister's nor the Minister of State's property but taxpayers' money, surely the general body of taxpayers are entitled to know what criteria have been adopted for payments of grants after the expiry date.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been examined in consultation with the Labour Court.  The conclusion reached was that the pattern of demand made on the conciliation service as between Dublin and other areas does not call for decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each industrial relations officer is allotted disputes in a designated provincial area in addition to disputes handled in Dublin.  Each officer can thus become familiar with such matters as the employment patterns, working conditions and industrial relations problems of the area and can also establish a relationship with representatives of trade unions and employer organisations there.  The officer travels to the assigned provincial <Col N="978" /> area as occasion demands.  I have had no complaint to establish that disputes outside Dublin have suffered as regards availability of conciliation service. However, should such a situation develop I shall of course review the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first part of that question, I would not disagree with the Deputy when he says that preventative machinery would be very useful.  That is an aspect of this area that I am considering at present.  As to the content of this question, I have explained to the House my reasons for believing that the present system appears to be working satisfactorily.  This is a system whereby an industrial relations officer is designated to a provincial area so that he can become acquainted with both sides in industry in the area.  I am not aware of any delay of any consequence in IRO hearings in the provinces.  For the Deputy's information I might add that of the disputes dealt with by the conciliation service in 1979 about 1,000 were in Dublin and about 600 were in the rest of the country.</P>

Accordingly, new training programmes are brought on stream and existing courses continually reviewed.  It is to be expected, therefore, that some training programmes will be developed and run once or, perhaps several times, and then phased out.  Also <Col N="980" /> a similar programme may be run by a different agency and in a different location.</P>

      <P>Statements of this nature at this stage would be premature and could possibly be regarded as being unhelpful.  The Deputy should be aware that the Taoiseach has said that the Government will work very hard to secure a new national understanding. This is because we believe there are benefits and advantages to be gained by the community from such a system but at a time when one party are having a delegate conference while the other are <Col N="981" /> considering the matter, a statement such as that requested by the Deputy would be regarded as premature and, possibly, irresponsible.</P>

What I said and what I am happy to be able to repeat is that the first quarter of this year has been the best quarter since we began compiling estimates of records of this nature.  During the last quarter of last year we had an improved industrial relations climate.  If the Deputy bothers to check my statements he will find I referred on a number of occasions to a considerable improvement in those two quarters.  I am not necessarily saying that we must not strive for further improvement. I am on record as having said that I believe the national understanding made a worthwhile contribution to that industrial improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Since its publication in December 1972 the report of the Commission on the Status of Women has been accepted as containing the terms of reference for the reforms which will lead to the elimination of discrimination against women in our society.</P>
      <P>Of the 75 recommendations made 41 have been implemented, nine have been implemented in part.  As to the remaining 25 the implementation of three is in progress and the implementation of a further four is under consideration.  Sixteen have not been implemented to date and two are no longer applicable.</P>
      <P>There remain areas of discrimination and difficulty for women in Irish society. One major area is that of paid maternity leave.  I have circulated proposals for legislation to Government Departments and I propose to discuss the matter also with the social partners.  I am to introduce legislation during the next session of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Other important items remain.  Certain aspects of family law are under consideration with the Law Reform Commission and the Minister for Justice; criminal conversation and related matters are included as indicated by the Minister for Justice recently in the Dáil. Child care facilities are under consideration in the relevant Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The changing of attitudes is a major factor in the elimination of discrimination against women in our society.  I am convinced that education has a major role to play in this change.  At my request the Employment Equality Agency have commissioned a research project on the extent to which curricular differences in post-primary schools may be contributing to the inequality of employment opportunity for girls.</P>

    <P>Arrangements have been made for financial assistance to the Council for the Status of Women who will have a role relating to the elimination of the outstanding <Col N="988" /> areas of discrimination remaining over from the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I have pointed out that the system of collecting revenue for the State or local authorities by rates is unjust and inequitable because it does not have regard to the capacity of the ratepayer to pay.  It does not have any regard as to whether the ratepayer is well-off or in poor circumstances.  The yardstick or method of assessment, the poor law valuation system, is almost 150 years old and the criteria used when it was introduced are no longer valid.  The system was regarded as unjust and inequitable by all parties in this House and I would have thought that the method of collecting revenue for local authorities would have been changed away from rates.  We were astounded to find that on the return to power of Fianna Fáil they set about extending the system to the agricultural community.  In their first year in office they abolished the agricultural grant on valuations down to £75 and saved themselves £7 million. <Col N="999" /> That was later reduced to £60 valuation, saving another £2 million.  That £9 million went towards the rates Fianna Fáil removed from private houses although the former Taoiseach gave a solemn undertaking that there would not be any shifting of the rates from private houses to any other hereditaments, agricultural or industrial.</P>
      <P>Section 1 is being introduced in pursuance of a budget announcement by the Minister for Finance which was to the effect that one of the principal objectives of the budget was to introduce greater equity into the taxation system.  Instead of introducing greater equity this Bill is doing the direct opposite.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I will keep within those guidelines and, if I wish, I can keep within them for quite a while.  Instead of introducing equity the Government are extending the injustice of the rating system.  I should like to give some examples of this inequity.  Last year the rate in the £ was £11 and this year it has been increased to £12.  The effect of this is to increase the rates payable on a valuation of £40 from £198 to £480, an increase of 142 per cent.  The rates payable on a valuation of £41 will be increased from £205.7 last year to £492 this year while the rates payable on a valuation of £59 will increase from £344 to £708, an increase of 106 per cent.  It is worth noting that the highest percentage increase is on the lowest valuation in this bracket.  The <Col N="1000" /> percentage increase on a poor law valuation of £40 is 142 per cent while the percentage increase on a PLV of £59 is 106 per cent.  That is not introducing great equity into the taxation system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Chair is overlooking the fact that it is said that it is possible to take credit for the rates as against income tax.</P>
      <P>A married couple in the non-agricultural sector with an income of £3,400 are free of income tax and do not pay rates.  But a farmer who has a valuation of £34 and is deemed, according to the Agricultural Institute, to earn £3,400&mdash;the same as his non-agricultural friends&mdash;is liable for heavy rates.  If he were a non-agricultural person earning £4,000, married with two children, he would be free from income tax and would not pay rates.  But if he is a farmer with a poor law valuation of £40 with an assumed income according to the best information available&mdash;of £4,000 he is not liable to income tax but is liable for £480 rates.  I want to know whether that is introducing greater equity into the taxation system.  In my opinion it is discrimination against the farmer as compared with his non-agricultural counterpart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by the Minister, and his <Col N="1001" /> Minister of State, that of course the farmer will be given credit for those rates against his income tax liability, that is if he is liable to income tax.  All of us know that many farmers in the bracket about which we are now speaking, on the accounts system, or indeed on any other system, would not be liable to income tax because of their family commitments, their method of farming or their incomes.  Nevertheless these people are being called upon to pay heavy increases in rates this year as a result of the provisions of this Bill, increases ranging from the lowest rung of the group with which we are dealing, of 142 per cent in the case of a farmer with a £40 valuation on down to an increase of 106 per cent in the case of a farmer with a £59 valuation. That is totally unjust.  Furthermore, we are told that the farmer can deduct the rates from his income tax.  He cannot deduct this year's rates from this year's income tax; he can deduct last year's rates from this year's income tax if he is liable to income tax.  Now he is being asked to pay portion of his income tax liability one year in advance, again discriminating against the farming community as compared with the non-farming sector.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us how much this reduction in the poor law valuation for the agricultural grant will save the Exchequer this year.  In my opinion it will save approximately £10 million in round figures.  If that sum of £10 million is correct, or anything like correct, it will mean that the Government will have saved approximately £20 million in agricultural grants since they assumed office.  If that is so it constitutes a serious transfer of the rates on private dwellings to agricultural land and is in contravention of the solemn assurance given by the former Taoiseach when it was alleged that rates on private dwellings would be transferred by this Government to industrial buildings or to agricultural land.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The only point I was making&mdash;and I submit with the greatest respect is a relevant one&mdash;was that this section transfers rates from private houses to agricultural land.  I want to put on record that I am against that and contend that it is relevant to do so.  It is against an assurance given by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, when he was challenged on this in relation to the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  I have made my case as strenuously and, I hope, as clearly as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> I have taken a rate of £11 in the £ for last year and £12 for this year, a conservative rate because I understand that the rate in the £ in Mayo is £17.46 and in Kerry £15.11.  Of course the effect on farmers there with valuations of £40 and upwards would be much more serious.  I readily concede that there would not be the same percentage of such farmers in Mayo or Kerry as there would be perhaps in Counties Kildare and Meath. But so far as my constituency is concerned many farmers will be affected by this unjust operation.  Between the two counties there are 1,171 farmers who will be affected in addition to those who were brought into the full rating system last year and the year before.  There are 495 such farmers in County Cavan and 676 in County Monaghan.  I am sure they will be very concerned about section 1 which transfers rates from the private houses of well-off people to farms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to this protest because I represent a constituency where 1,500 farmers will be affected.  We were told two years ago that any section of the community which did not derive benefit from the abolition of domestic rates would not have to pay extra.  In this case the Government are more than doubling rates for many people. The Minister may say that farmers derive benefit from the abolition of domestic rates but the people who will be affected by the provisions of this Bill generally live in older houses which have an average valuation of £5.  We must compare that with the average valuation of a new bungalow at £23 or £24.  People who have a good income may benefit from the abolition of rates and I am not suggesting that I am opposed to this.  I was one of those associated with the Government which began the abolition of domestic rates, but it was not then suggested that the difference would be made up by any other section of the community.  The original intention was that the expense would be borne by the Exchequer and in this Bill we have a complete turn around.  This Government <Col N="1004" /> have given the impression that there would be protection against further increases for other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The local authorities will not derive any benefit as a result of this imposition. If some portion were to be given to the local authorities, I would be prepared to accept it because it is badly needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks about relief but there is no relief whatsoever for those with a valuation between zero and £40. This year the agricultural sector are badly off.  There are counties which will not suffer but there is an obligation on me to protest at this measure because I represent a constituency where the rates of 1,500 people will be doubled.  We are being told that they are not making an extra contribution and are not subsidising anybody but it can be clearly seen that the farming community are the victims when one considers the allocation to county councils this year in respect of domestic rates and compares that with the agricultural grant during the past three years.  I am not opposed to big farmers making a contribution but this measure will affect people of very limited means.  Deputy Bruton has already given the average rural income and every rural Deputy is familiar with these facts.</P>
      <P>In speaking of Munster I am speaking of people with more than average good land but there are people in my constituency with valuations of £40 and £50 who are in dire straits to meet their rates at present.  I shudder to think that a rural Deputy would vote in favour of this Bill. I would welcome a contribution from the backbenchers on the Government side in regard to this measure.  I could not defend it and I doubt if it could be defended by anybody else, particularly by those who made certain statements in 1977. An opportunity has been taken by the Government who are in dire straits for finance and it is obvious that the agricultural sector is the most vulnerable.  I hope the Minister will reconsider it in view of the serious consequences for the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to <Col N="1005" /> make available to farmers relief in respect of rates.  If this Bill fails to pass through the House we cannot pay to the local authorities relief which would be due for people who still qualify.  The amount involved this year is £37.7 million and the Bill is necessary in order to permit us to pay that sum on behalf of farmers who are entitled to relief. Deputy Fitzpatrick asked how big a saving is involved and the sum involved is £6 million, not £10 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cost an extra £6 million.  Regarding the allegation that farmers are being asked to bear the burden of the relief of domestic rates, the grant this year <i>in lieu</i> of rates on domestic dwellings, community halls and farm out-buildings comes to just over £107 million.  This is being paid by the Exchequer or, in other words, by the taxpayer. The total amount this year for the relief of agricultural rates is £37.7 million, making a total of more than £144 million from the Exchequer and the taxpayer for the relief of rates.  We must have this Bill in order to make this relief available to farmers having a valuation below £40.</P>
      <P>There are 497,686 rated agricultural holdings.  Of this number, 396,871 are under £20 valuation and no rates are paid.  Of the remainder, 58,684 have valuations between £20 and £40 and there is partial relief.  There is 80 per cent relief on the rate up to £20 valuation and 30 per cent on the remainder, except for those between £20 and £33 who pay the full rate in the £13 as well as getting relief on the £20.  The number of holdings affected by the fact that the ceiling has been lowered from £60 to £40 this year is just over 20,000.  In Deputy Fitzpatrick's county there are 19,969 rated holdings under £20 valuation. There are 2,865 between £20 and £40 which are getting partial relief and there are 495 holdings with valuations between £40 and £60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section mentions anomalies in our <Col N="1006" /> valuation system and the unfairness and inequity involved in them. We debated this question about two years ago.  All agreed that the valuation system is not the fairest system possible where land is concerned.  This is because of the variations from one area to another, even in small areas inside the same county, caused by the famous Griffith's valuation and the manner in which the valuation of land was assessed at that time.  However, that is the valuation system on which we still work.  Changes in the valuation system where land is concerned are not a matter for my Department. The Valuation Office comes under the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at the moment to revalue the land of this country.  I have heard mention of valuations on an acreage basis or some such system, but I understand that the farming organisations are opposed to this.  In other words, they would prefer the existing valuation system.  The present system is the only way we have of levying rates on land at present.  The question of asking the farming community to bear a major or sizeable part of the burden caused by the derating on the domestic side is not correct.  All that is being saved&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;this year is £6 million.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Minister aware of the effect of the agricultural relief grant on all holdings over £40 valuation?  How many would be involved?  There were nine previously, but that would have to be adjusted.  I imagine it would be in the neighbourhood of 20.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that figure available right now.  As the Deputy will understand from the figures I have given, there are 58,600-odd holdings between <Col N="1007" /> £20 and £40 valuation, almost 400,000 derated under £20.  Adding those gives approximately something in excess of 30,000 holdings over £60.</P>
      <P>The total figure involved asked for by Deputy Fitzpatrick would be £17 million.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 1 is to permit us to give relief of £37.7 million to farm holdings under £40 valuation.  We need this Bill in order to make that money available to the local authorities <i>in lieu</i> of the derating.  Deputy Enright asked me to withdraw this section.  Withdrawal of this section means withdrawal of £37.7 million from the farming community. The Deputies across the way must decide whether or not they want this sum made available under the relief of rates scheme.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the number of farmers who could set this off against income tax.  There is no hard and fast rule.  All farmers cannot be treated alike with respect to their liability to income tax.  Some types of farming would make farmers more liable to income tax possibly than their neighbours. Last year might not have been a good year for cattle, but it was not a bad year for the milk industry.  Since payment is on accounts one cannot say whether it is of benefit to a farmer or not.  It would be a benefit to quite a number of people to set this off against income tax.  The Deputy mentioned that it would be next year's income tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that this is a relief of rates for farmers. Certainly, this is a misnomer.  This Bill could not be called a relief of rates for farmers.  It is a relief as far as the present Government are concerned; but as far as the farmers between £40 and £60 valuation are concerned it is a savage attack on them.  Those small farmers have often been told by Fianna Fáil in the past that they were the backbone of this country. We all know that they stood in the past between the people and hunger and want.  They worked long hours.  They were not promised this form of taxation when the Fianna Fáil canvassers went around the country in the dead of night saying that the Coalition Government had taxed them out of existence.</P>

      <P>They claimed that they would relieve the farmers of taxation. Instead of relief, they get this savage attack by the Fianna Fáil Government.  A small farmer with £40 poor law valuation in County Longford pays £266.84 extra in rates.  That is the relief that the Government are giving this unfortunate man under this Bill.  That is almost £5 per week, after the farmers of Longford have had a very bad year. Very few of them are engaged in the milk industry.  Their land is not suitable for tillage and the vast majority are engaged in cattle production.  They purchased cattle in many cases at £50 per cwt and sold them during the winter at £39 to £40 per cwt.  In Westmeath the small farmer loses £271 and, what is worse, those farmers must engage an accountant because they are in the income tax bracket.  They may find that they have no income tax to pay, but will have to pay the accountant anything from £200 to £400 for telling them that they are not liable for income tax.  That is putting a further £4 per week on these people. Therefore they have an extra burden of from £9 to £10 per week with an inflation rate of 20 per cent and cost of living increases.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with it.  I am speaking about the £50 poor law valuation.  In Longford the farmer pays £266 extra.  Is that a relief for that man, to put an extra £10 per week on him?  In Westmeath he pays an extra £238. Where is the relief for these people?  The farmer with a £60 poor law valuation in Westmeath pays £266 extra and in Longford almost £400 extra.  Will that farmer call that a relief?  Will it help the small farmer with a family to increase production?  The Minister said that he could set it off against his income tax. For a start off he can only set off last year's against his income tax, that is, if he is liable for income tax.  Many farmers under £50 valuation will not be liable for income tax.</P>
      <P>The Government in this Bill are imposing an extra burden of anything from £8 to £14 per week on those people. There are 928 people involved in Longford-Westmeath, with poor law valuations between £40 and £60.  There are 361 affected in Longford.  That makes 1,289.  The Minister in replying to me on the last day mentioned the relief that those under £40 valuation will get. The bachelor with £39 poor law valuation will be getting the full relief.  Where is the equity there?  Will anyone turn around to his neighbour and say &ldquo;Are you over £40 valuation?  We shall pay quarter, or half of your rates&rdquo;?  They will not and there is very little use in pointing that out to anyone in this House.</P>
      <P>Instead of a relief, this is a savage attack and, indeed, not for the first time by a Fianna Fáil Government.  That is the same Government that jailed the farmers in the past, the dairy farmers who marched peacefully outside Leinster House.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's reply to previous speakers. The day is past when people can be fooled by figures.  The Minister gave us a figure of 396,000 for people with a valuation of less than £20.  If that is correct then these people are living below subsistence level and they cannot be expected to pay rates.  The remainder, somewhere in the region of 90,000 people, will be responsible for a certain percentage of rates and those with a valuation of £40 and more will be responsible for full rates.  According to the Minister's figures these people will contribute somewhere in the region of £100 million, taking rates, income tax and levies into consideration.  I object to the heading of the Bill.  The word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; is in the title but the only group getting relief will be the Government.  There is no way that people can be fooled from now on.  The impression has been given that the farmers are getting relief but it was available before Fianna Fáil came into government.  People with a valuation of up to £60 got relief of rates but now the Government have reduced the threshold to £20 valuation.</P>

      <P>They could not afford to do that.  They would be much worse off than people with valuations just under £40.  The position has not been explained in the explanatory memorandum or by the Minister.  Rates on agricultural land are a means of collecting tax in order to provide services for local authorities in particular.  Tax collected at this level should be related to income.  Rates must be described as taxes and they do not relate to income or family circumstances. The increase of rates, particularly in the category of £40 to £60 valuations, is becoming a burden.  This is especially the case in high valuation areas such as Wexford.  There are high valuations in the Macamore area which is well known to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You are talking about relief in the the Bill but people with a valuation of £50 will be responsible for approximately £12 per £ valuation.  That will be approximately £600 and they will also be responsible for full taxes because their valuations are in excess of £40.  As Deputy L'Estrange pointed out, these people will have to pay an accountant and that may cost them £300.  Some of these people may have only 60 acres and their return last year would have been in the region of £3,000.  Their rates bill will <Col N="1013" /> be £600, they will have to pay £300 to an accountant and this total is approximately 30 per cent of their income and you are responsible for making them pay this amount in 1980.</P>

The Minister is putting a burden on <Col N="1014" /> over-burdened people to the tune of 30 per cent of their gross income for 1980 in some cases.  What is the position of people with valuations of between £20 and £40?  Will they get the 30 per cent relief mentioned here?  The position is certainly not explained and is very misleading.</P>

      <P>With some justification in the past politicians have been treated as a joke and it was considered that they spoke from both sides of their mouths.  When a Minister of State brings in this sort of Bill we cannot blame the people for thinking like that about us.

If we are doing an injustice to only one person the <Col N="1015" /> Bill is wrong.  Numbers have nothing to do with it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tried to make what could only be described as a semantic point when he claimed that this was a relief measure.  Reliefs which existed up to now required to be renewed by statute every so often and were renewed automatically in previous years. This year instead of being renewed reliefs were substantially cut.  It is purely an accident that it has been the practice to renew this relief by statute every so often. It is not as if on each occasion the statute was reintroduced and a new set of reliefs introduced.  All that happened was that reliefs which existed up to now were renewed.  The difference on this occasion is that instead of merely keeping existing reliefs in being the Minister is reducing these reliefs substantially.</P>
      <P>What is happening in this Bill, whatever the Minister may argue from a legalistic point of view, is a substantial reduction in reliefs.  The Minister may seek to get a few lines in the paper conveying the idea that this is a relief measure and anybody who does not study the thing might be fooled into thinking that it is so, and not read any further, but the Minister will not fool any of the farming community or anybody in this House by using those terms.  As a result of this Bill the property tax&mdash;-because that is what it is&mdash;payable by farmers in the £40 to £60 valuation range will be far higher than the property tax being paid by any farmer in any country in the EEC.  I challenge the Minister to controvert that statement. Will the Minister inquire into this matter to assure himself that I am correct, although I am satisfied that I am.</P>
      <P>If a farmer in Monaghan goes a few miles down the road into County Armagh he will meet a farmer in the same situation as himself working the same type of land but the Monaghan farmer will be paying substantial rates whereas the farmer in Armagh will pay no rates.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered satisfactory the question about the divergent effects of this section on different sections of the community. It has not been contested by the Minister that the amount of income actually derived by farmers on valuations between £40 and £60 per £ of valuation can vary in a ratio of 3:1, depending on what part of the country they are living in.  In some parts of the country a farmer with a valuation of £40 could be earning three times as much as a farmer with a valuation of £40 in another county.</P>
      <P>That has been borne out by studies carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute and by the farm management survey of the Agricultural Institute.  There is no doubt about that. Yet, no allowance for that is made in this legislation which will apply straight across the board to all farmers with valuations in excess of £40.  In some counties some farmers can earn an income of only one-third of the income of another farmer with exactly the same valuation in another county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course of events if this were a tax measure, at this stage we would be able to introduce amendments to remedy the anomalies with which we are confronted, such as the one I have mentioned about the divergence in income relative to valuations in different parts of the country.  Because strictly speaking this is not a tax measure, because it is merely a renewal of a relief, any amendment to remove that anomaly, if moved from this side of the <Col N="1019" /> House, would be deemed to be imposing a potential charge on the Exchequer and would be ruled out of order.  If it were a matter of imposing exactly the same additional charges in the form of a Finance Bill, rather than in the form of an alleged relief Bill, we would have no problems at all about introducing amendments to reduce the burden of tax.  Unfortunately, we are forced to raise it in the form of a general discussion.  It is not my preference that we have to discuss it in this way.  I would prefer to discuss it in the context of specific amendments. When this matter was before the House earlier I sought to introduce amendments and they were all ruled out of order, rightly, by the Chair, given the form of the Bill.</P>

He is empowered to do something in this instance which no other Deputy is empowered to do.</P>

    <P>I would ask him if he is prepared to introduce an amendment to the section providing that the reliefs which applied prior to the introduction of this Bill will apply in a case where it can be shown that, in a particular county, the income levels per £ of valuation are substantially below the average for income levels per £ of valuation in the country at large.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider an amendment of that nature.  I agree this could not be done in all counties. Perhaps the Minister could say that if it could be shown that the income levels were, shall we say, 40 per cent below average in a particular county per £ of valuation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the national average, a system would be introduced <Col N="1020" /> whereby the reliefs which existed prior to this year would be allowed to apply. Given the figures I have mentioned, would the Minister be prepared to consider such an amendment which he can do and which I cannot?</P>

      <P>The Minister is not disposed to answer at the moment.  I am amazed and really worried that the Minister has given in to what I would describe as the anti-farmer lobby within the Government who have deprived numbers of people whose valuations are £40 and in excess of £40 of rates relief. That was unexpected.  It is quite obvious that rural Deputies, the people who have a rural outlook within the Cabinet, are dominated and overpowered by the thinking of the city-orientated members of the Government.  I believe the Minister has a proper understanding and a proper perception of what an agricultural income is in the west.  I do not believe he would introduce a Bill such as this and exclude practically 1,000 people in his own County Clare, if he had a free hand.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what this Bill is doing. It is excluding 1,000 people with valuations between £40 and £60.  It is depriving them of a total sum of £184,000. That is what the anti-farmer lobby in the Government have done to the farmers in County Clare.  I certainly will oppose this section of the Bill which is deceptive in its introduction and its memorandum and attempts to gloss over its real purpose. I will oppose it and I will vote against it.  If I did not, I would be accepting something which the farmers themselves resent, particularly after a year in which they had to overcome many hardships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what I said, but we cannot give too much publicity to the losses which the farmers in that income bracket in each county are suffering. I am particularly interested in the groups which have developed in County <Col N="1021" /> Clare, particularly, in the dairying areas and adjacent to the seashore, where valuations are excessively high.  On their behalf, I protest in the strongest way against the introduction of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The amendment Deputy Bruton proposes would be impossible to administer. How could one establish an average income per valuation for a particular county or for different farms?</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor is worried because I am not worried about Clare farmers.  In Clare there is a total of 23,529 holdings with valuations under £20.  I would say a big number of those are in the part of the county where Deputy Taylor lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to counties such as Monaghan, and indeed to parts of my county where incomes per £1 are very low, I suggested to the Minister that he introduce an amendment to the effect that where it can be shown that county incomes per £1 of valuation on the farm are more than 40 per cent below the national average a system be introduced whereby the reliefs which existed previously should be allowed.  The Minister said that this would be impossible administratively but I do not agree. The relevant figures are available.  The ESRI have just completed a study&mdash;it was carried out by Mr. Micheál Ross&mdash;which dealt precisely with this point of county incomes in agriculture.  It is possible to relate this information to <Col N="1024" /> valuations.  The Agricultural Institute have carried out extensive studies in the course of their farm management survey regarding the relating of what is earned to the amount actually earned per £1 valuation.  The national average is about £100 per £1 valuation but there are wide variations around this average.  In some cases people would be earning as low as £30 or £40 per £1 valuation while in other cases the figure would be much higher.  The Minister should introduce an amendment using the existing published data produced by the ESRI and by the Agricultural Institute for the purpose of producing an index that he could use or, if he is not satisfied to use these sources, he could commission the Central Statistics Office to produce a special study for this purpose.  The system I have in mind would rectify the situation in counties in which incomes in agriculture are well below the average. This would be one way of dealing with the problem even if, admittedly, it would be crude and unsatisfactory.  It would be one way of mitigating the obvious injustices of this section.</P>
      <P>Another amendment that the Minister should introduce to the section is one to provide for some system of personal allowances against rates for those in the £40 to £60 valuation band and whose rates will now be almost doubled.  In my earlier contribution I illustrated that the injustices, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the PAYE sector, of the rating system are far greater in the £40 and £60 valuation band than is the case among any other category of farmers. Therefore there would be justification for some special system of relief for those in the £40 to £60 band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister introduce an amendment to allow a farmer with children under 18 to claim in that respect against his rates.  This will apply both to farmers with families and to those without families.  Large families are common in rural Ireland but particularly so among farmers in the category I am talking of.  Demographic data could be adduced to sustain that case.  If it is justifiable to have a system of personal allowances in respect of income tax for <Col N="1025" /> people who find income tax burdensome, why should there not be a personal allowance in respect of wives and children for the purposes of the rating system for farmers?  The Government have always used the case of rates paid by farmers in their arguments with the trade union movement about the amount of taxation being paid by farmers and have always treated rates as a contribution by the farmers to the Exchequer. Business people or PAYE workers are making a contribution out of their incomes to the Exchequer but they are allowed to claim in respect of their families.  The same allowances should apply to farmers especially those with large families.  The Minister must not complain that the administration of such a system would be difficult.  The data relating to the marital status of any farmer and to the number of children concerned is available in the Department of Social Welfare in respect of eligibility for children's allowances.  If the data in respect of children's allowances were supplied there would be no difficulty in computing the amount of rates remission that should be allowed to the farmer in respect of the number of children he has.  The Minister should consider very seriously an amendment along these lines which would be administratively quite simple to operate and would introduce a measure of justice into the provisions of this section.  I hope the Minister will consider this very carefully.</P>
    <P>There is another amendment which the Minister should consider in respect of this matter, that is, to allow some relief against rates to farmers in the £40 to £60 valuation range affected by this section for the cyclical nature of agriculture.  Under this Bill some farmers in certain years will not have any income, not a single penny, and will not be able to set off their rates against income tax because they will not pay income tax.  They will pay full rates in a year in which they did not have any income. Last year there were many farmers who did not have any income and some had negative incomes.  The Minister as good as admitted that in the debate when he <Col N="1026" /> referred to the position of the cattle trade last year.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be an amendment to this section and that a variable relief should be allowed to take account of the cyclical nature of agriculture.  I would be happy if this were confined to farmers below £60 valuation because farmers above £60 valuation can look after themselves.  They usually have the possibility of having more than one enterprise on their farms.  If one enterprise is going badly, the other may be going reasonably well.  They can inure themselves against the cyclical nature of agriculture more readily than can the small farmer who, because of the size of his farm, if he wants to be any way intensive, is driven into having a single enterprise system.  It is only by having a single enterprise that he can get any economies of scale into his farming operation.  The larger farmer can afford to have two or three enterprises and still obtain economies of scale.  He is not so much affected by the cyclical nature of the position.</P>
    <P>A farmer under £60 valuation, which is the classic case of a full-time small farmer, usually will be single enterprise in either milk or cattle.  If the cattle trade goes bad&mdash;and this is the example I am particularly concerned with&mdash;that man could find himself without any income in a particular year, or if he borrowed money he could find he had a negative income.</P>
    <P>There should be some provision built into the legislation so that, when price indices in agriculture for a particular range of commodities to be chosen fall below a certain line relative to the general rate of inflation, automatically a formula could be worked out quite easily by relating the agricultural prices index and the consumer price index&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It behoves all Deputies to apply their best thoughts to some system of rates relief, and that is what I have been trying to do. What disillusions people most about debates in this House is that when Deputies protest that the system is unjust they cannot or will not do anything about it.  We on this side of the House cannot do anything about it.  The Minister admits it is unjust but he will not do anything about it, and that is more disillusioning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for elaboration of this section. Subsection (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, shall apply to the local financial years ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, the 31st day of December, 1981, and the 31st day of December, 1982....</P>
      <P>What are the Minister's intentions after 1982, if he still has influence on matters after that date?  It is important that the Government should outline their long-term views on this matter. Will the Minister consider extending the date to 1990? Why stop dead at 1982?  The fact that the three dates were put in and no further dates envisaged suggests that there will be a worse and more draconian change in the rating system after 1982.  That is why we ought to have the benefit of the Government's long-term views on this because it is impossible for the Commission on Income Taxation to discuss this as far as farmers are concerned. They are not aware of the long-term views of the Government with regard to rates, an essential component of farmer taxation.  Is it the intention of the Minister to make any submission to the commission indicating his views on this matter?</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate on subsection (2) which states:</P>
      <P>(2) (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, a rating authority (within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1946) shall not apply the Act aforesaid to a person, as respects a local financial year, if the valuation of all the tenements of agricultural land in respect of which he is rated and which are situated&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) in the rating area of a county, or</P>
      <P>(ii) in a part of the rating area of a county borough, borough or urban district, being a part which before the 2nd day of March, 1976, formed part of a county health district,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> I should like to know what is meant by a rating area of a county borough, borough or urban district which formed part of a county health district before 2 March 1976.  What is the significance of that date?  I should like an explanation of the reference to Land Commission land. Does this refer to land that is in the hands of the Land Commission prior to division and which is being rented by them on the 11-month system?  Does it mean land which has been distributed by the Land Commission to tenants but not yet vested?  A large proportion of the land held by the Land Commission has been divided but is nominally in the ownership of the Land Commission in that the tenant is paying an annuity and is not the outright owner.  I should be grateful if the Minister would say whether tenements of agricultural land in respect of which the Land Commission is rated includes all those people.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister flatly refused to have any examination carried out of the Griffith valuation. Why did he dismiss the matter?  Has the matter been discussed by his colleagues? I would have thought that there were serious anomalies in this system and there should be some means by which they can be corrected.  I do not think it is necessary to go to the extent of revaluing every piece of land.</P>

      <P>The basis for levying rates is the valuation system and any changes would have to be in the valuation system.  That is not a matter for this Bill or my Department; it is a matter for the Minister for Finance who is responsible for the valuation authority.  Deputy Bruton asked if it would be possible to revalue part of the country or some areas.  That would not be possible.  It would be necessary to carry out a total valuation of the country which would take some years.  The Deputy asked me <Col N="1031" /> to explain the reason why this Bill covers three years.  I should like to point out that previous legislation covered two years.  At the end of this three-year period the position will be reviewed.  I should like to tell the Deputy that since 1976 where extensions of urban areas or boroughs have taken place into county council areas the rates relief has applied to such areas and that is why they are mentioned in this section.  The reference to Land Commission means that lands where the Land Commission are the rated occupiers will be treated as one unit or one holding.  There will not be any aggregation of the holdings of the Land Commission.  Where the Land Commission are the rated occupiers it will be treated as one holding and it does not have anything to do with land the commission have divided or allocated.</P>

      <P>I was talking about counties which are below average income and was not suggesting a revaluation of those counties.  I was suggesting that the reliefs which existed prior to the introduction of this Bill should be allowed in those counties. The reliefs should be restored in respect of counties where the income is very low by comparison with the valuation. Therefore, the Minister's objection that the valuation would take a long time does not apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Minister stated that he sees the injustice of the valuation system he is not prepared to do anything about it and that is disappointing. There was a great hue and cry against rates on houses and, although they were unjust and capricious, the rates paid on houses represented a smaller share of actual income than the rates paid on land by the categories of farmers we are concerned with in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is an injustice in the application of the rating system to the people with whom the Bill is concerned it is because it relates to a greater share of <Col N="1032" /> their income.  It is greater than any injustice that may have existed in respect of the rating or otherwise of houses.  If this legislation concerned more people than just a small section of the farming community the Minister would not get away with the attitude he has adopted because the pressure that would be put on him, electorally and otherwise, would be irresistible.  It is because this section of the farming community affected by the Bill are not as electorally significant as home owners are that an injustice, which is admitted by all sides, is being left in existence.  That is bad.  The Minister is aware that he is presiding over and implementing a system of unjust and capricious taxation.  The fact that he can do so with a straight face and no apparent expression of concern is a serious reflection on him or on his ability to influence his colleagues.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It has now become clear that this section and the similar section of the 1978 Bill introduced by the Minister is collecting an additional £17 million from farmers.  If the position had obtained as it was when Fianna Fáil resumed office, this year farmers would be paying £17 million less in rates than they are now being asked.  That is rather disgraceful coming from a Government who wrote a small paragraph into their election manifesto regarding rates and tax to the effect that Fianna Fáil would retain the notional system of farm taxation and allow rates on agricultural land as an instalment of farmers' tax bills.  It was added further that taxes due under the national system would be payable at the end of each year and that farmers <Col N="1033" /> would be free to opt for assessment by farm accounts.  There is there not one hint of any change in the method of assessing rates on farmers, or in the method of collecting rates from them. Yet, as a result of a direct action by this Government since their return to office, they will this year collect £17 million extra from farmers.  In fact they will collect more because, in addition to that, they have imposed a resource tax which will bring in another few million pounds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said his second budgetary objective was to improve the position of those on lower incomes. This section rather than improving their position attacks those on lower incomes.  As I have illustrated already, it increases the demand for rates on a poor law valuation of £40 by 142 per cent, whereas the increase for those farmers <Col N="1034" /> with a poor law valuation of £59 will be increased by 106 per cent.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The average increase&mdash;I did not give this before&mdash;in the valuation band between £40 and £60 is 124 per cent but the lower income group are being asked to pay 142 per cent.  Therefore this is an attack on the lower income people rather than an effort to improve their lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amongst other things the Minister for Finance gave as his third and final budgetary objective the protection of sources of economic growth.  I cannot see this as anything other than an attack on one source of economic growth, that is, agricultural production, because this is not a tax on wealth from production but rather constitutes an addition to the overhead expenses of the farming sector and, to that extent, is an attack on the source of economic growth.  I can only assume that there must be very bad lines of communication between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment. The Minister for Finance comes into the House saying that he will introduce more equity into the taxation system, that he will improve the position of the lower income groups and sources of economic growth.  Then he sends his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, in with section 1 of this Bill which will reverse all of those things.  As Deputy D'Arcy rightly pointed out, the Minister, in an earlier contribution, was making a virtue out of necessity.  I do not know how many farmers the Minister <Col N="1035" /> said there are in this country&mdash;I think he spoke in terms of 400,000; that could not be so.

There are 11,778 holdings under one acre of land; 38,398 with less than five acres; 41,027 holding between five and 15 acres; 57,146 holding between 15 and 30 acres, with 56,344 holding between 30 and 50 acres.  In my opinion practically all of those would have a valuation of less than £40 and, of course, they are receiving some relief.  Most of them would have a valuation of less than £20 and would not be rated at all.  But is the Minister serious in saying that they should pay rates.

I mentioned earlier that this is a most inopportune time to change the system of rating in regard to agriculture which has existed for about 50 years.

      <P>Deputy Bruton has appealed to the Minister to make various amendments which we cannot make or even seek to make because they would impose a potential charge on the Revenue.  It is admitted by all that the rating system is unjust and the Griffith valuation is out of date.  There are various precedents for treating the western counties in a special way.  The old Congested Districts Board recognised certain areas in the west as being in need of special treatment and assistance.  The areas involved are referred to nowadays as the 12 western counties and this includes Monaghan, Cavan and Longford.  The Minister should bring in an amendment on Report Stage which would allow the present law regarding relief of rates to stand in regard to the 12 western counties.</P>

The Minister should be aware of the taxation position of farmers <i>vis-à-vis</i> their competitors in Europe.  The introduction of a system such as we are discussing affects the competitive position.  If input costs are increased the selling price of one's product must also be increased if one is to make a reasonable income.  The Minister has not given an answer on this matter and the information should be available because I understand that the <Col N="1039" /> Community are collating information on various systems of farm taxation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a case in respect of the western regions, but it is important to bear in mind that the concession he sought should not be confined only to western counties but should be extended to all disadvantaged areas. Some of these areas, such as parts of Laois and Offaly, are outside the western counties.  Very sophisticated means have been used to determine whether or not certain districts should be included in the areas deemed to be disadvantaged.  The bulk of that work has already been done by the Department of Agriculture and has been cross-checked by the European Commission.  There is no question of any being undeservedly included.</P>
      <P>There should not be allowed to exist a situation where people in a disadvantaged area have to pay a penal increase in rates.  The Irish Government are arguing in Brussels that farmers in the west are in a bad way and need help and assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The average valuation in the country is £1.10, speaking from memory.  I do not have the average for the different areas of the country.  In the western counties, to which the Deputy is probably referring, the valuations are low except in specific areas such as the Shannon estuary where they are £2.00 to £2.50 per acre&mdash;higher than Wexford, I can assure you.  That is again as a result of the Griffith valuation.  He decided that the land along the estuary was ideal for growing wheat, whereas by modern standards it is not suitable at all.  That is another anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any redeeming feature in the Griffith system of valuation it is that it has not changed over the years despite the improvements which have been made in production and land due to modern methods.  The valuation has remained static and cannot change without new legislation for the whole country.  On the other hand, a person could have a business and if he improves his business <Col N="1041" /> his valuation goes up.  That is the only redeeming feature about the system that I can see, anyway.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said that we were responsible now for making the farmers pay £17 million more since we came into power.  That is not correct.  At least it is not correct when one considers that we have relieved farming ratepayers of £12 million because of the domestic derating and derating of farm buildings which were still rated in 1977.  There is £12 million on the credit side there.  I do not have available the number of farmers liable for income tax who can set that off against the rates.  Seventeen million pounds extra is not a true figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that we were asking the farmers to pay this extra, but we reduced this commitment by £12 million under the derating of the domestic sector.  I do not have any information on the taxation system throughout the EEC.  This is not a taxation Bill.  This Bill, let me repeat again, is necessary in order to give £37.7 million relief to the farming community.  It is necessary to have the Bill to give legislative power to the local authorities to make that deduction in the demand notes when striking the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is outrageous that a Minister can come in here to introduce a measure which will dramatically increase the rates paid by farmers who are exporting and competing on the international market and admit that he does not know even the system of taxation which applies in the other countries with which Irish farmers are supposed to compete.  This is completely wrong.  The Minister should have that information about the system of property taxation applicable in other countries.  I repeat that as a result of this Bill the small farmers who will be affected by it will be paying substantially more property taxation than in any other country in Europe with which they are supposed to be competing. <Col N="1042" /> This is wrong.  We are an exporting country and must depend on export markets to sell our products successfully. If our farmers are forced to pay higher levels of property taxation regardless of whether they make a profit or not, they will not be able to compete equitably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a statement that the redeeming feature of the Griffith valuation was that it never changed.  I might point out that the use of the land changed.  Land which was highly productive when the Griffith valuation system was introduced is the low productive land now.  The land with the low valuation is now the high productive land.  This is where the inequity comes into the valuation system. This valuation system has completely outlived its usefulness.  If lands were suitable for beans and wheat at that time, they are not suitable today as a result of the movement from horse to machinery.  This land is unsuitable for high productivity and the Minister's own county has 40,000 acres of Macamore land.  This is able to produce only 75 per cent of its potential while the other land can produce up to 100 per cent.  Those are facts and are the results of modernisation. The Minister certainly has got it wrong when he said it has a redeeming feature.  There is no redeeming feature in the fact that the valuation has not changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, but the fact is that the average valuation of £1.10 means that people who are liable for rating in most counties will be talking in terms of £18 to £20 per acre.  That is a direct tax, taking the average into consideration.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> A brief intervention.  I stated when last speaking that the present Government were extracting £17 million more from farmers by way of rates this year than farmers would have been paying if the law were not changed. The Minister corrects me and says that that is not so.  Perhaps the Minister is technically correct.  Certainly the Government are extracting £17 million more from farmers in rates than they led the farmers to believe that they would have to pay.  Before the election they stated that the farmers would not have to pay rates on private houses.  Before the election they stated that they would not have to pay rates on farm buildings.  The farmers were entitled to assume that. The Government said that loudly and clearly all over the country, but never said a word about the abolition of relief in respect of agricultural rates down to £40.  They told the electorate about the goodies.  They did not tell them about this particular operation.  Perhaps I should correct myself and put on record that, as a result of this section and the same section of section 1 of the 1978 Act, £17 million more is being extracted from the farmers than they were led to believe by Fianna Fáil before the last election they would have to pay.  That is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>Do I correctly understand the position. Could the Minister explain briefly from his brief section 1 (2) (a) of the Bill? Could he tell me if I am correct in thinking that the effect of this section is to say that holdings in the possession of the Land Commission will not be aggregated in order to bring them over £40 valuation and suffer a loss of the relief grants? Am I correct in thinking that the proviso to section 1 (2) (b) means that if any holding in the hands of the Land Commission exceeds £40 valuation it will lose relief?</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There are certain urban areas that encompass quite a lot of land and two examples come to mind. Ballinasloe is a big urban area with quite a lot of land and Naas is another example. Does the Minister think it reasonable that those areas should be excluded from the benefit of agricultural rates relief?  I presume the thinking behind not giving the lands the benefit of agricultural rates relief was that it was thought they had all the amenities of a town and had inflated values as a result of being in an urban area.  As I understand it, modern thinking now proposes to value these lands at use value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>There is an existing system of reliefs for those areas.

This means that areas taken in by urban councils since 1976 qualify for the agricultural relief we are talking about in this Bill.</P>

The spring show is being held at Ballsbridge now and every effort is being made to show the people the value of agriculture to the economy and to build up the confidence of the farming community in their industry.  Yet, in this House we are trying to extract an extra £6 million from farmers, money that could be spent on the development of their industry.  Farmers today have no confidence in their industry.  They do not know what direction agriculture is going and they have no confidence in the Government to protect their interests at home or at EEC level.</P>

The Minister mentioned a figure of 20,000 extra people with valuations of between £40 and £60 being brought into this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, shall, within three months of the commencement of each calendar year to which this Act has application, prepare and have presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, a report setting out the following in respect of each of the three previous calendar years&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  in respect of each rating authority the number of persons, the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land in respect of which they are rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, who <Col N="1055" /> were not liable to pay income tax because of insufficient income but who were liable to pay rates, as provided in this Act, in the relevant year,</P>
    <P>(b)  in respect of each rating authority the number of persons, the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land exceeds £1 per acre on average and whose total valuation exceeds the amount standing specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, and</P>
    <P>(c)  in respect of each rating authority the extent to which the percentage increase in the county rate in the year exceeds the percentage increase in agricultural incomes in the State in the year in question or the latest year for which figures are available as determined by the Central Statistics Office.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a new section.  At the beginning of the year the Minister will be required to make a report on the application of the Act and he will be making that report under three headings: first to indicate the number of people in each rating authority who, although they will suffer an increase in rates under the removal of reliefs, do not have sufficient income to render them liable for income tax.</P>
    <P>In other words, we want to know in respect of each area the number of farmers who are being asked to pay substantially increased rates but who do not have to pay income tax because of their not having an income that would be taxable. We want to pinpoint those farmers who are the victims of injustice.  As I said earlier, farmers who are paying income tax can set their rates off against that tax so that the injustice to them of an unfair rates demand is greatly mitigated.  But for those farmers who do not have sufficient incomes to justify their paying income tax but who will be faced with a dramatic increase in rates there is an injustice because there is nothing against which they can set off <Col N="1056" /> their rates.  Each year for the next three years we want a report from the Minister on the position in each rating authority in respect of the number of people who do not have sufficient income to justify their paying income tax but who are being asked to pay this dramatic increase in rates.</P>
    <P>We want to know also in respect of each rating authority the number of people whose valuations exceed £1 per acre on average and who are being subjected also to reduced rates relief.  In such cases the burden of rates will be more substantial on an acreage basis for somebody whose valuation is less than £1 per acre. Thirdly, we want a report in respect of each rating authority on the extent to which the percentage increase in the county rate is more than the rate of increase in agricultural income in the State as a whole.  We can foresee a situation occurring quite often where in a given local authority area the rate of increase in the rate will be much faster than the rate of increase in agricultural incomes. Perhaps this year is the best one for this sort of assessment because while rates will increase by about 10 per cent agricultural incomes have fallen by about 3 per cent.  Therefore we will have a situation in which the relief for farmers against rates will be reduced, with their rates being increased by 10 per cent on a substantially increased amount of their holdings as a result of the removal of the relief at a time when their incomes will have fallen by 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>We are asking that information be laid before the House each year to demonstrate clearly every case in which the increase in rates exceeds substantially the increase in income from which the rates should be paid.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment which is seeking information, and that is all we can do under this Bill, is to get information about the inherent injustices in the Bill and about the system which the Bill is aggravating.  If the information that we request is laid before the House each year the public will see clearly the injustice of the system.  The amendment is very reasonable and its acceptance <Col N="1057" /> would be very useful in that it would expose the injustices of the rating system and would bring about a situation in which by force of public opinion and of public information this unjust system would be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment seeks to have written into the Bill a provision that each year I would be bound to submit report to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Such report would have a number of sets of detailed figures related in some degree to the agricultural grant and covering the three previous years.  I do not conslider the amendment to be reasonable and I must oppose it.</P>
      <P>My Department publish three major document on an annual basis and all three are submitted to both Houses. There documents between them contain a large amount of figures and of information of general interest relating to the work of my Department and of local authorities.  If at any time any Deputy wishes to have extra figures or information about particular schemes or services it is open to him to table a parliamentary question and I should be willing always to answer any such question to the extent to which I have the information being sought.  But it would not be right for me to undertake to submit detailed figures of particular servies as a matter of routine.  If this were to be the case we would all be snowed under quickly with facts and figures which might be of very little general interest or value.  I must take into account also the likely value of detailed information in relation to the cost of producing it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the particular information to which the amendment refers, some of it would not arise directly from the administration of the agricultural grant while some of it would involve the responsibilites of other Ministers. Therfore, even if I thought that the information concerned was important to justify the submitting of a special annual report to both Houses&mdash;and I do not think that is the case&mdash;I would be unable to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The amendment highlights the inequities of this piece of legislation. If a tax of any kind is being introduced or imposed it should be applied uniformly. Let us take a case of two landholders each wilth a valuation of £40.  If one of them is liable to pay income tax&mdash;and the amount of the rates liability will be, at £12 in the £1, £480&mdash;he can deduct the amount of the rates from the income tax liability with the result that he will not be paying any rates.  However if he has a large family or if for one reason or another matters are not good with him&mdash;for instance, if his herd is stricken with brucellosis or with TB and he is not liable for any income tax by reason of the Inspector of Taxes being satisfied that his income is such as to absolve him from income tax &mdash;he still must pay the £480 rates so that the net result is the same.  Surely that is unfair in the extreme.  It is a system of taxation that cannot be justified.  It is saying that although somebody is not liable for imcome tax he is being told that he will have to pay the £480 anyway.  Therefore two farmers with similar valuations could find themselves in two very different situations. One could get a credit note for his £480 rates and would not have to pay while the other farmer would have to pay. How can such a system be justified?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If a man is liable to pay income tax, it is because he has an income which justifiers the assessment of income tax on him.  That man is obviously in a much better position than his neighbour who is not liable for income tax.  Yet, each pays the same amount of tax&mdash;call it rates, tax or what you like&mdash;although it is acknowledged that one man is much worse off than the other.  One has an income which attracts income tax and justifies the demand of income tax from him but the other man has an income which excuses him from paying income tax.  Each pays the same tax.  Is that not an unfair law?  Is it not an unjust law?  Is it not a discriminatory law?</P>

The information will be very relevant in deciding whether the legislation is operating justly.  The intention of the removal of the rates relief should be seen in its overall context.  It was announced in the budget as part of a measure of achieving equity between the farming community and the reat of the prople and figures were provided of revenue that would be derived under various heads, rates being one of them, from the farming community.  The whole idea was to achieve a sufficient amount of revenue from the farming community so that it could be said that equity was being achieved between farmers and everyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are concerned with equity, this information is very relevant because it shows how equitable or otherwise the mesures introduced in this Bill will be in <Col N="1061" /> practice.  If the idea is that people should be paying an equivalent amount on an equivalent income, whether they be farmers or somebody else, it is clearly not equitable if farmers who have no liability for income tax have to pay a very substantial increase in their rates.  That is not equity.  Yer the Government are arguing that the whole idea of their budgetary policy is to achieve equity .  If that is happening, the information should be brought to public knowledge and this amendment will ensure that that happens. Equally, if valuations differ widely from one part of the country to another, that is not equitable or in line with the objectives of the budget.  If the increase in rates is completely out of line with the increase in agricultural incomes, with which these rates have to be paid, that is not equitable either.  This information should be made available so that we can see if these circumstances exist.</P>
    <P>I believe an amendment such as this, seeking from amendment Minister that he make avaialble on a regular basis statistical information as to the application and effect of the legislation he is sponsoring, should be included in much more legislation than it is at present.  Far too often we pass Bills and forget entirely about their effect for years afterwards and we do not discuss them in any way until for some reason or other, amending legislation is brought in.  In the meantime, this legislation could have caused considerable injustice, could have been applied in circunstances which were never the intention when the legislation was passed.  There is no system for review on a regular basis of on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>This section is, in that sense, breaking new ground in that it seeks to institute a system whereby the responsible Minister will have to report regularly on the implementation of this legislation.  If that system were adopted, It would be a very good day's work.  I believe very strongly in this and propose to have it further discussed on Report Stage.  This matter is important enough to warrant further discussion. I will withdraw my amendment <Col N="1062" /> to give the Minister an opportunity to reconsider his position.  I believe that when he reconsiders it he will alow our amendment or something similar.  It will not cost anything to give this sort of information.</P>

This threshold was £60 on 1st January 1979 and £50 on 1 January 1980.  The Minister for Finance in his budget statement indicated that the imcome threshold was being settled at £40 for 1980,1981 and 1982.  Subsection (2) of section (1) of the 1978 Act is being replaced by subsection (2) of section 1 of the Bill which specifies the ceiling of £40.  Subsection (3) of section 1 of the 1978 Act empowered the Minister by order to grant a waiver to local authorities generally from the requirement of national aggregation.

      <P>I move amendment no.4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 34, before &ldquo;Relief&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Wilthdrawal of&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is misleadingly titled Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill and I <Col N="1064" /> propose to change that title to Rates on Agricultural Land (Withdrawal of Relief) Bill because the effect of the Bill is to withdraw reliefs which previously existed and had been renewed annually. Although some of the previous reliefs are being renewed automatically this year a substaintial portion of the reliefs which were previously given are withdrawns the Bill.  The Bill is one which withdraws reliefs which perviously existed.  Legislation should not be misleadingly titled; it should always be titled as to its real effect so that people can see what it is about.  There is not doubt that in any reasonable interpretation of political and economic reality the Bill is about the withdrawal of relief from rates.  It is not about granting reliefs because the reliefs which it renews and maintains existed for years.  The only major change in the Bill from the situation which existed previously is one of withdrawing relief which have existed since the last war. That justifies a more honest title and that is why I am proposing a change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a misnomer to call the Bill Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill because noboday could take it as a relief.  I would go so far as to suggest that the word &ldquo;imposition&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;relief&rdquo; be used.  The Minister may look upon this as providing relief but he has told us that a further £6 million will be extracted from the farming acommunity and that could not be termed relief.  If that is the Minister's interpretation of the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; he should check a dictionary to find the true meaning of the word.  If the Minister is trying to get across to tlhe farmers that he is granting them relief he is deceiving them because he is extraction £6 million from them.  I support Deputy Bruton on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. I agree with Deputy Bruton that no Bill should have a Misleading title.  If I were to comply with what is in this amendment I would be giving the Bill a misleading title.  Without this Bill all farmers throughout the country would be paying full rates.  This Bill gives relief to the extent of £37.7 million.  We <Col N="1065" /> must have the Bill to give that relief; without the Bill no rate-paying farmer would get any relief.  Therefore the Bill is properly named and I cannot accept an amendment which would misname it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a legislative accident that this relief requires statutory renewal every few years.  The fact that the Minister is introducing a Bill to prolong something which had existed before the war&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not significant changes. The fact that the Minister is doing that is in no sense creating a situation in which it would be said that he is granting any relief.  He is merely renewing or maintaining something that has existed for a number of years.  There is nothing new about it.  What is new about this Bill is the withdrawal of reliefs which existed previously.  That is how this Bill will be seen by the farming communilty when they come to pay their rates later in the year.  That is the effect that this bill will be perceived as having had.  If people choose to look up the index of statutes for the year 1980 in order to find out the legal authority for the substantial and dramatic increase in their rates this year and they see a Bill entitled Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill they will say that could not be the appropriate Bill, that that would not be a Bill that would increase rates.  Yet the reality is that this misleadingly entitled relief Bill will increase the rates on lthe farming community.  It is a misleading title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>How about farmers below a £40 valuation?  Would the Deputy have them rated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> As we know, when this relief was first introduced it was an omnibus relief that covered all agricultural holdings.  Then the Bill was quite rightly holdings.  Then the Bill was quite rightly entitled Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1939, or whenever it was. <Col N="1066" /> That was a proper title for it then.  But we are inclined to follow precendent.  If we can find a precedent for anything we are inclined to take it out of a pigeon hole or a file and continue to use it.  There is no relation between the type of Bill first introduced to grant rates relief on agricultural land and the present one.  What is being done here is that relief that existed is being withdrawn.  It is being allowed expire and is not beng received.</P>
      <P>Of course one can have an argument about anything but, as Deputies Bruton and Griffin have said, anybody looking for a rates relief Bill would not recognise this as such.  As the Minister has gone so far as to include in it withdrawal of relief he might consider striking out the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; and calling it the Rates on Agricultural Land Bill, 1980.  That would go some way towards correcting the misleading title.  In those circumstances a person would stop, look and inquire what the Bill was about.  But to leave the Bill as at present entitled, when it takes away relief from a category of agricultural holdings extending from a valuation of £40 to £60, is going a bit far.  This Bill abolishes relief in respect of that band of holdings and in so doing increases the rates this year by varying degree from 106 per cent to 1472 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is not his wish to mislead the House ot the farming community.  No legislation passing through this House should be deceitful, attempt to misrepresent the factual position or lead any section of the community astray; it should be clearly stated and specified what is the intention of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister serious when he tells us that a Bill such as this which will bring an extra 20,000 farmers into a rateable category is granting relief?  I doubt very much if the 20,000 farmers adversely affected will accept glibly what the Minister tells them, that he is granting them relief.  It is outrangeous that a Bill such as this carrying a deceptive title should pass through this House.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously if <Col N="1067" /> not Deputy Bruton's amendment at least the reasonable request of Deputy Fitzpatrick when he urged that the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; be removed from the title.  I cannot stand over such a title nor can the Minister, especially in the full knowledge that this year 20,000 extra farmers will be affected by the provisions of a Bill misleadingly termed a relief Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Bill affects farmers.  The Bill is necessary because it offords total relief to holdings numbering approximately 390,000&mdash;no rates on holdings under £20 valuation.  The Bill affords partial relief on further 58,000 holdings.  Therefore it is affording relief of rates on something in the region of 460,000 holdings.  I have no intention of misnaming the Bill.</P>

They worked Friday night, Saturday and Saturday night and all day Sunday. There were allegations that there was complecancy and a go-slow among the staff of that Department.  This was an unfair and mean attempt to criticise people who cannot defend themselves and are trying their best ot deal with a very difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were also allegations that the Minister for Social Welfare was complacent about the payments of social welfare benefits and assistance.  I wish to put on record that I totally refute this <Col N="1072" /> allegation.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister is and has been actively pursuing a policy to ensure that all persons entitled to benefit receive payment of the full amount to which they are entitled at the earliest possible date.  The substantial increases in benefit in the budget and the fact that the budget was late this year naturally made that all the more difficult.  As everyone in the House will appreciate, the budget this year was a month later than in the past two years.  The fact that the revised payments took effect such a short time after the budget rendered it a physical impossibility&mdash;not for officials but for printers and others&mdash;to have these booklets published, especially the pensioners' bookets.  In fairness the Department did all they could.  The printed 330,000 pension books twice&mdash;one on the old rate to cover people up to the time when the new rate was brought in.  As the Minister said last night, 80 per cent of these payments have now been made. There was not a lot more that could possibly have been done.</P>
    <P>With regard to delays last year, it was hardly a question of the Minister for Social Welfare being responsible for all the delays.  There was, as everyone knows, a serious industrial relations problem within the postal service last year.  As the Department of Social Welfare deals mainly through the post all over the country the postal strike seriously affected their working.  In spite of that they made numerous temporary arrangements, using the good offices of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the traders in various towns around and country to solve the problems.  It has been generally accepted by social welfare recipients last year that a fair job was done by the Department of Social Welfare in this regard.  The fact that people were not getting their new rates last year naturally led to an increase in correspondence with the Department, and in a number of cases employers took avantage of the situation not to return their social welfare cards.  A new system was brought in last year which led to all sorts of confusion with a number of employers. Taking all these reasons into account, <Col N="1073" /> any reasonable person would have felt that delays would take place within the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It was said last that the Minister was far too busy with the Department of Health and that there should have been a separte Ministery.  However, the Minister pointed out that the Minister of State at the Department had some special responsibility concerning delays. Apart from that, it is almost ludicrous to suggest that a Minister, who in his first few months in the Department of Social Welfare was able to achieve, in a year of cuts, economies and stringencies, the biggest increases ever for social welfare recipients, was not fulfilling his role in a satisfactory manner.  In answer to Deputy McMahon's questions, which seemed to be of a constituency nature, regarding claimants for disability benefit who had to consider selling their houses, the Minister said that he is anxious to obtain particulars of the two specific cases mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I deal as much as anyone else with the Department of Social Welfare and am satisfied that all possible steps are taken to eliminate delays in payments as expeditiously as possible.  It is only fair to say, as is known on both sides of the House, that a number of the faults which arise within the Department of Social Welfare are the responsibility of the claimants themselves.  Frequently they use the wrong reference numbers and consequently this causes some delay.</P>
    <P>We were told that 100,000 cards for men and women were still outstanding for 1978 and 1979.  This gives some indication of the extra work involved for the Department.  I do not know how anybody can say it is the fault of the civil servants concerned.  In 1979 a total of £13 million arrears of social insurance contributions was collected by the outdoor inspectors.  I know the inspectors have a difficult task in tracing employers throughout the country.  If the officials adopt a heavy hand and use their statutory powers the individuals concerned will run to their Deputies complaining about the matter.  On the other hand, if there are delays with regard to payment <Col N="1074" /> of claims the public have no hestiation in approaching their Deputies on the matter.  Deputies at least should understand this problem more than people outside this House.</P>
    <P>There are delays with regard to social welfare payments, but I accept that they cannot be paid on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Money must be spent in the best possible way and given to those who require it most.  If it was to be paid in a random way, without checking and verifying the facts, the system would be chaotic.  The controls that exist naturally cause delays but they are essential and poeple will have to live with them.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister gave some figures with regard to delays and referneces to this matter was made also when we discussed the Estimate.  Last year was disastrous because of circumstances outside the control of the Department.  What we are debating here tonight is the situation inside the Department. I agree with the Minister that an all-party committee&mdash;probably it would not even be well attended&mdash;would do little to alleviate the situation in the Department of Social Welfare.  It would be only another talking shop and would cause delay in any short-cuts the civil servants can take in coping with the backlog.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say there are delays in every Departments and indeed in every business.  If one tries to order something in this city it may take four to five weeks to get the item in question.  The Department of Social Welfare is a complex organisation, dealing with many people and having a budget involving an enormous amount of money.  Last night it was almost suggested that the Minister should check that all letters are answered promptly.  That is an administrative matter and we would not help the situation by haviing a separate Minister to deal with the problem.  The Minister's role is to make sure that schemes are administered as fairly and as promptly as possible.  This motion was put down several months ago before Christmas when the postal backlog was creating large problems.  It has little relevance to <Col N="1075" /> the present position.  If we compare the situation now with that existing six months ago we will see that delays are less common and they are in respect of short-term paymetns only.  Long-term payments are always dealt with reasonably promptly and, as the Minister pointed out last night, most of the pension books have been issued.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems in this Department, as in other Departments, is the fact that the staff are over-worked. The services provided by the State have become so numerous that a very grave burden has been placed on Departments. The rates for social welfare benefits changea number of times each year and consequently the whole system has to be changed.  This affects the computerised systems in the Departments and it entails more than merely pressing a button.  It is a complex operation and it takes time.</P>
    <P>There are comparatively few offices dealing with social welfare payments and many of those throughout the country are cramped and small. In fact Garda stations are used for the payment of such benefits.  Last night the Minister told us that Gandon House on the north side of Dublin will be opened within a few months.  Last year and early this year the very large queues outside Oisin House caused many comments.  That centre could not cope with the enormous number of inquiries that were made.  The Minister's announcement will be welcomed by all.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that the old and infirm should be helped as much as possible.  The opening of Gandon House, which will deal with the whole range of social welfare services, willl be enormous benefit.</P>
    <P>The remarks made last night by many Deputies have no relevance to the situation today.  When the motion was put down six months ago there were serious delays because of the postal dispute. Any allegation that there is a flaw in the Minister or in his Department is totally unfair.  It is unfair to attack the civil servants who worked all last summer on Saturdays and Sundays and at night time and it is unfair to attack the <Col N="1076" /> Minister who has introduced the highest increases ever in social welfare.  The people who have made these allegations should take them back.  To say that the Minister is complacent or that the Department are on a go-slow is absurd and this should be corrected in the House.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his efforts and for the assistance he has given to Deputies from all sides of the House in dealing with problems.  The Minister, more than any other Minister, has gone out of his way ot make sure that there is a clear understanding as to what people are entitled to as a result of the budget.  He sent out posters and so on to community centres, health centres and institutions catering for the old people so that it can be ensured that they will get their benefits.  If any Deputy still feels that the Minister is complacent, anythign I or the Minister will say will not change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not always decided it otherwise.  I am longer in the House than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I know the situation.  In expect that it will finish tonight, but I will not speak for the last person to talk on this debate.</P>
      <P>I have always had the greatest respect for the Department of Social Welfare. Since I came into House in 1954 I defended them on numerous occasions, but I believe in calling a spade a spade.  While preople might take exception to the Minister being attacked for the shortcomings of his Department, that is what he is accept the same thing. The last speaker, who talked about the Minister being attacked, rightly said that officials should not be attacked as they are not responsible to the House.  I will confine my remarks to the Minister as head of the Department but not in a personal way.</P>
      <P>The motion put down sometime ago was reatined on the Order Paper and given priority by the Labour Party because it is more necessary now than it was when it was put down.  The Minister in his amendment makes our point.  We say in our motion:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann, in view of the failure of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to ensure that eligible persons receive their social welfare payments on time, resolves to appoint an all-party Committee of the House to investigate and report on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves the efforts, made by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to ensure that eligible persons receive social welfare payments on time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not say, as one would <Col N="1078" /> expect if the Minister and the last Deputy to speak are correct, that social welfare receipents receive their benefits on time.  Everybody knows that there are hundreds if not thousands of people who weekly have to do without a benefit to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Over the years, no matter what Government were in power, social welfare recipients always got their benefits unless something extraordinary occurred or somebody gave the wrong number on a certificate.  I have great admiration for those who go to great trouble to ensure that people get their benefits.  However for the past six or eight months since the postal strike we have had an extraordinary situation where week after week I get phone calls and letters from people complaining that they have not received their social welfare benefits.  I get letters from old age pensioners who sent away their books and did not get them back, from people on disability benefit, on unemployment benefit, on the unmarried mother's allowance, and from deserted wives and widows who from time to time complain that they have not received their entitlements.</P>
    <P>This is not good enough.  There was a time when it was possible to taken up the phone, get on to the Department of Social Welfare and be told in a matter of minutes if an error had been made, if the matter could be cleared up or if not, how it should be approached.  That cannot be done now because one cannot get on to the Department except once in a blue moon.  Last week I dialled the Department 32 times before I got a lone clear. Nobody answered the phone.  When I inquired yesterday from the Minister's office I was told that there was some trouble with the switch and they just could not deal in the normal way.  Because 31 times before that the line was engaged somebody must be getting service.  Having, done that and having made my inquiry I had to wait for as long as 15 to 20 minutes and then for some extraordinary reason the line went dead.  It does not cost me anything from the House, but what would it cost the unfortunate <Col N="1079" /> person who makes such a call from the country and who must keep feeding the machine again and again until eventually they may get a reply?  There is something radically wrong and there is no use in whitewashing it.</P>
    <P>I am amused by the people here who do not know what it is like to be without a week's income.  From the day they were born until the day in which they get up here to speak, some people do not know what it is like to go through a week and have to worry about buying what is needed.  But hundreds of thousands of people are depending on weekly social welfare benefits.  If these people do not get their benefits on time they either go hungry to try to get in touch with the health board to get what used to be called home assistance&mdash;it now goes under a more respectable name&mdash;while they are waiting for their entitlements from the State.  There is no reason why the State should not pay out the money to the people who are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>One of the most common complaints is from people who have been told that they cannot be paid because the card was not stamped.  When I hear this in relation to people who have been in constant employment for periods up to 30 years it makes me wonder whether somebody is being codded or somebody is being terribly careless.  There is something wrong.  It is all right for a Deputy to say that, if somebody makes a mistake in the application or in the certificate or whatever, it is put aside and dealt with in another way.  But that is of little use to the person who is left waiiting.  If there is an error surely the least people can expect is that the Department of Social Welfare will notify them immediately of what error has been committed so that they can get their weekly money in the shortest possible time.  That just does not happen.  I am aware of this because many people told me they were a number of weeks without receiving benefit.  When I checked with the Department I got the reply eventually that there was an error in the digit, or some other error.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> There was a period when I found it possible, particulary with regard to disability benefit, to dial the number or to write to the Department.  People who work in the Department will admit that I have a record of always trying to give all the inforamation required.  Occasionally I cannot do that.  If I do not get it I cannot do it.  Ninety-nine times out of 100 I will give the number, the period of illness, and the correct name and address.  When that is done, it should be possible to address the application or the query to the section dealing with it and get a fairly quick reply.  I had to stop doing that because I was getting no reply.</P>
    <P>Now I have to write to the overworked secretary of the Department about every complaint, and he sends me an acknowledgement at least.  I may not get anything further for several moths although within a week, a fortnight or a month the person with the complaint gets his money.  Several months later I will be notified of that.  Very well, the people have been paid and the rest does not really matter, but it appears slightly political.  If not, there is no reason why a duplicate could not be made when the person is notified and sent to the person who made the inquiry.  I am aware that under previous Fianna Fáil Governments it was not uncommon for certain Departments to be instrcuted to send out notices like this later to members of the Opposition then to the Minister's supporters. I would hate to think the Department of Social Welfare would stoop to that sort of antic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I receive a reply to my query when the person is being paid his benefit, I will accept that there is no rason for me to think something like this could happen.  When I was in charge of a Department I insisted that everybody who sent a query got a reply at the correct time, with no delay, no putting it aside in a file for a couple of weeks until the heat had gone off. It was <Col N="1081" /> not the practice of the Department of Social Welfare to delay replies and I should hate to think a new practice is arising here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>These letters go directly to the secretary and are dealt with directly by the secretary.  In case anybody would get a false impression, there is no political involvement in such letters.  If there is any delay I will take up the matter internally in the Department.  By courtesy that is the way they are dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if I or anybody else makinig representations send the application directly to the section dealing with it, it should be possible to have the matter dealt with immediately?  I had to write three times about three different cases to one section where the matter had not been dealt with correctly. I sent in a number of pretty serious cases.  In one case I gave the name of the insured persons, the name of the employer, the insured persons's number and I asked to have something done about it because the man was married with a family.  that was three months ago and I still have not got anything more than an acknowledgement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would like to give me the details I will have to dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that, but I do not think I should have to, and I do not think the Minister should have to.  This is a normal routine matter which should be dealt wiith in a different way.  I have vice generally and particularly for the people in the Department of Social Welfare.  I would hate to think that an odd person in the Department&mdash;and this appears to me to be the case&mdash;attempts to put a twist on something which should not be put on it.  It is the sick poor who suffer as a result.  Therefore, I do not want to see it continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the postal strike.  During the postal strike it was <Col N="1082" /> really disgraceful to see people having to stand outside offices for hours waiting to get their benefit.  It was also disgraceful that the delays should be so greate out on the street in bad weather.  We many blame anyone we like, but we know ithappened. There is talk about opening further offices in this city, but what are we promised now?  When this was going on, the number of social welfare certificates and complaints which were going in were being dealt with in an entirely different way.  There should not have been extra delay because of the fact that these people had to call personally.  Normally their claims would have gone in through the past.</P>
    <P>I listened to the last speaker saying the Department of Social Welfare should not be expected to send out books to pensioners because they had to print, I think he said, 225,000 books.  I am not aware that the Department of Social Welfare print those books.  The order would be given, the books would be printed and, I assume, would have to be handled by the Department of Social Welfare.  The printing of the books would be a matter for someone else.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of delays which have occurred.  The Minister, his predecessor, and indeed many before him, did not seem to be prepared to take much action on the failure of employers to stamp insurance cards and now to include PRSI.  The case was made that if pressure is put on certain people they will stamp the card but that it may effect them.  In fact, one of the tricks played by people who do this sort of thing is to say the firm will have to close if they pay in the money which they have taken out of workers' pockets and have not forwarded to the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance do not make some effort to stop not alone small firms but also large firms from getting away with not sending in the money which they collect for this purpose.  A tremendous amount of money was collected last year.  It was mentioned here by the previous speaker and by the Minister last night.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree it is a disgrace that this should happen.  Will he take my word for it that if he or his Department went about it, there are many more millions that could be collected? I know that because people write, or call, or telephone to me and say they have been informed that their cards are not stamped and they cannot draw benefit.  Some special effort should be made to ensure that people who are employed and who pay for their insurance get credit for it from the State.</P>
      <P>Another thing which, possibly, many people may consider to be a small item is the question of the changeover between the time the insurance cards were in operation and PRSI was introduced.  As the Department know, because neither stamps nor PRSI were available to show what work was being done, they introduced a rule of thumb giving credit for four stamps for every three weeks worked the previous year.  In other words, over a period of three months there would be 16 stamps as against 12. They completely ignored the fact that everybody who would be claiminig benefit would not have been working during that period.  I cam across several cases where people were not entitled to benefit, not because they had not got their stamps on in the normal way, not because they had not worked and stamped their cards, but because of the Department's decision to estimate in a certain way.  This put them out of benefit.  I broughth the matter to the notice of the Department and eventually a number of them were paid their benefits.  I wonder how many more who were entitled to such benefits did not get them.  Before a decision is taken in such matters there should be discussion with a body such as the ICTU who would be dealing with workers in a big way and who would be able to tell them what should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to hear the last speaker say that social welfare benefits should be index-linked.  I do not know whether the is a little ahead of the Minister in that <Col N="1084" /> regard.  Perhaps it is an indication of forthcoming events casting their shadow already but I shall not comment further on that.</P>
    <P>There is the question also of people who apply for the old age pension.  In the normal way and if the person applies in time it should be possible to have the pension paid to him on his reaching pension age but that it now always so.  People find sometimes that, after working for a long number of year as but having been in receipt of disability benefits for a year prior to reaching old age pension age, their benefit ceases and it is only when the matter is queried by someone that is transpires that that person should be receiving an old pension or at least should have appelied for it.  While it may be said that such a situation arises that should not happen.  It can cause a good deal of trouble for public representatives.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of children's allowances.  If somebody applies for children's allowances, particularly in respect of additional children and supplies all the necessary information and certificates that are required, it is not fair if their is a long delay before the additional money is paid.</P>
    <P>What most insured workers resent most is the difficulty experienced in having their queires to the Department replied to.  Today I had a complaint from somebody to the effect that he had not received benefit for the past four or five weeks.  Luckily I was able to get through to the Departments on the matter.  That person had been in receipt of disability benefit and the reason for the stopage in payment was that he did not have the necessary 156 stamps.  However, he was not told that by anybody and the payments were simply stopped.  This should not happen.  The whole system of applying for benefit&mdash;and I am talking particularly of people who have been stamping cards for many years&mdash;is wrong.  For instance, if somebody who has been drawing benefit dies and if there is a spouse remaining, that spouse should be informed of her entitlement, that is <Col N="1085" /> assuming that the Department have been notified of the death of the beneficiary. Perhaps such situations arise because the people involved in this sort of work have too much to do, but if it is a question of there not being sufficient staff in the Department, the remedy is in the hands of the Minister, but it is not good enough that letters to the Department are ignored.</P>
    <P>Any of us who read the column in <i>The Evening Press</i> dealing with complaints from readers find that the Department of Social Welfare come in for more than their fair share of complaints.  I imagine that people who take the trouble of writing to the newspapers about some grievances must be fairly annoyed.  Apparently it is not unusual to find that people have been left for a considerble time without their queries being replied to by the Department.  Recently I had a compalint from a woman to the effect that she had been waiting since the middle of last year for children's allowance. The matter was striaghtened out within a relatively shhort time of the delay being brought to the notice of the Department. It is possible that when she was writing to the Department in the first place she failed to give all the necessary details but she is a poor woman and could ill afford long.  Similarly, I met an old age pensiioner who told me that he applied in January of last year for the old age pension for which he qualified in the in the following month.  When the postal strike ended he was notifiied that he had been granted the pension, but up to March of this year he had not received the arrears and when somebody made an inquiry to the Department on his behalf he was informed that it might be several weeks before the money would be paid.  That is not the right way to deal with poor old people who in most cases are of a quiet nature and have no wish to certain a fuss.</P>
    <P>Although the Department have had a very good record down through the years, there is a grave danger that as a consequence of the disruption last year which was due to the postal strike, their having found that the public were <Col N="1086" /> prepared to accept less than the best, matters are allowed to slide now or, at least, if something is pushed to one side it is left there.  Of course, many people receive their benefits without any bother but they are many others, and if we include the dependents of those we are probably talking in terms of hundreds of thousands, who cannot exist without their social welfare payments.  There is a tendency to be complacent.  It may be all right to receive arrears of about £400 when a matter has been cleared up but that is of little consolation to somebody who may have been hungry while waiting for payments.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong that people who are entitled to benefit should be under the impression that they must pull strings in order to get that benefit.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this sort of situation will no longer exist.  We should not have to write letters to the Department in respect of payments to the Department in entitled.  I am aware that every letter written to the Department adds to the workload of those dealing with complaints but in many cases benefits would not be paid if we did not write such letters. Very often documents which could not be found for a long period are found quickly after the relevant matters being brought to the attention of the Department by public representatives.  This should not happen.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that those who employ labour and who deduct from wages under PRSI or anything else, money which is due to the State, return that money to the State and that it is not used to keep the company going which they have gone off to the Bahamas on a holiday and when the worker looks for his dental or sickness benefit he cannot get it because it was not paid in time.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister's amendment which is to make sure that all eligble on time.  We are all aware of delays in the payments of benefits and assistance but we should get our persepctive right.  As public <Col N="1087" /> representatives we hear about the delays but we must not forget that the majority of benefits and assistance are paid regularly and on time.  When one considers that there are 522,000 payments made weekly and a further 420,000 children's allowance payments made monthly, it is a great tribute to the officials and the Minister that so many payments are made with such regularity.</P>
      <P>There are, there have been, and, unfortunately, there will be delays but it is not always the fault of the Department. There are delays in short-term benefits.  I spoke on the Estimate for Social Welfare and mentioned the cfonfusion that can be caused with the PRSI number and the insurance number.  I believe the abolition of the post of social welfare agent did not help the situation.  He was in a position to check disability certificates, to see that the number was correct and that the name and address was on the certificate. If there was a problem, the Department got in touch with the agent and he could easily identify the problem and give the correct name or number on the particular certificate.</P>
      <P>Occasionally when an industry closes down it is discovered that contributions have not been collected by the employer, which is something I see as deplorable. When a person applies for benefit &mdash;unemployment or diability benefit&mdash; there can be a delay because an officer has to investigate his entitlement.  If a social welfare officer investigated all those employed in that industry and had it recorded on their cards, this might speed up the process of investigation for others when they apply for their benefits.</P>
      <P>The Minister said last night that £13 million had been collected last year through outstanding contributions.  This was more than twice the amount collected in any of the previous three years. This, too, is a tribute to the officials of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 70,000 people in a given week in receipt of disability benefits.  The majority of these people receive their payment regularly and without question, but in some cases that <Col N="1088" /> are delays.  The majority of the delays are due to the fact that for one reason or another the record card is not correct. Once the record card is correct there appears to be very little delay in payment. The situation has improved considerably in the last few months.  There was a problem during the postal strike but when one thinks of the numbers involved iit is a tribute to all concerned&mdash;the Minister, the officials, those working in the field, St. Vicent de Paul and the other organisations who helped&mdash;that payment were made to so many people and that the effects of the postal strike were not as hard on them as might have been expected.</P>
    <P>In relation to long-term benefits, there does not appear to be any great delay from the Department's point of view. There are delays in investigation but many of them are due to the difficulty the applicant has in producing the necessary documents.  One example is the case of the widow's pension.  When a husband dies suddenly the widow will receive six weeks' payment.  To qualify for her pension she has to produce her marriage and birth certificates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with this motion.  The setting up of this committee is very necessary. The difficulties in the Department and the efficient payments of social welfare benefits have been of concern for quite some time.  It was a fact of life with the Minister's office and his predecessor's office on numerous occasions and said the Department was not properly looked after or effeciently run. I make no reservations about that because that is very important to people who claim benefits and who are depending on benefit and assistance for their existence.  The people <Col N="1089" /> who unfortunately are out of work due to illness are the greatest suffers, in my experience, and I have a wide-ranging experience in this area.  I know many people do not get their social welfare payments in time.  If the Minister doubts my experience, he can consult the file in an office in his Department which will show the number of times I contacted his office.  I have asked on a number of occasions to speak to the Minister to inform him of the unfortunately, I never managed to get the Minister in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister consults with his Private Secretary he will discover the number of occasions I called.  I understand that because of the number of complaints an official has been appointed to deal exclusively with them.  The situation was just as bad when the Minister's predecessor was in office and I hoped that the arrival of a young, energetic man would alter the situation but that did not happen.  In most cases those who claimed disability benefit have worked all their lives but are unfortunate enough to fall into ill-health as they get older.  It is my experience that most of those who claim are not paid for many weeks.  I have made representations on behalf of many of those people and have discovered that benefit has not been paid for up to three weeks later.  That should not happen if the Department is being run efficiently.  I do not blame the officials because they are doing the job that is laid out for them.  The boss is to blame and the boss in this case is the Minsiter for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing this matter with an hotelier recently he pointed out that those who visit his hotel were not concerned whether his staff were ill or there was a breakdown they weere only concerned about getting the service they went to the hotel for.  Those on social welfare are entitled to the same service. That Department should be run in a businesslike manner.  There is no excuse <Col N="1090" /> for people entitled to benefit being left without their money.  On a number of occasiions I have discovered that medical certificates were not received in the Department of Social Welfare although certificates submitted on the same day were received.  I do not know how that can be explained.  I know of a man on sickenss benefit who drove to Dublin to deliver his medical certificate in an effort to get his benefit on time but, ironically, he did not receive his benefit the following week.  That man had a child for confirmation and he had no option but to drive to Dublin the following week in an effort to get his benefit.  The Department at first refused to pay it because of the absence of identification, but after representations by me they paid the money.  The Minister must be aware of the hardships caused by the inefficiency of his Department with regard to the payment of benefits.</P>
    <P>Many people have epxerienced difficulty when trying to contact the Department by telephone to iron out their complains.  I have compalined to the Minister's officials about the difficulty of getting through to the Department. I accept that there is a problem with regard to the telephone service but on many occasions I got a dialling tone and no reply.  When I compalined I was told that this was a matter for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that the Minister concerned had been made aware of the problem and was dealing with it.  This is not a case of lines not being available or blackage; it is a case of the phone not being answered.  Why is it that the phone is not answered to deal wiith queries from Members, officials of the Department based in other parts of the country, employment exchanges and supplementary welfare officers?  I am sure the Minister read the story in one of the national newspapers of the difficulty a reporter experienced in trying to get through to the Department on the telephone.</P>

      <P>Last night I stated that there was a major problem in the Department in relation to the telephone system.  I made an announcement then <Col N="1091" /> that the Minister concerned has given me a firm assurane that this matter would be dealt with immediately and for that I thank him.  This is being treated as a major priority.  It is a substantial problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>If this motion only solved that problem it would have been well worthwhile.  People do not look upon social welfare benefits as charity.  I do not accept that in relation to the payments made the number of compalints are small.  If other Members, county councillors, social welfare officers and information centres get anything like the number of complaints I receive then those numbers are substantial.  It is a major problem and must be regarded as such for these unfortunate people who, as Deputy Tully said, have paid into a fund all their lives to provide a benefit which is not available when they most need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are often told that the supplementary welfare officer is a sort of in-between man, an anchor man, for people who do not get their benefit.  The supplementary welfare officers are sick and tired of dealing with these cases.  Some wise boys realise they can now get two benefits, supplementary welfare and disability benefit, which is entirely due to the Department not sending out the benefit.  Nobody else is to blame.  If one leaves an opening for a certain element they will always take advantage.  This is causing a great drain on local authority finances. This year I was appalled to see the demand from the South Eastern Health Board on Kilkenny County Council increased from £160,000 to £260,000, occasioned by the fact that the supplementary welfare officers had to unload money that was not made available to people who did not receive <Col N="1092" /> their benefits in time.  The money could not be recouped and had to come from local authority finances.  It should be remembered that local authorities were confined to a 10 per cent increase in revenue from the Department.  But the South Eastern Health Board's demand was for a 60 per cent increae on an already substantial figure.  This is very unfair and will have to be investigated both by the Department of the Environment and the Departments of Helth and Social Welfare.  All of the local authority services, housing, road and so on are being directly affected by the inefficiency of the Department of Social Welfare.  I make no bones about it; it is inefficient and is not being run properly.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to wirthdrawn his amendment and accede to this reasonable demand that an all-party Committee investigate these problems and, hopefully, be of help to the Minister. We do not want to be critical.  We want to see the Department being run efficiently. Indeed it pains me to telephone the Department and to have to be abrupt with officials doing their best, but it is sad when there are people queuing at one's door who have not received their benefit.  As public representatives we want to help the Minister.  I would ask the Minsiter to give us a chance of so doing and of making helpful suggestions. Indeed the whole administrative arm of the Department has become too large. The paymentof social welfare benefits should be regionalised and be paid in county or health board regions.  There is no reason whatever why the Department of Health structure could not deal effectively and efficiently with these claims. Unemployment benefit is paid weekly in the employment exchanges around the country.  There is no reason why a structure could not be devised under which disability benefit could likewise be paid efficeintly at local level.  This is all we are seeking.</P>
    <P>There are problems in other areas alos but they are not quite as bad because they are not so urgent.  Recently also I have come across delays in the payment of children's allowances.  I did not encounter <Col N="1093" /> this problem 12 moths or two years ago.  It is one which has arisen in the past six months.  I do not know its cause but the Minister would need to investiage it and put it right immeidately rather than allowing it to gain momentum.</P>
    <P>I should draw the Minister's attention also to delays experienced in some cases in the return of old age and widows' pension books when requested by the Department for investigation of one kind or another.  Indeed the Department should be complimented on always having returned these books within two or three days of receipt.  But it must be realised that the postal service is no longer effective for dealing with social welfare matters.  That is anothe reason for having the payment of all of these benefits regionalised or paid on a country basis.  I know that now such books are not returned to old age pensioners or widows with the same expedition. Perhaps the Minister would investigate these matters with a view to divising some other means of handling them rather than through the post.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would afford us an opportunity of helping him, and through him, the unfortunate people who suffer most through lack of payment or delayed payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am pleased to note that the motion in the names of Labour Party Deputies has brought some assurances from the Minsiter that some improvements will be effected, I must press it because its discussion has exposed the very serious deficiencies there are at present in the social welfare payments system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare is the most important Department of State because it deals with the most needy of our people.  It is in effect the Department of Social Security and one likes to feel secure when one thinks about that Department.  In the past 12 months its name has become more synonymous with insecurity than security.  I have been a public representative for almost 20 years and I do not make that statement <Col N="1094" /> lightly.  I have always had to deal with problems in relation to the Department of Social Welfare; that is inevitable.  But in the past ten to 12 months I have never experienced anything like the volume and extent of problems arising.  Every Member of this House would have to admit that fact.  Those of us with a number of years' experience in public life would have to admit that recent within that Department.  This should not be the case. The postal strike has been blamed for most of these difficulties, but my experience during the postal strike was that the system worked reasonably well having regard to the fact that there were no paostal services.  The real difficulties seemed to arise after the postal dispute. The position at present is so bad that it can only improve.  There are problems in every area but they are most serious in regard to the payment of disability benefits.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the Minister's claim that half their problems are caused by claimants not filling in forms correctly. The reason for this is that people have no the information and knowledge about social welfare benefits and claims. Many people caliming benefit for the first time have no experience of the procedure and very little information is provided as to how they should proceed. Advertisements in the newspapers deal with increase in the rate of benefits but none of them gives real advice to an insured person as to how to go about making a claim.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across a case of a young worker in his first job who was involved in an accident at work ad rushed to hospital.  His parents were small farmers who never had any experience of insurance contributions When he had recovered partially he was sent home and his parents were extremely worried about him.  It was not until seven or eight months later that they inquired about the benefit to which he might be entitled.  By that time 26 weeks from the date of the occupations injury had expired and the parents were told in the usual letter from the Department that they could not <Col N="1095" /> make a claim expect in regard to disablement benefit.  This is one example of the Deprtment making money because claimants are not fully aware of their rights.</P>
    <P>I could give many other cases in which claimants entitled to benefit would never have received those benefits were it not for the fact that they approached me and I am sure other Deputies on all sides could tell of similar cases.  Thhis is a very sad state of affairs because we like to believe that a person who is entitled to somethign will receive it without seeking the influence of public representatives. That has not been the case in recent months regarding social welfare payments and there is something wrong in the system.</P>
    <P>These problems arose mainly during thhe time of the Minister's predecssors and we were hoping that this Minister would take immeidate action.  Heis still relatively new on the job and we want to give him every chance to put this very important service on a proper footing. People whose weekly income is suddenly cut off must have an alternative income as quickly as possible and cannot wait weeks and months.  Quite a number of people have gone back to work by the time their cheques arrive and a number of claimants do so against the advice of their doctors because they cannot get their entitlements.  In most cases these people suffer a relapse of illness and a much longer claim results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty mentioned the worry and anguish of people calling to say they have not received their cheques.  One <Col N="1096" /> tries to contract the Department and this is now almost impossible.  One could spend all afternoon dialling 786444 without getting any result.  This is a relatively new situation because up to last year it was not too difficult to get through.  I want to pay a deserved tribute to the courtesy of the officials in the Department who do their utmost to help when one finally makes contact with them.  They must be working under servere strain because telephones are jammed all day and correspondence is piling up.  These problems could be solved if people received their entitlements promptly.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to accept this motion.  All Deputies have experiene of this problem and an all-party committee could make some contructive suggestions as to how to resolve this matter.  I ask the House to reject the amendment.  It is not a matter of whether we approve of the efforts of the Minister; we want results.  This motion has been down for a number of months and was nominated for this week because results are not coming through.  Nothing but good could come by the passing of the motion and there might be a rapid improvement in the position.  At present the health board community welfare officers are overburdened doing the work of the Department of Social Welfare and are not able to devote themselves to the area of community welfare and health.  They must fill in for the shortcomings of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Today I had the following question on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment if some grant applications to reduce dependence on oil and for insulation of houses caught in postal delays in January have been refused on the grounds that they were not received in time, if he wil accept these applications. as having been received within the prescribed time and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dissatisfied with the replay of the Minister of State.  He appeared to be saying he was giving the matter consideration&mdash;I <Col N="1099" /> think he used the phrase &ldquo;sympathetic consideration&rdquo;&mdash; but I could not get an assurance from him that if he was satisfied that the applications had been posted in time to be delivered in the ordinary course of post before 1 February that he would accept them.  He said he would give me no such assurance and for that reason I sought permission to raise the matter on the adjournment.</P>
    <P>During the exchanges today the Minister of State said on a number of occasions that during the period of office of the coalition Government they and the Minister for Local Government cut off the Grants without any notice whatever whereas he had given a week's notice.  I want to put on record that the national Coalition Government did not cut off any home improvement grants or reconstruction grants.  The Minister for' Local Government quite sensibly imposed a means test&mdash; I think it was a PLV means test of £10&mdash;and if it had been allowed to remain it would have covered all the the applications for reconstruction and improvement grants. Here the Minister for the Environment cut off all applications with the exception of very limited grants for disabíed persons and he did it on one week's notice.</P>
    <P>It was done in a time of postal difficulties. I do not have to remind Members that there have been postal difficulties for months and we must have the worst postal service in Europe at the moment.  Having made inquiries I am satisfied that many people posted thier applicationn froms on or beforee 28 January in good time to reach the Department of the Environment if the Postal services had been working properly.  I do not think an application for a grant can do any more about posting his application in good time than by handing it in a post office under the control of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  By doing that he has done all that can be expected of him and if his application is not delivered in time he is not at fault and should not be penalised.</P>
    <P>What I and the people on whose <Col N="1100" /> behalf I am speaking want is not sympathetic consideration from the Minster. Al thee people concerned want their legal rights.  They want their grants processed and paid in due course and they want an assurance from the MInister that if they can satisfy an impartial tribunal that ficient time to have them delivered to the Department of the Environment by 1 February that the grants wil be paid.  I regret that there is Departmental coufusion at present and there has been for some time past.  It takes up to a week to have a letter delivered when it should be delivered the day after it is posted, Even in the Minister's Department there is confusion.  The housing section of the Department was closed to the public for a couple of months.  They would not transact business with citizens personally and refused to accept telephone calls from the public.  I want an assurance that these people will ger their money from the Department and that there will be no question of treating them unfairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a reasonable and realistic man and I hope he will take a reasonable and realistic view of the problem.  At the time of the announcement a number of people had but those who did posted them back within the timee linit.  Many of these have received notice that their applications were not received in time even though they should have been received in time if normal postal services were operating. On Thursday 31 January I personally delivered an application form into O'Connell Bridge House, but that appli cant received after 1 February the application could not be considered.  I can remember that incident will.  The applicant came to me on a Wednesday night and I informed him that I would be coming to Dublin the next day and would personaly deliver the application.  How <Col N="1101" /> can it be said that this form was received after 1 February?  That is just one example that I can stand over.  I appeal to the Minister to have a realistic look at the situation because obviously mistakes have been made and there have been some undue postal delays.  It is unjust to inform applicants whose applications were late through no fault of their own that their applications cannot be considered.</P>

      <P>One has to admire the tremendous facility with which Deputies opposite Switch on their crocodile tears at the plight of per sons whose applications for house improvement grants were late.  They forget all too readily that when the Coalition Government were in office they imposed a drastic means test overnight, thus severely restricting eligibility for both the new house and the reconstruction grant. Is it Fine Gael policy to have a means test for al grants?  It would be interesting to know because at times it is hard to know what their policy is.  Because of the means text many people who had entered into commitments which would incur heavy expenditure suddenly found themselves debarred from these grants.  We published a notice in all the papers setting a time linit for applications arriving in the Department.

    <P>Neither Deputy Fitzpatrick nor Deputy O'Leary, Who had a lot to say on this issue today, wept at the plight of those unfortunate people who were debarred on the introduction of the means test.  In our case anybody who had entered into a contract before 21 January last is eligible subject to the usual guidelines laid down for the grants. We did not shut these people out.  There <Col N="1102" /> is a year's applications in my Department at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the closure of my office.  The office was closed to the public until 14 April and it has been open to the public since then.</P>

      <P>We have been handling the situation very well, and I thank the staff on O'Connell Bridge Housed for their courtesy and the manner in which they meet the public on this issue.  Deputies opposite had the gall to say that we are unjust in allowing only two weeks in which people who had entered into commitments could apply for these grants. This assertion must be considered in the context of the 45,000 applications submitted in good time between 21 January and 1 February for the grants.  If we had allowed a period of ten weeks innstead of two there would still be people whose applications would be marginally late and they would blame somebody.  However, I am looking into the situation to determine whether or not there is genuine hardship to any appreciable extent, and I wil advise my Minister of my considered views on the matter very shortly. Further than that I am not prepared to go.</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition have been crying crocodile tears, but there were no crocodile tears when the Coalition Government were on Office when they introduced one of the most cumbersome means tests.  I have files over in the Department now, and even the county councils would not certify the income.  I refused to deal with them because no one would certify wages.  I will make a decision with my Minister on this shortly.</P>

      <P>A claim for occupational injury benefit was received from the person in question on 13 December 1979.  Following completion of normal inquiries, the claim was allowed on 26 March 1980 with effect from 5 November 1979, the date of the accident.  The delay in deciding the claim arose from a delay by the employer in replying to inquiries. Notice of the decision was issued to the claimant on 26 March 1980.</P>
      <P>An interim payment of disability benefit was made pending a decision on the occupational injury benefit claim.  All payments due to date in respect of injury benefit and pay-related benefit have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of weekly flat rate injury benefit together with pay-related benefit is statutorily restricted to the amount of average weekly earnings in the relevant tax year.  When the flat rate injury benefit payable was increased from 7 April 1980 under the 1980 budget provisions <Col N="991" /> the combined benefits exceeded the average weekly earnings.  This had to be adjusted by means of a slight reduction in the rate of pay-related benefit payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of sick pay benefit to kitchen and mess helpers employed by this Department at military barracks is governed by the sick pay scheme for temporary, unestablished and State industrial employees.</P>
      <P>The conditions under which these benefits are paid are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Eligible Classes</P>
      <P>The scheme shall apply to employees while they are in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>2.  Benefit</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Benefit under the scheme shall comprise payment during qualified sick absence of full pay, less appropriate <Col N="992" /> deductions in respect of social welfare disability benefit and/or benefit payable under the social welfare occupational injuries scheme including pay-related benefit as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  after three month's continuous service, sick pay at full rate for up to six weeks in any period of 12 months' service.</P>
    <P>(b)  after six months' continuous service, sick pay at full rate for up to nine weeks in any period of 12 months' service, and</P>
    <P>(c)  after 12 months' continuous service sick pay at full rate for up to 13 weeks in any period of 12 months' service.</P>
    <P>To allow for short voluntary breaks in service in the case of industrial staff, aggregate service of 17 weeks, 34 weeks and 68 weeks, respectively, may be accepted as alternatives to the minimum qualifying periods mentioned at (a), (b) and (c) above.</P>
    <P>3.  Qualified Sick Absence</P>
    <P>Sick absence shall qualify for benefit under the scheme provided the employee concerned&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  notifies his superior, in writing, of his incapacity on the morning of the first day of the absence;</P>
    <P>(b)  submits, where necessary, a medical certificate in the required form, and there is no evidence of permanent disability for service;</P>
    <P>(c)  applies on the appropriate form for the payment of benefit under the scheme in respect of the absence.</P>
    <P>4.  Medical Certificates</P>
    <P>(i)  Benefit shall be payable for single or two-day qualified sick absences without medical certificate within a maximum limit of seven days in the aggregate in any period of 12 months' service.  Otherwise all sick absence must be covered by medical certificate in order to qualify for benefit under the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> (ii)  Each medical certificate, in addition to stating the nature of the complaint occasioning the absence and the period which the certificate covers, must indicate when it is expected that the employee will be fit to resume duty.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Medical certificates must in all cases of continuous absence be furnished on the third day of the absence at the latest and, normally, benefit under the scheme shall not be allowed for a longer period than one week on any one certificate.  Where sick absence extends over two working days with a non-working day or days between, a medical certificate must be furnished.</P>
    <P>5.  Deduction of Social Welfare Disability/Occupational Injury including Pay-Related Benefit</P>
    <P>The amount of the deduction to be made shall be determined in the first instance on the basis of the details furnished in the application for benefit under the sick pay scheme.  These details must correspond exactly with those furnished in the claim made by the employee for disability/occupational injury including pay related benefits to the Department of Social Welfare.  Any adjustment necessary by reference to the amount of benefit actually received from the Department of Social Welfare shall be made subsequently.</P>
    <P>6.  Workmen's Compensation</P>
    <P>Where an employee is entitled to workmen's compensation from the state during a period of qualified sick absence any sick pay issued will be regarded as including workmen's compensation.  Any addition to workmen's compensation payable by the Department of Social Welfare under the occupational injuries scheme administered by that department will be deducted from sick pay entitlement.</P>
    <P>7.  General</P>
    <P>(i)  The employing Department reserves the right to have any employee covered by the scheme <Col N="994" /> medically examined at any time and to take whatever action it considers necessary as a result of the examination.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Any suspected abuse of the scheme by an employee may be investigated by the employing Department and appropriate disciplinary action may be taken.</P>
    <P>(iii)  It shall rest solely with the employing Department to determine whether or not an employee is covered by the scheme and when benefit may or may not be paid.  In any event, sick pay will not be issued beyond the date on which the workman's employment would normally have terminated.</P>
