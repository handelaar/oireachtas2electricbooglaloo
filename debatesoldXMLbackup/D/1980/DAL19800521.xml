      <P>We are on section 3, amendment No. 1c, and amendment No. 1d is related.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1c:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I asked the Minister to delete section 3 (2) (e).  I asked the Minister if he had any idea of the actual cost involved in its administration and what fees he envisages will be charged under this section.  He stated that he is considering setting up an inspectorate.  Would the Minister give us more information about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing amendments Nos. 1c and 1d.  Amendment No. 1c refers to authorisation and amendment No. 1d refers to routine inspection. They are two completely different matters. It is accepted that there should be an inspectorate.  The inspectorate, in addition to being guardians for the consumer, will provide a service for industry. Theirs will not be purely a policing role.  The service will include authorising and checking certain types of equipment to be used in making up or checking packages outside the normal verification and stamping done under weights and measures legislation for equipment for use in trade.  The fees provided for in this legislation will mean that all the types of equipment authorised will be treated in a uniform manner.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that the industry user should pay for services provided by the State and the proposal maintains consistency with existing practice in relation to similar services provided under weights and measures legislation.  It is consistent with the present practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> Industry packers will have savings arising from use of high speed machinery and more cost effective methods of control. It is not envisaged that there would be a necessity for a net price imposition on the consumer.  It is appropriate that the person who uses the service&mdash;primarily the packer and indirectly the purchaser of the particular product&mdash;should pay for the service. The alternative is for the taxpayer in general to pay and there is not a significant reason favouring this.</P>
    <P>The legislation applies largely to goods which are mass produced and the cost of certification of machines when allocated over a large number of products would be insignificant, and probably on account of the savings to packers arising from the use of the average method would not involve any cost to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Deputy wondered about the size of the inspectorate and asked whether it would be numbered in hundreds rather than tens.  It will be tens rather than hundreds. In regard to amendment 1(c), there will be a charge for initial authorisation but there will not be a charge in regard to routine checks.  It is largely in line with the weights and measures legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will imported items have markings on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If they come from the EEC countries they will be marked with the distinctive E, and under the EEC regulation which we are endorsing by this legislation our goods going to EEC countries will have a similar marking for certification purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that if the packer is charged under this legislation that charge will be passed down to the consumer in increased prices for the products.  The important point is that the consumer should not have to pay extra for the goods, that the Central Fund should bear the cost of the authorisation. On Monday the Minister for Finance spoke about our loss of competitiveness <Col N="171" /><i>vis-a-vis</i> other countries.  Surely the adninistration of this legislation would mean a further loss of our competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be a charge in the case of routine checks. Only the initial authorisation will be charged for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees will have to be paid by the packer and in normal practice such costs will ultimately fall on the consumer.  That is my main concern.  If the number of the inspectorate is to be as small as the Minister has said, the cost to the Exchequer will be relatively small and therefore it would be wise that it would be met by the Central Fund rather than having it fall on the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any way the cost could go down along the line to the consumer.  This legislation will be operating on similar lines to the weights and measures legislation in regard to authorisation and certification of self-indicating or semi-self-indicating machines.  The fee in that respect is £5 and I cannot see how that could trickle down to the consumer.  As I have said, there will not be a charge for routine checks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that it is as simple as that.  Will the machines be the property of the State or will they be owned by the firms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be owned by the firms.  The Deputy-spoke about the possible effect on competitiveness.  In <Col N="172" /> Great Britain the system is that the packer will pay the fees in accordance with their legislation endorsing the EEC regulation.  We are following that pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this legislation is in accordance with the EEC regulation.  I accept that Britain have somewhat similar legislation and that they are not making any charges.  Be that as it may, we should look at this from a more general viewpoint.  The fee for the certification or authorisation is so small and there are so few inspectors employed that there is little reason why in this instance the Minister is not prepared to meet our approach and have the costs levied from central funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is arguing that point, we would have the present system under the weights and measures regulations and the new system with the new inspectorate and there would be a lot of inconsistency.  Nobody can say that the charge of a fee of £5 for certification of self-indicating machines or semi self-indicating machines that weigh more than one ton and are under five tons is excessive.  For a machine that weighs 100 kilograms there is a £2 fee. That is not unreasonable.  It all must be operated on the same lines.  We cannot have a new system charging fees one way and the old system charging them another way.  We will probably have a separate inspectorate at the beginning but as time goes on we hope there will be a uniform one.</P>

Will the Minister tell the House when he thinks regulations will be introduced?  A considerable amount of equipment will be used for the testing, weighing and certification of packaged goods and while many firms may have this equipment already a considerable number will not have it.

      <P>There is provision for derogation.  The original idea was that the provisions of this measure would come into effect some time in 1980.

      <P>I wish to make a general point here about the introduction of regulations.  I have noticed that in legislation such as this in which power is given to introduce regulations, there are tremendous delays in the introduction of the regulations.  I had a case this morning which related to the Horse Industry Act, 1970, which provided for the making of regulations to govern horse-riding establishments.  I found that, ten years after the Bill was passed, the regulations have not been issued.  The Consumer Information Act which was passed in 1978 also contains extensive powers for the introduction of regulations but to the best of my knowledge no regulation has been introduced under that Act, an Act which concerns all sorts of important matters such as information that must be given on packages, the meaning of particular terms used in advertisements and so on. The failure of the Department to issue the regulations in this case means that in many respects the legislation is now a complete dead letter in so far as it could have taken effect only if the regulations had been issued.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position regarding this section <i>vis-à-vis</i> the position relating to section 3, subsection (1) (e).  I take it that in referring to the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act, what is involved is the workings of the Department as distinct from the weights and measures inspectorate.  On the one hand a firm or packer may be responsible for some costs whereas in section 7 we find that the expenses incurred will be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees charged may not cover the whole cost of the inspectorate. There will be inspections also that will not be charged for and these are covered in section 7.  As I have explained, the ordinary routine inspection is not being charged for and the fees collected will not in general be sufficient to cover the routine charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <P>This section applies to any package which has been either made up in the State or imported and which, as provided in subsection (1) has been made up other than in the presence of the person purchasing the package. Paragraph (b) of the subsection deals with what should be expressed on the package.  If a firm fail to express on the package the information referred to in the subsection, will the Minister have power under the legislation to take action against that firm?  In other words, will firms be compelled to express on packages the information concerned?  I am talking about the type of case in which a firm might be devious enough to try to escape the general intentions of the Bill by omitting deliberately to express on their packages information as to weight, volume and so on.</P>

      <P>The overall intention of the relevant EEC regulations is to ensure that the consumer is protected.  Let us take the example of tins of beans and peas, standard types of tins of both, on which the weight is shown.  Let us assume there has been an increase in the price of peas and a firm discover they are unable to implement that increase, having sought permission from the Prices Commission.  To enable them sell their product they reduce the size of the tin and charge the same price.  In other words, the consumer is getting less for the same amount of money.  The same can happen with the simple bar of chocolate when, at times, the quantity is reduced but the price level maintained.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to mention two matters arising out of the earlier discussion on this Stage of the Bill.  One point is important and the other rather trivial.  I shall be putting down an amendment on Report Stage to delete section 1 (5) from the Bill.  It will be recalled that a number of Deputies made the point, when we were considering section 1, that the UPOV Convention made no specific mention of wild plants.  I accept this and propose to amend the Bill so that it, likewise, contains no specific reference to wild plants.  In view of this change, it will be necessary to propose an amendment to section 1 of the First Schedule.  We shall likely be discussing this later in the day.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the word &ldquo;rootstocks&rdquo; which appears in the Bill in section 4 (12) and in the First Schedule, section 2 as two words &ldquo;root stocks&rdquo; should, in fact, be one word &ldquo;rootstocks&rdquo;.

There was a good deal of discussion on the problem of who would be entitled to rights.  It is generally accepted that the person first in a position to validate his claim would be the person to whom the rights would be granted.  This section is parallel with patent law.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At what stage would regulations be made under this section in the case of an application?  Would they be made at the stage when the person has merely indicated an intention to commence research into the production <Col N="184" /> of a particular plant variety, or would they be made later on when the application has acutally been filed, containing all the information and all that remains to be done is that that information be examined by the office and subsequently protection granted.  It would be very important to know at which stage these regulations are made.  That would be the answer to the problems that we were raising under section 6.  If regulations are made early, obviously claim jumping is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also query one word in this section, the use of the term &ldquo;regulations&rdquo;.  That implies regulations under this Act of general application to all applications pending.  It is not simply a question that the Minister will be making regulations in respect of each application?  If this is so I am wondering why this has not been done under the Act.  Why are we waiting to make regulations about this subject seeing that it is an issue of general application?  The effect is that the Minister will be able to make rules about this matter over which the Members in this House will have no scrutiny unless they move to annul the regulations, which is a very drastic step which one does not wish to take.  Why is this mechanism used?  Why not write into the Act at least the principles on which this protection will be given, with perhaps some of the details left to be ironed out by regulations?  To say baldly that the Minister will make regulations providing for the protection of the proprietary rights of applicants pending the final determination of applications for the grant of plant breeders' rights gives the Minister very great freedom to make any regulations he likes.  One could say that if somebody writes a letter without any supporting evidence, saying that he is doing research on a variety which will be resistant to a certain type of fly, or something like that, he might sit back and do nothing for ten years.  He would, because he had written that letter, prevent anybody else replying.  I know the Minister would not be inclined to make regulations of that nature because they would be so sweeping in their effect.  As far as the House is concerned we do not <Col N="185" /> know that he will not make regulations of that nature.  As far as I can see he could make any regulation he wished under the powers conferred by section 7.  It would have been better if the Minister could at least have outlined the general principles under which those regulations will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be applicants under section 4 who will be covered here. As regards protection of applicants, while the application is pending, they will apply for this protection at the time they apply for their rights.  We know that presenting their cases will very often take a long time because they have a lot of data to present and so on.  They will have to get provisional protection from the time they apply until such time as the rights are granted.</P>
      <P>A temporary protection will only be considered when the applicant has done all the necessary work.  The protection given is temporary because it will take time to process the application which could go on for a couple of years.  It is only right that an applicant will have that protection in the interim period, that somebody else should not come in and jump the gun before him.  That is the reason this kind of protection is provided under section 7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Minister not laying down the principles under which he may make regulations under section 7?  I would have thought that should be stated.  Even if it is only to be a cross-reference to some other section in the Bill that cross-reference should be in section 7.  It is not clear from reading the section what principles the Minister will use in making those regulations.  It is badly drafted legislation when it does not contain some statement of the principles on which the regulations may be made. It is simply giving the Minister power to make regulations about a problem without any reference to any constraints on him.</P>

In the example I gave they could conceivably say that all the person needed to do was to write a letter before he started to do any research.  That would simply give that person protection if the Minister so drafted the regulations.  You can give protection to applicants pending the final determination of applications in any number of different ways.  It should be made clear what principles the Minister would have to act under in making those regulations.  Does the Minister see the point?  I know what he will make the regulations for but the content of them is not in any way constrained by the provisions of section 7.  If he wanted he could make the most draconian regulations.</P>

If the Minister will not give some assurance that he will look at this with a view to seeing if it can be more specifically defined I will have to draft an amendment for Report Stage as the only way of getting the thing discussed.  Unfortunately I do not think that I will be able to draft a good enough amendment because it is a very complicated matter.  I do not know what would be the appropriate restraints.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this section is the most important section in the Bill and the amendment to it and the discussion on it are really the key to whether or not the Bill will work in a beneficial fashion.  It is important <Col N="188" /> to recap what is being done here. By this Bill people are getting a monopoly in respect of the sale of certain varieties of plant if they have developed that variety and patented it.  Obviously, in giving anyone a monopoly one must have considerable protection against the abuse of that monopoly.  In an earlier discussion on the Bill the Minister constantly referred to this section as providing the protection which is necessary against the abuse of a monopoly.  He said that under this section, which provides for compulsory licences, if anyone feels that the person who has the licence, the monopoly, is abusing it he can apply for a compulsory licence.  He can apply to have himself or other people given the same rights the monopolists have had exclusively up to then.  The knowledge that somebody can apply for such a compulsory licence, is, therefore, a protection and an incentive to the monopolist against any abuse of his monopoly power.  If the provisions for compulsory licensing are effective there will be no abuse of the monopoly but if they are ineffective there will be a danger of abuse and over-pricing.  One of the dangers of the legislation in so far as it confers a monopoly is that the price charge for seeds to the farmer will rise considerably.  In the absence of this legislation no royalties had to be paid to people outside the State who had developed varieties which were in use here.</P>

      <P>I am trying to establish why the amendment is important.  The danger is that apart from necessary royalties there could be additional prices because of the monopoly position held by the people distributing the seeds. Although a provision for compulsory licensing has existed in British legislation for the past ten or 15 years no one has applied for a compulsory licence to my knowledge.  Similar powers exist in the patent legislation here where people may apply for compulsory licences against monopolists in the area of industrial patent <Col N="189" /> and that power has not been used. What is wrong with the power that it is not capable of being used?  The material contained in this amendment may be the key to understanding why the compulsory licensing provisions designed to prevent monopoly of use have not been used.  Under section 8 the applicant for a compulsory licence must satisfy the controller that he is:</P>
      <P>financially and otherwise in a position, and intends, to exercise rights in a competent manner which would be conferred by such an authorisation,</P>
      <P>It is not enough for some farmer who feels that he is being overcharged to apply for a compulsory licence to prevent the seed monopolist from overcharging. The farmer must be able to prove that he has the competence, the knowledge and the money to maintain the seed variety, market it, sell it and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that most people likely to be disadvantaged by this legislation by being overcharged simply would not have the financial competence to meet the very rigorous standards laid down in the section.  The provision that he must be financially competent is particularly onerous.  One of the reasons why he may not be financially in a position to do this is that he has been perhaps the victim of a monopoly.  If somebody who distributed seeds here has been refused the right to retail the seeds, the rights in which are possessed by the patentee, the patentee may be consistently losing money because he cannot get the seeds for his consumers. The only way that man can get redress for his financial position is to apply for a compulsory licence to make the person who owns the seeds sell them.  If he does so, even though the controller may be perfectly satisfied that an abuse has taken place and that the man should get a compulsory licence, he will be prevented by the provisions of this Bill from giving a compulsory licence to the seed merchant because he cannot satisfy himself that the seed merchant has enough money to be able to exercise the <Col N="190" /> authorisation to distribute the seeds if he got a compulsory licence.</P>
    <P>I presume that within the terms of this legislation, if there is even a doubt in the controller's mind as to the financial competence of the applicant, he must refuse. The onus of proof is on the applicant not on the monopolist who wants to prevent the compulsory licence being granted.  If a person is working on credit how can he prove that he has the money?  The banks will say that if he gets the compulsory licence they will give him the money but if not they will not give him the money. It may never be possible for an applicant to prove that he meets the terms of this section.  Unless these few words are removed it is likely that no one will think it worth their while to apply for a compulsory licence.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the reason that this compulsory licence provision has not been used in Britain is not that the powers are too onerous but that there has been no abuse.  I would question that.  Mr. M. Woodrow Wilson of the National Farmers Union in America made a submission on 22 April last to a sub-committee of the House of Representatives in Washington which was sitting on legislation very similar to ours.  This legislation proposed to extend the number of plants that were covered by an Act which had been passed in 1970.  Referring to the experience of the farmers of the operation of this Act since it had been passed in 1970 Mr. Woodrow Wilson said that seed prices had risen rapidly since 1970, that all farm production costs had been rising faster than the general rate of inflation during the past decade and that seed costs had been one of the leaders in the price rise.  That has been the experience of legislation in the US similar to what we are passing.  That seems to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case that this legislation is liable to operate in such a way as to lead to an abuse of monopoly by excessive prices being charged and that there is a need for a strong provision to prevent that happening by strengthening compulsory licensing.  The inclusion of the provision that the applicant must satisfy <Col N="191" /> the controller that he is financially sound and competent and able to exercise the authorisation will effectively prevent the protection which this section is designed to confer.  I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendment would deprive the controller of any discretion as to the suitability of the applicant for a compulsory licence.  There is no point in granting a compulsory licence to a person who will not be in a position to avail of it.  Anyone who gets a licence must be capable of maintaining the variety true to form.  Therefore, we must keep the existing provision.  A power does not have to be used to be effective. The existence of the right to apply for a compulsory licence has been sufficient to deter breeders from abusing rights granted to them.  This is the experience in other countries and I have no reason to believe that the same will not obtain here.  There were many cases of applications being made for compulsory licences but when the breeders found out that this was being done in most cases they conformed.  As to the question of who should be granted a compulsory licence, there is no point in putting a compulsory licence in the hands of a person who cannot exercise it.  There is also the possibility of abusing a compulsory licence just as there is the possibility of abusing a plant breeder's licence.  For those reasons we must keep the existing provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the danger of a person who has been granted a compulsory licence is far less than the danger of a person who has been granted an exclusive monopoly abusing that.  If the person has been granted a a compulsory licence he is not the only one who has it. The original patentee has the monopoly already.  Therefore, there are two of them and if one abuses it the other one, certainly in the matter of price, will be able to ensure that he does not by selling more competitively than he does.  That danger is exaggerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the Minister's point about <Col N="192" /> the necessity to maintain the variety.  I would prefer if the section were drafted in such a way as to say that the controller must satisfy himself that the applicant is capable of maintaining the variety.  To say simply that in general he is financially competent to exercise the compulsory licence seems to be drawing the thing far too widely.  I fear that, because of this provision, which places a very heavy onus on the applicant to prove all sorts of things to the controller's satisfaction, this power will not be used.  Also I would like to clarify this question of the onus.  Would it be up to the applicant to prove that he meets the provision of the section or will it be up to the person who objects to the granting of a compulsory licence to prove that he does not meet the section?  If the onus is all on the applicant it seems that this section will not be effective.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is going to be very difficult for an applicant to get a compulsory licence when he has to satisfy all of these conditions and prove beyond all doubt that he does so?  Even if the controller grants a compulsory licence to an applicant under this section, it will be open to the original licensee to contest that in the courts on the grounds that the controller has not satisfied himself fully of all the requirements, and if the controller knows that he can be brought to court if he grants an application unless he has proved to his own satisfaction beyond <Col N="193" /> reasonable doubt that the applicant is competent financially, he will not grant it.  He will tend to err on the side of not granting a licence for fear of being taken to court.  Given that the onus is on him to be satisfied that all these terms are met, the tendency would be not to grant a compulsory licence.  I would prefer if the section somehow were drafted to say that if the objector to the granting of a licence can prove to the satisfaction of the controller that the applicant is not competent financially to exercise the thing, then it shall be refused.  The onus should be on the person objecting to the compulsory licence to prove that the applicant is not competent, not the other way round.  Otherwise the section will not operate because of the excessive caution the controller will have to exercise in deciding to grant an application for fear that if he does the licensee will take him to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We must realise that the issuing of a compulsory licence is a very serious step to take.  More than price is involved.  The section says:</P>
      <P>... financially and otherwise in a position, ...to exercise rights in a competent manner....</P>
      <P>Really it is up to the applicant to prove that he is financially and otherwise in a position to exercise the rights being conferred on him.  If he is not, it would not be correct to give him a compulsory licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest an alternative.  I see the Minister's point that he has to ensure that the variety is maintained and if an authorisation is granted to one person neither he nor the licensee will bother to maintain the variety.  Rather than requiring the applicant to prove all of this before he gets a compulsory licence&mdash;which would ensure that he never does get it&mdash;would it not be better to put it the other way round?  I have made one suggestion that the onus of proof could be changed and I would like the Minister to consider that.  Secondly, would it not be possible to put into the section a <Col N="194" /> provision that the controller shall in the granting of a compulsory licence lay down such conditions as he thinks fit for the maintenance of the variety, and in the event of these conditions not being met the licence will lapse?  If that were done there would be much more likelihood of a licence being granted and of a more effective protection and it would be possible to ensure that the variety would be maintained.  That might be a way out of the problem which is a genuine one.  I see that there would be some difficulty in the amendment as drafted at present in the case of maintenance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that this amendment goes to the very central point of the Bill and is worthy of detailed examination.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to confer a monopoly and the idea of the amendment is to give greater discretion to the controller to issue a compulsory licence in a situation where that monopoly is not being exercised in the <Col N="195" /> public interest.  From the point of view of the danger that can be associated with a monopoly situation it is very important that the hands of the controller should not be tied over much.  It is really a question of finding the balance between the rights which will be conferred on somebody who is registered under the Act and the claims of somebody who wants to, as it were, break the monopoly. Under the Bill the applicant for a compulsory licence has to show various things but in particular he has to show the controller that he is financially &ldquo;and otherwise&rdquo; in a position to exercise rights.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggests that should be withdrawn.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment, because why should anybody bother applying for a compulsory licence unless he is in a position financially to utilise that licence?  Secondly there is the looseness of the expression &ldquo;and otherwise&rdquo; because not alone must the applicant satisfy the controller that he is financially in a position to exercise the rights in a competent manner but also that he is otherwise in a position to exercise such rights.  What does that mean? It could be interpreted in a very strict way.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment proposed by our spokesman in this area and remove this bar to somebody applying to the controller for a compulsory licence.  If the Minister is not in a position to do that at this stage, would he give an indication that he would do so on Report Stage?  Would he explain what is meant by &ldquo;and otherwise&rdquo;? How wide and how narrow will those additional words be?  What is the intention of the Minister in having those words added after the word &ldquo;financially&rdquo;? Perhaps he would deal with the second point first and then consider the question of striking out, as suggested in the amendment, that entire provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult to list all the conditions necessary, but a fair explanation would be anything necessary to ensure the purity of the species involved.  Many things could be included in that.  It is very important that <Col N="196" /> this provision should be retained because anyone who gets a licence must be capable of maintaining the variety true to form.  The financial end is only one aspect of it.  Certainly it is necessary that the applicant be financially capable of fulfilling his obligations&mdash;and there are financial obligations imposed in the granting of a compulsory licence such as this.  We know it would cost a breeder a lot of money.  Therefore, it is necessary for the controller to be satisfied that the applicant was in a financial position to fulfil his obligation and, since he would be getting the use of a right fairly granted to the person who produced the new variety, it is only fair that the person getting the compulsory licence should first prove his capacity to exercise the licence in a competent manner.  I see nothing wrong with the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect to the Minister and probably other people who have drafted similar legislation with almost exactly the same words in other countries, I believe the provision here does not afford as much protection as what I have suggested.  Suppose somebody gets a compulsory licence and has satisfied the controller that he is financially competent and so on to exercise it, what is there to say that in a year or two he may not become bankrupt and be no longer capable of exercising the licence?  All this section says is that he must prove competence at the time the application is granted.  It would seem to be far more effective to adopt the approach I am suggesting, that he would not have to prove all of this beyond reasonable doubt before he got the licence but that a checking mechanism would be set up whereby he would have to continue reporting regularly to the controller on what he was actually doing to maintain it.  If at some stage, perhaps three or four years later, having got a licence, he became incapable of maintaining and fulfilling it, his licence would lapse.  That would afford a better protection against degeneration of the species than what is contained here, which only requires him to prove competence at the time he applies for the licence and does <Col N="197" /> not seem to have any continuing supervision as to his continued financial competence as regards maintaining the variety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that would be virtually impossible as this section is now drafted as opposed to the way suggested by Deputy Bruton? On that point, has the Minister any information in regard to the situation in other countries that have enacted similar legislation under this convention?  Has he any details of the provision in regard to the percentage of compulsory licences issued as against the percentage of registered rights under that legislation?  It seems to me that, if this is the basis here or elsewhere on which the door is to be left open in the public interest, the key may not be turned but the door is fairly well closed.  I see great difficulty in anybody being able to get through that door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I understand we have not any similar case in other countries where a licence has been withdrawn for the reasons stated here today.  The position is that the controller can have the position of an applicant reviewed every year and, if he finds the licence holder is not capable of fulfilling his obligations for any of the reasons we have stated, it is up to the controller to act accordingly.  If an applicant cannot provide proof at the time of application, he will be unlikely to do so afterwards. <Col N="198" /> Effectively he would not be able to use the compulsory licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>Does that not afford sufficient protection?  Surely it is not necessary for an applicant to prove before he gets the licence that he is capable of exercising it and afterwards to have mechanisms to ensure he does?  It would seem that the argument for requiring to prove beforehand is invalidated if there are sufficient means to prove afterwards that he complies anyway.  It seems the Minister is trying to have it both ways and that the legislation is simply designed to prevent people from getting licences.</P>

      <P>In page 13, after line 52, to add the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(11)  The Controller shall grant a <Col N="199" /> compulsory licence under this section if he is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a demand for the plant variety is not being met on reasonable terms as to price or other considerations, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that by reason of the refusal of the holder to grant an authorisation on reasonable terms the development of agricultural or commercial activities in Ireland is being unfairly prejudiced, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the terms on which the holder is prepared to offer an authorisation are more onerous than the terms being offered by him in respect of the same variety in another country, or</P>
    <P>(d)  the terms as to royalty payments imposed by the holder in respect of the grant of an authorisation are unduly burdensome on the applicant, seriously impairing his ability to compete with the holder, where the holder through prior licence royalties and profits from exploitation of the variety has more than recovered the costs allocable to Ireland of the development of the variety.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is another amendment which is designed to ensure that a monopoly granted under this legislation is not abused and that the compulsory licensing provision will be used.  Deputy O'Keeffe asked if the Minister had experience of these compulsory licensing provisions being used elsewhere.  As I said earlier, the compulsory licensing provisions under our existing patents law have not been used even though the legislation has been law since 1960.  My information is that the compulsory licensing provisions in the British plant varieties legislation, which has been in operation since 1968, have not been used either.  This clearly indicates that these provisions do not have much value as at present drafted.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister on Second Stage to obtain information on why these compulsory licensing provisions have <Col N="200" /> not been used in other countries.  I would be interested to know the results of these inquiries.  In the absence of satisfactory information, and we have not had it yet, it seems the provisions are ineffective.</P>
    <P>I already pointed out that the American Farmers' Union commenting on similar legislation said they felt that since the legislation was passed the price of seeds has risen more rapidly than the cost of living and other agricultural costs.  This places the onus on the Minister to prove that this legislation does not have that effect.  My amendment says that the controller shall grant a compulsory licence under this section if he is satisfied that the demand for the plant variety is not being met on reasonable terms as to price or other considerations, or that the refusal of the holder to grant an authorisation on reasonable terms to the development of agricultural or commercial activities in Ireland is being unfairly prejudiced; or that the holder of the licence is behaving in an unfair fashion in that while he is offering favourable terms for the use of his variety in one country he is offering more generous terms in Ireland; or that the royalty payment imposed by the holder on people selling on his behalf, with authorisation, is so severe that it interferes with the purchasers' capacity to compete&mdash;in other words, that excessive profits are being garnered.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister thinks that this amendment is simply concocted out of my head or that it is something I imagined one day when I was feeling in a particularly bloody-minded mood and wanted to make life awkward for him by putting forward amendments, I would like to point out that this amendment is based on a proposed amendment to Canadian patent law which was recommended by the working party on patent law revision which reported to the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs in Canada in June 1976. My amendment is modelled on the Canadian amendment and therefore, is reasonably well drafted.  It is not a simple invention of my mind.</P>
    <P>The purpose of compulsory licensing <Col N="201" /> is to do precisely what this amendment sets out, namely, to prevent unreasonable prices being charged, to prevent the licensing system being used as a means of imposing disadvantageous terms on this country, preventing agricultural development or leading to excessive royalties being charged to Irish people.  In other words, this amendment will impose terms to ensure that the controller will grant a compulsory licence in any case where there is a need to grant such a compulsory licence in the interests of preserving, developing and protecting our agriculture.  This amendment should be accepted.  Again I want to point out that it is adequately drafted and would achieve what we would all like to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing provisions of this section, subsections (1) and (2), provide for the granting of a compulsory licence as far as paragraphs (a) and (b) of Deputy Bruton's amendment are concerned. As regards paragraphs (c) and (d) of his amendment, I am satisfied that market forces will dictate that its holder of rights makes propagating material available on reasonable terms.  Incidentally, charges in different states will not be identical.  They could be affected by fluctuating exchange rates and, in particular, by the size of the market.  If unreasonable terms are set by the holder of rights it is open to the aggrieved party to apply to the controller for a compulsory licence.  The grounds for granting a compulsory licence are, I feel, sufficiently wide to cover the contingencies envisaged by Deputy Bruton.</P>
      <P>In regard to the last phrase in (d) I do not propose to set specific figures in relation to allowable costs for developing varieties because it would not be a practicable possibility to work out such costs.  As I have already said, a breeder could be working on 100 varieties at the same time only a few of which might prove successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In Canada it has been felt that it was possible to make provision for the allocation of costs in so far as the <Col N="202" /> determination of the appropriate royalty to be charged for patented inventions is concerned.  Obviously people who are inventing industrial inventions of a patentable character would also probably be inventing a number of them at the same time and the costs would be mixed.  If it is possible to allocate costs in Canada in respect of patented inventions I cannot see why it should not be possible to do the same here in respect of plant varieties which have been brought into this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister claimed that market forces would be sufficient to ensure that the terms of (c) and (d) were met.  Then he said that it would not be possible to have the same prices charged because of exchange rate fluctations and the fact that this was a small market.  It seems to me that he is contradicting himself because the exchange rate fluctuations can be worked out with a calculator.  If exchange rates are going to be used as an excuse it seems that there is a danger that market forces will not meet the case that I am making.  The fact also that we are a small isolated market means, as the Minister probably meant to mention, that we are liable to be charged higher prices for our seeds under this legislation than other people, perhaps in France or Germany, even for the same seeds.  People will say that we are only a small market, that they are not going to make any great profit out of it so we can just stew in our own juice and will not get the commodity.  The person who is refusing to give us the commodity could have a compulsory licence which would prevent anyone in Ireland from marketing the same plant variety in competition with him which would seem to contradict the Minister's assertion that market forces will sort the whole thing out.  It would seem that in view of the reasons the Minister gave for the possibility of differential pricing he is contradicting his own assertion that market forces will solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept either that the first two sections in the amendment, (a) and (b) concerning unreasonable charges and refusing to grant authorisations in <Col N="203" /> Ireland, are satisfied by section 8 (2).  In this the controller may grant a licence if the applicant has satisfied him that it is in the public interest to do so.  First, it is up to the applicant to satisfy the controller and, second, it is a very vaguely determined public interest, which are the criteria under which the controller may or may not decide to grant a compulsory licence.  The public interest is probably the most impossible thing to define that one could imagine.  The socialist's view of the public interest is very different from that of the capitalist, the view of a practising Christian is very different from that of an atheist.  The public interest is something that no one can define.  It is something that has defied political philosophers for 2000 years, ever since Aristotle started to define it. Nobody knows what the public interest really means.  It means whatever one would like it to mean.</P>
    <P>Putting that provision in here is no protection against anything because it all depends on what the controller thinks is the public interest.  The amendment is much more specific.  It is objective and says he must grant a licence if he is satisfied that demand is not being met or unreasonable prices are being charged. Those are objective, definite criteria that one can go out and find and prove to be the case and it is not up to the controller to look into his heart and know what the Irish people think.  If he is satisfied on the basis of certain objective facts that demand is not being met or that unreasonable prices are being charged then he must grant a compulsory licence.  If somebody contests that, he is contesting it not on the basis of some nebulous concept of the public interest but on the basis of definite, specific criteria.  This amendment is preferable to the vague concept of the public interest which the Minister is seeking to assert here. Perhaps the Minister would deal with that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister deals with this point, perhaps he would deal with this very sensible amendment in the broader context.  Does he not accept <Col N="204" /> that this House can decide that it is in the public interest that compulsory licences be available on reasonable terms in reasonable circumstances?  If the experience in other countries is that compulsory licences are virtually unobtainable what is the sense of putting through legislation of a similar nature in this House?  Would the Minister not accept that we should go back to the broader issue in considering this amendment as to whether compulsory licences should be available when it is reasonable that they should be available?  This amendment highlights a number of circumstances in which we can decide that such a reasonable situation exists.  Surely the Minister should accept that a compulsory licence should be available if the demand is not being met on reasonable terms.  Surely it is reasonable that we should insist that a compulsory licence be available to an applicant if we can prove that.</P>
      <P>The other terms suggested in this amendment are also of a very central nature.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment, is he saying that a compulsory licence should not be available if the development of agricultural activities here is unfairly prejudiced?  By refusing to accept this amendment the Minister is, in effect, saying that.  The Minister and all of us are interested in the development of agriculture.  In those circumstances surely it is entirely reasonable that we should provide that it is in the public interest that if an applicant can prove that the development of agricultural activity here is being prejudiced a compulsory licence should be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies in regard to the possible situation where excessive prices are being charged by an existing holder. In considering this amendment we are in the situation where we have before us a section which apparently on its face is designed to facilitate the issuing of compulsory licences in certain circumstances. It is clear from a reading of this section and the discussion taking place here that an applicant for a compulsory licence faces a minefield of obstacles and that, in the light of the difficulties <Col N="205" /> that are obviously incorporated in this Bill, and in the light of experience in other countries, such an applicant would never get through that minefield. Therefore, we would have no compulsory licences issued even when it is clear that it is in the public interest that such should be given.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton and suggest to the Minister that it is in the interests of the country from many points of view that the entire procedure of obtaining compulsory licences should be liberalised.  If we do not take the opportunity to do so now, we will effectively close the door on the issuing of compulsory licences in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister is slavishly reproducing the provisions of the British Act.  Instead of drafting a compulsory licence provision specifically designed to meet Irish conditions&mdash;Ireland being an agricultural country&mdash;he is copying slavishly the provisions of the British Act passed in 1968.  That Act has not worked particularly well in Britain and it was designed for a country which is predominantly interested in industry. The Minister should look at this provision from the point of view of the country <Col N="206" /> he represents and recognise that we should have a provision such as I have suggested which will protect Irish interests in the context of this legislation. The Minister has not said that my amendment would be contrary to the provisions of the UPOV Convention.  It is obvious from his failure to make that assertion that my amendment would be consistent with UPOV.  Instead of availing of the freedom he has to draft the provision in our own way to protect our own interests within the terms of UPOV, the Minister is copying word for word the provisions of the British legislation which was passed in 1968.  He has not had any regard to the specific interests of the country.  It is a bad thing that we should be always following British legislation in matters of this sort.</P>

      <P>From what the Minister has said there is no reason within the terms of the UPOV Convention why he could not accept the amendment I proposed.  For that reason I am disappointed he did not do so.  The section <Col N="208" /> states that a compulsory licence shall not be an exclusive licence.  The Minister was arguing earlier the reason why the compulsory licensee had to prove before he got the application that he was financially competent.  He would have to maintain the variety.  If he is not being granted an exclusive licence, in other words, if a licence is being granted to other people as well, it seems a little unfair to require him to be able to maintain the variety before he gets it if other people are getting it as well who presumably will be equally required to maintain the variety.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister consider it necessary that such a licence may be granted by the controller only with the consent of the Minister?  On the offchance that the applicant for a compulsory licence gets through the obstacle course of convincing the controller, why is it necessary that the consent of the Minister must be obtained before the controller can issue the licence?  This seems to me to be merely an additional obstacle to prevent the issuing of such a compulsory licence.  This is a very serious aspect.  If the controller is to have charge of this office and if the applicant for a compulsory licence eventually by some miracle is able to convince him, why is the Minister involved at all?  That leads to a second point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section the Minister may conduct such consultations as he considers <Col N="209" /> appropriate before giving his consent. Is not that a very loose provision? We are talking about the exercise of a semi-judicial function by the controller when the applicant applies for a compulsory license.  I presume the controller will conduct his affairs in a semi-judicial way.  I would hope the procedures would be in accordance with the principles of natural justice.</P>
    <P>The provision in regard to the Minister does not lay down any such conditions.  The Minister is merely empowered to conduct such consultations as he considers appropriate.  I do not want to be an alarmist but this raises the possibility of bringing the whole question into the political field, into the area of political representation.  This is entirely inappropriate.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister would exercise his judgment unfairly on such an application, but what is the need for it at all?  The Minister is given discretion to conduct such consultations as he considers appropriate without any reference to how that is to be done and what the procedure will be.  If a point is made to the Minister by the applicant, what is the position of the original holder in replying to that point and <i>vice versa</i>?</P>
    <P>If we say the controller is exercising a semi-judicial function, the fact that he cannot issue a compulsory licence without the consent of the Minister means that the Minister himself is put in the position of exercising a semi-judicial function.  This is very relevant.  It goes back to the basic point: why is the Minister involved at all?  Under the Bill we are appointing a controller.  We should let him do his job and keep the Minister out of it, and all that might follow from having a Minister involved in such a situation.  That is a very important point.  It goes back to the broad issues involved and to the core of the Bill.  It will be virtually impossible for anybody to get a compulsory licence.  It seems to be an additional step in the obstacle course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember that a compulsory licence is against the interests <Col N="210" /> of the breeder and it is reasonable to have a safeguard for the breeder.  We must assume that a breeder would have spent a considerable amount of money in propagating his plant.  Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that there would be some safeguard to make sure his interests would be protected.  It is for that reason that the Minister has to be consulted on the issuing of compulsory licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pursue this point with the Minister.  Under subsection (9) when the controller receives an application he is obliged to give the holder notice of the application and give him an opportunity of hearing what the original holder has to say before returning the application.  This is in accordance with proper procedures and the principles of natural justice.  If the rights of the original holder are to be affected he should have an opportunity of being heard by the controller.  In that situation, what is the function of the Minister?  It has been suggested that it is in the interests of protecting the rights of the original holder, but his rights are already protected under subsection (9).  Will the original holder have to go directly to the Minister, or get on to his local TD to lobby the Minister?  That does not seem to be a procedure which we should incorporate in legislation.  Would the Minister give the justification for including ministerial consent?  It does not stand up, because the rights of the holder are already protected by way of giving notice and being heard before the controller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of two heads being better than one.  It is an appeal to someone higher than the controller. As I have already said, the breeder will have spent a considerable amount of money in developing the variety and the Minister should look at cases where the results of the breeder's work are being made available compulsorily to someone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned a court of appeal.  Does he accept <Col N="211" /> that the section as drafted is an additional obstacle to the granting of a compulsory licence?  If the Minister is there, as it were, a second head providing a court of appeal, why then can he not overrule the controller in all circumstances?  The controller may already have decided to issue the licence. This is not a proper appeal procedure.  If the controller has decided to refuse the application the Minister will not have the power to say, &ldquo;I have considered the matter and I believe you should grant it&rdquo;.  That would be a one sided appeal procedure.  The Minister is not there in an appeal capacity but more as a further preventive to the issue of the licence.  The holder of the licence can get on to his TD to lobby the Minister, but the applicant cannot do so because if the controller has refused the application the matter does not even reach the Minister.</P>
      <P>This brings me to another point.  If the Minister thought that an appeal procedure would be wise, why not lay down a proper appeal procedure whereby either side could go to the Minister or to the courts in the event of a refusal by the controller?  The Minister's justification for bringing in Ministerial consent on the basis of looking at it with one eye is not a proper appeal procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the case made by Deputy O'Keeffe.  When speaking earlier I did not have a copy of the 1964 British legislation before me and I alleged wrongly that the Minister was following it slavishly.  The British legislation is far more liberal as far as the granting of compulsory licences is concerned and I urge the Minister to study that Act.  If it has been possible to operate the British Act for 16 years without all the dire consequences suggested by the Minister, it should be possible to operate a similar provision <Col N="212" /> here.  There is no provision in the British legislation for an appeal to the Minister in the case of a compulsory licence being granted&mdash;the controller has complete control.</P>
      <P>I refer to section 7 (3) of the British Plant Variety and Seeds Act of 1964 which states that in entertaining applications and settling the terms of the compulsory licence, the controller shall endeavour to secure that the plant variety is available to the public at a reasonable price and that it is widely distributed and maintained in quality and that there is reasonable remuneration for the holder of the plant breeder's licence.  There is not a thing in the British legislation about something as vague as the public interest and I therefore ask the Minister to examine the British provisions.  I am not in favour of following British legislation when it is more restrictive than ours but if it is more liberal I would be happy to follow it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am&mdash;I do not mind so long as I am getting what I am looking for in this Bill.  That Act has worked for 16 years in Britain.  I would point out that it is not in the interests of a country like Ireland to be imposing restrictive provisions in relation to compulsory licences because we are likely to be importing more seeds than Britain who are more likely to be exporting seeds. Therefore, one might expect more restrictive provisions in the British legislation, and it seems ridiculous that Ireland should be imposing more restrictive conditions.  Earlier I could not find the British Act, which was buried among my papers, but I eventually completed the excavation and found it.  I urge the Minister to have a careful look at it and to consider amending this section radically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should it be necessary to extend the grant?  It seems to me that a term of 16 years is long enough to ensure that a plant developer will make sufficient profit from a plant variety, having had 16 years to market it exclusively.  This is rather odd.  Whereas in the previous section there was a provision for Ministerial consent, there is not a word here about the Minister's consent being necessary for an extension of the holder's licence.  If there was a case for Ministerial consent anywhere in the Bill I would have thought it would be in the case of a person who had had a licence for 16 years and who sought a monopoly of the variety for a further 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for this is that in many cases a person who had a licence might have had it for years without getting any market for the plant on which he had spent so much time and money.  He might not have had a sufficient financial reward for his work in propagating the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If a licensee was involved with that variety, or an applicant was looking for a licence or people waiting for the term to end so they could go ahead with the variety without any licence, what would their rights be in that situation?  Having granted monopoly rights under the Bill we are talking about having an extension of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last section there were very onerous provisions and conditions to be satisfied by somebody trying to breach the monopoly in regard to financial standing, public interest, discretion of the controller and the consent of the Minister.  Here we have somebody who wants to extend the monopoly and it is very significant of the thinking that went into the drafting of the Bill that there are no onerous conditions on such a person. The section provides that all that has to be proved is that adequate remuneration was not received by the original holder. What is &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;?  Is the controller to decide whether a sufficient profit has been made?  Is it merely a question of <Col N="214" /> sufficient profit, and if so, how much?  Is it a question of covering expenses?  Surely leaving it to the controller to decide whether the original holder got adequate remuneration is not a sufficient safeguard because of the possibility of abuse of the monopoly privilege.  In that situation, what about the public interest? Surely the controller should be entitled, indeed obliged, to consider the public interest in the extension of monopoly rights.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the position of somebody who was a compulsory licensee in relation to that variety.  Why is the holder of the original grant not obliged to prove that he will exercise the additional monopoly rights conferred on him in a competent manner in the same way as the applicant for a compulsory licence under the previous section?  I mentioned the question of Ministerial consent in regard to compulsory licence.  Surely this is an obvious case where, if it is supposed to be a safeguard for the holder of the original licence, the function of the Minister should be there as a safeguard in the public interest and such extension should not be granted without having the matter examined in detail, if the Minister has any function under the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards notice and appeal, there should be a requirement to have all interested parties notified one way or the other.  This may be difficult.  The application for the extension of a monopoly might be in regard to some popular variety of cereal which might be of great interest to the agricultural community. We could find that bodies such as the IFA, Macra and so on would be interested in it but, under the section, the application could go through without them knowing about it.  There is no obligation to give any notice about it nor is there any provision under the section in regard to hearing other people who might have an interest.  Neither is there provision for an appeal by people who might feel that the controller's decision was incorrect or unjust for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>The case I am making is that the question of an extension of a monopoly right is one which should not be allowed to go <Col N="215" /> through without the most rigorous examinations. In talking about monopolies, the onus must always be on the person who wants the monopoly to prove his case to the hilt.  Here we are providing that a monopoly can be extended for a further period on the flimsiest of grounds. All the applicant has to do is go to the controller and say he did not make enough money out of his monopoly and ask to be given another 20 years.  As far as safeguards are nececsary under the Bill, this section, in the public interest, must be expanded and extended to ensure that the extension of monopoly rights are not granted save where the holder thereof proves his case to the hilt and it is in the public interest to grant that extension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister argued on the last section against amendments we had that it would not be possible to decide whether or not the amount being charged by a person who was the holder of an exclusive licence was unfairly high because of the various costs involved. How will it be determined in this case whether the holder has been adequately remunerated?  If, for instance, the person is a holder of an exclusive licence in ten different countries and made a lot of money in France on selling the seed&mdash;admittedly he could not make money in Ireland because there was no market here during the protection period but towards the end of the period the market arose&mdash;would the controller take account of the profits made in France to decide that he had been adequately remunerated or would he be required to satisfy himself that he had received adequate remuneration in Ireland and, if he had not, would he be able to get an extension of the licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support all the points made by Deputy O'Keeffe.  The other side of the story would suggest that if a person has the right to get an extension of a monopoly because he has not been adequately remunerated during the period of the monopoly there should be an equivalent power to deprive him of the monopoly, even within the period of the grant, if he has been adequately <Col N="216" /> remunerated in the shorter period.  In other words, when a compulsory licence is granted, in all cases where, even within ten or five years less than the maximum period of the grant, the licensee has been adequately remunerated, the monopoly should be withdrawn.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The same principle of adequate remuneration should apply both in the granting of compulsory licences and in the granting of extensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of extending the maximum period by 20 years.  The controller could have given the maximum period at the start.  If he gave less than that section 9 allows him to go to the maximum.  If the controller was satisfied that the breeder did not get a reasonable return, having regard to all matters including the public interest, he would simply give him more time to exercise his rights but this does not give him any specific return as such. We are trying to encourage breeders. The extension would be only for a period between the minimum and maximum period for rights for a particular variety.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that in the extension of monopoly rights the points I have made in regard to the onus of proof on the applicant, the efforts he will have to make and the proofs he will have to produce should at least be as rigorous as those on the applicant for the compulsory licence under the previous section?  Will the Minister consider withdrawing the section or, alternatively, tightening it?</P>

      <P>Even if we forget about the public interest and the rights of other people and if we talk strictly in monetary terms, will the Minister not accept that the term &ldquo;adequate remuneration&rdquo; is a very loose one?  Are we talking about recovering costs or the level of profit? Has the Minister any idea of what would be adequate remuneration?  If the applicant can produce figures to show that he has covered his costs and has got a return of only 25 per cent on his investment, would that be regarded as adequate remuneration?  Would it be necessary for him to show he had made a lesser or a greater profit?  If that is the criterion that is the sole basis on which the controller will make his decision, I think it is quite hopeless.  I suggested some other provisions that should be included before a monopoly is extended. The term &ldquo;adequate remuneration&rdquo; is so loose the whole section is rather like a sieve.  Any applicant would be able to make a case that he did not make enough money; most people whether salary earners or owners of a business, do not think they get enough money.  We should have some guidelines if we are basing the whole business on monetary terms.  If members of this House had to make a decision about what constituted an adequate remuneration, what would be their response?  I should like the Minister's views on this point.  Secondly, I urge him to give more thought to this section and insert more safeguards before monopoly rights are extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy realises that I cannot say what an adequate remuneration would be and I do not think it is expected that that should be written into the Bill.  The onus is on the applicant to prove he did not get a reasonable return from his investment.  I take it he would have to submit his accounts to the controller who would go through the accounts to see what had been the investment, what money had <Col N="218" /> been spent and the returns over whatever period he had been granted the rights. The controller would decide on the basis of that information.  I do not see how we could lay down what would be an equitable remuneration.</P>

      <P>I do not think that it would be in the public interest to say if reward money has been paid in particular cases.  The Deputy will appreciate that if a precedent were established for givíng such information, a situation would inevitably arise sooner or later where there would be a disclosure of payment that would involve <Col N="219" /> the effective identification of the recipient or recipients, and that in turn would result in their being put in serious jeopardy, all the more so because of the seriousness of the crimes in relation to which special rewards are liable to be offered. It would not be enough to refuse to give any information in a particular case where such a problem would arise as such a refusal, given the precedent that had been established in other cases, would be tantamount to an admission that money had in fact been paid. Furthermore, the risk of disclosure, if it existed&mdash;or, to put it another way, any doubt about the ability of the authorities to give an effective assurance of confidentiality&mdash;could result in people not responding who might otherwise do so. In those circumstances, I think it necessary to ask the Dáil to accept that this is not the sort of question that could be answered without the risk of serious repercussions in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat the answer to Question No. 3:</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána are authorised under article 4 of the Road Traffic (Removal, Storage and Disposal of Vehicles) Regulations 1971 to remove and store vehicles which have been illegally parked.  The regulations do not specify the method to be employed for such removal.  On occasions when unlawfully parked vehicles have been found with keys in the ignition, they have been driven to the pound by members of the force.  It is not garda policy, however, to issue sets of keys to gardaí to enable locked unlawfully parked vehicles to be opened and driven to the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is aware that senior Garda officers responsible for traffic control are very strongly of the view that, where locked vehicles are causing total obstruction and require immediate removal, they should be given permission&mdash;as they already have entitlement under the statute so to do&mdash;to enter such vehicles and drive them to the pound?  The current system of sending for a pick-up truck is a total farce, causing even further traffic obstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The present regulation does not prescribe the exclusion of the method of which the Deputy speaks.  In my reply, I stated that the gardaí have, on occasions, driven cars to the pound. This is totally a matter for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and it is not the policy of the Garda to issue bunches of keys for this specific purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="231" /> not sympathetically consider having discussions with the traffic superintendents, particularly in the Dublin area, where such illegally parked and locked cars and lorries cause massive traffic obstruction and have to be, and should be, removed immediately.  The Garda are quite willing to do this, but, apparently, they are not issued with any set of keys. The Minister would earn the eternal gratitude of the travelling public if he would so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that it is Garda policy that keys are not issued in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  However, I shall have the matter taken up with the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There certainly would be risks.  Members of the Gardaí could be exposed unnecessarily to risk in the use of that practice.  To repeat the answer to Question No. 4:</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that Kilmoganny station has not been closed and there is no proposal to close the station.</P>
      <P>Due to accommodation problems in the station premises, the two gardaí who resided in the station up to 2 April were transferred to Thomastown on that date and the opening hours of the station were reduced.

Does he not consider that the present arrangement, which is most satisfactory from the point of view of the inspectors of taxes and public representatives, should continue?  Should it not continue, can the <Col N="233" /> Minister say whether it would be more appropriate then to address such inquiries to his office, so that no time would be lost in having immediate inquiries made.  This involves extremely urgent tax problems which occasionally arise in relation to constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only have the Government examined the question of high bank interest rates but we have played a very active role in getting to the <Col N="234" /> root cause of the international high interest rates in consultations which I have had at Finance Ministers level in the EEC, at the IMF in Hamburg and elsewhere.  These consultations will be continued in the course of my discussions with these Ministers at a meeting in Brussels this coming week.  We hope that we may see a move towards a lowering of the international interest rates. However, until such time as that emerges I do not want to hold out any undue hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism here in the House on a debate on bank interest rates went on to outline that a number of firms were hanging on by the skin of their teeth and the increase in the bank interest rates would mean the difference between survival and disappearance with significant job losses for a lot of these firms, and that the Government in the meantime have not done anything about this in that there have not been any additional aids or remedies or anything else provided by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the Deputy wants to refer questions to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism he should do that.  As far as the aids provided by the Government are concerned, the Deputy will be aware from a previous question on this topic a few weeks ago that I indicated that the Government are providing exchange risk guarantee through the ACC for farming and through the ICC for industry and this has been of very considerable assistance.  That seems to contradict the Deputy when he said we did not do anything.  I assure the Deputy that across the whole range of these activities the impact of this unwelcome development internationally is something that we are endeavouring to cushion, taking account of our responsibility to the taxpayer generally.  Otherwise the easy and immediate answer would be to subsidise in every event and to call on the taxpayer to pay more and more.  I am not prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>The stability of our currency within the EMS, and it has been very stable at the centre of the band.  The exchange risk for either industry or agriculture is not at all as was apprehended it might be.  As I have said already, they should be encouraged to take up the sources of credit that are available in the normal course and I will encourage them to do so and that would act not only in ease of themselves but also in ease of the management of public finances, which is a matter of some concern at this stage.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is no risk for industry borrowing abroad in the exchange fluctuations and there is no risk for the Government either and this is one of the themes that will give this guarantee by the Government and will give them the courage to go into the markets of Europe and borrow money if they are assured there is no exchange risk?

Secondly, to introduce this as being a general principle that the Government should subsidise against the impact of these events when other Governments are not doing so would be something that in responsibility I could not do.  The industries themselves should engage in a practice which, understandably, has not been their practice, tied as they were more or less to one market, of looking to other markets particularly in Europe and elsewhere, and they will find that not only are the sources of credit there but they are at competitive rates which will be in their interests and the interests of the economy.</P>

Inflation rates in other countries by comparison with experiences of some years ago&mdash;as Deputies across the way will be aware particularly&mdash;were very much higher in proportion to ours than they are now.  As far as interest rates are concerned&mdash;the leader of the Opposition raised this question previously&mdash;in real terms, not just proportionate terms, since June of last year the increase in interest rates has been lower in this country than in any of our partners in the EEC.

      <P>The Minister talks about the stability of the currency within the EMS and I acknowledge that.  However, does he appreciate that farmers and people involved in industry in Border areas who have their banking accounts in Northern Ireland and who were forced <Col N="238" /> to bring their banking accounts into the Republic were forced to increase their overdrafts.  In other words, if they had an overdraft of £100,000 in Northern Ireland they needed £112,000 or £110,000 to discharge that amount by using the punt as against sterling.  This forced the farmers in Border areas and those involved in industry there to pay a higher interest rate on the increased overdraft. The Fianna Fáil Government forced them to do this.  Does the Minister consider that the advantages within the EMS outweigh the advantages of Irish unity?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the targets set by the Government for the reduction of unemployment in 1977, 1978, and 1979, the actual reduction achieved in each year and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The job targets leading to a reduction in unemployment were set out in the White Paper <i>National Development 1977-1980</i> published in January 1978.  These were 5,000 (for the latter half of 1977, and 20,000 and <Col N="240" /> 25,000 for the calendar years 1978 and 1979 respectively.</P>
      <P>The actual outturn for the second half of 1977 is estimated at 4,000 and for the subsequent years 1978 and 1979 the figures are now estimated at 15,000 and 13,000 respectively.  The 1979 estimate must be regarded as tentative at this stage.  Definitive figures for employment increases in these years must await the results of the 1979 labour force survey and revisions to the earlier labour force surveys on foot of the population changes shown by the 1979 census. These figures are expected to be available in the late autumn.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the shortfall from the targets have been set out in the White Paper <i>National Development 1977-1980, Programme for National Development 1978-1981</i> and <i>Investment and National Development 1979-1983.</i>  The main reasons were a rapid increase in wage costs in 1978 which led to a slower than expected expansion in industrial jobs and a greater than expected number of jobs lost through redundancy and, in 1979, higher oil prices and losses in output due to industrial disputes.</P>
      <P>Another factor which contributed to the shortfall was a greater than anticipated fall in agricultural employment in 1979.</P>
      <P>The total increase of 32,000 in employment in the period as now estimated was an impressive achievement especially when compared with the fall of 15,000 in employment between April 1973 and April 1977.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the progress made in the past three years is satisfactory?  If 50 per cent of the target has been achieved, is that record satisfactory as far as he is concerned? Are the reasons given as being responsible for the shortfall of nearly 50 per cent in job creation to be found in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, because that is the document to which I referred as setting out the targets on which the Minister got into Government?  Is he now admitting 50 per cent of a shortfall?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking if I am satisfied with the progress and I think I can say yes, very definitely; and I think it will illustrate why when I say that the fall in registered unemployment in Ireland in 1978 and 1979 exceeded that in any other member state in the EEC.  This is good reason for being very satisfied in contrast with patterns existing elsewhere when the rise in unemployment here in the mid-seventies exceeded that in any other member state of the European Community.  In view of the dramatic change that has occurred the Deputy will see why I have every reason to be satisfied.</P>

That being so is it not the case that the Government have met only 44 per cent of their target at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>By any criterion, whether in terms of extra people at work, the drop in registered unemployment or comparisons with any of our partners in what has become a very difficult time, in each of these areas, the percentage change in the annual average registered unemployment here last year and the previous year is something about which we can be rather happy.

      <P>I did not say the Government have no intention of implementing it.  In fact the report has been made available to the county development team in Roscommon.  Only in the last few weeks, when this question was down previously, I indicated to the Deputy that I thought the report could be made available on request by them.  I still believe that to be the case.  It is a matter for them after that.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider providing an airport for the West in Strokestown?  This might be a matter for laughter on the Fine Gael benches because they do not have any concern for the west but it is not a matter for laughter on this side of the House, I am sure Deputy Burke does not share their laughter.  We are concerned about development in that area.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  With regard to the second part, the points raised in the copy of the document furnished by the Deputy would entail detailed regulation of the egg trade in this country, including domestic production, normally a matter outside my area of responsibility.  From the viewpoint of controlling egg smuggling for which there is little incentive at the present, I would have reservations about the feasibility and justification of such a comprehensive scheme of regulation as that proposed.  However, should egg smuggling become a significant problem, I would have all available courses of action examined fully.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Minister not agree that because the revised list comes out on 1 December and appeals must be lodged within 28 days, due to the fact that ratepayers are not informed until well into December, with the intervention of the Christmas period, it is nearly impossible to get appeals in on time?  As the Minister is aware, the date was originally 1 March, changed to 1 September for EEC purposes and changed since to 1 October and 1 December.</P>

      <P>An advertisement is inserted in all local papers in the first few days of September notifying ratepayers that the revised valuation lists are then open for inspection.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Minister not agree that putting an advertisement in the paper telling people that they may come and inspect the list is very little help and they do not really get to know until they get a little card half way through the month?  Would the Minister not also agree that, because the date on which the result of the previous year's revision comes down is 1 December and because the last date for listing the revisions for the next year is also 1 December, that means if a person misses the appeal he is left for one year paying at the higher rate and it is a year before he can initiate the matter again?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's question is prompted by his concern for the ratepayers.  I would hope that the fact that there are public notices in the paper in addition to the fact that notification is given to each individual ratepayer should be sufficient to alert them.  If there are other problems that arise despite those notifications I will <Col N="253" /> refer them to the Minister for the Public Service.  I cannot do any more than that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions No. 16 and No. 17 together.</P>
      <P>The Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment is established under the terms of the National Understanding for Economic and Social Development and is representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry as well as of the Government. The question of moneys being made available by the committee from the Employment Guarantee Fund is one for decision by the committee itself exclusively. The decisions of the committee in this matter are taken having regard to such considerations as other sources of finance and is subject to the committee being satisfied that support from the Employment Guarantee Fund is necessary in order to guarantee the creation or maintenance of certain levels of employment which would not otherwise be achieved.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Tripartite Standing Committee on 1 May was to assist specific development programmes for Arklow Pottery Limited and Castle Brand Limited by means of grants from the Employment Guarantee Fund of £160,500 and £100,000 respectively and to make a grant of £100,000 to the Bloomfield House Hotel Limited.  Payment of these grants is strictly conditional on the creation or maintenance of levels of employment as follows:</P>
      <P>Arklow Pottery Limited creation of 35-40 additional jobs in 1980;</P>
      <P>Castle Brand Limited, maintenance of 10 jobs which would otherwise be lost and creation of 13 additional jobs by end-1980:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> Bloomfield House Hotel Limited, maintenance of the present level of employment (34 permanent persons and 12 on a casual basis) and creation of 27 additional jobs.</P>
    <P>It was the view of the committee that these employment targets would not be achieved if the grants in question were not approved.</P>
    <P>The applications for assistance from the Employment Guarantee Fund for Arklow Pottery Limited, Castle Brand Limited and the Bloomfield House Hotel Limited were brought before the committee and sponsored by the Federated Union of Employers.</P>
    <P>The Bloomfield House Hotel Limited had requested grant assistance from Bord Fáilte before an approach was made on its behalf to the Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment, but this grant assistance had not been forthcoming as the venture was undertaken at a time when Bord Fáilte did not have a grant scheme for new projects. As regards Castle Brand Limited, the position is that, when the committee made its decision to support the development programme for this company, the only assistance granted from such State sources as the ICC, the IDA and Fóir Teoranta for that programme specifically was an R &amp; D grant for £2,500 approved by the IDA.  In the case of Arklow Pottery Limited, the development programme being assisted by the committee had been approved for a 25 per cent grant by the IDA in 1977, but, due to financial difficulties, the company had not been in a position to avail of this facility.  The grant from the Employment Guarantee Fund to Arklow Pottery Limited approved by the Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment will enable the company to launch this programme and to accept the grant approved by the IDA in 1977.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I got every detail of this answer which, long though it was, the Minister read very fast.  Had any of the three firms, Castle Brand in Nenagh, Bloomfield Hotel in Mullingar or Arklow Potteries, applied <Col N="256" /> to Bord Fáilte in the case of the hotel, or to Fóir Teoranta or the IDA or the ICC in the case of the other two for any assistance which had been refused or declined by any of these four bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with each of those points.  I read the reply very quickly so perhaps I had better repeat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to read it again.  Had these three firms gone the whole way with all the existing statutory modes of help and gone the whole way in vain before they came to this committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Each case is different. As I indicated, in respect of the hotel application there were no funds available from Bord Fáilte at that time. In relation to Castle Brand they got a research and development grant in respect of the work programme which enabled them to create these extra jobs. Arklow Potteries have received grant assistance but this was in respect of maintaining employment at a certain level and in fact in some cases increasing employment which is the particular responsibility of the tripartite committee. The fact that grants are not made available by any other State agency is not in itself a determining factor in the consideration by the tripartite committee. There is no condition precedent that they have to discharge in terms of dealing with applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not admit that at the very least if it is not absolutely undesirable it is an extremely messy administrative scene when we have on the industrial front no less than three statutory agencies with a function in this matter and now we have a fourth which has only recently become a statutory body and the relationship between them is not properly defined? Would the Minister not agree that that is a messy and unsatisfactory scene particularly when there is a potential £10 million in public money involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a statutory agency.  It does not in any way correspond to the IDA or CTT or Bord Fáilte. It has been found to be very effective in areas of maintaining employment or increasing employment by way of immediate and urgent reaction while the other agencies might not be able to give the same immediate response.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to a statement' by the Prison Officers' Association proposing to instruct its members to ban the supervision of evening recreation in jails, because they feel that manning levels have dropped to a dangerously low level; if he is aware that 53 of the 86 officers were unavailable to work overtime in Mountjoy Prison last week where it is claimed there were strong indications of a mass breakout; if, in view of the serious deteriorating conditions caused by a lack of adequate numbers of prison officers to carry out duties in reasonable normal working hours he will state the urgent and immediate steps he proposes to take, in the interest of the proper safety of prison staff offenders and the general public, to meet the serious threat to the breakdown of security in our prisons; and if he will make a comprehensive statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that problems could arise in relation to the manning of the prisons during the evening recreation period after 5 p.m.  The difficulty is that prison staff are not working overtime in sufficient numbers after 5 p.m. to meet the required manning levels.  It has been traditional for prison staff to supervise prisoners during this period on overtime, which is built-in to the rosters.  Excessive overtime has been a feature of the prison service for some time.  However, additional staff are being recruited this year which should reduce overtime working substantially.</P>
      <P>Built-in overtime can only be eliminated by changes in the rosters, and changes cannot be made without the agreement of the Prison Officers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> The position about staffing and rosters is as follows:&mdash;Between January 1975 and January 1980 the number of persons in custody in the charge of prison officers has risen from a daily average of 1,019 to 1,140.  In the same period the number of prison officers rose from 682 to 1,151.  Additionally, this year, 1980, 400 prison officers will be recruited, trained and assigned to duty. This represents a net increase of about 350 or 30 per cent over the staff numbers on the 1 January 1980.  It is, accordingly, expected that the number of serving prison officers will be 1,500 by the end of 1980.  So far this year, 234 additional prison officers have been recruited and about 50 more are expected to take up duty on 24 May 1980.</P>
    <P>Since August 1979, a working party, including representatives of the POA, has been engaged in a study of rostering in the prison service.  It has not been possible for the working party to agree on a suitable alternative roster.  It is open to the POA to continue discussions on rostering arrangements within the working party.  The decision whether or not to unlock a prison for evening recreation, having regard to the number of staff on duty, is a management decision.  If management are satisfied that it would be too dangerous to unlock, then obviously the decision should be taken not to unlock.</P>
    <P>This decision can be avoided by prison officers working overtime in sufficient numbers, especially in view of the fact that additional staff is being recruited and the fact that it remains open to the Prison Officer's Association to continue to negotiate on all problems affecting the prison service, including the question of new rostering arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about this problem and the potentially dangerous situation that could arise and I would hope that the POA would agree to continue to negotiate on the issue to try to arrive at an acceptable solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that his failure to respond <Col N="262" /> to this request put forward by the prisoner officers to operate a roster is the cause of the friction that has developed within the prisons?  Does he accept that responsibility rests at his door?  The prisoner officers have been pointing out to the Department and the Minister the need to have extra prison officers recruited because of the increase in prison population, but no action has been taken by the Minister.  Does the Minister agree that it is regrettable that men who give their professional commitment to do their best for society are forced into doing things which are against their natural instinct because of the lack of interest shown by the Minister and his Department?  Will the Minister assure the House that there will be no further delay on his part to respond to any reasonable request put forward by the Prison Officers Association?</P>

      <P>I reject what the Deputy has said because there has been a constant response from the Minister and the Department to this situation.  The suggested roster by the POA is still under active consideration.  Many aspects of it must be looked at and carefully considered. It proposes that an additional recruitment of 1,000 prison officers take place and that, along with many other aspects, could cost the enormous figure of £5 million.  The House must be aware where public moneys are involved I have a definite responsibility to ensure the adequacy of the service as it stands and the justification for an increase or development of that service, having regard to the enormous costs involved. Everything possible is being done and negotiations continuing.  Contacts were made this week and are continuing to be made daily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 provides that where people have had a licence or a monopoly in respect of a plant they can apply to the controller who, if he feels they did not get enough money out of the plant during the period of their original monopoly, can extend the monopoly for a longer period.  The Minister said we should not worry about this being abused because people could almost perpetuate their monopoly.  Subsection (2) provides that the controller shall not be allowed to extend the monopoly beyond the overall period prescribed under section 4 (10).  That sounds a very persuasive answer until you read section 4 (10) which prescribes no limit whatever on the length of a monopoly.  It prescribes a minimum period for the monopoly and says that the monopoly shall be granted in the case of certain types of plants for not less than 18 years and in respect of other types of plants for not less than 15 years.  No upper limit whatever is placed on the overall period which should be allowed for a monopoly.  For the Minister to say an extension cannot be granted for anything greater than the upper limit is of no value when the upper limit is not set and can be indefinite as it is open to be under section 4 (10).</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(e)  the Controller is satisfied that the holder is operating the plant breeders right in such a way as to hold the level of prices being charged for the variety in Ireland above the level which would be justified as remuneration for the <Col N="282" /> costs associated with developing and marketing the variety,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We were discussing earlier the compulsory licensing provision whereby if an individual felt that a monopoly was being abused he could apply for a licence. In the absence of an application by somebody for a compulsory licence, the controller can decide to revoke the monopoly.  I am proposing that the controller be required to revoke the monopoly if he is satisfied the holder of the licence is operating in such a way as to hold the level of prices being charged for the variety in Ireland above the level which would be justified as remuneration. We feel that this Act should not be allowed to operate to increase unreasonably the price of seeds being charged to Irish farmers, to disadvantaged Irish agriculture, and that the power in the Act to revoke licences should be precise and fully used.  At present the section only provides that the revocation may take effect in certain cases, such as the non-payment of fees or failure to maintain a variety.  It does not take into account the situation in which the monopoly may be operated in such a way as to lead to excessive prices. I feel that such an extension of the revocation grounds should be provided for.</P>

      <P>The grounds on which revocation may take place include failure to provide information, failure to supply the controller with reproductive material, failure to pay fees.

      <P>Before revoking the licence the controller must follow certain procedures.  For example, he must give notice to the holder and give general notice, probably by publication in the journal, of his intention to revoke.  He must consider any representations or objections, and in the case of non-payment of fees he must allow a reasonable time for repayment.  Then, the holder may appeal to the High Court within a certain period.  Section 16 of the Bill covers the matter of maintenance of a variety.</P>

    <P>I note that section 8 is mentioned among the sections to which this appeal procedure applies.  Is it envisaged that one can appeal to the Appeal Committee against the decision of the Minister in the case of a grant of a compulsory licence <Col N="284" /> or would one be able to appeal to the Minister against a decision of the Appeal Committee?

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see considerable difficulty here.  If someone is maintaining a variety in some part of the world far distant from here, the controller would not have the opportunity to inspect it <Col N="288" /> over there.  He would not have any power to go over and inspect it <i>in situ.</i>  I do not know very much about this question of characteristics of plants, but one of the conditions under which a variety might be deemed to be a new one would be that it would have characteristics which would enable it to survive in Irish conditions.  If it is not being maintained in Ireland but, let us say, it is being maintained in Canada and all that the controller is entitled to get is a dead plant sent from Canada to satisfy him that the plant is being maintained in Canada, it might be possible that the plant might have evolved in the interim period while in Canada to such an extent that, while it would survive in Canada, it would no longer survive in Irish conditions because the characteristics which it had when the breeder originally got the grant for it in Ireland no longer obtained.</P>
      <P>If these characteristics had been bred out of it by continued breeding in Canada, it would seem in that event that the requirements that it be maintained in Canada to satisfy Irish regulations would not be sufficient to meet the spirit of the Act.  Has the Minister considered that possibility?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>All that the breeder would have to do here is to prove that the plant was distinct, uniform and stable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the whole idea, as I understand it, of maintenance of a variety and of giving a person the monoply here is to ensure that the variety will be available to people here if they want to use it for further breeding. That is the idea of including maintenance of the variety as one of the basic conditions under which one obtains the licence in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the variety is being maintained outside this country but in such a way that, although it might be available to the people it would no longer survive here because it had evolved in a different fashion, or had not been treated in the proper way, all that the controller is entitled to get is a dead specimen of the plant and he would not be able to establish <Col N="289" /> if this is the case.  Am I correct in believing that what the controller must be able to get, to satisfy himself that the plant is being maintained, is something that would be in a form fresh enough to be capable of being planted here to see if it could survive in Irish conditions, as had been originally the case when the application was granted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The plant, of course, does not have to survive here.  Section 16 (3) sets out quite clearly what is to be done here.</P>
      <P>It shall also be the duty of every holder to afford to the Controller all such information and facilities as he may request for the purpose of satisfying himself that the holder is fulfilling his duty under subsection (2) of this section, including facilities for the inspection by or on behalf of the Controller of the measures taken for the maintenance of the relevant plant variety and if the Controller is satisfied that a holder has failed to comply with the request under this subsection he may, if he thinks fit, terminate, with effect on and from such day, as the controller shall specify the period during which the plant breeders' rights under the relevant grants under section 4 of this Act are exercisable......</P>

      <P>Whereas that might not have been so when the original grant was given.  If, through the effuxion of time the evolution of the variety, and the way in which it has been maintained it has lost its characteristics and would not be able to survive here, getting the Canadian controller of plant varieties to satisfy himself that it is being maintained in Canada would not meet the requirements of the Act as far as surviving in Irish conditions was concerned and would not satisfy the requirement of maintenance as far as Ireland was concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that. However, what I am worried about is that the breeder might be granted the right in the first place when the plant varieties were in a condition that they were capable of surviving here but subsequently might be maintained in Canada in a manner which would lead them to lose the characteristic that enabled them to survive in Ireland.  In other words, they would be stable to that extent.  They would be stable in every other respect but not in their capacity to survive here. The Canadian controller would not necessarily be aware of the change of the characteristics which might lead them to be no longer capable of surviving in Irish conditions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11b:</P>
      <P>In page 21, subsection (1), between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g)  the number of plant breeders rights held by each holder, the identity of the ultimate owner of each right, the price at which seeds of each variety in respect of which rights have been granted are being sold in Ireland and in all other convention countries, and all other information available to him that would be relevant to determining whether reasonable prices are being charged for the plant varieties in respect of which plant breeders rights have been granted by him,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 19 is concerned with publication of a journal by the controller on the operation of the legislation.  The amendment that I propose requires that additional information be given in the journal from time to time.  The information that I would like to see given would be the number of plant breeders' rights held by each holder, the identity of the ultimate owner of each right, the price at which seeds of each variety in respect of which rights have been granted are being sold in Ireland and in other convention countries, and all other information available to him which would be relevant to determining whether reasonable prices are being charged for the plant varieties in respect of which plant breeders' rights <Col N="293" /> have been granted by him.  The idea is that there should be some system for monitoring publicly the effect of this legislation.  We have argued here already that in that the Bill confers a monopoly it does confer on some people the possibility of charging a higher price than otherwise would be charged for certain services.  I would be afraid that this right might be abused.</P>
    <P>There is also a strong feeling in many circles that this legislation may benefit a few companies who, by virtue of the very heavy investment involved in plant breeding, will tend to have the control of a large number of varieties of plants because only large multi-national companies will possibly be capable of making the type of investment necessary to develop new varieties of plant.  The concentration of these monopoly rights in the hands of a small number of large multi-national companies could pose a danger to the farming community in all parts of the world.  Particularly concern has been expressed about the effect that legislation like this in the developed world could have on the availability of new varieties of plants to people in the Third World or the poorer parts of the world.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that the controller would be required in the journal from time to time to give information as to who really owns these monopolies that are being granted under our legislation. Is it a few large companies or is it a large variety of different people?  Are the prices being charged fair and reasonable or are they excessive?  If the controller is required to publish this information in the journal it will mean that he will have to keep a close watch on the development of the legislation.  This amendment may go too far in that some of the information would be very difficult to collect. However, there should be some requirement on the controller to ensure that some definite information is given in the journal regularly on the development and use of the monopoly powers being conferred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The information <Col N="294" /> proposed to be published periodically in the journal would be on lines similar to those of other convention countries and is based on a model UPOV journal which all member states are advised to follow.  This would not include the amendment proposed and, therefore, I do not propose to accept it.  In any event, the number of rights held by a holder keep changing because of deletions and new rights.  The price of seed is under the control of merchants and varies depending on market conditions. Royalties would come to only about five per cent of the retail seed price.</P>

We are bound to adhere to the terms of the convention but there is nothing whatever in the convention which would prevent us from ensuring that information of the nature that I have mentioned is contained in the journal. The Minister should consider requiring that some such information is contained in the journal because otherwise we will have no way of knowing whether this legislation is causing excessive prices to be charged.</P>

It seems that a fine of £100 is a mere nothing to many of the people who may be involved in this business whereas being locked up for three months could be quite serious.  The maximum fine should bear some relationship to the alternative term of imprisonment.  I should have thought £2,000 or £3,000 would be more appropriate as the maximum fine if the maximum term of imprisonment is three months.  This seems an odd combination.</P>

      <Col N="299" /> This amendment makes provision for the controller to collect a fee on the issue of a certificate of plant breeders' rights.  The proposed new paragraph (d) is merely reproducing one fee in the original draft. The proposed insertion of paragraph (e) would allow the controller to charge fees in relation to any other services given for plant breeders' rights&mdash;for example, a fee for granting a compulsory licence.</P>

But, having gone to considerable expense to prove all that has to be proved&mdash;and a person might be acting primarily in the interests of the consumer rather than himself because of overcharging&mdash;now the Minister says this person has to pay a fee as well.  That is unfair.  I do not see why a fee should be charged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree, because the compulsory licensing procedure in this legislation is not so much as a protection for the potential applicant or other merchants as for the consumer against overcharging.  This is the case the Minister was making all along when he said that the safeguard against the abuse of a monopoly was the compulsory licence.  If that is so, it seems that somebody when applying for a compulsory <Col N="300" /> licence is trying to do the public a favour as well as himself.  It does not seem to be fair that he should be asked to pay a fee which, from what the Minister says, would cover the entire cost of the operation of the examination of the compulsory licence application by the controller's office.  This bears out my suspicions that there is no intention that the compulsory licensing procedure will be used and that it will be made impossibly difficult for people to get compulsory licences.</P>

As of right and automatically the farming community, representatives of plant breeders and representatives of distributors of seeds and plants should be guaranteed by law the right to be consulted before regulations of this nature are made.  I realise the Minister probably intends to consult them, but in view of the fact that there will be a very large number of highly technical regulations made under this Bill and that the Bill will have little effect without all the regulations which will have to be made as they will contain the meat of the new legislation, it is important that they be made available to the various interests who can give their comments in time and that should be statutorily guaranteed.

      <P>In page 24, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Any regulation or order made under section 2 of this Act shall only take effect after its terms have been approved by resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The normal procedure is that orders made under this Bill shall be on the table of the House for 21 days and if any Member of the House feels that they are in any way objectionable he has the power to put down a motion to annul that regulation.  I have objection to that procedure in this case.  I object on a general basis to the idea that one can only annul them and not amend them because it is a sort of inertia selling. Unless a Member is industrious enough to go to the Library and dig out all the regulations and read them in full, these regulations are never scrutinised at all; but that is another day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> In this case the idea of making law by that means is especially objectionable because section 2 of the Bill is concerned with giving the State power to enter into new international treaties in respect of plant varieties.  Any treaty being made by the State should have the affirmative approval of this House.  No matter how esoteric the subject matter of the treaty it is still an international treaty binding on this country and no Government should have the power to incorporate a treaty into domestic law by means of a regulation which is never discussed here in this House.  In 999 cases out of 1,000, regulations made under the normal procedure of lying on the table of the House for 21 days are never discussed. That is no way to make a treaty. Therefore I propose that in the case of any regulations made giving effect to international agreements under section 2 there be a definite requirement that those regulations not be allowed to take effect until they have been approved by vote in this House.  I recollect that when we were discussing section 2 the Minister seemed quite sympathetic to the case I was making and I hope he will be able to accept the amendment now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not just any order. This is a convention.  This enables the Minister to bring into effect further conventions or agreements in respect of plant varieties.  For instance, it may well be decided that the terms of the UPOV Convention will be radically altered to make it much more restrictive than it now is or a new convention concerned with plant varieties of a much more restrictive character may be proposed. Under section 2 the Minister has the power to adhere to that convention and make it the law of the land without the need to do what he has to do on this occasion in relation to the bringing of the <Col N="304" /> existing UPOV Convention into force here, namely, introduce a Bill and have it properly discussed here in this House.  It seems very wrong that an international treaty of this nature, which could be quite wide-ranging in its effect, should be capable of being introduced into the law of this country without having had the definite affirmative approval of this House.  This is a point of fundamental principle as far as parliamentary democracy is concerned.</P>

      <P>I am still of the opinion that this amendment would be unnecessarily restrictive.  Deputy Bruton's argument is perhaps of a more general nature and might be more properly put to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The provisions of this section are no different to similar provisions in many of the Bills passed by this House before and I do not think they ever had to comply with what this amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton sets out to make them comply with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If this power had already existed under existing law there would not have been any discussion on this Bill at all here today.  In other words, the Minister is saying that he would prefer never to have this sort of discussion again on any new convention concerning plant varieties.  He wants the power to be able to dispense with all of this charade of the last four or five days with amendments and approving the legislation so that he can say that it is all right, that he did not have the power the last time. This UPOV Convention existed and unfortunately he had to go through this bother of discussing the matter and accepting a few amendments, but that in future he is going to make sure that he does not have to discuss it at all because he is going to take the power to ensure that he will be able to adhere to any new conventions made on this subject without any of this bother of having parliamentary discussion on the thing or any other time-wasting exercises.  That seems to be the type of attitude that the Minister is, although not intentionally, adopting if he is going to refuse to accept <Col N="305" /> the amendment I am putting forward.  I would remind him that this provision in section 2 is not concerned solely with the existing UPOV Convention.  It says:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of enabling any international convention or agreement for the protection of plant varieties and plant breeders' rights to which the State is a party to be carried into effect, the Government may by order declare one or more foreign countries, which foreign country, or each of which foreign countries, shall be one whose government or any of whose departments of state is a party to the convention or agreement, to be a convention country for the purposes of this Act, and for so long as the order remains in force any foreign country which is one specified in the declaration contained therein shall be a convention country for the purposes of this Act.</P>

      <P>That is not clear in the Bill before us because section 2 does not refer to the UPOV Convention but to any international convention. Presumably, this enables us to bring into our law any new conventions which may be made.  There may be a new convention entirely, independent of the UPOV, about plant varieties.  Ireland has now signed the UPOV Convention and I should like to know if section 2 only allows us to make the effect of signing the UPOV Convention and not for giving statutory effect to it?  To give it statutory effect it would have to have a substantive Bill.  Is it simply the case that section 2 gives us the full power to make the new convention, whatever it may be, effective here?</P>

      <P>In page 24, before section 28, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;The Minister may by order make regulations to prevent the import of potentially deleterious seeds or to prevent injurious cross pollination affecting crops of seeds, where such regulations are necessary and after consultation with the appropriate interests.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> It possibly is the case that we already have power under some other legislation to deal with this matter.  Basically, I am seeking to make provision to allow the Minister to make regulations to prevent the importation of dangerous seeds which may lead to the spread of disease or lead to injurious cross-pollination affecting crops of seeds.  If this power does not already exist it should be included in this legislation because we should not be allowing seeds to be brought in here which would do damage to existing seed types in use here.  The Minister should have some power in that direction.  It may be that the Minister already has this power but a section like this was not incorporated in the British legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the proposed amendment is unnecessary as the importation of potentially deleterious seeds is already prevented by existing legislation.  Our regulations on the marketing of agricultural and vegetable seeds introduced to comply with EEC directives lays down the conditions under which these may be marketed.  In general, we are obliged to allow the marketing of all seeds that meet EEC requirements, irrespective of whether the seed is produced in the EEC or in certain Third World countries benefiting from equivalents from the EEC for seeds. However, in all seed regulations there is a saver which provides for what the Deputy has in mind.  The wording, generally, is as follows: &ldquo;Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as affecting a provision of any statute, whether passed before or after the making of these regulations, which is a provision for the protection of human life or health, animal life or health, plant life or health or industrial or commercial property&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" />&ldquo;29.&mdash;On the commencement of this Act the Minister shall request either the National Prices Commission or the Restrictive Practices Commission to report to him within five years as to whether any provisions of the Act have led in any case to unreasonable prices being charged for seeds or plant varieties in Ireland and as to the amendments to the Act which would be necessary to prevent such unreasonable prices being charged.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have had a discussion on practically all sections on the possibility that the Bill which does confer a monopoly might lead to excessive prices being charged.  This amendment proposes that an independent body such as the National Prices Commission or the Restrictive Practices Commission would be asked to report on the operation of this Act within five years of its having become law.  I am suggesting that they inquire as to whether in any case the Act has led to unreasonable prices being charged for seeds or plant varieties in Ireland and to make recommendations for amendments to the Act which might be necessary to prevent any abusively high prices being charged.  The amendment does not in any sense tie the Minister's hands.  It is merely requiring him to ensure that an investigation is undertaken.  It is quite possible that an investigation of this nature might be undertaken anyway in respect of applications for increases in price by seedsmen to the National Prices Commission.  It would be a useful guarantee against any abuse of this legislation if people knew there was an independent body such as the NPC or the Restrictive Practices Commission undertaking an independent overview of the legislation with a view to reporting in five years' time its findings and any changes they might consider necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I may allay the Deputy's fears here.  The terms of the Restrictive Practices Act will apply in the ordinary way to this legislation.  In addition, my Department will keep an overall eye on <Col N="310" /> developments.  If any amendment should turn out to be necessary it will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with that because I know from bitter experience that the restrictive practices legislation here is almost entirely ineffective.  It does not work because of the very cumbersome administrative machinery that is there for the investigation of complaints. The examiner has to carry out an investigation. He has not got the staff or the power to investigate properly.  Until he has completed his investigation, the case is not referred to the Restrictive Practices Commission.  When they have completed their investigation an order has to be made to give effect to the regulations they feel are necessary to prevent whatever abuses they have found.</P>
      <P>It has been the experience that the regulations which have been made under the Restrictive Practices Act in most cases, perhaps, have been unenforceable. I have a particular case in mind about restriction on collusion in respect of drink prices in public houses.  Extensive regulations have been made under the 1965 Order which have proved to be totally unenforceable.  I do not feel the Minister's assurance that the existing procedures under the Restrictive Practices Act will operate in this case is worth anything, because I do not believe that Act is working.  I am proposing something different from the application of that Act.  An overall investigation should be undertaken of the Act by the Restrictive Practices Commission not with a view to the introduction of specific anti-monoply measures under the Act, which is what the Minister has in mind, but the publication of a general report on the Act.  By virtue of its coming from an authoritative source such as the Restrictive Practices Commission, it would have an informative and moral effect in preventing abuses of monopolies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a report came out from the Restrictive Practices Commission or the Prices Commission saying they felt that in three or four cases overcharging had occurred, <Col N="311" /> the publication of that report would tend in itself to highlight the abuse and lead to abuse not taking place.  The knowledge that such an investigation was under way would have a similar effect.  The Minister would lose nothing by accepting this amendment.  It does not tie him to any particular action.  I would ask him to consider accepting.  It would not cost very much and it would ensure that somebody was looking constantly and independently at the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This concerns a requirement for accepting a variety as being one for which a patent should be given.  It must not be previously commercialised, and it must be distinct and uniform.  As I mentioned earlier, at the moment there is a discussion in the United States of America on a similar Bill.  It is running into a lot of controversy in the House of Representatives.  The main fear being expressed there is rather different from the one we have been discussing.  It is that this type of legislation runs the risk of leading to a reduction in the total number of varieties of plants available.  The argument is that by requiring that the variety be uniform, in order to ensure that people comply with the terms of the Act and that there are no other variations <Col N="313" /> in a particular type of plant, if a plant is slightly different in some of its characteristics it is thrown away.  It is argued that this has encouraged the destruction of varieties of plants.  For example, in America it has been argued that about 200 plants become extinct every year and about 25,000 of varieties are in danger of extinction.  There are fears also that by promoting plants which are uniform one may tend to reduce the number of varieties that exist and that this may make the danger of an epidemic which would wipe out a whole countryside of plants more likely.  If one did not have the requirement to maintain different varieties of plants and if disease broke out within one variety it would not affect them all because some might be slightly resistant, whereas if one opts for varieties which are absolutely uniform, if one variety catches the disease it will eliminate the lot.  I will quote briefly from the submission of Mr. Woodrow Wilson to the US House Committee on Agriculture on 22 April last:</P>
      <P>The widespread use of uniform seeds with less resistance can result in a disaster like the epidemic of Southern corn leaf blight which destroyed much of the United States' corn crop in 1970.</P>
      <P>He also said that there had been a study by the Office of Technology Assessment in regard to the operation of legislation in the US.  He said:</P>
      <P>Many of the new varieties certified by the major seed companies during the ten years since the passage of the Plant Varieties Protection Act produced higher yields but are more vunerable to pests and disease.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly that there must be some means to ensure that we do not have an undue concentration on too small a range of plant varieties which are uniform because otherwise we would be vulnerable to the type of disaster I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore it is essential that the State should take on itself the duty of preserving <Col N="314" /> a bank of varieties which are slightly different from those patented because otherwise, because they are not commercial at the moment, they may be allowed to become extinct.  Definitely there is a danger of this happening and if the State does not do something about it is likely that the commercial firms will not do it because their only concern is with varieties of plants from which they can get an immediate return in the market as it obtains.  They are not concerned about whether the varieties they are marketing will be vulnerable to a disease that might break out in 15 years.  If they make enough profit between now and then they will be quite happy about that, whereas the State must be prepared to take a longer view and to preserve varieties of plants which might not be very marketable at the moment but which would be very useful in the event of some disease breaking out as a stock from which to build up new varieties which would be resistant to new diseases. If the only varieties available are those which are in constant commercial use and if a disease breaks out which affects all of them, we would be left without any stock from which to draw to build up new varieties which would be disease resistant.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the commercial companies will have a sufficient financial incentive to maintain gene banks of plant varieties which are not immediately marketable.  The State must do this because otherwise there is the danger that this legislation could lead to this eventuality.  I realise there is substantial disagreement among people as to whether what is leading to this increasing uniformity in plants has anything to do with this Bill, that it may be other factors that are causing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This schedule lays down the conditions of the UPOV Convention which a plant variety must satisfy in order to be regarded as new, and therefore <Col N="315" /> to qualify.  It must be distinct in one or more important characteristics: it must not have been previously commercialised in the State at any time or in any other country, prior to a period of six years in respect of vines, forest trees, fruit trees and ornamental trees, or four years for other species; it must be uniform or homogeneous to meet standards and criteria specified by the controller; it must be stable, that is, it must remain true to its description after repeated reproduction; it must be given a name to be specified by the applicant and approved by the controller as provided in section 12.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton said that the State had a duty to preserve plant varieties.  Most states are now establishing gene banks and we will do our best within our capabilities in this respect.  A link has not been established between the existence of plant breeders' rights and the decline in some countries of the number of plant varieties available.  Just because rights are granted does not mean that people must use these varieties.  People are still free to choose as before, and presumably they will use the varieties best suited to their needs.  During the Second Stage I said that there is a greater variety of plants now available to growers than ever before.</P>

As the Minister said, last year the title of the academic board was changed to academic council and had officials of the Department been <i>au fait</i> with the affairs of NIHE Limerick there would have been no need to use the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; in the Bill.  The word &ldquo;council&rdquo; should have been put in originally, I make that point because it is symptomatic of the structure of the Bill.  It is also a reflection of the fact that the Minister has had to bring in so many amendments.</P>

      <P>I should like to dispute philosophically what the Deputy has said.  The people who devised the system for our legislature saw to it that there were several stages.  It is the essence of democracy that at each stage inputs can be made.  I made the point originally that there was a board in the institute, that the name was changed to council and I told the House that was the reason for the amendment.  I reject also the suggestion that my officials, some of whom acted with distinction in the institute for a long time, were not <i>au fait</i> with what was going on.  I regard the whole process through Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage as being one that enables a democratic input and I do not <Col N="319" /> think it is a cause for criticism of amendments to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 24, after &ldquo;Awards&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, by a university in the State or by an equivalent degree awarding authority of international repute&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I consider this amendment is central to my approach to the Bill.  It goes back some years in that there has been a difference between my party and the Government in relation to the evolution of third level education.  This Bill embodies the principle of a binary system at third level and this is unfortunate.  The fact that the Minister has seen fit to designate the NCEA as the degree-awarding body is not acceptable to me. In this Bill the NCEA have a monopoly in relation to the awarding of degrees at NIHE, Limerick, and I assume something similar will be inserted in the Bill dealing with NIHE in Dublin.</P>
      <P>That is not acceptable.  There should be flexibility enabling the governing body of NIHE Limerick to look at their degrees and consider from where this should best be awarded.  I see no reason why the NCEA should not have the dominance in relation to the awarding of the degrees.  What I object to is their being given a monopoly in this matter.  The Minister has stated on a number of occasions that he is in favour of the comprehensive system in third level education in the long term.  If he is, certainly the Bill now before us does not lead to a comprehensive system, which is unfortunate. It does not even open the door towards a comprehensive system in third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be interrelationship between the NCEA and our university system.  Doors must be opened and there must be cross-fertilisation of ideas and services between the various third level institutions.  For that reason, my amendment is central to the Fine Gael policy in relation to third level education.  I would <Col N="320" /> certainly push it to a vote, it is a matter of principle rather than a matter of drafting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is clearly an important issue and one which should certainly be teased out at this stage of the debate, without necessarily committing ourselves irrevocably to any course of action.  This is an area which we should think about and if we need to come to a confrontation on it, probably that is best postponed until Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the point which Deputy Collins made, and I speak from the point of view of someone who also believes that an integrated comprehensive system of third level education, in the long term, is the best future that we could hope for in this country.  However, if we are going to have an integration, a move towards comprehensivisation, as it were, I would argue that such a move can only effectively take place if there is some degree of effective parity between the elements that are to be subject to this process.  I would favour, and the Minister and Deputy Collins would, no doubt favour, the maximum degree of transferability of students between all higher education institutes.  I do not, however, know that it is necessary at this point in order to facilitate student transfer between institutions, that we should have the possibility of NIHE courses at degree level receiving university validation rather than NCEA validation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer at this point in time to see a proposal that the NCEA should be responsible for all degree awards outside the university sector&mdash;which, in fact, is embodied in the NCEA Bill which has gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;given expression in this Bill.  In the circumstances, we should be slow to move towards the situation whereby there are alternative modes of validation for NIHE qualifications.  The main reason why I would be slow to accept this at this stage is that I am in favour of the principle of comprehensivisation of third level education is that it would make the job of planning even <Col N="321" /> more difficult than it is at present. Goodness knows, planning higher education is extremely difficult at the best of times.  I have a fear that opening this door would make it a little more difficult.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept Deputy Collins' amendment.  He has raised already in the House the question of the binary system and the comprehensive system and has been a little ambiguous about it, in one of the speeches at least, earlier on.  I have said, as Deputy Horgan recalls, that I would be very reluctant to introduce any structures which would be rigidarian, of having two systems not cross-pollinating but developing rigidly, independently and parallel with each other.  I have stated also that my vision of what will happen to the National Institution of Higher Education in Limerick is that it will become in due course a technological university.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Horgan that administration and organisation in the universities is difficult enough at the moment and that we would only be compounding the difficulties by having various assessment and degree awarding bodies dealing with one institution.  It would create difficulties from the administrative point of view.  It would also create difficulties within the institute itself, because you could very well have, not merely a number of degree awarding or diploma awarding bodies dealing with different sectors of the institute, but you could also have the position of students who would have to keep their eyes on a number of awarding bodies for the same discipline and the same subject, which has been true in this area before the establishment of the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, I made it quite clear that at the present stage of its development it is the Government's decision that the National Council for Educational Awards will be the degree, diploma and certificate awarding body for the National Institute.</P>

      <P>I see one problem here which relates to the transferability of students between the NIHE Limerick and, say, a university.  There is no arrangement in the Bill to have an open-ended attitude towards this matter.  Perhaps on this amendment the Minister might comment on this?  We all agree, or I hope we do, that there should be a concept of vertical and horizontal transferability of students between the higher education colleges and the universities.  It is important that some system be laid down to ensure this.  This problem is not tackled under this Bill.  The Minister should comment on this question, which is important for many students who perhaps attend a certificate or diploma course but would then like to move to a university college, for instance, to pursue a degree course.  Under this Bill the only degree awarding body is the NCEA.  I do not know what arrangements they have for transferability of students and would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Collins and Deputy Horgan that transferability is very important and the very fact that the NCEA are the degree-awarding body for the institute should be a help.  As the Deputy knows, because he assisted it through this House, the <Col N="323" /> NCEA Bill makes provision for reasonably heavy representation from the universities and the RTCs, which also are relevant in the matter of transferability.  The mechanics for transferability would have to be worked out between the RTCs, the National Institute and the universities where the RTC students want to have vertical mobility.  The NIHE, of Limerick, for example, if they get an application from a student in one of the university colleges would have to decide on the horizontal mobility, where that student would fit into their own structure.  It would be a question for the institute themselves.  It would be a question for the university to decide where a student, again for horizontal mobility, would fit in.  It would be quite different for a graduate; it would be just an assessment in that case. What should ease this is the fact that the council themselves are representative of a wide area of academic life, having people from the universities, the RTCs and the two National Institutes in their membership. There is hardly a more favourable milieu than that for transference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the amendment which Deputy Collins has put down will help to achieve the aim which we all share, and that is the aim of securing transferability of students between institutions.  We are talking about part of the definition section.  The reason I express doubt is that at degree level transferability arises in relation to a student who has acquired a degree going on to study for post-graduate work in another institution.  Involved there would be recognition by the other institution of the validity of the degree obtained at the NIHE rather than that the other institution should grant the NIHE degree in the first place.  In so far as it is related to transferability it might require another amendment to another part of the definition <Col N="324" /> section that we might discuss at another stage.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem in relation to all of this is that you cannot enforce anything on the universities in the matter of recognition.  You may twist their financial arms until they come out of the sockets and produce some results in certain areas, but you cannot force them to recognise anything that they do not want to recognise or to validate anything they do not want to validate in the system that they have.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 31 and 32, to insert &ldquo; `a graduate of the Institute' means a person who has received an academic award as a result of completing a course designated by the Governing Body for the purpose of defining a graduate;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This really is a definition of a graduate. Section 3 (1) (e) mentions a graduate of the institute.  This definition of a graduate of the institute is a drafting amendment rather than expressive of any feeling I hold in the matter.  I am stating merely that the graduate of the institute means a person who has received an academic award as the result of completing a course designated by the governing body for the purpose of defining a graduate.  It is a drafting amendment and it should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem about this.  The NCEA, who have been mentioned, award national certificates and national diplomas and degrees.  The word &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; here means someone who has been awarded a degree, in this case an NCEA degree, and we refrained from expanding any further on that because in the terms of the activity of the NCEA the meaning of &ldquo;degree&rdquo; and &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation with regard to the election of Members of Seanad Éireann will <Col N="325" /> be taking cognisance of graduates in the university colleges and will be taking cognisance also of graduates, people who hold degrees from the National Institute of Higher Education.  Consequently, this precludes me from accepting the amendment here.  Some people think there should be a tighter definition in the Bill of the word &ldquo;graduate&rdquo;, but I maintain that the words are clear enough in the context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said reinforces my opinion that there is a need for a graduate to be defined.  I appreciate the Minister's point.  I take it that if we have amending legislation to the composition of Seanad Éireann and that, for instance, a seat might be awarded to NIHE Limerick, then you have to define who is entitled to a vote for that panel or whether that legislation will allow graduates or degree holders from NIHE to have a vote under a different structure in relation to the composition of Seanad Éireann.  I take the Minister's point that there is a problem in relation to defining a graduate for the purposes of election to Seanad Éireann and that it is a degree holder the Minister is talking about.  There is a need for a tighter definition of the word &ldquo;graduate&rdquo;.  This matter should be tackled now rather than later where we might need an amending Bill to this one.  For the purpose of a graduate of the institute, if the Minister means a degree holder, he should say so.  On the other hand, if it is for the purpose of being a member of the institute&mdash;I do not know what benefit that confers&mdash;the Minister should state clearly that he means that a graduate is a degree holder.  If he means a certificate holder, a diploma holder and a degree holder he should state so also.  There is a need now to define a degree holder as a person who would have a vote in a Seanad election.  I would prefer to attack the matter now rather than later.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary to put it in this Bill as there will, of course, be a Bill introduced by the Minister for the Environment to cover the Seanad Éireann aspect of it.  I can see that by using <Col N="326" /> the word &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; in a loose way in other countries there could be some difficulty, but I think it is true that when we say &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; here we mean somebody who is a degree holder.  That is the meaning we attach to it in this Bill. That is the meaning that will attach to it in the legislation to cover the election to Seanad Eireann.  I am not sure if the Deputy asked me was it intended that graduates of the National Institute would have a vote in the Seanad elections but the intention is that they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a degree holder of the NIHE should have a vote in a Seanad election.  If the Minister, as he stated here, means that a graduate of the institute is to be interpreted as a degree holder, that should be stated.  It also means that a certificate holder or a diploma holder is not a member of the institute because the only members of the institute are degree holders; in other words, a person who holds a degree is a graduate of the institute.  There is a lot of sense in stating that quite clearly rather than leaving it subject to loose interpretation. I thought on reading section 3 (1) (e) that a graduate of the institute was a person who held a certificate or a diploma or a degree.  I thought any of those would be a graduate, but the Minister now states that is not so, that a graduate is only one who holds a degree. If that is what he means he should state it quite clearly because it will be open to misinterpretation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

That was my reading of the paragraph.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say that it was not what was intended but that what is intended is that a graduate of the institute is only a person who holds a degree.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The term &ldquo;Institute Body&rdquo; shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Article 1 (2) of the First Schedule.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is again a definition amendment.  In the First Schedule, Article 1(2) there occur the words &ldquo;The seal of the Institute Body.&rdquo;  There is need to define what &ldquo;Institute Body&rdquo; means.  In section 2 (2) it says:</P>
      <P>(2)  The Institute shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and power to sue and be sued in its corporate name and to acquire, hold and dispose of land.</P>
      <P>Article 1 of the First Schedule states:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come to that when I reach the relevant section and article.  Article 2 (2) of the First Schedule brings in something I do not understand&mdash;the <Col N="328" />&ldquo;Institute Body&rdquo;.  What is the &ldquo;Institute Body&rdquo;?

In these circumstances, the honorary degree has become a substitute for the honours which tend to be conferred by other administrations.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  (1) The functions of the Institute shall be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to provide degree level courses, diploma level courses and certificate level courses and, subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, such other courses, including post-graduate courses, as may seem appropriate to the Governing Body;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> (b)  to engage in research in such fields as the Governing Body may deem appropriate;</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to the approval of the Minister, after consultation with an tÚdarás&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to buy, acquire, maintain, manage, administer and invest all the property, money and assets of the Institute,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to institute and, if thought fit, to award scholarships, prizes and other awards;</P>
    <P>(d)  to accept from donors gifts of land or other property upon such trusts and conditions, if any, as may be specified by the donors; provided that nothing in any trust or condition is contrary to the provisions of this Act;</P>
    <P>(e)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to do all such acts and things as may be necessary to further the objects and development of the Institute.</P>
    <P>(2)  (a) The Minister may, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, by order assign to the Institute such additional functions as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(b)  Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this subsection, a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the Order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by order revoke or amend an order under this section including an order under this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the Chair rightly said this is an embracing amendment.  I have carefully considered the various representations made to me in relation to this section. For the purposes of clarification and to ensure that there will be no doubts as to the provisions of the section, the section <Col N="333" /> has been recast.  Provision has also been made for the assignment of additional functions to the institute by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>The revised wording of subparagraph (1) (a) has been introduced at the request of the institute.  I am sure the Deputies in their amendments wished to achieve the same purpose&mdash;to remove the limitations that the Minister's approval is required for the provision of courses other than certificate, degree and diploma courses leading to awards by the National Council for Educational Awards.  In this amendment I am proposing that the words &ldquo;subject to the Minister's approval&rdquo; should be replaced by the words &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo;.  I do not think there is need for any further comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First that the Minister should have to move this major amendment is a reflection on the poor drafting of the Bill.  He should have known clearly that the structure of section 4 of the original Bill, especially with the words &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo; was obnoxious as it applies to third level educational institutes. It is unfortunate that it was published in that form, and we can accept section 4 as amended by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 relates to continuing education of graduates and others.  That is something that should be specified in the Bill.  I appreciate that section 4 (a) refers to &ldquo;other courses, including post-graduate courses as may seem appropriate to the Governing Body&rdquo;.  I take that point.  There may be benefits in including some reference to continuing education of graduates and others.  It is for that reason that I put down amendment No. 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to subsection (1) (c) (i), the position in relation to the gift of land and other property has been changed.  That is important.  Obviously the institute would act responsibly in this matter.  In the original Bill that was subject to the approval <Col N="334" /> of the Minister.  That has now been changed and is certainly a con-structive move.</P>
    <P>I do not know why, in subsection (2), the Minister has to have the concurrence of the Minister for Finance in order to assign to the institute such additional functions as he thinks fit.  I would imagine that this should be an educational decision.  I do not particularly like that wording.  I am glad that where an order is being made under this that it must come before the Oireachtas.  It takes proper cognizance of the status of this House.  In general I welcome the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's introduction of his amendment. I feel he might have been a trifle more generous to the sentiments expressed in this House on Second Stage when he identified the source or sources of the amended section 4 which is now before us.  I am not against Ministerial amendments, far from it.  As I said in relation to other legislation here not so long ago, I would far prefer this House to act as a legislature rather than as a rubber stamp and if that means the Minister has to bring in amendments, so be it.  I will not be castigating him just because he is bringing in amendments.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of detailed queries which I would like the Minister to address himself to in relation to his amendment. Could the Minister tease out for us the difference between the phrases &ldquo;approval of the Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo;.  Does &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo; mean that the Minister basically says yes or no whereas &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo; means that the Minister can say yes but impose conditions?  In other words, in relation to the functions which are subject to the approval of the Minister, the Minister has no flexibility; he either agrees or disagrees, whereas, in relation to other functions the Minister may agree subject to conditions.  I would be glad to hear if that is the Minister's reading of the wording of his amendment as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> One of my amendments which is being discussed together with this is amendment No. 9.  When I made my speech on Second Stage I attacked, as Deputy Collins did, the pervasive presence of the Minister in the Bill and I suggested that the Higher Education Authority should perhaps be put in instead of the Minister in certain instances. At the same time I recognised that there was a structural problem here in that the Higher Education Authority is not a body which has been set up to permit anybody to do anything.  It is purely an advisory body advising the Minister in relation to the Minister's functions so I accepted that there was a problem here in putting in the Higher Education Authority as a gatekeeper when effectively that is not the role they have been asked to play by statute.  I would in any case have withdrawn that amendment at this stage because of that difficulty.  But in relation to the Minister's amendment the degree to which I would find it satisfactory or not&mdash;and in large measure it mirrors at least one of my other amendments&mdash;would depend on the Minister's explanation of the difference between the approval process and the prescribing of conditions process.  I would be glad if the Minister would address himself to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I will be able to convert Deputy Collins to my view of the legislative process.  As I said at the start I consider all the stages as stages where the House may have its input. I think Deputy Horgan agrees with me basically on that.  As he just said, he has no objection to amendments from the Minister or anybody else being considered. That is what we are doing; we are putting a Bill together which will become an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point that Deputy Collins made on amendment No. 10 was in regard to the courses for the continuing education of graduates.  That is now comprehended in the recast subsection (1) (a).  In fact the term &ldquo;other courses in education&rdquo; would take in post-graduate courses.  The words &ldquo;including post-graduate <Col N="336" /> courses&rdquo; are inserted to eliminate any doubts on the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also referred to subsection (1) (c).  In the recent section subsections (1) (c), (1) (d) and (1) (e) go most of the way to meeting Deputy Horgan's amendment No. 11 and Deputy Collins's amendments Nos. 8, 12 and 14.  I propose to remove the restriction of approval, as has been commented upon, from the acceptance of gifts by the institute and modify the restriction on the performance of other acts in paragraph (d) of the Bill as introduced and (1) (e) of this section.</P>
    <P>In relation to the phrase &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo; Deputy Horgan has asked me to distinguish between them.  In general the format in the recast section is more liberal than in the original one so it is in the business of doing what Deputy Horgan was recommending. Approval means a specific proposal must be submitted on each occasion. It is imposing an onus on the governing body.  That may be approved subject to amendment or modification. The approval means that a Minister can specify in advance in general terms rather than specific terms for the governing body what they may do and they will have freedom to work under that specific approval.  Is that satisfactory?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are really talking here about subsection (4) (e) of the Minister's amendment:</P>
      <P>Subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to do all such acts and things as may be necessary to further the objects and development of the Institute.</P>
      <P>It appears to be the Minister's intention to prescribe in advance to the Institute the kinds of acts and things it may do in order to further the objects and development of the Institute itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of prescription instrument has the Minister in mind?  Does he anticipate simply making a speech at the inaugural session of the new governing <Col N="337" /> body in which he will give the necessary prescription or is he thinking of issuing a statutory instrument?  What precisely does he have in mind when he talks about prescribing conditions?  It seems to me that the prescribing of conditions is some general statement which he is to make <i>in vacuo</i> and within which the institute would have to operate compared with the <i>post hoc</i> validation or non-validation of any proposal made by the institute.  If that is a correct reading perhaps the Minister will tell me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would envisage that the governing body <i>motu proprio</i> would indicate to the HEA and the Department of Education that it wanted to develop in a certain way or a certain area.  The Department of Education in consultation with the HEA would then lay down a kind of general framework for such development.  They would be general parameters rather than having specific proposals coming up in each instance for the Minister to approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The HEA is the funding body for the NIHE, Limerick, and it has the responsibility of seeing that the overall development of NIHE, Limerick, falls into place with its overall plan for third level education. In those circumstances there is logic in saying that it is the HEA that should prescribe the conditions or give the sanctions for courses and so on.  In fact, there is duplication.  Now the NIHE, Limerick, will have to go to the Minister for money and for sanction.  We should avoid that. If we have established the HEA on a statutory basis to do this work, let them do it.  Seeking the prescription of the Minister is somewhat unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would in every instance in regard to any development in third level education consult with the HEA and there is no question of duplication.  As Deputy Horgan stated, the HEA is an advisory authority set up by statute and consequently is not in the field of instructing any particular institution which may be designated to it. <Col N="338" /> There is not any difficulty at all in this regard because the Minister will consult with the HEA and will, as I stated in reply to Deputy Horgan's question, in advance set in general terms the kind of development it thinks suitable for the institute. I am anxious to get the idea across that it is a much more liberal terminology than the original one.  That is the distinction I want to make.  It will leave the governing body much freer than the original terms before the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some truth in what the Minister has stated that this is a more liberal terminology.  We will have the opportunity between now and Report Stage to plumb the depths of its liberality to see whether it meets all the requirements we would like to see it contain. In relation to my amendment, No. 9, which we are discussing with this, it occurs to me that part of the confusion in relation to the Higher Education Authority is one of nomenclature.  It is called the Higher Education Authority but it does not have the authority to do anything.  All it does is to advise the Minister; it is a higher education advisory council effectively.  In the Seanad, when we discussed the Bill dealing with the HEA, part of the discussion was about the degree of authority the new authority would have.  Sometimes, in order only to avoid confusion, it might be better to call institutions or bodies by names which approximate more to their actual functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it there seems to be a good deal in what Deputy Horgan has stated, but in fact the activity of the Higher Education Authority is so comprehensive and efficient that even though it does not have the statutory backing to put things into effect the result of the labours and expertise of the HEA is practically the same as if it had that statutory authority.  In developing a specific school the amount of expertise it gathers and work it puts into it and the fact that it is dealing with the allocation of funds for a specific project means that it is, in effect, a pretty powerful authority.</P>

      <P>The HEA does fund NIHE, Limerick, and to that extent would receive annual submissions from NIHE, Limerick, in respect of expenditure and course planning.  The HEA would sanction those things within the context of an overall budget policy and the functions it was given by this House. The HEA would also go to the Minister in relation to its annual budget and at that point in time the global development of third level education would be discussed between the Minister and the HEA.  That is fair enough and understandable and is the function given to the HEA.  Surely in that context the NIHE, Limerick, should go to the HEA and then the global problems of the latter in relation to the development of third level education would be discussed annually with the Minister rather than having the duplicated system that now arises.  Under that system the Minister will be laying down prescribed conditions in relation to courses and NIHE, Limerick, will have to go to the HEA for money and from there to the Minister. The duplication is unneccessary and unfortunate.</P>

      <P>In page 4 subsection (4), line 18, to delete &ldquo;nine&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment.  It deals with the composition of the governing body and reduces the number the Minister may recommend to the Government for appointment under subsection (4)(a) of section 5, which provides that nine of the members of the governing body shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance <Col N="341" /> with the provisions of subsection (5).  I am proposing to reduce that number to four.  The Minister has power, directly or indirectly through the Government to nominate 14 members of a 23 member governing body.  Therefore, a Minister &mdash;I am not saying the Minister would do it&mdash;could appoint a majority of the governing body of the NIHE, Limerick. That is not proper.</P>
    <P>I have attempted in amendment No. 22 to have a broader spectrum of membership of the council.  Under the Bill the Minister has the right to recommend five to the Government for appointment.  I am suggesting that those five should be appointed directly as follows.  One should be appointed on the recommendation of the governing body of UCC, one from UCG, and the Irish Farmers' Association should have the right to nominate a person for appointment and the Confederation of Irish Industry should have the right to appoint one member.  Finally I suggest that Limerick City Vocational Education Committee should have an input.</P>
    <P>To deal with the last one first, it is important that there should be some formal relationship between the NIHE, Limerick, and the local VEC.  Obviously there is a direct relationship, and the VEC representing the technological sector of second level education should have representation on the governing body of the NIHE, Limerick.  The concept of local participation is important and would help to ensure good relations between local educational authorities.</P>
    <P>I doubt that the Minister can argue against a member from the Irish Farmers' Association and one from the Confederation of Irish Industry.  The institute are directly involved in providing technological courses related to the Irish agricultural and industrial sectors.  There should be some ongoing relationship between UCC, UCD and NIHE, Limerick. For that reason I have suggested there should be one member from each of those university colleges.  I appreciate that setting out the structure for any governing body is not an easy task and <Col N="342" /> rarely can one prescribe the perfect solution. The rights the Minister has in this regard are overbearing and we should ensure that there is a very broad spectrum of representation on this governing body by being more specific in relation to the appointments to the body.  I recommend my formula for the appointments which the Minister can make through the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem we face here is presumably that the NIHE, Limerick, are precisely what their name implies, a national institute.  At the same time, it seems to be reasonable that an institute which will continue to draw, as the NIHE, Limerick undoubtedly draw, the vast bulk of their student population from a certain region should count in their governing body some regional if not local or community representative.</P>
      <P>The Minister has sufficient latitude in the number of free places he gives himself to appoint on the governing body to ensure that such regional interests will be represented.  It might be to his advantage and to the advantage of the institute if he were to cede at least one of those places to a specified local or regional representative in order to secure the maximum possible degree of local and regional acceptance for the institution concerned, which they have to some degree already, and in order to write into the Act the regional or local dimension of the activities of that national institute.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem is that in so far as this will be one national institute, and the NIHE, Dublin will be another national institute, I presume it is precisely in the areas from which the Minister chooses to pick his own nominees on to the governing body that he will be indicating to each institute how their aims, although national, will not conflict with each other.  We do not want any unnecessary degree of duplication between the work of the two National Institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder about the degree to which the Minister would be prepared, between now and the Report Stage, to consider the reasonable points made by Deputy Collins particularly in relation to local <Col N="343" /> and regional representation.  I do not know about the Irish Farmers' Association or the Confederation of Irish Industry having a right as of themselves to ensure effective nomination on to the governing body of the institute.  Perhaps the Minister would consider further the other points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point of the importance of local representation.  There is nothing in the Bill which would preclude them without the necessity of stipulating in the Bill that a person should be from a given region.  Deputy Horgan made the point that it is a national institute and designed as such, but, being in the area of Limerick and achieving a reputation for excellence, it will attract many people from that area.  I agree it is important to maintain the best relations with the local area and I will keep in mind what the Deputies have said about local representation.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the substance of the amendment is not acceptable because it would cut down the number of places available to me to represent commercial interests, fisheries, agriculture and industry, although the Deputy's amendment mentions farming representatives and somebody from the CII.  Taking this amendment with amendment No. 22 in the name of Deputy Collins, suggesting there should be members from UCC, UCG and the City of Limerick VEC, it would mean that 18 of the 25 members of the governing body would come from the educational sector. That is too many because it would leave only a possible seven from the industry, commerce and farming sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed during the passage of the NCEA Bill the importance of the technological sector.  This institute is training sophisticated workers for industry and it is vital that a large proportion of the governing body should be from the business and agricultural sectors. As it is, the terms of the Bill seem to be weighted a little too heavily in favour of the academic sector, 15 to ten, but if I accept the amendment of Deputy Collins the balance would be tipped over completely. <Col N="344" /> I do not find that acceptable because I do not think it would make for the kind of governing body we are looking for.</P>
    <P>In selecting the nine ordinary members whom the Minister will recommend to the Government, the five bodies mentioned by Deputy Collins will be kept in mind; but I would point out that there is a danger that we could have a too heavily weighted academic governing body if we specify existing university colleges.</P>

      <P>I know why the Bill is phrased in the way it is and I know why I put down this amendment, but I do not know if there is any ground in the middle where the Minister and I can meet.  It is plain that the framework of the subsection has been drafted in such a way that it gives the Minister the power and the duty to choose certain persons from certain categories because there is not a national form of organisation for either of the categories of persons involved.  I do not know how the Minister or how any Minister would feel about the emergence of further national organisations representing workers in the educational sector with whom he would have to deal and negotiate about various issues such as appointments like these, but it is arguable that if these appointees are to reflect the real concerns of the grades of staff from which they come there should be some kind of consultative if not elective process from which they might emerge.</P>
      <P>The danger otherwise is that the Minister will lay himself open to the accusation that he is appointing people from these areas less in relation to their academic or other qualifications than their political affiliations.  One of his predecessors, the late Deputy O'Malley, once delivered himself of the famous line that &ldquo;all other things being equal we look after our own&rdquo;, or words to that effect, and I should hate to have the Minister in a situation in which he would be accused unnecessarily of favouritism because of the absence of appropriate machinery and structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am therefore suggesting in the amendment that the governing body effectively should establish elective or consultative mechanism which would be approved by the Minister which would allow the persons whom the Minister would appoint to emerge.  At least to some degree those persons would have the consent and support of the people in their sector of the educational system and would thereby be enabled not necessarily to fulfil totally representative roles but at least to carry more weight at the level of the governing body than if <Col N="346" /> the Minister simply had snatched them out of the air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Horgan.  It is a difficult problem because the Minister will not be dealing with even one trade union nor is there a single body of teachers that can be approached easily.  I appreciate that the Minister is attempting to ensure that there will be representation from the RTC staffs. That is good and constructive, but how it will be achieved is another day's work. Incidentally, &ldquo;colleges&rdquo; in amendment No. 20 should appear with a capital &ldquo;C&rdquo; instead of a small &ldquo;c&rdquo;.  I see the merit in the Minister's point because there might be a difficult or mischievous process before he gets to that sector.</P>

      <P>The section as drafted empowers the Minister to recommend people from the RTCs.  I am glad the Deputies have commended that power. As the Bill is drafted, the Minister may if he chooses decide the procedure by which the choice is to be made, or he may invite the RTCs to recommend some people to him.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to amend section 33 (2), of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, to provide that where a member of a planning authority has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in the zoning, acquisition or disposal of land by the authority the member of the authority shall attend the meeting of the authority and shall disclose the nature of his or her interest and shall then withdraw from the meeting for so long as the matter is being discussed or <Col N="347" /> considered and further calls on the Minister for the Environment to introduce amending legislation to ensure that any member of a planning authority who wishes to make any proposal relating to the zoning of any lands which are the subject of periodic review under draft development plans shall be obliged to give 14 days notice of motion in relation to any such proposed changes.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy B. Desmond.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on this matter yesterday I welcomed the Minister's concluding remarks.  He outlined the present procedures and indicated he would look into the matter further.  He gave a detailed assessment of the situation and he was open to suggestions regarding any improvements that might be made.  The particular Act to which he referred was a very detailed piece of legislation.  The Minister has very considerable experience as a member of a local authority and as a Member of this House and I know he will use this experience to effect any improvements in the legislation that may be necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick when he spoke on the motion sounded plausible but the Minister showed the proposals contained in the motion would lessen the safeguards in relation to matters other than zoning that could affect interest in land.  The Deputy was eloquent in his speech but he was impractical in his approach and the Minister pointed out some anomalies that would weaken the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday to the ease with which an important change can be made in a draft development plan.  As the Minister pointed out, it is only a draft plan and is subject to scrutiny by the public, the press and interested bodies.  Most members of local authorities know of the tedious approach necessary in reviewing and revising development plans.  We are engaged in such a process at the moment in Roscommon County Council.  Before I was elected to the Dáil I worked as an architect; I find the study of development <Col N="348" /> plans interesting but it is time-consuming. All members of a council are subject to representations from chambers of commerce and individuals generally who are interested in plans for their county.  I do not know of any occasion when there was a conflict of interest in my county.</P>
    <P>Elected members of local authorities have an important role in planning.  It is one of the roles left to them and I hope there will be no diminution of their powers in this respect.  It gives them authority and responsibility but with their knowledge of the area they are in a better position to draw up a plan than any Department.  Local councillors are more conscious of the reprecussions of change.  In my own town, Roscommon, we had the example of proposed changes in the county development plan that would not have been acceptable to the people, changes that would affect the amenities available in the area.  Even though the planners and engineers had the best of motives and intentions, they were proposing something that would not be acceptable to the people and the Fianna Fáil members, with all other members of the council, agreed with the chamber of commerce and other interested bodies that changes would be made only to ensure the public interest would be served.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond who is also a member of a local authority made a point with regard to the 1976 Act about doubts expressed at the time by the Taoiseach as to whether planning was a good or bad thing.  In the United Kingdom it is now proposed in the interest of encouraging economic development to set up enterprise zones where there would be relative freedom from planning controls.  This is something the British Government are pursuing to create economic development.  Although planning controls are necessary, in many instances they can delay important economic developments that would be of benefit to an area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was selective in the quotations he used last night.  He did not quote completely what the Taoiseach <Col N="349" /> had to say on the matter.  At column 149 of the Official Report of 14 January 1975 the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>However, we have planning and all we can do when we have a planning apparatus is to try to make sure it is as good and as effective as we can make it ... if we are to have it let us have it as perfect as we can make it.</P>
    <P>That is the proper approach and it is something we support wholeheartedly. The planning apparatus is working quite effectively and the only opportunity for changes will come about in the drafting of the development plans.  These plans are scrutinised by the public and by all interested parties.  Councillors are deeply concerned about the necessity of having good planning and they are aware of their responsibilities in the matter.  I am confident that they are discharging their responsibilities in a proper way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of declaration of interest, it is no harm to remind newly-elected councillors and people with interests in development to complete an up-to-date declaration of their involvements and interests.  As I said last night, as an architect and a public representative I was conscious of the need to ensure that architects be clear on their role and responsibility. Deputy Quinn has put his name to the motion before the House and I am sure he shares this view.  Architects in their professional capacity in the planning area have a special involvement.  I know that the few architects who are involved in local authorities keep their roles separate.  Other officials of local authorities should be conscious of their position and ensure that their declarations of interest are comprehensive and kept up to date and are available for public inspection.  Any member of the public can go to the local authority offices and inspect these declarations.  It is an important aspect of the Act and its inclusion was justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly indicated that he is prepared to consider the amendment of any aspect of the Planning Acts <Col N="350" /> if it would be of benefit to the public in general.  I am confident that he will do so and come up with proposals which will have the full support of this Government.</P>
    <P>I endorse the views expressed that the local authority members are carefully carrying out their responsibilities and, as is known, without any remuneration whatever.  They are a most responsible group of people, dedicated in their approach, who are working extremely hard at present, preparing development plans for the betterment of the public generally.  This whole debate was unnecessary to some extent, but it has been proposed by Deputy Desmond who also is a member of a local authority and well aware of the controls and responsibilities of each local authority.  Local authority members are very conscious of their position and if they are doing the job properly will ensure that the Act is fully complied with and that no difficulties will be created for anyone.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I express my confidence in the Minister of State, Mr. Connolly, who is looking into this whole matter of planning.  He can call on his own personal experience as a member of a local authority, well aware of the responsibilities involved in local authority matters.  He will ensure that any amendment brought forward which is shown to improve the situation and not inhibit the work of the council and the councillors will be put into effect to enable them to carry out their statutory responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have been given the opportunity of speaking in this debate.  I support the amendments. It is important that from time to time we look at legislation to see if it needs changing.  This updating or change should not be done on the basis of panic or fear.  It should be done because we believe it is necessary and in this case it is necessary.  The law is there to protect the members of local authorities and to ensure that they are seen as above reproach.  It is not enough to be right: one must be seen to be right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> We must ask whether, in present circumstances and as presently constituted, local authorities are able to deal with their problems.  In areas of major development, where there are parttime elected public representatives, it is extremely hard for them to attend meetings at all times.  The time has come when we must look at the whole fabric of local authorities to see whether these are operating in the best interests of the communiy.  Can they operate on the basis of their present structure?  These are questions which should be asked. Plugging holes here and there is all right but, at the end of the day, that is not the answer.  In the whole general area of local authorities, because of the complexity and the vast development of growing towns and areas, we must examine the development of local authorities and local government.  The day has gone&mdash;and long since gone&mdash;when we could expect part-time public representatives to do the job which is required.  They do a great job. They are dedicated and conscientiously work long hours without any real remuneration.  Is that enough?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>Taking an area like greater Dublin, there must be a greater Dublin authority drawn from the whole area.  While everybody wants to guard his own particular authority and see that it is the best and does its business in the most efficient way, that is a parochial viewpoint. These authorities are all complementary to one another, particularly in the whole area of planning, housing, water, sewerage and road infrastructure.  In actual fact, Dublin county and the surrounding boroughs are all integrated. There is no great green area between them.</P>
    <P>Given that we have this vast area, we must ask if the present local authority structure is satisfactory?  Will the amendments put forward and accepted suffice? Is that what is wanted?  I honestly do not think it is and I do not think the people who put down the amendments could reasonably insist that it is.  A complete overhaul of the greater Dublin <Col N="352" /> council is required, with fulltime public representation so that on matters like drafting development plans, rezoning, infrastructure and so on are dealt with by full-time public representatives who have time to attend meetings and who are not looking over their shoulders towards their place of employment where they should be and dashing off to it.  It is only when we get this type of broad authority that we can expect the kind of local government which people expect today.  Dublin and its environs have become a vast area.  It is ludicrous for the public and this House to think that parttime public representatives can do the job.  Of course, they cannot.</P>
    <P>These amendments are important, as I said earlier, if for no other reason than to ensure that the public representative is protected and is seen to be protected.  It is easy to cast suspicion on public representatives when the law is such that people must make statements about their commitments as regards what they own and are part of and declare any interest that they may have.  That is fine, but it is not the whole story.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked why members were not in attendance at meetings.  This is simply because one cannot expect unpaid public representatives, who must hold down jobs, to act as fulltime members. We must face this fact.  In the greater Dublin area, it is high time that we took local government seriously for the first time and said &ldquo;Here is a vast area that we can break up into small, autonomous groups with authority in the various areas of cleansing and local planning, environmental works within their areas and that sort of thing.&rdquo;  They can elect their own councils.  We had them 50 and 60 years ago in this city. We had Pembroke, Rathmines and Howth-Clontarf when our population was very much smaller than it is today and people had much more contact. Now we need a great number of these local councils and local community involvement to deal with individual areas and they must send their people to the Greater Dublin local authority who will work fulltime, who will have full-time <Col N="353" /> chairmen of housing committees who will be sole representatives looking after housing development, general purposes, infrastructures, roads and so on.  This must be looked at in a positive way to see that people get the kind of local government to which they are entitled at the present day.</P>
    <P>We are coming into this House plugging a few holes here and there in the system.  While that is all right in the short term, we are not grasping the nettle, we are not taking on the problems.  If we take our local government seriously and give people authority and fulltime status and pay them well, we will have a sense of direction and we will not be coming in here looking for this type of change to be built into their standing orders.  We should look at the standing orders of local authorities throughout the country generally and build into those standing orders all such stipulations and protections and in that way we will have the type of structures that modern society wants.  We see around us today vast growing towns like Tallaght, Clondalkin, Blanchardstown, Ballymun and its environs without any semblance whatever of local government structures.  The people in Balbriggan have the same structure as the people in Tallaght and that on a parttime basis, and they are poles and miles apart.  That is not good enough and it is no wonder that we come in looking to plug a hole here and there.  If we continue as we are we will come in here from time to time wondering what we will do.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Department of the Environment take themselves seriously in this whole area of local government and local involvement, the better.  The sooner they devise schemes in which there will be real and meaningful involvement by the people required, on a fulltime basis on a broad and global area like the greater Dublin area, the better.  What we are getting now right through is dictation from the Department of the Environment. They hand down decisions without any consultation because they are fully aware that local government is becoming puerile and a bit of a joke.  That is very regrettable.  Only this week I attended a <Col N="354" /> meeting of the local authority in which I am involved and I said something about two new sports complexes in which the Government are involved and for which they are handing out some money. The local authority were written to and were told exactly the locations of these two complexes, that they would engage the amount of money, they would run the complexes, pay one-third and supply the site.  I asked if there was any consultation and I was told that there was none whatsoever.</P>
    <P>How can we hope to get any kind of local democracy with this lack of consultation? One may say that this is straying away from what is on the Order Paper.  If we had our house in order and proper devolution of power right across we would not be having the debates that we are having here.  I am raising the point because I am concerned about what is happening.  I ask the Minister to think long and hard on this area of involvement. Let us grasp this nettle.  Both sides of the House have been talking long enough about local democracy, involvement, people coming together, councils, infrastructures and so on. These come up generally at local election time and all have different policies on them, but when local elections pass we drift back wearily into the path of doing nothing and one has to look to see if we have a vested interest in not doing anything.  Maybe we have, but for goodness sake let us reject our vested interests and get on with it.  Let the Department come up to the Minister with a blueprint on the whole area of local democracy and proper structures, and the fears of a large number of people will be allayed.  Where you have fulltime commitment and dedication, then local democracy will be run not by officials but truly by fulltime elected representatives. That is the nub of the matter.</P>
    <P>I come to zoning and rezoning.  There is something wrong with the system when you can draw a line on a map this way or that way and say, &ldquo;That is now development land and tomorrow it will be ten times dearer than it is today&rdquo;.  I do not think that that was ever intended and <Col N="355" /> obviously it must bring tremendous pressure to bear on people when land can rise in price ten- or 15-fold overnight on the basis of moving a line one way or another.  If it moves to my side of the road I can be a millionaire and if it moves to the other side of the road I will remain as I am.  A system which has that built into it is wrong.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem is not easy.  The Americans do not believe in zoning land.  They allow market forces to prevail.  Whether that is a good idea or not is open to question.  This particular system is also open to question.  The sooner a policy on land is adopted the better.  The sooner the Kenny Report is taken off the shelf the better.  That would deal with the whole question of land and rezoning, whether people had interests or not.  I believe the capital gains would not be great and so it would not make much difference.  While you have a system of rezoning from agricultural to commercial or housing development it raises market value dramatically.  That system is not right.  The amendment before us to change the 1976 Act represents a plugging operation.  I support it.  I think it is necessary given the existing circumstances, but these circumstances are not good and we shall have to take some radical steps in this whole area rather than bring in piecemeal amendments to give people time to call a meeting and make certain declarations.</P>
    <P>All this was done and fairly well covered in the 1976 Act.  I fully supported it.  It is important that any public representative should declare his interest. That goes without saying, but the situation where land can command such an astronomical price overnight is wrong. That is where the problem lies, not with the public representative who is doing a parttime job conscientiously and well. He has to hold down his other job.  He has his personal commitments and he has to do a good deal of running and fetching for the people in his area.  The onus is then on him to come up on the draft development plan and make these decisions.  That system is wrong.  If <Col N="356" /> anybody is to blame it is this House because we here are the people who ultimately change the law and make it effective. If we are interested in doing that we must examine the problems.  These problems are in the astronomical cost of land when it is rezoned.  If we had made radical changes we would not be discussing this matter tonight.  It is high time that the Government came off the fence as regards the Kenny Report.  If there is lack of Government will to implement it, fair enough.  If there are constitutional problems, let us hear them; but let us not pussy-foot, because we see what can happen.  I do not believe that is or should be the intention.</P>
    <P>This House has the obligation of changing that system.  We should not put members of local authorities in positions like this.  We are elected to make laws and change them.  We will support any radical and reasonable changes in the area of land reform.  It is wrong that such a vast profit can be made when draft development plans are changed.  That is what puts on the pressure.  I would support zoning when land prices are controlled. When we have them controlled whatever way you draw lines the cost will remain the same.  There will be no vested interest and no pressure on the owner of the land or on anybody because the price will be the agricultural price.  That to me seems to be the only way we can solve this problem.  Let us not delude ourselves into thinking that changing this or that will have any real effect.  I think we know that it will not.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would look at the matter and see what changes could be made.  I am asking him to look at the Kenny Report and implement its recommendations by bringing legislation before the House.  If there are constitutional problems let us put them to the test.  Let us do something rather than hide behind the Constitution.  If the Constitution would stand over a system which allows such dramatic price increases overnight because of a line here or there, I think the Constitution must come into question.  Is the Constitution there to protect the people or to protect <Col N="357" /> property?  If it is to protect the people the whole question of land and the Kenny Report would stand but if the Constitution is to protect property it would not. Then it would be time to examine property rights under the Constitution and make the necessary changes that would protect people and their rights and so give them a right to acquire sites for houses and homes.</P>
    <P>So long as we are prepared to do nothing in this area and with the Kenny Report this will drift and we will have more amendments next time round, but we will not be facing the reality of the problem.  I hope the Minister and the Department will take positive action in restructuring local authorities, particularly in the fast-growing areas, giving them full-time public representative status and will look at the Kenny Report and bring before this House concrete proposals of change.  If that is done we will not be coming back with piecemeal legislation every other year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we should make clear exactly what we are debating.  The motion in the name of Deputy B. Desmond and Deputy Quinn says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to amend Section 33 (2), of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, to provide that where a member of a planning authority has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in the zoning, acquisition or disposal of land by the authority the member of the authority shall attend the meeting of the authority and shall disclose the nature of his or her interest and shall then withdraw from the meeting for so long as the matter is being discussed or considered and further calls on the Minister for the Environment to introduce amending legislation to ensure that any member of a planning authority who wishes to make any proposal relating to the zoning of any lands which are the subject of periodic review under Draft Development <Col N="358" /> Plans shall be obliged to give fourteen days notice of motion in relation to any such proposed changes.</P>
    <P>The terms are very specific.  It is right that I should contribute to this debate because I was the person who piloted the 1976 local government planning and development legislation through this House.  While I enjoyed most of the time I acted as Minister, there were periods during that debate which I did not enjoy. As a matter of fact, one particular thing disgusted me.  Apart from that there was a very substantial element of opposition from the present Government to the proposed legislation.  The result is that the Bill dragged on in this House for an inordinately long period.  There did not seem to be any good reason why.</P>
    <P>Some members of the then Opposition from time to time could be most reasonable and made some very good proposals.  Being a reasonable man, if there was any merit in the proposals I was only too glad to accept them.  Again and again proposals made were accepted, perhaps not exactly in the form in which they were made, but with the co-operation of the Opposition they were put into the final wording of the Bill and became law.</P>
    <P>Why was this Bill so important at that time?  Why was this provision in that Bill so important at that time?  It was as people here know it well&mdash;politicians remember things like this even if others do not&mdash;that there seemed to be a campaign of vilification being carried on in one particular newspaper Sunday after Sunday.  There were long articles attacking and vilifying not a member of the Coalition parties but a member of the then Opposition.  I considered that outrageous. A member of a local authority is doing a job for which he is not paid and he may lose a lot by being a member of a local authority.  To be attacked for doing this is all wrong, unless such a member deliberately leaves himself open to attack.  As Deputy B. Desmond said last night the only thing I thought was wrong at that time was that the person concerned took these attacks a lot quieter than I would have done.  He did <Col N="359" /> not take action against the newspaper. He did not take action to clear his name. I believe that is the way to deal with these people.</P>
    <P>It is said that a politician who goes to court in an effort to clear his name is foolish because the court does not look too kindly on politicians who want to do that kind of thing, even though they might be in the right.  There have been cases where very small amounts for damages were granted, where damages were sought.  At that particular time and before and since we have had innuendoes, comments and snide remarks about members of local authorities or members of different boards who use their position for the purpose of getting rich.</P>
    <P>Let us face facts.  This motion has been brought about because it was alleged recently that somebody who was a member of a local authority allowed his colleagues, if he did not persuade them, to support the rezoning of land which he owned for a relatively short time and which overnight would make him a very rich man.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was going through the House we had various suggestions as to how it could be improved.  In relation to An Bord Pleanála there were suggestions that notice would have to be given and that the member being there, would have to declare his interest and withdraw, but we did not include that type of phraseology when dealing with local authorities with the result that, if we can believe the newspapers, we have had a rather extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>While all the officials of that particular local authority were opposed to the proposal, no advance notice appears to have been given to anybody that the matter would be on the agenda. Therefore, when a decision which enriched one member of the local authority&mdash;it enriched many other people as well&mdash;was carried it caused a certain amount of unease.  The member affected carried out the letter of the law by being absent from the meeting.  He knew this matter was coming up although other members said, according to the <Col N="360" /> newspapers, that they had no way of knowing it was coming up.</P>
    <P>When there is a big issue like this involved, it is important that the member concerned should attend the meeting and say &ldquo;I have an interest in this and I am withdrawing&rdquo; or, as has been suggested here, adequate notice, 14 days, should be given to the chairman so that there could be no question of anybody being able at a later stage to point a finger and say &ldquo;This is a racket.  They are all in it and are making money for themselves&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I have always held that because a person is a member of a local authority that should not debar him by right from whatever he would have got if he was not a member of that local authority.  The idea that simply because a person is a member of a local authority he should automatically be prepared to do with a lot less than anybody else is all too prevalent here and it is wrong.  Having said that, I must make the point that the member, who must have known that there would be a storm about it when it came out, was extremely foolish that he did not do one of two things, publicly declare that he was not attending the meeting because this matter was coming up, or go to the meeting and say that he must leave the meeting because this matter was coming up.  A third alternative, if he felt that way, was to resign from the council.  The big trouble is that we have here a situation which can be pointed at by those who want to abuse people in public life.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by a number of people here, including Deputy Fergus O'Brien who is very well versed in these matters, to the Kenny Report.  I would like to point out that the Kenny Report is not the Bible.  The Kenny Report was not handed down by God.  It was prepared by a man and, being a man, he is of course fallible.  The Kenny Report has many shortcomings and while the Kenny Report was adopted in principle by the previous Government&mdash;and I would ask that the present Government would be prepared to do the same if they have not already done so&mdash;that does not mean that every <Col N="361" /> line and comma in it should be introduced into the legislation of this land. It would be a mistake to do so because, apart from anything else, there are some clear shortcomings in it and, to deviate for a minute, one of the shortcomings is that while it deals with land outside towns and villages and cities it does not deal with the land within the boundaries of the towns and cities and that is where the greatest scandal occurs at present because people are expecting and getting prices to which they would not normally be entitled.  An effort is being made by the Labour Party to try to remedy that situation at present.  Indeed, Deputy Quinn has a very big hand in making that proposal.</P>
    <P>To go back to the motion before the House I understood from the Minister of State that he was saying that the Government were going to look at this. Did that mean that the Government were not going to oppose this motion? That is what I thought he implied but he did not in fact say it.  We should know whether or not the Government are prepared to do something because looking at something in God's own time is a different thing altogether from accepting that the House has agreed, and all sides of the House apparently have agreed, that something should be done to try to ensure that we will not again have a situation where a public representative on any public body can be pilloried because he does not do what he should have done even though the law does not say he must do it.</P>
    <P>House prices at present and for the past couple of years have been going up through the roof.  We are told materials and wages push up prices and very few people want to admit that in many cases the main reason why House prices have gone up is that the price of a site now is many times more than the price of the erection of a house.  That is a bit rediculous and if this is the situation we should make every effort to ensure that that position does not continue.  It becomes tied up with this motion when we find that people in the public service, <Col N="362" /> people who are employed in the public service, people who are members of the local authority are in fact involved in this thing, when it can be said that they deliberately acquired property for the purpose of making a fast buck.  That is the suggestion which has been coming out.  It is wrong that we should leave ourselves open to such suggestions.  It is entirely wrong that any Member of this House or a member of a local authority should put himself in the position where he can be pilloried outside and inside this House on the grounds that he was trying to pull a fast one.  I do not know the Deputy who was involved in this who is a member of Dublin County Council.  I know him to see in the House.  I do know that he was only a short time in the House when he made a very snide remark&mdash;</P>

I have made no charges against any individual nor do I propose to do so.  It is not in my nature. There were people on this side of the House who had no hesitation whatever in making serious changes and getting away with them for a period.  What I am trying to say is that I have nothing whatever against the person concerned.  I am not making any charge except that earlier in this House when he had just become a Member he made a snide remark to the chair about a connection between me and Tara Mines.  In fact he said to ask me about Tara Mines.  I had no connection with Tara Mines and that person did not know anything about me or about Tara Mines but he had no hesitation in making a crack.  I am not going to descend to his level and I am not going to make any crack about him.</P>

We can pretend to ourselves if we like that this is not the reason but this motion is down here because of a particular incident and let us not go away from that fact.  I have already said that I am not suggesting for one minute that because a person is a member of a local authority that he should be asked to accept less than anybody else.  What I am suggesting&mdash;and I am not going to go away from that&mdash;is that the responsibility of somebody in that position is to ensure that he is not put in that position and if he will not do it then the law has got to lay down that he will either go into a council and say that he is involved and that therefore he does not want to be involved in the meeting or, alternatively, he must write to the council a fortnight beforehand saying he does not want to be involved in this because he will be affected by it.  I can see no reason whatever for the suggestion of the Chair that I am making any charges against anybody here because I have not done so and I do not intend to do so and I would suggest that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The plain facts of the case are that we had a county council decision which resulted in the newpaper publicity doing no good to the image of <Col N="366" /> public representatives.  I have always defended local authority representatives because I believe they are the salt of the earth.  I could never understand why people go into public life and do it for nothing, getting more kicks than payment. As Minister for Local Government I defended a prominent member of Fianna Fáil because he was attacked in a worse way than this.  For that reason I insisted that this legislation must go in in the way it did.  There was a lot of opposition from Fianna Fáil to that Bill.  Indeed, it is difficult to understand that opposition. I could not understand why sensible people who at other stages of the debate had been most helpful should in relation to this matter have a blind spot.  They deliberately, or otherwise, attempted to prevent certain things being put into the Bill.  The Taoiseach then Deputy Haughey, moved an amendment to my Bill and during the course of the debate on it he said: &ldquo;I want to have a record available to the Minister or any other interested person of what the exact position is in regard to such a matter. What I want is not alone will he have to disclose where he has an interest ...but that he will also disclose that interest in writing to the chairman.&rdquo;  That was the thinking of the Taoiseach in 1974.  I told him then that I agreed that might be of help to the board and felt it might be better to insert, &ldquo;shall inform the presiding chairman&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion must be accepted by the House.  If the Government refuse to accept it people will hold the view that the Government have not changed their minds since they were in Opposition and still hold the belief that there should be no disclosure of the interests of certain people when it might hurt themselves. That would be a tragedy.  I do not believe any Government would be foolish enough to try to say they were not in favour of protecting the rights and characters of their public representatives. I have more right than any other Member to insist that the character of public representatives be protected in every way possible because in recent times I was most viciously attacked for political reasons by people on the Opposition <Col N="367" /> side.  I dealt with that in my own way and I am perfectly satisfied I cleared my character.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any public representative, councillor or Member of Dáil Éireann, should be in a position when something like this happens of having a finger pointed at him.  There is a school of thought that believes that rezoning should not take place in any circumstances and there is one which believes that everything is sacrosanct even if there is a demand for housing in an area or even if it means that useless land left out of the original zoning is included later.  I do not agree with that.  We must progress with the times.  I do not know the area concerned or why we should have this hullabaloo up to now.  I believe that once the matter has come to public notice that if there is a loophole in the Act there is only one way to deal with it: the Government at the earliest opportunity should amend the existing legislation to ensure that the loophole is plugged.  When the Government looks at this Act they should have a complete review of it.  They have excellent officials who gave advice to me when the Bill was being processed in the House and I am sure they recognise the loophole or weakness in the existing legislation.  If more than one matter needs to be tidied up an effort should be made to do so now.  If it is announced that this review is on the way the public will accept that Members are determined to see that there will not be any loophole for which a public representative can be pilloried. We should be made aware what the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, meant when he stated that the Government were reviewing the matter.  Did he mean that they proposed to accept the motion before the House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is well aware of the background to this motion.  The House regrets the fact that such a motion had to be tabled and I believe the House anticipates that politicians will not vote against it.  What is the background to this motion and why have the Labour Party sought to put it down at this time?  In general terms the <Col N="368" /> background is the ever-increasing price of development land in our urban areas, a price which seems to be beyond control or totally out of control, and a political system that seems incapable or unwilling to attempt to control it.  In that context where the demand for housing at all times totally outstrips supply there is no upper ceiling to the potential price development land is likely to make on the market.</P>
      <P>It is the local authority that decides whether land should fall within the net of development or not and any member of a local authority or anybody connected with it who has an aye or nay in pushing land into the development category is open to the suggestion, allegation or dismissal that there is individual benefit to be had from such an activity.  If this House allows the present situation to continue whereby such an idea or image can be put abroad in the common minds of ordinary people, the entire process of democratic politics will be undermined in general and specifically the participation of public representatives at local level will be seriously undermined.</P>
      <P>I believe all parties are very definitely and deeply committed to the democratic process.  It is something we all share and we all experience similar difficulties in trying to make that process work in a mixed economy in a world where commodity prices and international tensions are frequently fraught with ups and downs which make our open economy highly susceptible to variations in prices with a consequent impact on the living standards of the people we represent. The pressures of trying to make democracy work in 1980 are substantial. We have enough difficulties in terms of the irrationality of the market system from the Ayatollahs of this world without compounding it internally on our part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We desperately need the support and continued assistance of our people to enable working politicians on all sides to try and resolve democratically the problems that confront society at present. The right to shelter and the failure of successive Governments to provide <Col N="369" /> that basic right is one of the problems that has confronted the State since its foundation.  The dramatic increase in the population in the last 15 years has emphasised that problem.  The consequent impact of that population growth on the cost of development land is enormous. The kind of allegation that is put forward&mdash;politicians are only in it for what they can get out of it; politicians are all the same; the only politicians who survive are those who are getting something from somewhere&mdash;is the beginning of the cancer that will eat away at the democratic process if we are not prepared to confront it and remove the grounds on which it has any substance whatever.</P>
    <P>The mover of the 1976 Act, Deputy Tully, was the first to concede that there are loopholes in it which can now be closed.  We are saying in the light of what has happened in recent weeks that such a gap has been identified, not by us but by the gallery of our society.  That gallery is looking at us to see what we are prepared to do as politicians trying to make the democratic system work. We have a very simple choice.  The Government have a very clear choice in accepting the motion.  There are no time limits to our motion or specific wording attached to it.  On that point I should like to refer to the reasonable response that the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, made to the motion.  He drew attention to certain drafting ambiguities that are contained in the motion, if one were to assume that the motion was an amendment in itself to the 1976 Act.  That would be a wrong assumption.  The critical verb is &ldquo;to provide&rdquo;.  We are asking the Government and the person designated with the responsibility within the Government, the Minister of State present, to provide for the terms of our motion and draft those clauses, sections and subsections to amend the Acts of 1963 and 1976.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's response to the debate and the points he raised are legitimate if one were to consider our motion as a specific amendment to the 1976 Act, which it would be wrong to <Col N="370" /> take as such.  It is essential to understand that we are calling on the Minister and the Government to make provision for what we called for in the motion.  We have asked them, in the interest of the democratic system and in the interests of maintaining a public commitment to the continued existence of that system, to provide by way of amendment to the 1976 Act that where a member of a planning authority has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in the zoning, acquisition or disposal of land by the authority, the member of the authority shall attend the meeting of the authority and shall disclose the nature of his or her interest and shall then withdraw from the meeting for so long as the matter is being discussed or considered.  If further calls on the Minister for the Environment to introduce amending legislation to ensure that any member of a planning authority who wishes to make any proposal relating to the zoning of any lands which are the subject of periodic review under draft development plans shall be obliged to give 14 days notice of motion in relation to any such proposed changes.  We are asking the Government to amend legislation initiated during the term of the Coalition Government because we&mdash;and the ex-Minister was here and accepted responsibility&mdash;have identified the loopholes that have surfaced in a way not anticipated at the time.  We are now asking that it be amended in relation to the declaration of pecuniary interest in a specific way.</P>
    <P>Although the term &ldquo;Draft Development Plans&rdquo; is included in the text of our motion&mdash;and the Minister correctly picked it up in his speech as being worthy of some clarification&mdash;let me respond to that by saying that that is the option and reserved function of a local authority member, as the Minister being an ex-local authority member will clearly know and understand, both at the draft development plan stage and at the stage when it comes back in after public exhibition. In both those instances we are looking for two things&mdash;specific declaration of pecuniary or financial interest in relation to any lands involved, specifically conveyed in whatever manner <Col N="371" /> the Minister wants that written into existing legislation.  I am not going to teach the person to say his own prayers; I shall leave that in the capable hands of the Minister and his staff.</P>
    <P>Our second request is for 14 days' notice of the proposal to change zoning. In that context let me turn to the at-tempted intervention of Deputy N. Andrews who unfortunately was out of the House when he could have spoken for five uninterrupted minutes and made his full case without the interruption of either Deputy Tully or the Chair.  Fianna Fáil is not the majority party in Dublin County Council.  That is substantially correct.  The situation to which this motion is in part related, the textual background against which this motion, in part, has been phrased relates to a situation in which a particular local authority, Dublin County Council, over a period of weeks has been reviewing the draft development plan for the most rapidly urbanising area in the entire State.  That review process takes place on Fridays, starting in the morning and going through the afternoon with a break for lunch.  Under present standing orders no notice is given in advance of any intention by any councillor or councils to propose a change in the draft zones as prepared by the technical staff. The membership and attendance of that committee meeting of the county council in question depend very much on the amount of time its members&mdash;who are not paid, full-time politicians like members of this House&mdash;can obtain from either their place of work or business.  Regrettably the practice has been&mdash;because it is an extremely important matter&mdash;that some members have not been able to attend for the entire period.  The pattern appears to have been that a lot of the business was conducted in the morning but in the afternoon attendance was particularly low.  One can only presume that the decision of the minority party on that particular council to move, in consort, a particular amendment after lunch, when attendance was lower than before lunch, when indeed the chairperson of the county council had to <Col N="372" /> undertake another engagement, was purely coincidental, and happened just as the way these things sometimes do. But the fact of the matter is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has fairly and graciously responded to the motion we put down.  He has made valid criticism about its wording.  I hope I have responded to that criticism by the out of the proviso contained in the words &ldquo;to provide&rdquo;.  We will leave the detail to the Minister as to how he wants to stitch these two objectives into the legislation. Reading the last couple of paragraphs of the Minister's speech I see stated that he would look into the matter without delay&mdash;which I welcome and respect. The very last sentence of the Minister's speech read:</P>
      <P>I will look at the matter without delay and if I find that a revision of the provisions referred to is justified I will bring forward draft proposals in due course.</P>

    <P>Taking the English language at its face value it would appear that the Minister is not convinced, as of now, that a revision of the provisions referred to is justified. We would argue that not only has it been shown to be necessary by the public response but that the underlying need for their revision has been validated and signalled quite clearly by the very highly publicised action of the Taoiseach in <Col N="374" /> calling in the Fianna Fáil members, the minority of Fianna Fáil members of Dublin County Council, and asking them specifically to reverse a decision on which they had voted at that meeting in unison after lunch when the attendance was different from that in the morning.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's responsibility to bring in these proposals.  We will allow the Minister every reasonable time in this regard but we would hope that we would see some proposals before the House by the end of this year.  Obviously we cannot expect anything by the end of June; we would not even attempt to suggest that there should be.  At this stage, having regard to the performance of the Minister of State since he assumed office, I am prepared to accept that he will look at the matter without delay.  I believe the actions of the Government in relation to the decision taken by the Taoiseach clearly recognise that the provisions are justified.  On the basis of that we will be looking forward&mdash;and we will provide whatever technical assistance the Minister may feel we can provide&mdash;to drafting adequate proposals to amend the legislation some time in 1980.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>For quite some time up to Monday of last week the corridors have been seething with rumours as to what precisely the Minister for Educa-tion was proposing to do in relation to the free transport scheme for primary and post-primary education.  The recurrent rumour was that the Minister was about to charge for the service, but time and time again the Minister or his Minister of State came into the House and denied that any charge would be made for this service.</P>
      <P>We on these benches accepted this in good faith.  I do not think anybody realised what was about to happen. However, on Monday 12 May, three days after the conclusion of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Education, during which the Minister, by right, should have announced this, his Department issued a statement in relation to school transport of which a copy was sent to me and to the newspapers. This is the first occasion on which the Dáil has had an opportunity to discuss this serious measure, and as I sought permission to raise on the Adjournment the reasons for the changes being made, it is only fair that I should put into the records of the House some of the changes involved and comment on their implications, because it is only by looking at the changes and their implications that we are enabled in any degree to assess them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education circular identifies a number of significant differences for transport to primary schools.  In paragraph (a), it mentions the number of eligible children necessary for the establishment of a school transport service.  The number is being increased from ten to 12.  This means that small townlands, parishes and other small centres in rural areas where there are groups of children of ten or 11 in total will not be given access to free transport to primary schools next year whereas they would have such access this year.  By <Col N="378" /> any standard this must be regarded as a worsening of the service.</P>
    <P>We have no idea about the number of children who will be affected by this step, and the Minister, to judge from a reply he gave to me yesterday, has no idea either, but I can tell the Minister and the House, and particularly the Minister's backbenchers who will have to go around explaining this away next September, that by next September we will not be under any illusion about the number of children who might have been expected to avail of the service if it were available on the terms available this year.</P>
    <P>Under (b) the circular states that a child of more than nine years of age must live at least three miles from the nearest national school in order to be eligible for free transport.  The age limit has been ten years up to now.  The effect of this is not clear, to put it mildly.  I can only assume that it is disadvantageous to children between the ages of nine and ten.  Under (c) the Minister's circular states that children between four and five years of age may not be taken into account for the purpose of establishing a service.  Prior to this they could have been included in the number required to set up a school transport service.  I am asking the Minister a specific question: does this mean that in relation to existing services where children of between four and five years were being carried and were counted in the original total, this service will be discontinued as and from next year unless the other criteria are met, or does it mean that this will be continued? Even if it is continued it puts at a disadvantage all areas in which children of four and five years are needed to bring the new total up to 12 rather than ten children.  We have no clear idea of how many townlands and villages are being excised by the Minister's scalpel, but I have no doubt we will be told by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (d) the Minister notes that new services that may be introduced as from 1 January 1981 will be based on the criteria for such services being established in the first term of the <Col N="379" /> school year 1980-81.  In relation to post-primary education, the free transport scheme is being altered so that the establishment of a school transport service must require 15 children eligible for the service before the school buses are allowed to run.  In order to avail of the service a child must live four miles from the school, and if one wants to be pedantic about it this is an extension of 33? per cent from the present limit of three miles. There are certain other provisions in relation to the fares for children who are accommodated as concessionary fare-paying passengers.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion we can draw from the facts at our disposal is that the changes in the scheme will disadvantage younger children and those who live at a distance from a school where formerly they were entitled to free post-primary transport.  I had a question to the Minister yesterday in the Dáil&mdash;Question No. 227&mdash;and he told me that the school transport regulations to apply in the school year 1980-81 were considered and adopted for the purpose of providing a service suited to the requirements of present circumstances.  He said the motivation was not a saving in financial expenditure through not making the ser-vice available to a particular number of pupils.  That answer is enough to make a cat laugh.  I cannot see anybody looking at the changes in the scheme and coming to such a conclusion.  If the motivation was not a saving in financial expenditure, what was it?  Was it spite?  The Minister could hardly agree to that. Perhaps it was the salvation of the Irish footwear industry as a major beneficiary of the changes being announced by the Minister?  If the motivation is none of these things, what is it?</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that the revision of the scheme that he has announced bears no relation to the financial and economic circumstances of the pupils and the parents who may be disadvantaged by the changes.  Some of the children involved in the scheme may be the children of social welfare recipients.  There are 100,000 in this country who live in <Col N="380" /> families that have social assistance as their only form of income.  Are these children going to be denied the right to free education or even compulsory education at the primary school level because their parents cannot dip into their social welfare money to get them to school?</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Education we made some play of the fact that the allocation for primary school transport was cut by more than £3 million.  When they were making that criticism I do not think anybody realised the extraordinary cavalier nature of the proposals the Minister was about to bring us in this sneaky way, just after the debate on the Estimate for his Department and without affording the House a proper opportunity to comment on them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I urge him in the interests of social justice and equity to think again about what he is doing.  I can tell him that if he does not heed the appeals from this side of the House at this time the appeals from the benches behind him will become more clamorous as the year goes on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that so many people who hardly miss an occasion to remark unfavourably on the annual increase in the expenditure on this service and who ob-serve how much more effectively they feel this money might be used in secondary schools or universities have suddenly become agitated at the prospect of any regulation of the annual rate of increase in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm for me again to place on record the fact that the Labour-Fine Gael Government who went out of office in 1977 saw fit to appoint a study group to investigate the operation of the free school transport scheme.  The terms of reference of the study group included, <i>inter alia</i>, the following: (1) Whether an increased ability to pay on the part of the parents/guardians gives grounds for subsidised rather than free transport and <Col N="381" /> whether, therefore, a charge should be made for any or all categories of pupils at present carried free of charge; (2) Whether other pupils not eligible for free or subsidised transport should be carried at full economic cost if such tended to improve the general economics and the degree of service being provided; (3) Whether in determining entitlement to free or subsidised transport, a more restrictive or more liberal set of criteria than hitherto should be formulated.  It was stated that in this connection the link between the provision of transport and school attendance should be considered to ascertain whether the statutory distances of the School Attendance Act represent a logical criterion of whether children should have school transport.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Horgan and Deputy Fitzpatrick, who was a member of the Government in question, would accept that the terms of reference that Government gave the study group were not purely of an academic kind and certainly envisaged that a look should be taken at the school transport scheme.  I do not think it was envisaged that the consultants should have made a case for the enlargement of the scope of the scheme, to attempt to justify an annual increase in public expenditure on it or even to maintain the real level of support from public funds on it.  I would be interested to hear from Deputy Horgan or Deputy Fitzpatrick whether the exercise was academic or whether it was done with a view to having some effect on the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan said there were rumours that a charge was going to be introduced.  I am sure that it was he or others who gave rise to such rumours.  I should have thought he would have accepted the word of the Minister for Education who denied the rumours, that he would have accepted that Deputy Wilson spoke the truth when he went on radio to deny the charges made by Deputy Collins that he was going to introduce <Col N="382" /> a flat rate for the service. Deputy Horgan has said that there was something wrong, sinister or treacherous about the Minister saying he was not going to introduce a charge.  The Minister spoke the truth at that time. Perhaps Deputy Horgan or Deputy Collins are disappointed the Minister is not introducing the flat rate as was envisaged by the Government who requested consultants to look at this matter with a view to introducing the charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of holding sittings of the Circuit Court in Dún Laoghaire has been examined at various times in the past and the view has always been taken that the proposal has little to commend it.  As regards criminal business there are practical reasons why this should continue to be heard in Dublin.  As regards civil business I would remind the Deputy that, even if there were Circuit Court sittings in Dún Laoghaire, the parties, or their legal advisers, in such cases would have the option of selecting Dublin rather than Dún Laoghaire as the trial venue.  Because most solicitors have their offices in Dublin, and as members of the Bar would not be as readily available in Dún Laoghaire as they are in Dublin, this is an option that would be widely exercised.</P>
      <P>However, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, in its Twelfth Interim Report has recommended that the jurisdictions of the District and Circuit Courts be substantially increased.  Such an increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court in Dún Laoghaire would, of course, have the effect of transferring to Dún Laoghaire a considerable amount of business now dealt with in the Dublin Circuit Court.  As I indicated in reply to Question No. 12 of 27 March last I hope to bring legislation based on the committee's recommendations before the House reasonably soon.</P>

      <P>The original certificate of reasonable value at a price of £17,750 issued on 29 December 1978&mdash;not August 1979&mdash;and the price of £19,500 for other houses of the same type was approved by a CRV issued on 18 April 1980.  I am satisfied that both these prices were reasonable by reference to the criteria established for the determination of applications and having regard to the dates of construction of the houses.</P>
      <P>The April 1980 price showed an increase of 9.9 per cent over that of December 1978 whereas the house building cost index showed that the cost of labour and materials between January and July 1979, the respective average dates of completion, went up by 14 per cent.
