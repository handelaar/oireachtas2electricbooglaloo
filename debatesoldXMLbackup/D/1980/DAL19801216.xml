      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the findings of the latest opinion poll which indicate that a majority of the people in the Republic would support the dropping of the constitutional prohibition on divorce; and if the Government are prepared to review their policy on this matter in view of this strong indication of public opinion.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available.  With regard to the numbers unemployed there is no local employment office in the town of Kilcock. Total figures for the numbers of persons on the live register residing in different counties and in towns with legally defined boundaries are complied on a quarterly basis, but since the town of Kilcock has no legally defined boundary, information on this basis is not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he and the Central Bank have taken any steps to secure the co-operation of other European Ministers for Finance, Central Banks and commercial banks to improve the readiness of foreign banks to exchange other EEC currencies for Irish currency notes and to quote exchange rates for Irish currency in the same manner as exchange rates are quoted and exhibited for other EEC currencies including the pound sterling which is not within the European Monetary System; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline the steps taken by the Central Bank to notify to other European banks and commerce in general, details, including the appearance, of Irish currency notes; the number of such notifications to date issued in respect of the new series of Irish currency notes; and if steps will be taken to improve the circulation of information having regard to the lack of familiarity which many foreign financial institutions have with Irish currency and the consequent difficulty experienced by persons seeking to exchange Irish currency notes abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply <Col N="1154" /> to questions on this subject on Thursday, 30 October 1980.  In addition, the Central Bank have informed me that on the introduction between 1976 and 1980 of the new £1, £5, £10 and £20 legal tender notes, colour photographs or actual specimens of each note, as appropriate, together with information sheets containing full details of note design specifications were forwarded to all central banks throughout the world, bankers associations within the EEC, Interpol, commercial banks located at major airports throughout the EEC and also the Interchange Bulletin &mdash; an agency which circulates comercial banks and exchange bureaux worldwide with colour photographs and background details of new note issues.</P>
    <P>As a result of approaches by the Central Bank within the past year, the Irish pound is now officially quoted on the foreign exchange markets in Austria, Spain and Portugal.  I am informed that the Irish pound is already quoted on the foreign exchange markets of the other EEC states.</P>
    <P>As indicated in my reply to the earlier questions on 30 October last, the difficulties that arise in EEC and other countries in relation to the exchange of our currency tend to arise at commercial locations, such as banks and shops.  Their attitude to a foreign currency will be governed by commercial considerations and they cannot be legally compelled to exchange or accept in payment currency other than their own.  I am satisfied that my Department and the Central Bank are taking all reasonable steps to make <Col N="1155" /> our currency better known abroad but, as I have already said in the House, there are definite limits to what can be achieved by official action.</P>
    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if having regard to the considerable bother often caused to persons in respect of comparatively small currency transactions by reason of the requirements of the Central Bank in relation to foreign currency transactions, measures will soon be introduced to relax the requirements in respect of small and infrequent transactions; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The administrative arrangements arising from exchange controls on transactions involving foreign currency are kept to the minimum necessary consistent with the effectiveness of the controls.  A number of relaxations were introduced in the existing system of controls when the controls were extended to transactions with the United Kingdom in December 1978.  These include the removal of exchange control formalities in respect of most transactions not exceeding £100 and also in respect of travel facilities within generous limits. For larger amounts the banks in many cases have delegated authority from the Central Bank to grant permissions.  The possibility of further relaxations is being kept in mind by the Central Bank and my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>Paragraph 8 of the second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development states:</P>
      <P>The Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment as constituted under the 1979 National Understanding will monitor progress towards the achievement of the commitment on employment. The Committee will meet regularly and will be supplied by the Government with regular reports on progress.</P>
      <P>The Committee will also:</P>
      <P>(a)  assess the effectiveness of existing mechanisms for anticipating redundancies and recommend improvements where appropriate;</P>
      <P>(b)  consider and make recommendations on any anticipated developments which might significantly affect employment and unemployment levels; and</P>
      <P>(c)  in monitoring employment developments, identify measures for improving the relevant data.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Bruton</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline the terms on which the special foreign loans being dispensed through the ACC and the associated banks have been borrowed; the rate of interest and other conditions which farmers have to meet who borrow from the loans; the rate of commission being obtained by the credit institutions dispensing the loans; the method whereby the rate of commission was determined; if money is being set aside to provide an insurance fund for the Government against the eventuality of the exchange risk guarantee being called <Col N="1166" /> upon; if so, how the amount of money being set aside was determined; the use to be made of such money in the meantime and in the event that it is not called upon to cover the exchange risk; how much of the loan funds obtained have so far been taken up by farmers; and the use being made of the money which has not yet been allocated to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The institutions concerned borrow at variable interest rates which are refixed periodically.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest to the borrower is also variable and is refixed periodically; currently it is 12½ per cent to 13¾ per cent. A farmer must be working to a farm plan, or have one drawn up in consultation with his agricultural adviser or consultant, to be eligible to apply and his loan application must be for a purpose for which the scheme was established.</P>
      <P>The operating margin of the ACC and the Associated banks in respect of the schemes is 2½ per cent and 2 per cent respectively.  These margins were determined by reference to the special circumstances of the schemes and are intended to cover operating expenses, provision for bad debts and so on.  They are lower than the institutions' usual lending margins.</P>
      <P>The interest rate charged to the borrower includes a contribution towards possible exchanges losses and by residual loss will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The amount of the contribution has been determined by reference to the currencies being borrowed, subject to providing farmers with loans at favourable interest rates.  These contributions are credited in special interest bearing accounts with the institutions concerned and may be used in the meantime for their general purposes.  Any balance remaining in the special accounts on termination of the schemes will be paid to the Exchequer in consideration of its having borne the residual exchange risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the ACC, funds onlent as at 28 November 1980 amounted to £19.7 million and a further £5.5 million has been committed.  Funds not yet allocated to borrowers are invested by the ACC in financial assets.  The associated <Col N="1167" /> banks commenced operating the scheme towards the end of October and the total amount onlent by them to date is £9.5 million.  As they are borrowing only to meet demand under the scheme they do not hold balances awaiting allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of the commitments made for and the payments received by Ireland since accession to the European Communities are shown in a tabular statement, which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement shows the commitments and the receipts for each of the main funds where a distinction is made between commitments and payments, that is, the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the FEOGA Guidance Section. Receipts under the FEOGA Guarantee Section, which account for the bulk of our receipts from the Community, are <Col N="1175" /> not shown because these are paid monthly in advance.  The EMS related interest subsidies are not shown either, since we have taken up in full in 1979 and 1980 the annual amount of £45 million earmarked for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The figures show that the conversion of commitments into receipts, after a slow start in the early years, has improved quite significantly in 1980.  In the case of the Regional Fund the receipts show an increase from £25.5 million in 1979 to £45.5 million in 1980, in the case of the Social Fund from £28.8 million in 1979 to £46.2 million in 1980 and in the case of the FEOGA Guidance Section from £26.4 million in 1979 to £35 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>The improvement in receipts is attributable both to the accelerated payments procedures adopted for the Social and Regional Funds in 1978 and 1979, which are now becoming progressively more effective, and to a revision in the method of application to the Regional Fund agreed by the Commission in February last at the Government's instigation.  A revision of the procedure for payments under the FEOGA Guidance Section has also been in effect since March last.  This <Col N="1176" /> allows for 100 per cent payment of the Guidance Section grant during the year following the incurring of national expenditure on the measures in question rather than 75 per cent under the previous provisions, and should lead to a further speeding up of payments in the future.</P>
    <P>It must be appreciated of course that it is inherent in the system whereby commitments are made at the commencement of multi-annual projects and payments are phased over the life of these projects that a certain amount of commitments will be outstanding at any particular time.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned to ensure that there are no avoidable delays in converting the outstanding commitments into payments, either at national level in submitting payment claims or in the processing of those claims in the Commission.  I am confident that with the accelerated payment procedures already referred to becoming increasingly more effective, the considerable improvement in regard to payments during 1980 will be maintained and strengthened further in 1981.</P>

      <P>I have not seen the Minister's figures but is it correct that the total sum outstanding to Ireland amounts to £124 million broken down as follows: £43 million from the Social Fund, £40 million from the Regional Fund and £41 million from the FEOGA Guidance Section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount could be of that order, but I want the Deputy and the House to be reassured from what I have just said that this could be a reflection of two factors.  The first is the level of our advances from each of these funds, which obviously would determine the outstanding funds at any one time.  What is important is the level of commitment which, as outlined in my reply, has improved very considerably because of action that we have taken and in respect of which we have got agreement from the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, in view of the state of our national finances, a situation in which there is £124 million outstanding deserves more than passing comment?  Therefore, despite any thing the Minister has had to say about progress today, will he assure the House that every effort will be made to have this money paid to us from Brussels?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy also that a further sum of £37 million is expected to be approved for us from, I think, the Social Fund in 1980 and that in addition further receipts of about £16 million are expected.  This is a measure of the effect of the procedures which the Government introduced.  I can assure the Deputy that the level of commitment to the Irish Government is about the second highest in the Community.</P>

The external reserves are at an adequate level for this purpose.  As at end November 1980 the reserves amounted to £1,165 million, an increase of £190 million since the end of last year.

It was clear at the time that appointment was made that the country was facing a very grave crisis brought about by the way in which the economy had been managed by Fianna Fáil in the preceding two and a half years.  It was vital that the country should have a Minister for Finance who would have a clear run ahead of him until whenever the next election might take place and would have the opportunity to tackle those problems effectively.  To have appointed Deputy O'Kennedy despite his impending appointment as Commissioner, which we have all been aware of for the whole of that year, was something which is indefensible and it has resulted in a failure to tackle the economic and financial problems of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no doubt other contributory factors.  The Taoiseach's own problems in making up his mind and taking decisions on crucial issues has been perhaps the central factor.  But had there been a Minister for Finance who knew he was there until the election and whose future depended upon that general election, rather than one who knew that he had an easy let out at the end of the year, then even the unwillingness of the Taoiseach to take decisions might not have inhibited <Col N="1261" /> the Government from tackling some of the problems which they have failed to tackle.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in retrospect that appointment appears as an unfortunate one.  We can see part of the results of it in the expenditure over-run of £273 million in the Supplementary Estimates, almost all of it current expenditure, though it is not easy to distinguish one from the other because of the way in which these accounts are produced.  This is an excess in expenditure which amounts to almost twice the amount of additional tax revenue raised in the budget.  In other words, in retrospect taxes would need to have been increased by twice the actual amount to maintain the projected current deficit of £353 million, or 4 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The Minister's lack of concern about the public finance is reflected in his knowledge that his tenure was limited. We can see this in the cavalier way in which he said in the budget speech that, in the event of the £100 million provision for pay and pensions having to be increased, he was determined not to have a recurrence of the previous year's experience whereby such excess expenditure added to borrowing.  In the Question Time that immediately preceded this debate he tried to get out of that by suggesting that the lower balance of payments deficit justifies his doing so.  The economic logic of that would defeat even a first year economics student.  Certainly if he put down such a reply to a question on that subject he would not get a pass from any economics lecturer from any university in Ireland.  The Minister did not do himself any good by attempting that explanation, particularly in view of the reasons for the fall in the external deficit which reflects a 7 per cent drop in exports and the selling of our breeding stock for the year to come.  The Taoiseach's action in making such a short-term appointment has contributed to the present chaos in our public finances.</P>
    <P>The new Minister, whom we must congratulate on being appointed but also comiserate with in view of what he is taking over &mdash; and he is a courageous man to take it on &mdash; is faced with an even <Col N="1262" /> more short-term task than his predecessor. The situation in which over a period of a year to two years we will have had three Ministers for Finance at a time of the greatest economic crisis we have faced in 50 years is obviously unsatisfactory and damaging to the interests of the country.  In fairness, the Minister who took over office when the Taoiseach himself was appointed to his post should have been given a longer run at the job, an opportunity to tackle the whole task of putting our finances straight over the whole period up to the election.  The new Minister now being appointed should equally have been given a longer run at his very short-term job of presenting perhaps &mdash; that remains to be seen &mdash; a budget to this House in some weeks' time.  To ask him to take over this process in mid-stream, if indeed the process is being carried on at all at this stage, does seem very unfair.</P>
    <P>Knowing the complexity of the task and having seen a Minister for Finance struggling with less acute problems under less unfavourable conditions than the present, I must say that to expect someone to take this over in mid-stream, to assimilate all the preparatory work that should have gone on up to this point and to actually produce a budget with the full command of all the data required for that purpose is asking a lot of anyone.  If it is intended to produce a budget in the early part of next year then the Minister should have been given a greater opportunity to prepare and the outgoing Minister should have offered his resignation at an earlier date to enable that to have been done.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that it does not matter who is the Minister when no decisions of consequence are being taken, but it is this very failure to take decisions which is at the core of our problems.  We have drifted through 1980 without any of the necessary economic decisions being taken under Deputy O'Kennedy as Minister and I cannot say we have any confidence that the change in Minister will halt this drift.  There is every sign that it will continue until there is an election and we have a new Government.  It is the prospect of continuing drift and the damage being done to the country's economy, <Col N="1263" /> finances, credit and creditability abroad which makes it clear that a general election is desirable at as early a date as possible.  We naturally hope and believe that we would succed in such an election, but whoever succeds it is vital that this country has a Government with a mandate to govern for a long enough period to tackle the problems which have now been allowed to accumulate in the last year and which were created during the past two and a half years.</P>
    <P>I fear the new Minister may be as shadowy as his predecessor and we cannot but fear that under the Taoiseach's direction he will produce as irresponsible a budget as this year's, one in which the estimates of expenditure bore so little relationship to the obvious outturn, a budget which was dishonest in its failure to provide adequately for expenditure needs.  Perhaps it will be otherwise; it remains to be seen.  Nothing in the history of this Government under other leaders suggests that facing into a general election they will be willing to take the kind of action necessary to put our finances in order.</P>
    <P>I will ask in due course that an issue which arose during Question Time and caused some confusion be clarified because, contrary to what we understood from the Taoiseach to be the case on a number of occasions and in his original allocation of functions, we were told that economic planning was the function of the Department of Finance and not of the Taoiseach's Department, despite the Taoiseach having told us something rather differently when he made the original changes and despite the transfer of the economic planning staff to the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy Nolan well in his new appointment.  He is a popular Member of this House and someone whom all of us are glad to see being rewarded by promotion to the Cabinet.  He has been given a difficult task, one which has been carried out with less than total success by his predecessor.  I do not wish to be unduly critical of an individual because Governments act with collective responsibility and no individual is entirely free to carry on his Department in the way he wishes <Col N="1264" /> because of the constraint of Cabinet responsibility.  Deputy Nolan's predecessor was not very successful in maintaining industrial peace during his first two and a half years in office and during the past year he has done so at immense cost to the nation in the settlement of claims on terms and in a manner which have stimulated a new bout of inflation at a time when there was some prospect that inflation might be brought not to but towards single figures.  In those circumstances Deputy Nolan has a difficult task.  He has inherited a runaway inflation situation as far as pay claims in the public sector are concerned and he will not find it easy to cope.  He will have our good wishes and co-operation in tackling the problems he has inherited and it is important in the interests of the nation that we should extend this co-operation.</P>
    <P>He will be aware that we have twice offered the co-operation of this party in legislation in the industrial relations field on an agreed basis without any response from the other side of the House.  We ourselves have published proposals for legislative reform in this area which evoked very little public dissent from any side and considerable commendation from some of those in this area.  Deputy Nolan will be aware that we offered then and more recently our support for such legislation along the lines set out in our policy statement and that there has been no response to that offer.  He will be aware that the Taoiseach, upon his election to that office, promised such legislation but withdrew the promise by omitting it from his first radio and television address to the nation.  The Deputy is taking over a ministry in very difficult conditions with an indecisive Taoiseach whose indecision is particularly marked in this area and in a situation where the policies pursued by the first Fianna Fáil administration under Deputy Lynch of trying to control public service pay within reasonable limits has been abandoned. Deputy Nolan is the person who will have to carry the can.  He would be less than human if, on being offered membership of the Cabinet, he did not take it despite the fact that it has these intimidating features and he may well feel that he may <Col N="1265" /> not hold this position for very long before a general election, so there will be little time for him to get into difficulties due to problems he is inheriting.  Perhaps that is the case.  In any event, we wish him well in his new position and we can only hope that the new Minister for Finance who has also taken on a difficult task will, for a change, bring in an honest budget which will honestly assess revenue and expenditure prospects and take the first steps to putting this country back on the course towards economic growth, from which it has been driven by the incompetence and mismanagement of the Fianna Fáil Government elected in 1977 and the indecision of the Fianna Fáil Government which came to power a year ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party I extend to Deputy Fitzgerald and his family our congratulations on his appointment as Minister for Finance and Minister for the Public Service.  I also convey to Deputy Tom Nolan and his family our congratulations on his appointment as a new member of the Government and to the Labour portfolio.  I extend to Deputy Michael O'Kennedy the best wishes of our party on his appointment as Commissioner Designate.  I have served with the Minister in this House since 1969 and also served with him on a number of outside bodies.  We wish him well in his endeavours in the national interest abroad and on behalf of our interests at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must express disquiet in relation to a number of aspects.  First, there is the decision of the Taoiseach once again to put the Department of the Public Service into the political merry-go-round.  It was part of the Department of Finance and then became a separate Department.  It was hived off to the Department of Labour and now goes back again to the Department of Finance.  One might ask when this gyration is to stop.  It has been the long-held view of my party and of the general public service trade union sector and various individuals and bodies concerned with the influence of the public sector that the Department of Labour was the entirely appropriate alignment for the public services sector, bearing in <Col N="1266" /> mind its intensity of involvement in national income policy negotiations on a directly related basis and that there are 300,000 employees in the public sector whose industrial relations problems are more effectively handled by the Department of Labour.  We have argued this time and time again.  At long last, in the last allocation of portfolios, the Department of Labour and the Department of Public Services were put together.  Now, apparently, the Taoiseach, in his own allembracing presidential style &mdash; to that extent one wonders if the appointments are of any relevance &mdash; has once again decided to adopt an entirely different policy.</P>
    <P>Looking at the appointments, I have some sympathy for the men directly involved because in the past 12 months, as Deputy Garret FitzGerald rightly pointed out, we have had three different Ministers for Finance, each one, with respect to the men concerned, more confused than the last as to what precisely was the brief of the Minister for Finance in relation to Government policy.  Having started out in November/December 1979 with a determination to confine public expenditure to a 10 per cent increase, by the middle of July 1980 the whole plan had been totally jettisoned.  In the past fortnight we have put through both Houses of the Oireachtas Supplementary Estimates totalling £464 million.  If that is policy, frankly I am baffled.  In that sense one must sympathise with the men concerned because the Taoiseach has decided that the show will be exclusively his, that the responsibility is his, and that appointments will be his.  We see the outcome of that today.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not endorse the decision to bring the Department of the Public Service back under the Department of Finance.  It will have short and long term repercussions.  I do not envy Minister Gene Fitzgerald in the onerous, direct responsibility which has been imposed on him.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to conclude on a cynical note.  Very often appointments are more related to constituencies than to individuals. When one considers the constituencies concerned, despite my congratulations <Col N="1267" /> to the Ministers I can be excused for having a mild degree of jaundiced cynicism in that regard.  We extend our congratulations to the Ministers concerned. We reserve our position as the outlines of policy they are designed to follow and we reserve our decision in that regard for the adjournment debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy G. FitzGerald and Deputy Desmond in congratulating the men involved in the new appointments announced today.  I also congratulate Deputy Michael O'Kennedy on his appointment as Commissioner in Europe.  I hope he will have a very happy four years over there.</P>
      <P>For the last 12 months there has been an air of unreality about the Department of Finance.  Anyone who remembers the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Jack Lynch, when Deputy Jack Lynch asked if he would appoint Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, must have felt that Deputy O'Kennedy was a long time Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith, Deputy Nolan and Deputy Fitzgerald are all decent, honourable men.  I believe none of them is under any illusion as to why he was appointed.  Deputy Smith will know his promotion is not unrelated &mdash; although he is more entitled on merit alone to be appointed, given the calibre of some of the people who were appointed &mdash; to the fact that there is a vacancy in his constituency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nolan will not be under any illusions either.  Perhaps we have a better view from this side of the House of calibre and ability and Deputy Nolan is someone we would have picked out for promotion long before now.  I am very glad to see him being promoted.  However, I am afraid he will discount the promotion when he looks at one of his colleagues in his own constituency and recognises the bearing that has on his promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat inhibited by Deputy Fitzgerald's geographical location and my personal affection for him.  Deputy Fitzgerald has a tremendous amount of ability.  For the last four years he was left an unholy mess to clear up in industrial <Col N="1268" /> relations, a mess largely created by his Cabinet colleagues and the manifesto under which they were elected in June 1977.  I believe his transfer from one Department to another is because one side of industry particularly feels he has lost the grip of industrial relations and that he has been moved because of that. I find it difficult to say that, because he has tremendous ability.  The complexity of drawing, drafting and presenting a budget and keeping that budget on the rails during 12 months require qualities which I hope are present in his makeup. The damage that has been done over the last four years, particularly in the last 12 months, to the economy by the actions of the present Government requires a Minister for Finance at the helm who has nerves of steel and a determination and will to do what is correct.</P>
    <P>Despite the denials of the outgoing Minister O'Kennedy about the growth rate and our position in the economic stakes of Europe, every independent commentator who has spoken about the Irish economy in recent months has expressed concern at the direction at which the balance of payments, the external borrowings, the level of unemployment, the rate of inflation &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I will not continue.  Deputy Fitzgerald is taking on a portfolio when internal and external independent commentators point to the fact that our economy could be in very serious trouble during 1981 unless a Minister or a Government with determination, courage and the knowledge of what to do takes a grip on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley, who was the first Minister for Finance, was a victim of his spendthrift colleagues and of the manifesto which elected the Government in 1977.  Nobody is more guilty in that regard than the present Taoiseach when, as Minister for Health, he over-spent continually his budget in his three years as Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said one of the aims <Col N="1269" /> of the new Government was to restore credibility to the financial affairs of the country.  That was quickly abandoned.  A budget was drawn up and presented to the House which, in my opinion, did more damage than any budget in the past 20 years as is evident by the rate of inflation this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to say that the portfolio being assumed by Deputy Fitzgerald is a demanding and difficult one.  The first thing he has to do is to ensure that he runs his own Department and that the Taoiseach does not, as he did with Deputy O'Kennedy, dictate what is to be done, and by whom, in that Department.</P>
      <P>Again I would like to congratulate the three men who have been promoted, if that is the right word for what happened to Deputy Fitzgerald.  He is still a member of the Cabinet but it is assumed Finance is a more senior position than Labour.  I hope they will have a happy but extremely short sojourn in their new appointments.</P>

      <P>I would like to join briefly with other Deputies in first extending personal congratulations to those Members who have been rewarded with promotion. The work they have put into representation in this House is recognised by this side of the House.  I want to mention specifically Deputy Michael Smith, whom I have known since 1977 and whose name was inadvertently omitted by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing a motion by the Taoiseach.  The political crux of this motion is that we are seeing yet again, not at the Taoiseach's personal expense but at the expense of the Irish people, the personal pay-off for the Taoiseach's occupation of the seat he now holds.  It would be nice to think that the Taoiseach could nominate jobs for the 115,000 people who are currently unemployed with the same facility that this House will give <Col N="1270" /> the nod to the successful promotion of Deputy Nolan.  Alas, that is not the case. The Taoiseach in moving this motion to appoint someone to a job which will have an index-linked pension &mdash; and I am in order speaking on this motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is being asked to give consent for a person, at the behest of the Taoiseach, to take on a job that is far from easy.  This side of the House has never claimed government is easy.  I want to lay two charges to the mover of this motion.  The first is that he gave full support to the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the second and more serious charge is that he went along with the pretence of believing it for two-and-a-half years.  The mess the current participant will have to deal with in the Department of Finance will not be made any easier.</P>
      <P>They are the nuts and bolts of what we are being asked to do.  Nobody knows how long the present incumbent will have in the Department of Finance but the one thing we can be sure of is that it will not be of any benefit to the 115,000 people who do not get promotion today and who will not have the good wishes that go from this side of the House to the three members who are being promoted.</P>
      <P>This House and the public at large expected more than what happened over the last year &mdash; the turn around, backtracking and so on, and this motion, which will undoubtedly get the support of the House, is further evidence of that backtracking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my good wishes to those which have already been expressed to the three Deputies whose positions are about to be changed <Col N="1271" /> this afternoon.  I do not know Deputy Smith very well but I wish him success and happiness in his job.  I know Deputy Nolan a little better and have always found him a pleasant and agreeable colleague, although on the opposite side, and I wish him well too.</P>
      <P>I also wish well Deputy Fitzgerald about whom I have somewhat stronger feelings.  I remember his conduct when he was in opposition and I can say now that this is a big day for him.  In turn, I hope he will be big enough to endure patiently the few things I may say about him which will not be very severe.  He will not deny, perhaps he even takes pride in the fact that he was the noisiest and most obstructive member on the Opposition benches.  He roared and bellowed so loudly when the National Coalition were in power that he could be heard &mdash; and I believe frequently was heard &mdash; out on the street.</P>
      <P>I never noticed in his attacks on the Coalition Government any special subtlety or any special grip on what government was all about, least of all on what the financial direction of government was all about.  He seemed to be happy to have a crude figure, like the unemployment figure, add 60,000 and then beat us over the head with it.  That was his style of debate.  I hope he will not be hurt when I say that nothing has happened since then which has led me to form a better opinion of the grasp he has of the country's affairs.</P>
      <P>He clearly has a grip on the affections of his constituents, to judge from his enormous vote on which I congratulated him after the last election, but his performance in this House does not lead me to be much impressed with this appointment, which is not just to any old Ministry but which is the nearest thing we have to a super Ministry.  It is the Ministry on which all others depend.  It is the Ministry from which all others have to get permission before they get a box of paper clips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald is a convivial and nice man personally.  When I got to know him better my feelings about his Dáil performance subsided.  I accept he has very good personal qualities and for that <Col N="1272" /> reason I wish him the best, but I cannot pretend to be impressed by his appointment. I do not want to hurt his feelings, although I am sure he is tough enough to withstand a few words from me, but he is not the best man on the Fianna Fáil benches for this job.  He may be the best man for some purposes which have not been disclosed to the House or which the House has not had an opportunity of debating; it may be that the elements that went into the decision to appoint him are valid for some people and for some reasons, but I think there are at least three Fianna Fáil Deputies who would have been better suited because they have a better grasp of the economy, of large amounts of money, what they mean, how hard it is to collect them and how carefully they must be spent.  I hope he will not be offended by that because I would not take it as an insult if somebody said the same &mdash; as they might have only too much ground to do &mdash; about me in making a disadvantageous comparison with some of my colleagues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley should not have been moved from the portfolio he held and he should be put back there.  Failing him, Deputy O'Malley should have received this post.  Deputy O'Malley is no charmer and I had many a hard word with him and I do not suppose we have heard the last of them.  Both Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley &mdash; despite the fact that they have the black mark of taking the benefit of a dishonest manifesto and of successive Government statements and policies which only made matters worse, and naturally must share in the collective responsibility for these &mdash; seem to be men who are more inclined than many men in their party to put the country first.  I do not say that that is an entirely unmixed sentiment because unfortunately as we have seen here only too often in lobby votes with the party opposite the party tends to come first and everything else tends to come last even if the devil is breathing down the back of its neck.  It did seem to me over the years &mdash; though I do not especially admire either of them &mdash; that Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley have this quality, have a certain willingness to take unpopular decisions, <Col N="1273" /> to put up with hard words and severe criticism and to withstand the wind in their faces.  I do not think Deputy Fitzgerald has this to the same degree.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that at serious moments on the industrial relations scene he has tended over the last three years to lie low and say nothing.  I remember the two months during which the country agonised over Ferenka when Deputy Fitzgerald was to be seen opening bull fights in Sligo, cutting the tape in Dunmore East, things like that.  But as a factor in the developing Ferenka situation &mdash; I have said it to him before so he will not mind my saying it to him now in the hour of his triumph or promotion &mdash; he simply did not exist or, if he did, the activity of himself and his Department was kept well below the parapet; it could not be seen so it could not be criticised except for its low visibility.  In general I must say that over the three years in which he has held the office of Minister for Labour, augmented in the last year by responsibility for the public service, the performance has been fairly poor.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations have always been a sore point in this economy.  When I first started taking an interest in such things, when Deputy Costello and subsequently Deputy Lemass was Taoiseach, it was always being said that we needed to straighten out the industrial relations scene.  That has become particularly evident in recent years and become more evident with every passing year as the public service tends to get more and more dragged into &mdash;</P>

      <P>It is only fair to say that we would not be doing our job here today unless we said, in all friendship and goodwill towards Deputy Fitzgerald, that he has shirked and ducked any radical acts on the industrial relations front over the last three years.  The front is a disaster area and he must know that better than anybody.  I could not believe my ears when I turned on the early morning news on, I think, a Monday morning about a speech he had made on a Sunday which got very little press coverage in which he was appealing to employers to do something about industrial relations.  On my oath the Minister for Labour was appealing to employers to do something about it.  That is what he is there for.  I do not say that employers have not got a role but he is the man who is principally responsible for this and, so far as he is the Minister for the Public Service, he is the employer for industrial relations purposes. I have to say that his record there is not a very impressive one, not impresive at all.  In so far as the Minister for Labour plays a part in achieving national wage agreements and national understandings which are useful to the economy it may be that the thing would have been worse only for Deputy Fitzgerald; that may be so because I have not a high opinion of Deputy O'Kennedy either. But I do recall the days when the people in charge on the Government side on this issue were Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Leary, when they sweated bricks and blood and produced, in those days, national wage agreements in the black times of 1976 and 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, Deputy Fitzgerald already is a member of the Government and the statement which inaugurated this debate expressly referred to him as being the person to whom the Department of Finance was being assigned.  I think I am the first Deputy who has spoken here today who has been pulled up on this point.</P>
      <P>Moreover in the area of public service reform &mdash; I acknowledge that Deputy Fitzgerald has not been in charge of that for very long, for little less than a year &mdash; I should like to remind the House that there was no subject to which the Government, so far as it spoke through Deputy Jack Lynch, attached more importance in July 1977 than this.  In the Official Report of 5 July 1977 Deputy Jack Lynch had this to say:</P>
      <P>I consider public service reform to be of fundamental importance for the effective discharge and implementation of the programmes of the national renewal and development upon which we are now embarking.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Fitzgerald gets over his understandable elation at his new appointment I should like him to take a serious look at himself and the Department over which he presided until now, whose function he is now bringing back with him to finance, and ask himself what has been done about public service reform over the last three and a half years.  We have asked questions about it from these benches occasionally when we have been met with a cataract of waffle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> One was stunned and stupified by the load of stuff about interdepartmental committees, ongoing reviews, escalating reappraisals and so on.  But when the smoke is all cleared away the net result is that there are just 7,000 or 8,000 more people in the non-industrial Civil Service, and nothing else that I can see.  I cannot see that anything is being done to ensure that the State gets better value for the public sector employment, that its work is better organised, that any effective redistribution of a kind that makes useful sense has taken place.</P>
    <P>These are all areas in which between them Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy O'Kennedy have had the prime responsibility over the last three years.  I must say that to find one being replaced by the other at the helm of the economy awakens in me &mdash; I do not want to bring levity into this &mdash; no very serious sensation of respect, particularly when there exist on the other benches people who, whatever party differences there may be, are more accustomed to and I believe have the will to handle large issues of a financial and economic kind than is Deputy Fitzgerald. It is not being offensive to him to say that; they are much more accustomed to doing so.  Nobody doubts their patriotic commitment, flavoured I am afraid, diluted, perhaps polluted, by a large element of mindless party loyalty.  Nobody doubts their ability whatever relations one may have had with them personally. It is right to temper one's congratulations and good wishes by saying these things and I hope Deputy Fitzgerald will forgive me for saying them.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which led to Deputy Fitzgerald's assignment to this Department are of an unprecedented kind.  No Minister for Finance was ever appointed in this country since the State was founded on a caretaker basis.  It is only because that happened that we are debating Deputy Fitzgerald's reassignment here today.  There never was such a thing before and the very idea that it would cross a Government's mind, or its leader's mind, to make such an appointment only shows the depth of the wreckless arrogance which possesses them. This country, by all the economic indicators <Col N="1277" />&mdash; even the ones to which Deputy O'Kennedy was obliged to confess to today, simpering as he handed out the answers &mdash; is in a recession far more serious, far more directly attributable to the Government's own acts than it was in the middle of the seventies, and it is at that time that the Government chose to acquiesce, and the party acquiesce, in a stop-gap appointment, a conacre Minister, on the 11 months system.  That is a disgrace.  I should like to know what would have been said if Deputy Liam Cosgrave had appointed Mr. Dick Burke as Minister for Finance at the end of 1975, in the depths of that recession, knowing full well that he would send him to Brussels at the end of 1976.  What would have been said about him had he done that?</P>

      <P>I know what would have been said because I can remember the kind of criticisms which came from the Fianna Fáil Party in those days.  If there were so much as a flaw in the printing of the Order Paper, if Deputy Lynch did not get the report of the bagpipes commission with his breakfast, there was a row about it here on the Order of Business. We were watched like hawks by the media and everybody else to see how we were doing the business &mdash; was it orderly or was it a shambles?  So far as it was less than orderly, it was as a result of the constraints which the small majority imposed on us, as I was never tired explaining.  Had Deputy Cosgrave done what I am talking about, and appointed on a stopgap basis somebody to the Department of Finance, whom he knew would be going in 11 or 12 month' time, the roof would have fallen in on us.  Of course he was not a showman.  He had not spent 20 years assiduously slapping backs and buttering up people whose opinions are important at junkets like that.  He did not do any of those things and so, of course, he did not enjoy the same immunity from critics &mdash;</P>

      <P>We are debating the nomination of a member of the Government. Normally this gives rise to a bloodletting debate.  It has now become the ritual.  Looking back on the debates over the past 30 or 40 years, one cannot but be struck by the degree of bitterness and personal abuse hurled across the floor at new appointees.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to indulge in any personal abuse, nor would I be allowed to do so.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Nolan, well in his new appointment. However, we must focus on the appointment of the new Minister for Finance.  As has been graphically described by Deputy Kelly, Deputy O'Kennedy was appointed, it would seem knowingly, on the basis that he would be leaving that Department within 12 months.  When one considers that the Department of Finance is the cockpit of economic activity in any democracy, one cannot but be disappointed at the attitude that prevails in relation to the kind of person to be appointed, and the duration of that person's appointment.</P>
      <P>The new Minister for Finance has had experience in the Cabinet.  When he was on this side of the House he had all the answers to all the problems which confronted us from 1973 to 1977.  He was most vociferous in his condemnation of the then Government but he was short of concrete, positive proposals to relieve the problems which existed then.  He was appointed Minister for Labour in 1977 and, predictably, that vociferous characteristic diminished to a degree where, in times of industrial stress, one was tempted to send out an SOS to find out where he was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I saw a report in the national <Col N="1279" /> media of a statement made by him, which accompanied the most recent unemployment figures, to the effect that he was quite happy with the level of unemployment because it showed an improvement, and showed the impact of the measures taken to relieve the situation.  This type of cynical approach to a very serious matter is unbecoming to the Minister for Labour, and that kind of attitude will ill-become him as Minister for Finance.  In the past two days I saw a report of a statement attributed to Deputy Fitzgerald in relation to youth unemployment. While I appreciate that sections of speeches are taken out of context because of the need for brevity in reporting the statement was to the effect that something should be done to relieve the intolerable level of unemployment amongst our youth.  He is a member of the Cabinet and it was his responsibility for the past 3½ years to do something about that problem. Nothing has been done.  While we hope the new Minister will be a success, we cannot but doubt that in the light of his performance as Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a section in the Department of Finance to deal with economic planning and development. This followed the abolition of the Department of Economic Planning and Development a year ago.  We expect our Minister for Finance to look after our finances, and he is also responsible for forward planning and economic development. This is a major role.  On the record of the new appointee, one cannot but look with doubt on the ability and creativity of the new incumbent to produce the kind of ideas with the kind of enthusiasm necessary to put our economy back on its feet.</P>
    <P>An idea is widely held that, since the new Taoiseach took over a year ago, it does not much matter who is in the Department of Finance, that he calls the tune and decides personally what the approach is to be and what views are to be expressed on economic policy.  Rightly or wrongly that view is widely held.  I suppose in bad times that is a bad thing, and in good times it is a good thing.  At the moment I do not see how any one <Col N="1280" /> man can hope to pull this country out of the mess we now find ourselves in if he has his finger in every pie.  I would agree that the Taoiseach, taking his rightful place in the Government, must have ultimate responsibility with other members of the Government.  The buck stops with him.  That does not mean that he has 14 puppets on a string who must do what they are told by him.  There is such a thing as democracy as well as collective responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are debating this appointment and the new appointee simply because the Taoiseach cannot afford to give people of wider experience in Government the kind of latitude they would have if they had the confidence of their leader.  My colleague, Deputy Kelly, mentioned the names of Deputies Colley and O'Malley in this context and also Deputy O'Donoghue whose ministry was abolished. These are people who have wideranging experience of economic matters but the Taoiseach was constrained in his choice because he thinks he cannot depend on the loyalty of these people. This is unfortunate.  The country is the victim of the suspicion which is implanted in the Taoiseach's mind.  Perhaps it is here for good reason.  I am not a prophet and cannot give a verdict on how deep the divisions are on the other side of the House but divisions there are and we are the victims of these suspicions, rumours of disloyalty, lack of trust and so on which exist.  They should not exist if we are to look to a team to pull us out of the depths of the recession we are now in.</P>
    <P>That is the unfortunate aspect of this appointment.  I wish Deputy Fitzgerald, for the sake of the country, every success in the Department of Finance but I raise the question of whether he is the right appointee and of the motivation behind his appointment.</P>

      <P>Clare will be very pleased that Deputy O'Kennedy is going to Brussels. He will maintain the very high standards established there by Commissioner Burke and President Hillery.  I hope he will have a successful period because much depends on the success a commissioner has.  The channelling of finance to the country will determine in some measure whether or not disadvantaged areas will get proper recognition in years ahead.  I ask the Commissioner to remember the areas that have not been so successful in getting funds and as far as the regional fund is concerned, on which we all depend, he should use his influence with the other commissioners to channel money into those areas.</P>
      <P>It is the privilege of the front bench to criticise and I am sure all the people concerned got their fair share of criticism. Deputy Fitzgerald has taken his share of it very silently.  He has been criticised for his stentorian voice but he cannot be blamed for that.  Looking to his GAA background he acquired this pitch and GAA yell from the playing fields where he was very popular.  I hope the Minister will keep an eye on the west coast of Munster.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Borrowing is at an alltime record and national and international experts have told the Government to bring the borrowing to a stop.  The balance of trade would be out of hand altogether if it were not for the sale of our national cow herd. Above all, agriculture is in a state of depression and confidence is at its worst ever level.  Therefore, it will be agreed readily that a superhuman effort by the best talent available to the Taoiseach will be needed to make an impression on the state of the country.</P>
      <P>I have nothing personal against any of the four Members involved, Deputies O'Kennedy, Fitzgerald, Nolan and Smith, all decent men who have been in this House for some time and who have not done anything but their best for their constituents and their country.  That is not the issue.  The only issue is whether this poor country is getting the best men for the job.  Look at the Department of Finance.  In three years we have had three Ministers for Finance.  Deputy Colley was appointed after the general election.  He is the man who introduced the notorious two per cent levy that drove the rural and urban communities apart and into street marches.  It created a state of affairs that was bad for the country and that has penetrated to the marrow in the bones &mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am not debating policy.  So bad, apparently, did Deputy Colley prove as holder of that office that his colleagues by a small majority decided they had to get rid of him.  He was followed by the EEC Commissioner-elect, Deputy O'Kennedy.  I do not think I am being offensive to him as the outgoing Minister for Finance when I say under his stewardship in that Department this year some of the most extraordinary U-turns became necessary.  The budget was introduced with a resource tax, another dreadful tax that could not be justified.  It was hardly in operation when it was decided to drop it.  In the same year farmers were screwed by the abolition of relief of agricultural rates.</P>
      <P>So unwise and foolish did that prove that before the end of the year the second moiety of rates was returned to those affected.  The outgoing Minister for Finance must also take responsibility for the uncertainty of the financial policies operated by him.  He is now going to Brussels and I wish him well &mdash; that is the worst I wish him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is being succeeded in the Department of Finance by the present Minister for Labour and the Public Service, Deputy Fitzgerald.  Again, I do not wish to be personal but we must ask ourselves seriously whether he is the best man available to the Taoiseach for that job.  I think that in all humility Deputy Fitzgerald would not answer that question in the affirmative.  We have had three and a half years of appalling industrial relations. One has only to ask the people affected by strikes in the ESB, in CIE, those put out of business in tourism by the strike in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, whether they are satisfied with the way <Col N="1285" /> the Department of Labour has been operated last year, the year before and the year before.  Now Deputy Fitzgerald is being asked to take over the most onerous and the most important Department in the Cabinet.  It is not nice to have to remind the House that only as recently as a little over a year ago when the Taoiseach was appointed, speculation was rife as to who would be promoted, who would be held and who would be sacked.  It is not an overstatement to say that there was no Minister in the then Cabinet so much in hot water, so much in danger of losing his job, than the present Minister for Labour and the Public Service.  One has only to read the newspapers to see what the commentators had to say at the time.</P>
    <P>Now, in the last 12 months, we have heard that industrial relations have improved.  I wonder have they?  I think that if one discounted the appalling six month's strike in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs last year then this year is a very bad year for industrial relations. Notwithstanding the fact that when he was appointed the Taoiseach said that two things needed to be done, namely, industrial relations needed to be put on a much better footing and finances needed to be stabilised and put in a healthy condition, neither of these two things has been done.  Can anybody say that industrial relations this year have improved when we have had unofficial strike after unofficial strike in the public service and can only end such strikes as occur by paying the maximum asked for by way of a cosmetic job for the next general election?  Can anybody say that finances are in a healthy state?  Everybody in the country knows that finances are in a horrible state and yet we have the Taoiseach putting the outgoing Minister for Labour and the Public Service in to clear up that mess while he is in fact leaving a mess where he is.</P>
    <P>Some people say that the Minister for Finance will only be a rubber stamp and that the Taoiseach will be the Minister for Finance anyway.  I do not know whether that is right or wrong but if it is right it means the country is not getting the service it should get; it means the <Col N="1286" /> country is not getting the undivided attention of the Taoiseach in his capacity as Taoiseach and the undivided attention of the Department of Finance and of the best possible occupant for that position. I say that in the strongest terms that I can command.  We are not getting the best talent available even from within Fianna Fáil because they are suffering from internal ills which demand that the Taoiseach tread warily, that he elevate this one and demote that one.  That is not fair to the country.  It is not good for the country.  That is not the way to get the country out of the appalling mess into which it has been dragged by Fianna Fáil with its majority of 20 since the last election.</P>
    <P>I have known Deputy Tom Nolan since both of us went into the Seanad at about the same time in 1961.  Like the other people I have nothing to say against him. I have never found him anything but a perfect gentleman.  But I wonder has he the experience of Government; has he the experience of the Cabinet room to take on the difficult, sensitive task that he has been given and to make the best possible job of it in the interests of the people here.  Time will tell.  I do not know.  He has certainly had one year's experience as a junior Minister.  Now he is being put into this extremely difficult, sensitive job, the success or failure of which means so much to us.  One hates to say these things but one has to say them. One sees extraneous considerations and ulterior motives and future general election thinking permeating this appointment. Is this the sort of thing that this country, in its present terrible state, has to suffer from this Government?  It is not good enough.  Maybe Deputy Nolan is the best.  Maybe he will prove to be the best.  But I think at best the Taoiseach is taking a chance that lack of experience in this sensitive job will militate against him, will prevent him from giving to the country the best service.  Maybe it is only a coincidence that Deputy Nolan is being promoted.  But people could be pardoned if they thought that the real thinking of the Taoiseach is that it is in his interests to build up Deputy Nolan because, in building up Deputy Nolan, he will be <Col N="1287" /> crushing Deputy Gibbons.  People could be pardoned for thinking that but we must have straight thinking when straight thinking is called for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith is another very nice man who is well suited for a junior ministry which is all that is involved here.  I suppose the fact that there is a by-election pending in his area, if it is ever held, has affected the Taoiseach somewhat in this appointment.  But again, as I said in the beginning, I have nothing against these men as individuals.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I think that, due to the extraneous considerations within Fianna Fáil and due to the fact that the Taoiseach finds himself in party difficulties and, in some sense, Cabinet difficulties, this country is not getting the best and anything short of the best at any time, but certainly at this particular time, is not good enough.</P>

      <P>It is time to avail of the opportunity to wish Deputy Fitzgerald every success as Minister for Finance, to wish Deputy Nolan success in the Department of Labour and to wish Deputy Smith success in his new appointment. There is nothing personal in what I am going to say because, although I have known Deputy Nolan and Deputy Fitzgerald a little better than I know Deputy Smith, I have never found him to be aggressive or unfriendly or inattentive or anything other than one of the group of the old school tie in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But that is not what it is about.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I cannot but come to the conclusion that it is not important what talent there is in the Fianna Fáil Party because that is not one of the Taoiseach's considerations. I do not believe that any party could allow a person as talented as Deputy O'Donoghue to remain on the back benches.  Whether or not it is unpleasant to say this in the <Col N="1288" /> presence of the Taoiseach.  Deputy O'Donoghue has one of the brightest brains in this House.  Admittedly he was unlucky and his economic calculations were wrong when he was in charge of the Department of Economic Planning and Development and no one said so more strongly than I on the question of the EMS.  That should not forever condemn a man to limbo and the back benches.  If the Taoiseach is acting in the best interests of the people, I am surprised that he should allow this man to remain there.  I do not intend any disrespect to Deputy Fitzgerald, Deputy Nolan or Deputy Smith in putting this view on record.</P>
    <P>It is not without significance that the Taoiseach has promoted Deputy Fitzgerald to the Department of Finance, but what are his qualifications?  Without any disrespect to Deputy Fitzgerald, I have not noticed anything dramatic or historic or any major breakthrough &mdash; terms which have been much used during the past few days &mdash; in the Department of Labour since he took office.  The only thing I have noticed is that more people are unemployed and there are fewer job opportunities for young people.  I wonder whether the Department of Labour is just as important as the Department of Fisheries in Switzerland.  It would seem to have the same purpose as a Department of Fisheries in Switzerland or Luxembourg and a successful Minister would need the same qualifications.</P>
    <P>It is not without significance that Deputy Fitzgerald's former boss in private life was one of the key workers and probably one of the financiers during the by-election in Donegal and perhaps it is another case of plastic surgery or &ldquo;Let Willie shift it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I hope that Deputy Fitzgerald will be more successful in the Department of Finance than he has been in the Department of Labour.  In fairness it must be said that the Department of Labour is not the easiest place to make headway during a recession.  While the <Col N="1289" /> difficulties are acknowledged, I should like to see a man of proven ability, drive and initiative taking office as Minister for Finance.  It is no longer a case of the Taoiseach being chairman; it is the Taoiseach being president and having president's men.  If Deputy Fitzgerald is successful the Taoiseach will take the credit and if he is unsuccessful he will be chopped.</P>
      <P>I wish Deputy Nolan well in the Department of Labour but people will be excused for thinking that he has been promoted to put another dagger in the back of Deputy Gibbons.  I was no great admirer of Deputy Gibbons as Minister for Agriculture, although he was as successful as most in that office and more successful than many.  Nobody in this House could say that he has a very pleasant personality and I have not spoken to him three times in my life, but he gave fairly good service to a Fianna Fáil Cabinet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons for Deputy Nolan's promotion is that it is another dagger in the back of Deputy Gibbons. Deputy Nolan has been a Member of the House since 1965 and I have not noticed any great dynamism on his part or seen him excel in any major way.  I suppose his turn has come and he may have been <Col N="1290" /> overlooked on previous occasions.  For that reason I am prepared to be less critical of his appointment than I might be. There is an argument for the promotion of a person who has served his time in the House and fulfilled his obligations to his party and constituents and who has been a legislator of reasonable dimensions.  I accept that a man who has served his time in the House may be more entitled to consideration than someone who has been here only a short time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith's promotion to the junior post is another attempt to buy votes in Tipperary.  No one has played the political cards as slickly as the Taoiseach, but in the words of Abraham Lincoln &ldquo;You can fool some of the people all of the time and you can fool all of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time&rdquo;.  I am wondering when Deputy Charles J. Haughey's bubble will burst.  All the appointments to the Cabinet when he took office and all the changes made since have one pattern, that is, they all involve people on the gravy train; it is all a big pay-off.  That is the name of the game. Consideration as to who would be the best man for a particular portfolio is of secondary importance and perhaps my rating of it is somewhat higher than the Taoiseach's.  The pattern of events since Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach has this thread running through it.  There is an emphasis on public relations &mdash; make the people believe that what you are doing is right and you can fool some of them all of the time; and keep it up for long enough and all will be fooled for some of the time, but the bubble is bound to burst.  I wonder what the collapse will be like when that happens.  In the past 12 months no one, no matter how generous one would like to be in public comment, could say that conditions are better economically or, indeed, politically in the State.  Yet, for some peculiar reason the Taoiseach seems to be on the crest of the wave.  How true is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not really important whom the Taoiseach promotes.  The Taoiseach should not consult the people of Tipperary in the new year as he consulted the people of Donegal a while ago.  He has <Col N="1291" /> received a lot of credit for winning the by-election.  A close analysis of the figures show that is far from the truth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would be in the interests of the Taoiseach, of Deputy Fitzgerald, now promoted Minister for Finance, of Deputy Nolan, as Minister for Labour, and Deputy Smith, who has been brought into the junior Cabinet, and in the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party and of this House, but more importantly in the interests of the people of this State, if the Taoiseach declared that we will have a general election at the earliest possible date.  No one in this House wants to fight a general election, but it is of paramount importance that whoever is governing should hold the confidence of the people who elect Members.  It is very questionable whether or not the Taoiseach has that confidence, in spite of the professional public relations campaign which he has conducted.  I have nothing personal against the three men who were promoted. I hope they will be successful in their new posts and if the present Government are re-elected, may that continue, but let democracy not alone be done but be seen to be done.</P>

      <P>I will give the Taoiseach whatever time he wishes.  The motion before the House is the approval of Deputy Nolan for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government. On the 18 November I inquired in the House when the Taoiseach intended to make a formal announcement as to who was to be Ireland's Commissioner in the EEC.  On that occasion I was told he intended to make an announcement in due course.  I pursued the matter because I felt that Deputy O'Kennedy would be appointed.  That was in November and I felt that whatever Cabinet changes were going to be made should have been made at that time so that whoever took over the Department of Finance, or whatever vacancy occurred, would have an opportunity of going into the Department and being there for a number of weeks to familiarise themselves with the economic situation.  The announcement should have been made at that time, but was not made until the 1st of December.  The vacancy is being filled in the Department of Finance today.  Next week is Christmas week, and to all intents and purposes there will be very little work in Government Departments because of civil servants going on leave.  A new Minister of Finance is taking over the week before Christmas.  I do not think that is sufficient time for him to take over and prepare a budget and to have it before the House in whatever week it is in January.  The Taoiseach should have made his decision three or four weeks ago.  I do not know what circumstances prevented him from doing so, whether they were political or otherwise.  The appointments should have been made earlier.</P>

      <P>As Fine Gael spokesman on Labour, it is incumbent on me to say a few words about these new appointments. I wish Deputy Fitzgerald every success in his new appointment.  It is a tragedy that the past three-and-a-half years were among the worst in our industrial history.  It would be totally unfair to blame Deputy Fitzgerald for that because I believe he was constrained by the then Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He now brings to the Department of Finance some experience in the industrial relations field.</P>
      <P>I want to voice one serious criticism of these appointments.  The Taoiseach has returned to the situation where the Minister for Finance is also the Minister for the Public Service.  That is a terrible mistake. One of the good things Deputy Haughey did when he became Taoiseach was to separate those two Departments. He should reflect on this new move because it is very important for the eventual achievement of industrial peace that those two Departments should be separated.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that one aspect of these appointments has not been adverted to, and that is the importance of the appointment of a Commissioner in Europe.  Anybody who closely observes the situation as it is developing in the Community would acknowledge that the new Commissioner who will take office in January will have a very important part to play in the way the Community will develop.  At present the Community is going through fundamental changes in outlook, in attitudes and in approach to policies.  I want to make the point that, from our point of view as a nation, it is of crucial importance that our representative in the Commission be somebody of very great ability and considerable experience.  In selecting Deputy O'Kennedy to be our Commissioner I had that very much in mind.  In my view, the House has not paid sufficient attention to that aspect of the appointments. It is of great significance and importance to us as a country, to our farmers particularly, to business people and employees, that we have in Europe a Commissioner of first-class calibre.  Deputy O'Kennedy has had considerable experience of Government and his term as Minister for Foreign Affairs will stand him in very good stead in this very difficult and onerous appointment he is undertaking.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that in the circles where it matters &mdash; among employers, employers' organisations and trade unions &mdash; Deputy Fitzgerald has built up for himself a very wide degree of conficence and support during his term as Minister for Labour and Minister for the Public Service.  The fact that he will continue in the Department of the Public Service is of considerable importance and an aspect of these appointments to which sufficient attention has not been devoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond suggested there was an unfortunate element of change so far as the Department of the Public Service <Col N="1297" /> are concerned.

I believe the whole atmosphere in the industrial relations area is a great deal better because of his labours and dedication.</P>

      <P>That makes my point even stronger.  However, I think Deputy Tom Nolan has all the qualities to handle this sensitive, troublesome and difficult portfolio.  In fact, Deputies who know a little about his career know that on many occasions he has performed very competently in the field of industrial relations and has succeeded in contributing to the settlement of a number of very serious industrial relations problems.  I feel quite confident that he will acquit himself competently, adequately and successfully in this appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make two very quick points before I conclude.  Deputies opposite have been commenting on the manner in which I have marshalled the forces of my party here in regard to the front bench and the second bench.  I want to assure them that if I was over on that side of the House there are an awful lot of people on that front bench who would not last five minutes and they can be very glad that I am not leading that party at <Col N="1298" /> present.  If they want to talk about not availing of all the talent that is available, for heaven's sake, they should just take a sneaky look over their shoulders at their backbenchers and compare them with some of the ornaments on their front bench.  We will leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,687,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for retired pay, pensions, compensation, allowances and gratuities payable under sundry statutes to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces and certain other Military Organisations, etc., and for sundry contributions and expenses in connection therewith; for certain extra-statutory children's allowances and for sundry grants.</P>
      <P>The main Estimate for Army Pensions for the year ending 31 December 1980 is for a net sum of £20,751,000.  This Supplementary Estimate is for a net additional sum of £2,687,000.  The gross supplementary comprises £3,013,000 reduced to £2,687,000 by savings of £133,000 coupled with an increase of £193,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Provision amounting to £756,000 towards the cost of increases in pensions was included in the main Estimate; the additional sum now sought is required to meet the cost of the actual increases and certain new expenditure arising from the operation of the Army Pensions Act, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of subhead B &mdash; Wound and Disability Pensions and Gratuities, etc. &mdash; the increase sought arises from pay increases which were granted after the Estimate was framed and which are now reflected in disability pensions.  The existing amount in subhead C in respect of allowances and gratuities for dependants is not now adequate to cover the grant under the 1980 Army Pensions Act of an annual allowance which was introduced for the widows of special allowance holders and the grant of increased pensions <Col N="1300" /> and allowances, retrospective to March 1975, for widows and children of soldiers killed in the course of duty.</P>
    <P>The new allowance for the widows of special allowance holders has been advertised and now that the first influx of applications has been dealt with, the Department's records are being searched to try to identify any other widows who may be eligible.  If Deputies are aware of the widow of any special allowance holder who has not applied for the new allowance perhaps they would let my Department know whereupon the necessary steps will be taken.  All current cases which come to notice are followed up as a matter of course; the initiative is taken by my Department by communicating with the widow of the deceased special allowance holder.</P>
    <P>Most of the extra provision in this Supplementary Estimate is required under subhead E &mdash; Defence Forces Pensions Schémes &mdash; arising from increases in pensions and gratuities retrospective to mid-1979. These increases derive mainly from certain revisions of pay scales going back to June 1979 as well as direct increases in pensions and gratuities.</P>
    <P>Subhead K relates to special gratuities and lump sums payable in the case of men killed or injured while serving with a United Nations force.  As the House is aware, there have unfortunately been a number of tragic deaths in Lebanon this year.  The sum now required is in respect of the lump sums and gratuities payable to the next-of-kin of five soldiers who died this year in the service of the United Nations.  The annual allowances are included under subhead C.</P>
    <P>Subhead L provides for grants in respect of free travel, electricity, television licence, and so on, for veterans of the War of Independence.  The increase of £118,000 here is due to the extension of the free electricity and television schemes to widows of veterans, as provided for in the 1980 budget, and to increased charges for electricity, travel and telephones.</P>
    <P>As regards savings, the main item is for £100,000 for funeral grants in subhead M.  In addition, there is an increase of £193,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid. <Col N="1301" /> Taken together, the effect of these is, as I said at the outset, to reduce the current requirement by £326,000 to a net sum of £2,687,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of wishing the Minister well, this being the first occasion on which he has introduced an Estimate for this Department.  I hope he will enjoy his ministry.  In the past few hours we have been debating a change of Ministers in a very important Department, that of Finance.  It is not a good thing to have had such a rapid change of Ministers in that Department in the past year because there are enormous problems to be tackled.  I make those comments in passing while conveying my best wishes to the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could give us some breakdown of the figure of £2,687,000.  I have been endeavouring to highlight the number of people who left the Defence Forces after their initial term had expired.  If my information is correct it would appear that a sizeable amount of that £2,687,000 is payable by way of gratuities to people who leave as soon as their initial term has expired. This would open up a very wide discussion on pay, conditions and accommodation which I cannot go into now.  I would be grateful if the Minister would say what amount is payable in relation to gratuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with subhead K. &mdash; Special Compensation &mdash; United Nations Force.  This is the most important part of the Supplementary Estimate.  It provides a sum of £65,000. I should like the Minister, if possible, to break down this compensation.  I take it, it is a once off situation.  Is this the total contribution being made to the dependants of the five soldiers who lost their lives in such a noble cause in the Lebanon? Can he inform the House whether any other compensation is being paid for illness or injury?  If this is the sum total of the compensation &mdash; and I am open to correction - for the relatives of those five soldiers who lost their lives, it is a miserable pittance.  How does it compare with compensation in the case of a person who lost his life in a civilian occupation?  People <Col N="1302" /> who were doing such a noble job and doing it so well, lost their lives in a noble cause.  They left widows and children, and I know one widow who has three children.  Will the £65,000 be distributed between these widows and dependants? If so, it is miserable contribution.  The Minister should examine this matter again and see if something worthwhile can be done.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing the tragedies in the Lebanon I said we were under an obligation to those people.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke on behalf of the Government.  I said that the UN could not renege on their obligations to these widows and children.  The major powers have an obligation to them as well.  I suggested that the Minister should take it up with the United Nations and the major powers, and suggest that some contribution should be made to the widows and children of those soldiers.</P>
    <P>The figure under subhead L. is £118,000.  I take it this is the result of inflation and increased costs.  On subhead N. &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash; I take it there is an increased contribution to the pension scheme.  I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me what the increase is.  There is a reference to recoveries in respect of pension liability.  I should like the Minister to give me some detailed information on that.  I understand that in 1979 an increase in pension was awarded to the widows and dependants of officers and men.  The order was made in July and I understand that the increase has not yet been paid.  What is the reason for the delay in the payment of the increase?  If provision is made why does it take a year or more before the payments are made.</P>

      <P>The provision of £65,000 under subhead K. is in respect of special gratuities payable in the case of men killed while serving in the Lebanon.  Apart from those gratuities there is provision in the Army <Col N="1303" /> Pensions Acts for the payment of a gratuity equal to a year's pay and, in the case of a married man, his widow gets an annual allowance of 50 per cent of his pay.  There are also allowances for the children, so that in the case of a widow with three children such as the Deputy mentioned, an amount equal to 90 per cent of the pay is payable.</P>

      <P>It would not be equal.  In addition, widows' and orphans' benefits under the social welfare code are payable in the circumstances.  That is the position with regard to the UN people who unfortunately lost their lives.</P>
      <P>On subhead E. there is nothing unusual about the number of gratuities in this case.  In the past 12 months 267 long service gratuities and 888 short services gratuities have been paid.  As I explained in my opening statement, the bulk of the sum is related to increases in the rates of the payments and gratuities.  The main source of the Appropriations-in-Aid is the contributions made by officers and men towards the widows' and orphans' pension scheme.  These were the points raised by the Deputy and I thank him for his contribution and for his good wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) An applicant for a casual trading licence shall be required to obtain a bond of not less than £5,000 from a licensed assurance company, for the protection of consumers purchasing goods or property to which the licence relates.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I recommend that this amendment should be inserted between lines 33 and 34 of the Bill.  The Minister is aware that there are many people involved in the commercial and business life of the country who deal with transactions involving large sums of money and who are required to obtain a bond from an insurance company or some other body or have some form of indemnity.  One that comes to mind offhand is an auctioneering bond.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recollect that my reasons for requiring this amendment were that a situation could arise where, in the course of a day, a casual trader could sell ten colour televisions each costing £400. That would be a business transaction of £4,000.  It could happen that the television sets would be duds, completely useless and utterly unsuited for the purpose for which they were originally intended. Alternatively, it could happen that the person who sold them was not the owner but had acquired them in some way or other.  I am just taking the example of colour televisions but other types of goods of equal value could also be sold.</P>
    <P>A person who purchased one of the television sets and sought redress from the trader could find that the trader had no means whatever.  He would be left with a completely useless television which could not be repaired and he would have parted with his money and have no redress.  Such a person has no remedy whatever.  Unless there is a safeguard inserted in the Bill it provides a loophole for those who wish to be unscrupulous.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably say that this would be an infringement of the rights of casual traders because shopkeepers do not have to have a similar bond and that would be an expense on the casual trader. A person who is established in business <Col N="1305" /> and who perhaps has a dwellinghouse or family ties with a particular town does not have to take out a bond.  However, there is a great difference between the two cases.  The Minister should reconsider the line of argument he put to us on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A casual trader has to have a licence but it is of little comfort to a person who has parted with £400 and has no redress to know that the trader will be refused a licence the following year.  The cost of the bond is an expense but a reputable casual trader who has means and is able to satisfy an insurance company or similar body will have little difficulty in taking out such a bond.  A bond may cost £70 or £100 but it is not a big expense.  The Minister should adopt my proposal.</P>
    <P>We have put through a lot of important legislation to protect the consumer &mdash; the housewife, working man, old age pensioner and so on &mdash; and the Minister and his Department have a responsibility to add this amendment to the Bill.  It will cause little problem to the casual trader but will provide a remedy and redress for anyone who purchases goods and later finds that they are unsuitable for the purposes for which they were intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say that I am not accepting the Deputy's amendment because, as he said, a shopkeeper is not required to take out such insurance.  The Department and I feel it would be very unfair to impose this requirement on casual traders.  There is also the fact that it is possible that no insurance company would bond a casual trader.  If it did, the cost of the insurance would be almost excessive.  I cannot see any insurance company operating special rates for casual traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people who have to lodge money with the High Court.  Invariably they are well known and trusted members of the community but it has always been accepted that while they have to have bonds it is more to secure against legal accidents than likely dishonesty.  That is a point that has been missed as far as auctioneers and other sections are concerned. <Col N="1306" /> It is up to people who purchase from casual traders to ensure that they are from reputable firms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright said that shopkeepers are generally well known in their areas. There might be traders who had rented stores who would vanish overnight.  For those reasons I reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister's point holds water.  There will be consumers who may have bought defective or useless goods and who, without the type of bond I am suggesting, will be unable to recover compensation.  If insurance companies are not prepared to guarantee consumers against dishonesty or insolvency among casual traders how will consumers obtain redress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been concerning himself mainly with dishonesty. Most bonds taken out from insurance companies are not against dishonesty. The Deputy will bear auctioneers in mind.  Their bonds are in regard to the taking of legal action.  Once you start on this line it is difficult to see an end to it. Insurance companies, if asked to initiate a scheme against dishonesty, would find themselves having to issue bonds right across the board.  Anyway, other legislation goes a considerable way to protect consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    <P>I have introduced these amendments in response to points made by Deputy Enright on Committee Stage, particularly in relation to section 14.  The Deputy expressed concern in regard to the importation, possession or sale of goods and to conviction in this respect of a casual trader.

      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A person engaging in casual trading shall display on his person an identification to the effect that he is engaged on such trade.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This point was raised by several Deputies on this side during Committee Stage.  We felt that the permits should be displayed in a place where they would be clearly visible to the consumers.  The same applies to licences.  This is particularly important in the case of casual trading. Large supermarkets at the moment have such a system and in regard to staff identification they have tabs with the names of staff on the clothing of the staff so that customers know whom they are dealing with.  In bazaars and street trading points on the Continent it is normal for staff behind counters to have their names displayed and to have on display proper identification, issued by the local authorities so that they can be clearly identified if there is any breach of the law on their part or any complaint by the person they are dealing with.  Also if people find it is necessary to make a report to the local authority or to the Department or to make a claim in court they will have had the opportunity of seeing the permit or licence displayed and will also know the individual with whom they were dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority will be issuing permits. But it can happen that there will be a group of traders conducting business under one permit or licence.  This should be in a prominent position in the place where transactions are taking place.  But the permit might be displayed in such a position that the customer cannot see it clearly and therefore will not know whom <Col N="1309" /> he is dealing with.  It is to avoid that sort of situation that I am putting forward this amendment.  What I have suggested is standard practice on the Continent and should be adopted here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not worry about that.  The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be that the trader would have to display on his person some sort of sign to convey that he was engaged in casual trading.  I do not see any point in doing this because section 6 says that a person engaged in casual trading in a casual trading area shall display the casual trading permit relating to the trade or a copy thereof in such a position in the place where he is carrying on the trading as to be clearly visible and easily legible to members of the public at the place.  That is very clear.  It is obvious that many people change their address but it is the intention of the Minister to ensure as far as possible that licences will not be handed out but posted to an address.  I would like if the local authorities would adopt the same policy of reaching a postal address so that we will at least know the address of the person applying for the licence and include it in the licence or permit.  That should satisfy the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have seen in the papers over the years that many of these people have permanent addresses but they are shared with many others.  They merely have an arrangement to collect post there.  That is the only business transacted at such addresses by people whose sole purpose is to make money at as rapid a pace as possible.  My amendment seeks to ensure that this does not arise.  I am familiar with numerous people involved in casual trading and I am friendly with many of them. The vast majority, over 90 per cent, have permanent addresses, lead normal lives and are providing a service by being involved in this type of business.  They have a reputation to maintain and it is for the sake of those people that I propose this amendment.  Displaying names and addresses is a safeguard that this country could adopt since it is normal practice on <Col N="1310" /> the Continent and it would be an addition to this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Committee Stage of this Bill was arranged for Thursday of this week but apparently the Government attached considerable urgency to having the Bill enacted and they made a special request that the Bill be brought forward to today and indeed indicated that if this were not done by agreement they would introduce a motion in the House to discharge the order for taking the Bill on Thursday next and use their majority to ensure that the Committee Stage would be taken today. I am only referring to this because it indicates to me that the Government have some plans for using this Bill as part of the election machine in the not-too-distant future.  Apparently they want to ensure that the Bill is passed into law before the Dáil dissolves.  Let me ask the Minister, as a matter of something more than curiosity, if this might indicate that this Dáil will not again reassemble after the Christmas Recess.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Perhaps the Minister would tell <Col N="1311" /> us whether there is anything sinister in the urgency with which this Bill is being pushed through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The effect of section 1 is to enact that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle shall in certain circumstances be automatically re-elected to a certain constituency without the necessity of going through the electoral machine.  It is provided in section 1 (a) that a new paragraph (b) shall be inserted in section 14 of the Electoral Act, 1963.  The new paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 14 of the 1963 Act will read:</P>
      <P>(b)  if a revision of constituencies takes effect on the dissolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case on such revision there is a new constituency which either consists of or includes the constituency referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection, that new constituency.</P>
      <P>In effect it is provided that, if there is a division of a constituency and the constituency which the Ceann Comhairle represents is not interfered with but emerges again as a constituency or if the constituency which the Ceann Comhairle represents forms part of a larger constituency, the Ceann Comhairle will automatically be re-elected.  He may represent a three-seat constituency which is merged, for example, in a five-seat constituency. I am objecting to sub-paragraph (i) paragraph (b), which states:</P>
      <P>In case on such revision there is a new constituency which either consists of or includes the constituency referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection, that new constituency ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interpretation of that is that, if there is a constituency which consists of a former constituency, then it is not a new constituency; it is identical with a former constituency.  I suppose it could be said to be a new constituency in the sense that the former Act will be repealed and all the constituencies will be new constituencies when the new Act comes into force. To say the least of it, that is extremely confusing.  Such a constituency is not a <Col N="1312" /> new constituency and the position would be clarified if the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; before &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; were deleted.  This would make more sense and I should like to hear the Minister's view.</P>

It was decided on the previous occasion that this debate would be resumed on Thursday and the Ceann Comhairle insisted that we should set a date.  This is not Thursday, but I am not objecting to the change because it clears the air as we would all wish.</P>

      <P>There are suspicious minds at work on the other side of the House.  This is merely a tidying operation on legislation introduced at the beginning of the session and there is nothing more devious in it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the paragraph to which Deputy Fitzpatrick refers we are referring to two different categories of constituency.  In the first place we are referring to Dáil constituencies actually in force and, secondly, to the constituencies which have been defined in a constituency revision Bill but which will not come into effect until the next dissolution of the Dáil.  The word &ldquo;new&rdquo; is included here to make for greater clarity and to assist in understanding the provision.  Omission of the word would not seem to make any change in the meaning of the paragraph but would <Col N="1313" /> tend to make its meaning more obscure. The parliamentary draftsmen gave considerable thought to the wording of the paragraph and were of the opinion that some qualification was necessary in order to distinguish between the two categories of constituency.  Various expressions such as &ldquo;revised constituency&rdquo; or &ldquo;constituency prescribed in the relevant Act&rdquo; were considered and the draftsmen concluded that the expression &ldquo;new constituency&rdquo; conveyed the necessary meaning clearly and without undue verbiage.  It is a matter on which the House would be well advised to accept this professional advice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question if there is no alteration in a constituency from one Bill to another, does it mean there is no new constituency, is something one could argue and make a reasonable case as Deputy Fitzpatrick has done.  However each constituency is defined anew in revision Bills and is not defined by reference to any existing constituency.  In this sense, each constituency is new, whether or not there has been a change in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I cannot see how putting in the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; takes away any confusion and makes the position clearer.  The part &ldquo;if a revision of constituencies takes effect on the dissolution &mdash;...&rdquo; is the part we are going to deal with at that stage.  If the revision of constituencies takes effect on a dissolution, the previous Act will have been repealed because the Bill contains a repealing provision which repeals the previous revision Act as on the dissolution. The old Act will be gone and the old constituencies will be gone.  Then we will say, in case of such revision, the revision only takes effect as from the dissolution.  In case, on such revision, there is a constituency the only constituency could be then the constituency contained in the Act which is in force.  The only Act which will be in force is the last revision Act because it contains provisions repealing &mdash; as far as I know &mdash; the previous set of constituencies.  They will be gone.  It would make more sense, with all due respect to the draftsman, if it <Col N="1314" /> reads &ldquo;if a revision of the constituencies takes effect on the dissolution &mdash; (i) in case on such revision there is a constituency which either consists of or includes the constituency referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection, that new constituency,...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is in a difficult position because he has got certain technical advice on a technical matter.  It is difficult for him to brush that advice aside but I have put forward a reasoned argument showing that the only constituencies that will be in operation on the relevant date, the relevant date being the date when the Dáil is dissolved and people are thinking about nominations, will be the new constituencies, if they are new constituencies.  A constituency which is on all fours and consists of a previous constituency, would not be recognised by anybody as a new constituency.  It would be recognised as a constituency that was not in the field, just as the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan was a three-seater constituency for the 1973 election and a five-seater for the 1977 election.  Deputy Tully mentioned it as being one which had not been interfered with by the commission.</P>

I do not think that it will make a lot of difference, because at the appropriate time, there will be only one constituency anyway.  It will probably be identifiable.  It is baffling when one reads this section for the first time.  How could a constituency, which is identical with the previous constituency, be termed a new constituency?  New constituencies, in ordinary language, are only those which differ in some way from the previous constituencies.

      <P>In page 2, line 35, after &ldquo;includes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a substantial&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 1(b) of the Bill proposes to insert a new subsection in section 14 of the Electoral Act, 1963.  The purpose of the amendment is to deal with situations such as have arisen here.  Where the Ceann Comhairle ceases to hold office subsequent to a revision, either due to resignation or death.  It provides machinery by which a new Ceann Comhairle can make a declaration which, in effect, specifies the constituency for which he will be automatically re-elected.  If the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle has been elected forms a new constituency, or in its entirety forms part of a new constituency, then he is obliged to opt for that constituency and he is automatically elected unless he does not stand.  If the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle was elected was carved up into several pieces and if this section goes through as it is, the Ceann Comhairle may make a declaration identifying any constituency as his which contains any part of his previous constituency no matter how small that part is.</P>
      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle knows, not so long ago the constituency of Louth, for which he was elected, contained a very small part of County Monaghan, which is now part of the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are getting to the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It happens that that is the example which proves the necessity for this amendment.  If this section were to go through, in theory the Ceann Comhairle could stand for the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and be automatically elected. <Col N="1317" /> That would not make sense because there is only a tiny bit of County Monaghan &mdash; around Inniskeen, containing a few hundred votes and certainly not more than a thousand &mdash; which, under the Bill as it stands, would entitle the Ceann Comhairle to opt for Cavan-Monaghan. You could extend that argument all over the country.  The same set of circumstances could arise if we had a different Ceann Comhairle who found himself in a similar position after a revision.</P>
      <P>The situation I have done my best to describe arises because new paragraph (b) in the new subsection reads as follows:</P>
      <P>A constituency specified in a declaration made under this section shall be a constituency specified in the Act providing for the revision which includes part of the constituency for which the person making the declaration is a member of the Dáil at the time when the declaration is made.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, the Ceann Comhairle was elected for the constituency of Louth which at that time consisted of a small part of Monaghan.  It is unreasonable that a person should be entitled to opt for an entirely new constituency merely because it contains a few townlands of the constituency for which he was elected.  It would be unthinkable if the constituencies could be revised by a Minister, because he might be entitled to take this provision into account when revising the constituencies.  As far as I know there is no statutory provision which says constituties shall be revised by an independent commission.  It is likely that in the foresable future that will be done, but it is not part of our statute law nor is it laid down in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment proposes to insert in the new paragraph (b) after &ldquo;includes&rdquo; the words &ldquo;a substantial part&rdquo;.  The Ceann Comhairle would be entitled to be elected, without election, for any constituency which consisted of his own constituency, or which included his own constituency, or which included a substantial part of his own constituency. That is reasonable, is common sense and <Col N="1318" /> would get over the situation I have been spelling out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit disappointed because I was so sure the Minister would put down an amendment similar to Deputy Fitzpatrick's that I did not put down an amendment myself.  This seems a very reasonable way of dealing with this problem. When this provision is not included there is always a suspicion that the section is worded in this way for an ulterior motive.  The present Ceann Comhairle, decent man that he is, might be persuaded to stand for Cavan-Monaghan because the area around Inniskeen, which has a very small number of votes, is in Cavan-Monaghan and was formerly in Louth.  If that happened it would throw the cat among the pigeons because there is war between the rival Fianna Fáil people in Louth and if they had ten seats they could have ten candidates.  It might ease the situation if instead of the Ceann Comhairle taking an automatic seat there, he went into a neighbouring area. This might make it embarrassing for Fine Gael and some of their own people, but that might not worry them a lot.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why this amendment should not be accepted unless there is an ulterior motive.  It does not make sense that a Ceann Comhairle should be entitled to stand for portion of his former constituency which might contain only a few dozen votes but that could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the Bill which went through this House last July was stupid.  I could not understand the reason for it.  This is equally foolish.  I am quite sure it was not the parliamentary draftsman who suggested it, that it is a ministerial decision and, if it is, I would ask the present Minister, who inherited the Bill, to have a look at it even at this eleventh hour. Unless the Minister accepts it there is not any point in arguing over it because it will be carried if we put it to a vote.  It looks so foolish that a Ceann Comhairle should be entitled to stand for an area, even if there are only one or two votes in it. Even if it were down to that he would be so entitled under the section as it stands. The only way to avoid it is to say a substantial portion, more than half; I left the <Col N="1319" /> wording of it to the Minister, so sure was I that a Ministerial amendment would be introduced for the purpose of regulating this and preventing a second rather foolish decision being taken.  If the Minister has something I have missed, I should like to hear it.  Otherwise I would ask him to accept the Fine Gael amendment of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to appear to narrow down the choice of constituency for which a Ceann Comhairle could opt.  However the problem with a suggested change in the choice of words is that the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is not defined and could mean different things to different people. While the intention of the Deputy may well be to prevent him opting for a constituency which might include, say, only one townland or district electoral division from his present constituency, it is doubtful if it would do so in law.  The word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is a very subjective one. What may be substantial to one person may well be trivial to another and <i>vice versa.</i>  Thus to an outsider one small village or polling district may not represent something substantial but a Deputy who can rely on the vast majority of votes from the area may regard it as substantial indeed.  Even if the words were capable of precise definition or if we could find a similar word with a precise legal meaning, we cannot at this time claim to foresee all the circumstances that may arise in the future.</P>
      <P>If we accepted an amendment on these lines we could well be tying the hands of a future Ceann Comhairle in an unreasonable way.  Unintentionally we could be putting him into a box which we would not dream of doing could we foresee the full circumstances.  Therefore I suggest that we adhere to the wording of the section and allow a Ceann Comhairle to have the already limited choice the Bill proposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Like Deputy Tully, I was rather surprised to find that no ministerial amendment had been introduced today <Col N="1320" /> to meet this very reasonable request.  I was equally surprised to learn that apparently the Government party were going to use their brawn to put the Bill through the House.  Therefore, within five minutes, I introduced this amendment.  If this amendment were accepted and any Ceann Comhairle acted in a reasonable way, and did not avail of a freak situation such as I have been describing, a court would hold that he borrowed a substantial part of his constituency.  Assuming that there is any substance in the argument put forward by the Minister&mdash;that he is not satisfied that &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is the right word, that it might be difficult to interpret and that it might embarrass a Ceann Comhairle&mdash;there are several ways at the disposal of his parliamentary draftsmen, about whom he has been speaking, to bring in an amendment that will meet both his and our genuine fears. This is not merely a mickey mouse amendment; it is not introduced merely for the sake of putting forward an amendment. Neither is it an amendment put forward for the sake of poking fun at the Bill or for having a bit of crack.  It is an amendment which meets a real situation that could be exploited for political purposes in a constituency that perhaps was never drawn up for that purpose.  For example, human nature being what it is, nobody knows who the Ceann Comhairle will be from week to week and it follows therefore that nobody will know what constituency he will be representing when this new section comes into force. And if he finds himself in a position to exploit a situation like that for party purposes he would be less than human if he did not avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was before the House on the last occasion &mdash; and I want to get down to brass tacks now &mdash; we told the Minister that he should have a more comprehensive section dealing with this specific difficulty, dealing with the very situation that had arisen by the lamented death of the former Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Brennan.  We asked what would happen if a Ceann Comhairle were to resign, when the Minister's predecessor said that a new, small section would be necessary.  They did not heed us then. <Col N="1321" /> They were too lazy to go and think about it and introduce a section such as they are now doing.  We are telling them now that the section, as drafted, can lead to trouble, to absurdities, to an abuse of the favourable circumstances conferred on the Ceann Comhairle by the Bill.  It is customary to say that present company or present occupants are excluded.  I do with all sincerity exclude the present occupant from any remarks I make.  But this Bill is not being passed for the purpose of this present set of circumstances. It is an amendment of the Elecoral Bill of 1963.  It proposes to set up machinery which will last for all time, and for several revisions, in the years to come.  The Electoral Act of 1963 replaced the Electoral Act of 1923, 40 years later.  Indeed, if the Minister brought in an amendment here tomorrow, we would facilitate him.  He might get the parliamentary draftsman to work overtime.  If he brought in a suitable amendment here on, say, Thursday, we would facilitate him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that there is nothing wrong with Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment apart from the difficulty in defining the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;. If that is so, in the normal way one would expect the Minister to say he accepted the principle behind the amendment and would introduce a suitable amendment on Report Stage.  Possibly the Minister has been studying the operations of some of his colleagues and, most particularly, the approach adopted by the Minister for Justice.  In a most polite and apologetic way he says &ldquo;no&rdquo; and makes people feel they are being given their Christmas presents all rolled into one.</P>
      <P>I want to give notice to the Minister for the Environment that some of us know him too well for him to think that will work.  It will not work.  The Bill is to be guillotined through this House and, presumably, through the Seanad before the end of the week, to clear the decks for a general election which may be possible at any time from Christmas Eve onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister of State agreed to take the Committee Stage of this Bill this coming Thursday.  That was swept aside by frenzied activity on the part of the Government Whips.  Since last week <Col N="1323" /> the Government Whips have been chasing themselves and the Opposition Whips around the House to change the order to have the Committee Stage of this Bill discussed on Thursday next.  A special motion was put down on the Order Paper today to have Committee Stage taken today.  If it does not go through the House by agreement today, it will be guillotined through the House at 7.10 p.m. so that it can be cleared through the Seanad and the decks prepared for a general election. It is well that Members of the House should realise that is the situation.</P>
    <P>No serious consideration is being given to Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment. Even if the amendment were clear-cut and considered worth while by everybody, there is no way in which the Minister would accept it whether he was nasty or polite about it.  When we discussed the purpose of this amendment last week I made the point that we could have a section suggesting that the Ceann Comhairle could nominate the part of his old constituency which was the largest of the parts into which it was being divided or, alternatively, in fairness to the Ceann Comhairle that he could nominate the area in which he was domiciled.  It could happen that one-third of the Ceann Comhairle's constituency might be added into another constituency and that might be the part of the constituency in which he enjoyed most of his electoral support, and in which he lived.  It would have been simple for the Government to put down an amendment giving effect to those suggestions.</P>
    <P>Neither of those suggestions should be beyond the wit or the competence of the parliamentary draftsman, or the Minister, or even the Minister of State who listened to the arguments last week and appeared to regard them favourably.  He appeared to see a lot of merit in them. He must have seen so much merit in them that he was not allowed to come in today to handle the Committee Stage.  He was too generous and too reasonable.</P>

The Minister interjected and said: &ldquo;Now we are getting down to the basis of it&rdquo;.  The example given by Deputy Fitzpatrick was merely a follow on to an example I gave in the House last week about the possibility of a section of Louth being added into the county of Meath. The Minister introduced a note of personal rancour by suggesting that Deputy Fitzpatrick wanted this Committee Stage debate because Cavan-Monaghan is beside the Ceann Comhairle's constituency.</P>

The arguments put forward are reasoned and there is a lot of merit in them.  The Minister should show his goodwill to the House in a positive way by accepting this amendment, or by saying he will introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  We have certain misgivings, and what we are saying today could apply to the Fianna Fáil Party at a later stage.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Fitzpatrick put down this amendment he was not thinking of his own back door.  It could apply to Kerry and Cork.  Part of south Kerry was with west-Cork for a considerable time. Part of west Limerick was with east Limerick. Part of Clare was with Galway. There are several multi-seat constituencies which are spread across county borders. Last week it appeared that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, was amenable to the suggestion we were making. It is surprising that a guillotine motion has been tabled by the Government.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1980. - Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) (No. 2) Bill, 1980: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) (No. 2) Order, 1980, which I made on 11 December 1980 under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>This order extends for a further two months the currency of a statutory ban on the operation of new company owned motor spirit stations by oil companies, created by the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972.  That order, as amended, is due to expire on 18 January 1981.</P>
      <P>The 1972 order was made following an inquiry by the then Fair Trade Commission, requested by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1970, into the growth of the number of retail outlets directly operated by the petrol companies. In their report of the inquiry the commission argued that the growth of the control by the oil companies over the retail market needed to be halted for a time in the public interest as they felt that this development would lead to dominance over the retail market by the oil companies and increase the risk of such restrictive practices as price fixing and market sharing.  The 1972 order halted this development for a trial period of three years.  It was reviewed by the commission in 1975 and, on their recommendation, it was extended for another three years until the summer of 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During that review the commission also received representations on matters relevant to the orders which their terms of reference did not allow them to consider. The commission had suggested, accordingly, that when they next reviewed the ban they should also review the other aspects of the orders relating to the motor spirit trade.  I decided, therefore, to ask the commission to hold an <Col N="1329" /> inquiry into the operation of the orders as a whole, into any matters germane to the operations of those orders and also into the conditions which obtain in regard to the agreements under which stations which are company owned but not company run are operated.  This latter aspect was included because I was anxious that concerns expressed by, and on behalf of, persons who were operating company stations without the security afforded by employee or tenant status should be explored thoroughly.  Pending the receipt of the commission's report, I extended, by way of orders in 1978, 1979 and 1980, the ban for a further two and a half years to 18 January 1981.</P>
    <P>I received the commission's report some months ago.  The report has been examined and decisions have been taken on its recommendations.  I had hoped to be able to have an order made implementing those of its recommendations which I accept and to have had a confirming Bill before the House before the end of this session.  However, the order I propose to make is a complex one requiring careful drafting to ensure that it reflects accurately the numerous recommendations made.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that when I spoke on this matter in the House in June of this year I expressed the hope that I would be able to introduce permanent legislation relating to the supply and distribution of motor spirit.  Towards this end, I also propose, in the order to be made, on foot of the commission's report, to consolidate all relevant legislation. It is now clear that it will not be possible to have this lengthy order finalised in time to introduce confirming legislation during the present session.  I have accordingly extended the currency of the statutory ban on the operation of new company owned stations for a further two months to 18 March 1981.</P>
    <P>As regards the commission's report, I hope to publish this very early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the confirming Bill <Col N="1330" /> which is necessary to give the force of law to the order.  The order, however, may not be amended but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.  This is an uncontroversial measure and I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter referred to by the Minister concerns regulations under the Restrictive Practices Commission's Report.  When discussing this last June the Minister referred to certain areas and activities of petrol companies and he expressed concern.  At that time I referred to the position of persons who were operating company stations and I made the point that in many cases these people had spent the best part of their lives in these jobs and their livelihood depended solely on the sale of petrol or oil.  In recent years because of the bullying tactics &mdash; to put it bluntly &mdash; of some companies because they wanted to get out of this position, in some cases they used the flimsiest excuses to find fault with the tenants of the stations and tried to eject them.  These people had in many cases spent years in the service of the company but they seemed to have established no fixity of tenure; they had no legal rights.  To me the law of natural justice would be expected to come to their aid but in many instances this did <Col N="1331" /> not happen.  I hope that, when the Minister has decided to review the recommendations and select those he wishes to implement, this particular one will attract his attention and that he will lay down some definitive ground rules about this problem which has caused great hardship to many people in the service of oil companies. It is major problem with a human dimension.  I hope the Minister will direct his attention to this aspect of the report.</P>
      <P>Obviously I must agree with the extension for a two-month period to 18 March of the present state of things, the ban, to give the Minister time to get down to the nuts and bolts of this recommendation. He said, however, that he received the commission's report some months ago and because of that I am disappointed that he is not in a position now to bring in the order he mentioned in regard to the report's recommendations and the implementation thereof.  In June last I asked the Minister if some type of moratorium would apply in the case of people over whose heads a threat was pending &mdash; an eviction threat in some cases.  I think he said he was unable at that time to give that guarantee and I would like to know what the position is now until 18 March or such time as he finds it possible to introduce legislation to correct some of the anomalies and inadequacies which now exist in regard to certain regulations governing the sale of petrol.  Would the Minister clarify that now?</P>
      <P>I should also like to know if, in framing the regulations which he intends to bring before the House in the form of a confirmation order, he has consulted or intends in the next few months to consult with the parties involved in this area to get their points of view and see what might be suitable for them.  I look forward to the legislation which the Minister has in mind.  He said it has been delayed because of its complex nature and I hope we shall see something substantial that will correct the anomalies that have existed in this area.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Toole inquired about the position of certain operators of stations who were in some <Col N="1332" /> difficulty with the companies concerned. I understand that the majority of the operators who had these difficulties have concluded agreements with the employers in question.  Some cases have not been settled yet; I think there are court proceedings in a number of them.  It would not be proper for me to divulge the contents of the recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>Other problems mentioned by the Deputy were covered in the inquiry and in the subsequent report.  I have made decisions in regard to these recommendations &mdash; such of them as I accept &mdash; and a preliminary draft of the order has been received in the Department but it is very long and very complex.  It was only received in the past week and it was quite undesirable in view of the complexity of it to rush it as it appeared that some parts of it needed re-drafting to express more clearly the decisions reached.  At the time of publication of the report in January I shall publish the new order and will introduce the necessary Bill immediately after the Christmas Recess so that it will be enacted before 18 March.  I would envisage the new order taking effect from that date.</P>

      <P>A Supplementary Estimate has always been regarded as a parliamentary device to tide us over the last few weeks of a financial period.  However, it must be pointed out that an enormous sum &mdash; in the range of £450 million &mdash; will by tomorrow evening have been put through this House in the past fortnight. I do not think Supplementary Estimates were meant to be used when amounts of this size are involved.  They were meant to be used in the event of unforeseen circumstances, where over-expenditure was inevitable because of something outside the control of or unforeseen by a Department.</P>

    <P>There has been a considerable abuse of this device during this year.  A note of warning should be given because we are not getting adequate time to debate the pros and cons and the reasons for this additional expenditure.  It should have been included in the budget this year but because of miscalculation or because of a deliberate cut by the Minister for Finance to give the impression that things <Col N="1334" /> were better than they were, we were led to believe that £X million would run the show.  Now we are finding it is taking £X million plus £Y million &mdash; £Y million being £450 million.  The most cynical aspect of all of this is that it was probably a deliberate act on the part of the Minister for Finance and the people who advise him to give a false impression. Now Minister after Minister has trooped into this House seeking amounts that total £450 million.</P>
    <P>On the Supplementary Estimate now before the House, it gives us an opportunity, short though it may be, to discuss agriculture and the crisis in that industry. In the recent past we have not seen such an outburst of dissatisfaction, frustration, disappointment and hopelessness as exists among the farming community today.  This affects large and small farmers. I have been throughout the country and I can tell the Minister that there is a deep sense of dissatisfaction from County Wexford to County Mayo.  It covers the entire spectrum of agricultural activity, from the small fragmented farms to the large and so-called well-off farmers in the east and south-east.</P>
    <P>About five weeks ago after making an inquiry with the Minister's office I made a statement in relation to delay in payment of headage grants.  Despite the fact that there was an increase in the grants negotiated by the Minister, I pointed out that at the time of negotiating the increases he had failed to get an increase in the ceiling price per acre, which was then £12.  At the time I was accused of untruths by some of the Minister's colleagues. They published a statement saying what I had stated was untrue but in the next sentence they said the Minister was in Brussels negotiating a deal that would take note of this ceiling and, hopefully, would increase it.  When I made that statement the ceiling was what I said it was.  Since then it has been raised to £18 per acre which will give the small farmer some chance of availing of the full grant provided he has the necessary number of qualifying units.</P>
    <P>I never thought I would see the degree of dissatisfaction that there is at present. The large meeting which was held in Limerick <Col N="1335" /> recently is indicative of that dissatisfaction. A strong Government supporter said to me, in a very naive way, that all the people in Limerick at the meeting were anti-Government people. It is very easy to point the finger and say these demonstrations are motivated by political feelings.  They are motivated by economic demands on the people involved who see no light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would try to relieve the hardship which now faces the agricultural community.  Yet he and his party trooped up steps last week to oppose a motion put down by Deputy Bruton and Fine Gael which was specifically tailored to make some effort to relieve the very hardship the Minister says he is seeking relief for, which relief so far has not transpired apart from a few peripheral suggestions and schemes he brought in in the late harvest&mdash;£20 per ton for fertiliser for first-time silage makers.  In relation to this scheme and the costing of it one wonders what allocation finds its way into the pockets of the producers.  A major fault with schemes up to now has been that they have not concentrated on the producer and, to a large degree, do not find their way inside the farm gate.  There are people between the producer and the consumer who reap a rich harvest from schemes that are introduced.  The only way relief can be seen to be having an impact is when it is directed solely to the producer.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which farmers now face were expected by many of them.  Ample warnings were given that unless corrective action was taken things would get worse.  Yet there was a blatant failure on the part of the Minister to take the kind of corrective action which was obviously necessary if the farming community was to be in a position where they could look to the future with confidence.  Confidence has been eroded and they wait for some form of relief from the Minister and the Government who pride themselves on having the problems of the farming community at heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Minister has been in constant contact with farming organisations it is obvious that there is no communication between them and the Minister.  The Minister can go into a room and have a so-called discussion about the very serious problems facing agriculture but the Minister seems to be turning a deaf ear.  He should come down to one of the marts in Fermoy, Midleton or Mallow and there he would hear the true facts which are very disheartening and disappointing.</P>
      <P>There is a complete lack of confidence in the agricultural industry and nobody can deny this fact.  Farmers are facing very grim problems.  There has been a drop of 50 per cent in their real incomes in the past two years.  Inflation may be one of the major factors in this because input costs have gone up by 30 per cent. It is unfair to ask anyone, farmers included, to produce goods when they are not getting a fair return for their efforts and time.  Nobody wants to produce goods at a loss and this is what farmers are being asked to do at present. It is alright for the Minister for Finance to say to them not to cut down on their use of fertiliser but if the Minister had to buy fertilisers he would know the necessity for cutting down on their input.</P>
      <P>The banks and lending agencies who were such good friends to farmers when agriculture was better than it is today should play their full part in financing farmers and being more sympathetic to them.  They and the agricultural institutions should come together and put some of their profits into the reclamation of all marginal land in the country.  It is estimated that half the land is marginal land.</P>
      <P>Exporting beef on the hoof is shameful. What we are doing is exporting jobs which we can ill afford when one considers that there are 120,000 unemployed and that 38,000 of these are under the age of 24.  Surely the Minister must keep these people in mind and surely they can expect some future in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> That the agricultural industry is so bad at present is a very serious matter especially when one considers that 22 per cent of the population are directly involved in farming and a further 18 per cent are involved in spin-off industries relating to agriculture.  The Minister should make every effort to rectify the position and not turn a deaf ear to the farmers' complaints. He turned a deaf ear last week when Deputy Bruton produced a six point plan&mdash;the abolition of rates on agricultural land; the abolition and refund of the resource tax; the abolition of the bovine disease levy; an interest subsidy for farmers; a tax free allowance on breeding stock and stamp duty relief for young farmers.  It was put on the table for the Minister but we will remember at the next general election that Fianna Fáil said no to all these points and I hope the Minister will remember it also.</P>
    <P>I was in the Grand Hotel in Fermoy yesterday and the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about the future of agriculture.  I thought he was referring to one country and that I was thinking of another.  The way he saw agriculture and the way I, a rural Deputy, see it are two completely different outlooks. I know there is complete lack of confidence among farmers.  The Minister will have to come up with something constructive to help farmers to recover their confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mac-Sharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Mac-Sharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Deputies who spoke for their contributions to the debate.  It would be too much to expect that I would agree with all that was said, especially from the other side of the House, but I appreciate that the many contributions from all sides of the House indicate great interest in agriculture and its expansion and well-being.</P>
      <P>However, I should like to deal with some of the more detailed matters that were raised in this, the budget debate on any Supplementary Estimate so far.  It has extended over four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I want to point out that in recent months the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I have had a number of meetings with leaders of the farming <Col N="1338" /> organisations to consider what could be done to improve farm incomes through national and EEC measures.  When introducing the Supplementary Estimate I outlined to the House the series of measures the Government have taken to help farmers.  Some Deputies opposite described these measures as useless and inadequate.  Far from being anything of the kind, they represent a real effort in the present difficult financial situation to help the agricultural industry and to do so in ways that would best assist those most in need of assistance.  The size of the Supplementary Estimate, almost £40 million, clearly reflects the extent of the Government's effort, and it should be remembered that this sum does not include the £6 million or so represented by the concession on rates to farmers in the £40 to £60 rateable valuation category.</P>
    <P>The discussions with the farming organisations are continuing, and I want to assure the agricultural community of the Government's concern about the agricultural situation and of their determination to do what they can to help farmers to overcome current difficulties and to bring about the expansion in agricultural production which is so important not only to farmers but also to the entire national economy.</P>
    <P>One suggestion made by the farming organisations &mdash; namely, the devaluation of the Irish green £ &mdash; would, to say the least, present considerable difficulties. At present there is no scope for any significant alteration of the green £ without a change in the central exchange rate for our currency.  The latter, of course, cannot be contemplated.  A green £ change by itself would run counter to the whole philosophy of the Community's agri-monetary system and indeed of the common agricultural policy generally.</P>
    <P>It is correct, as Deputy Bruton said, that the UK and Ireland have had different green rates for some time past.  The reason for this was that, when both pounds floated downwards and substantial MCAs arose, we moved faster than the UK in reducing and subsequently getting rid of the MCAs.  At that time we <Col N="1339" /> were not creating new and bigger MCAs but were moving in the direction of abolishing them.  This was fully in line with the whole theory of MCAs, which are intended to be applied on a temporary basis while green rates are brought into line with foreign exchange market rates after the latter have altered.</P>
    <P>The kind of green £ change now being suggested by some interests would, however, go in the opposite direction.  It would create artificial new MCAs solely to give Ireland a higher level of prices. Naturally, I would be very happy to secure a price rise for Irish farmers in any way open to me, but one must be realistic. It is necessary to consider how other member states and the Commission would react to something which would be completely contrary to the whole philosophy of the MCA system.  Could the Commission propose something which would run counter to the principle of market unity and common prices?  Could Ministers from other member states, which also have difficulties in regard to farm income, agree that Ireland would be taken care of in a manner contrary to the Community's agri-monetary system, while nothing would be done for their own farmers?</P>
    <P>We are, however, examining various other possibilities, particularly in an EEC context.  I have very much in mind in all of this that Article 39 of the Rome Treaty specifically provides that one of the basic objectives of the common agricultural policy shall be to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community. Mainly because of diverging inflation rates this aim is not being achieved in this country at the present time.  Neither is it being achieved in some of the other member states.  I recently met Commissioner Gundelach and I have put a range of suggestions to him aimed at dealing with the present income situation of our farmers. As I have already told the House, the Commissioner was receptive and sympathetic, and he undertook to examine forthwith ways and means of relieving the situation.  Arising out of our meeting discussions are proceeding at high official level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> In this debate Deputies opposite painted a picture of deep gloom and depression.  They could foresee nothing in the future of agriculture except worsening conditions and increased problems. Deputy Barry said she could not see any light at the end of the tunnel.  I do not deny that agriculture has been passing through a difficult time.  Indeed I have been saying so for many months, but the position is not helped by spreading despondency and fear.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies opposite referred to sales of livestock by farmers in order to buy food for their families and tended to convey the impression that this was happening on a widespread scale.  It is, however, necessary to consider all the circumstances of any individual case in which livestock have been sold.  For instance, I myself have heard of cases where farmers with substantial holdings bought further lands on the basis of heavy bank borrowings, and as a result they are now in financial difficulties.  I would, however, ask Deputies opposite whether they consider that the taxpayers should be asked to provide money to help those farmers to hold on to the lands which they bought and which might otherwise have enabled small farmers to reach viable levels.</P>
    <P>The impression given by Deputies opposite was that there had been widespread sale of breeding stock to help to feed farmers' families.  I do not accept that and I do not think the farming community throughout the country would accept it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bermingham is another Deputy who said it.  It is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are much more concerned about the situation of farmers who borrowed to develop their existing holdings and who now find themselves burdened with interest payments and unable to obtain the necessary working capital to run their enterprises efficiently. These are the farmers who deserve sympathy and help, and it is primarily to assist this type of farmer that the Government arranged that money would be borrowed abroad by the banks and the ACC to lend to farmers at attractive rates and also that these financial institutions would do something about re-structuring loans for farmers in the kind of situation I have just outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The loans have not been taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be surprised that they are being taken up. The Government provided these facilities with the banks and the ACC.  Some Deputies claimed that Continental interest rates for agricultural purposes were very significantly lower than those payable in this country.  Where this happens it is partly the result of a generally lower level of interest rates.  Also, in some member states assistance under the Farm Modernisation Scheme is given in the form of an interest subsidy rather than in <Col N="1342" /> the form of a capital grant which we provide here.  If they so wished, farmers here could get an interest subsidy instead of a capital grant, but I think that the preference of Irish farmers throughout has been for the grant.</P>
      <P>On interest rates generally, the Government, as I have said, arranged with the ACC and Associated Banks to make money available from foreign borrowings at attractive interest rates.  As much as £100 million is being borrowed and this will be made available to cover a wide range of capital investment including, in particular, the provision of additional working capital where the farmer's own funds are seriously depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>How much is taken up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that it will all be taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>This shows that the Government have tackled in a very positive manner the problems of capital for investment.</P>
      <P>Regarding the exchange risk guarantee on these borrowings, the residual risk is being carried by the Government.  Deputy Bruton and others have criticised the arrangement, but I would ask him if he objects to farmers getting money at 13 per cent as compared with a rate here of 18 per cent or so at the time, and with about 16 per cent now.</P>
      <P>Similarly with rates, the Deputy seems to regret that the Government gave relief to farmers in the £40 to £60 R.V. category. The farmers concerned have no such regret and certainly would not describe the relief as useless, as some of the Opposition Deputies did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to leave the judgement to Irish farmers and I know they are accepting them as such.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to matters relating to the Land Commission and to the price of land.  These matters do not arise on the Vote for agriculture.  I should like to say, however, that I was rather surprised at the suggestion that taxpayers' money should be used to help people who had bought land at £3,500 per acre. It seems to me that the purchasers concerned and the financial institutions who provided money so readily to finance such extravagant purchases should work out their own salvation.  In so far as State assistance can be made available for agriculture, it should be allocated to more deserving borrowers and for the development of agricultural production.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to boosting the national cow herd.  Deputy Callanan made quite a number of suggestions for the development of agriculture.  This was in sharp contrast to the absence of practical ideas from the other side of the House.  I agree with Deputy Callanan that putting a stop to the export of young cattle is no remedy for the destocking problem and that a far better solution is to provide a direct and positive incentive to producers by way of increased headage and suckler cow payments as we have already done.  In the ongoing discussion with farm leaders and with the EEC I will be seeking other means to assist the livestock industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That has changed from the time the Minister jailed them and when the present Taoiseach jailed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever might be said about the suckler schemes, farmers who increased their suckler herds will get £57 for each extra cow in the disadvantaged areas and over £25 for each extra cow in the rest of the country.  Time will show the results of these worthwhile incentives.  All Deputies in the House should hope that the results will be favourable rather than condemn them. Deputy Bruton maintained that other <Col N="1344" /> member states were paying the national element as well as the EEC element.  In fact France and Ireland are the only member states who are paying any additional suckler cow grants out of national funds.</P>
      <P>Regarding the disadvantaged areas, Deputies are aware that the Government have been pressing for an extension in the boundaries for quite some time.  This matter has recently been considered by the Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures in Brussels.  I expect the final step of a Commission decision to take place very soon and I will then be in a position to make a statement on the detailed changes which have been worked out with the EEC Commission.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Kenny who raised the question of the timing of inspections under the various headage schemes.  In view of the number of such schemes at this stage and the huge amount of inspection work involved, my Department are at present examining how best to arrange a better spread of inspections over a much longer period of the year.  It is, of course, necessary to carry out inspections at times which will not interfere with the marketing of cattle by farmers but I am, in any event, hopeful that it will be possible to have more streamlined inspection arrangements introduced in the coming year.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Deputy O'Toole said earlier about the increase in the limit per acre under the headage grant scheme, I want to make it clear to him that the increase in the headage grants and the increase in the limit per acre were negotiated with Brussels at the time of the announcement on 12 September last to enable us to pay to the maximum number of farmers the upper limit of the new increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham was very critical of the Dairy Herds Conversion Scheme. We in this country have never encouraged farmers to use this scheme but some farmers want to go out of dairying and they are entitled to EEC money if they meet the conditions laid down.  This scheme, however, is designed to reduce the milk surplus in the Community and so is very much in our interest and especially <Col N="1345" /> in the interest of our milk producers. It has succeeded in having fairly substantial numbers of cows slaughtered in some member states and this will be of benefit to this country in reducing the size of the overall Community milk surplus. Many people are asking for the information so let me say that the closing date for conversion scheme is 31 March next and the non-marketing scheme, the second arm of that scheme, is discontinued since September last.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy and others were concerned about the fact that our milk price was only 78 or 79 per cent of the target price in the EEC.  It was not today nor yesterday that this situation arose.  It has been there for quite some time.  It is a pity it is there and we will all look for ways to resolve it.  Indeed, Bord Bainne, the milk processing industry, the farmers and the Agricultural Institute are co-operating in a study to identify the factors responsible for this gap.  I hope they come forward with suitable conclusions and corrections of that situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the question of imports of New Zealand butter to the Community market.  The New Zealand economy relies heavily on earnings from butter exports and this fact is widely recognised within the Community.  While I would like to see any special arrangements for imports of New Zealand butter coming to an end, political reality makes this impossible at the present time.  My main concern then is to ensure that any new import arrangement should be for considerably smaller quantities than provided for previously and that the import arrangements do not undermine the Community market.  This has been the main thrust of the stand I have adopted in the Council discussions on the issue. The examination of the problem is continuing and I am hopeful that a satisfactory solution can be agreed.</P>
    <P>There were also references to the new Common Market system for sheep.  I am satisfied with the way in which the new system has been operating since it began on 20 October.  Market prices have been somewhat better than expected.  As a result, the amount of the ewe premium could now be somewhat less than anticipated. <Col N="1346" /> We originally estimated that the ewe premium would be about £3.50 per ewe for the half year to April next.  The premium is to cover any losses to producers arising from changes in market prices as a result of the new system.  As prices have been better than expected, the ewe premium may be less, but we shall have to wait and see how prices develop over the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Still on the subject of the ewe premium, I would like to emphasise that the premium will be paid only on good quality ewes.  The premium should be used to promote improvements in both numbers and quality.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell inquired about grants for sheep producers.  Grants under the normal farm modernisation scheme are, of course, available to them and, in addition, under the new western package there will be grants of 70 per cent available for the division, fencing and surface treatment of commonage and for the fencing and surface treatment of hill and mountain pasture.  Grants of 40 per cent will also be available for buildings and equipment.  Grant aid will also be available for group projects for dipping and shearing facilities, and for individual and group projects for accommodation of sheep during winter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of farmer investment at present and suggested that the high level of payments under the farm modernisation scheme this year represented work which was commenced a long time ago.  In fact, approvals of new projects for land improvement and buildings which were issued by my Department in October and November were at roughly the same monthly rate as in the previous quarter and also as in this quarter of last year. This shows that farmers are continuing to make new investment in their enterprises and have confidence in their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy claimed that grants were in some cases held up for one, two or, he said, even up to four years.  That could not be the case.  I am sure he realises <Col N="1347" /> that grants cannot be dished out on a kind of slot machine system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an onus to see that any moneys spent on behalf of the taxpayers are properly used.  Grants are subject to certain conditions that must be met before payment can be made.  If grants are delayed because specific conditions are not met, then the remedy for those delays rests with the farmer himself.  As far as I am concerned, it will always be my aim to have all grants which are properly due paid out within the shortest possible time.  The normal period taken for the payment of claims for farm works which have been inspected and passed is four to six weeks, and this is the standard which we seek to observe.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy suggested that there was a note of pessimism in my reference to the disease problem.  On the contrary, I am very optimistic, especially about brucellosis.  In the case of bovine TB, it is not that I am pessimistic, I am simply impatient as I think any responsible person concerned with farming should be.  I want to see both TB and brucellosis cleared quickly.  In particular I do not want us to fall into the trap of becoming complacent, as may have happened before when we seemed to be on top of the TB problem.  It is now when we are at a critical stage of the programme that we should be going all out to rid ourselves of these diseases once and for all.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the importance of disinfection on farms where disease is found and I agree with him.  Farmers are advised about the kind of disinfection that should be carried out in every case. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to stand over every farmer to see that the job is done properly, but I will see what can be done to help generally in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan referred to the role of badgers in the spread of bovine TB. As of now, I have no evidence that the badger is a major factor in the spread of <Col N="1348" /> this disease.  All carcases of badgers received in my Department's laboratories have been, and will continue to be, examined for the presence of TB.  Only a small number, however, have been found to be infected with this disease. There is continuing close co-operation on the badger problem between officers of my Department and officers of the Forest and Wildlife Section, as well as with persons experienced in this species in other countries.</P>

      <P>The enforcement of existing legislation relating to dogs is a function of the Garda Síochána and if any Deputy has any specific complaints or proposals in this matter he should bring them to the attention of the Minister for Justice for consideration.  I would not agree with the Deputy's view that the law is always on the side of the owners of marauding dogs.  A flock owner has the right to shoot a dog he finds on his land worrying his sheep and he has a good defence in law for so doing.  Apart from my Department's function under the Rabies Order, 1976, which relates to controls on dogs in the event of an outbreak of that disease, I have no statutory function in respect of stray dogs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan complained that some sheep dips used in his area were ineffective.  This matter is being investigated by my Department.  If any Deputy has a specific complaint about any particular sheep dip he or she should inform my Department, indicating among other details whether the dip in question was used for the prevention of sheep scab or the control of maggot fly or other sheep parasites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the volume of food imports.  I certainly share their concern about the extent of imports of food products that we could produce here.  Of course, much of the food products imported consist of fruit and other products which we ourselves do not produce but there is, at the same time, a disturbingly high level of imports of products <Col N="1349" /> that we are quite capable of producing ourselves.  In some of these cases it is possible that the products are being imported in some way under unfair conditions but that is far from being the whole story and much of the answer to the flow of imports is to organise and produce similar products efficiently in this country and market and promote them effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty advocated large scale market intervention for horticultural produce. There is already provision for market withdrawals by recognised producer groups of certain fresh fruit and vegetables such as tomatoes and apples to restore the market balance when prices have dropped to a low level.  This facility has been availed of on occasions by our producer groups.  I would point out, however, that for perishable produce which cannot be stored in intervention for later sale, it would be impracticable and undesirable to have a widespread operation of market intervention.</P>
    <P>In the vegetable processing sector, the industry throughout western Europe has been experiencing a phase of economic difficulties in recent years and unfortunately it is not possible for us to insulate ourselves from the effects of these.</P>
    <P>The future of the horticultural industry as a whole is at present under detailed examination by the Horticultural Development Group which I have set up under the aegis of my Department and which includes all sections connected with the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fox expressed concern about imports of Cyprus potatoes.  As he probably knows, since the implementation of the EEC Plant Health Directive in May last we cannot prevent these imports. They are, of course, subject to a duty of 9 per cent and this goes up to 21 per cent if the potatoes are imported directly into Ireland.  The proposed common organisation of the market for potatoes should provide better safeguards for our growers against competition from other countries generally, but it will not have any impact on imports from Cyprus.</P>
    <P>With regard to improving the presentation of our own early potatoes, my Department will do everything possible <Col N="1350" /> to assist producers in this matter and I am hopeful that impending EEC regulations will also be helpful in this respect.</P>

      <P>That organisation is under discussion and we will deal with it when the time arises.  Contrary to what has been said on the other side of the House, there is no question of a cut-back in the provisions for education and advice.  In fact, there is an increase in expenditure on these services.  Between the funds provided directly in the main Estimate and in the Supplementary Estimate, the county rates contributions and balances accruing to ACOT from county committee funds, the total this year is well up on 1979 &mdash; £15.2 million as compared with £21.7 million.  Because of the fact that the transfer of functions to ACOT took place during the year there are a number of savings and deficiencies on various subheads but these are offset in funds made available under subhead B.7 and otherwise.  This situation applies in the current year only and, as I said earlier, all ACOT expenditure will be covered in one subhead in future.  However, I want to be quite clear on this year's position.  Total expenditure on education, advice and training, is well up on 1979 and there is no question of a cut-back.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bermingham raised the question of imports of feed from abroad which are affecting the market for Community cereals.  I fully agree with his opposition to the imports of third country feed products such as manioc, and I have repeatedly criticised such imports in the discussions in the Council of Ministers.  At a recent meeting of the Council Commissioner Gundelach outlined the results of discussions he had had in Thailand which will bring about a reduction in supplies of manioc from that country, which is the main source of supply to the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have covered a number of the points <Col N="1351" /> which were raised in the debate.  I readily admit that the agricultural industry has been passing through a very difficult time but the industry is basically sound and the huge investment in it, especially during the past five or six years, puts it in a position where it is better able to cope with the current problems and will be able to expand again as soon as conditions improve.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1980. - Veterinary Inspection Fees: Motion:</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft: Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 (Part II) (No. 7) Regulations, 1980, and Agricultural Product (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporters' Licenses) (Fees) Regulations, 1980 copies of which were laid in draft before the Dáil on the 11th day of December, 1980.</P>
      <P>The effect of the regulations would be to reduce to a nominal amount the fees payable in respect of pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts. I would hope, with the approval of the House, to have the remission of these fees in operation as from 1 January 1981. In a full year the total remission comes to £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this remission is to afford relief to the Pigmeat Industry for a period of two years, that is for the years 1981 and 1982, to help overcome the serious difficulties being experienced by the sector at present.  The chief contributing <Col N="1352" /> factor to these difficulties has been the depressed state of the pigmeat market throughout the Community during the past year.  The UK Bacon Market, our chief export outlet, has been weak. Confidence in the industry has also been adversely affected by uncertainty about marketing arrangements.  As the House is aware, the industry has engaged a good deal of my attention over recent months and I have had several meetings with the various interests to consider ways of helping the industry over its current difficulties.</P>
    <P>At the most recent of these meetings, which took place last Thursday, 11 December, I was very glad indeed to have confirmation from representatives of the bacon curers and the pig producers that they all have agreed among themselves, and I emphasise all, on measures to improve the centralised marketing of pigmeat. In short, we now have a unified approach by all concerned.  I feel certain that this remission of fees which I propose will provide the necessary stimulus to the pigmeat industry to establish itself on a surer footing for the longer term.</P>
    <P>A unified approach is vital if exports are to be maintained, not to mention increased, and if we are to compete effectively with possible imports.  A fall in exports would mean a drop in throughput in the factories and a consequent threat to jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the temporary remission of veterinary fees, the Government have decided to provide a grant of £200,000 per year over the next two years to the Pigs and Bacon Commission, to enable the commission to increase its work in the promotion of pigmeat.  This work will be a very important part of the ongoing work of improving the industry.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention that I hope to be in a position very soon to introduce legislation to extend the statutory levy to all pigs slaughtered for pork, including slaughterings for the home trade.  This levy is the administrative levy at present payable to the Pigs and Bacon Commission on bacon pigs.  The extending of the levy to pork pigs will, I believe, lead to a more comprehensive and co-ordinated approach within the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> I hope Deputies on all sides of the House will support the proposed regulations which are now before the House in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely concerned about the threat to the home bacon and pork market from potential imports of Danish bacon.  I do not think we are adequately prepared to meet the threat which now, as a result of our membership of the EEC, is very real.</P>
      <P>There are two areas in which action must be taken if we are to hold our home market, because it is important to recognise in the case of the Irish pig industry that the home market is very important. It is far more important in the case of the pig industry than it is, relatively speaking, in the case of the beef or milk industries. We run a serious risk of massive penetration of our market by Danish bacon unless we take immediate action to discourage such imports, because once they become established it will be impossible to get them out.  They will have made an investment and will not want to leave. They will want a return from that investment. We must take action now, before they move into our market, to show we are determined to hold on to it.  We may, by resolute action, scare them off and they may not come in at all.  I am not satisfied that the Minister is tackling the problem in the manner in which it should be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their 1977 election manifesto the Government made a very specific and clear promise to establish a domestic marketing council for the promotion of Irish food on the home market.  That specific promise has not been kept.  If it had been it would have provided a very useful means to promote Irish food on the home market, in particular Irish pigmeat. We have to look at the quality standards of Irish bacon, because Danish bacon has attained a justly high reputation for quality, and there have been recent suggestions of undesirable practices being used, such as pumping excess levels of brine into bacon, thereby selling more salt than bacon.  I am not satisfied that the system of inspection in the factories is sufficiently rigorous to prevent <Col N="1354" /> this happening.  I would like the Minister to tell the House the number of prosecutions that have been instituted for practices of this nature which are not in line with the law as it stands in relation to consumer protection.  I would also like to know the frequency with which each factory is inspected.  Is every carcase inspected?  Is the brine content of each carcase inspected each time, or is it purely a spot-check operation?</P>
    <P>I would like to know the position that obtains in relation to standards at slaughtering premises killing solely for the home market.  I understand there are numerous rules relating to what may be done at export premises, but such rules and the consequent right of inspection to ensure that they are enforced do not apply to small butchering premises which are sending meat only to the home market.</P>
    <P>If people buy bad home-produced bacon which has come from a premises which is not subject to law, that is sufficient to blacken the name of Irish bacon, particularly if there is an alternative Danish product on the shelf.  Does the Minister intend to ensure that there is an adequate service and just as rigorous an application of the regulations to home slaughtering premises as well as to those licensed for export under the relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give his view of the future of the pig industry.  As he is aware, in 1980 there was a bad harvest all over the world and this meant a considerable shortage of feed. Obviously the pig industry depends for its profitability on the price of feed.  The use of concentrated feed is far higher per pound of meat produced in the pig industry than in the beef industry.  A moderate change in feed prices can have a dramatic effect on the pig industry.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.  Is there a section in the Department analysing trends in world feed prices to see what impact they will have on the economics of the pig industry?  Will the Pigs and Bacon Commission spend some of the money being allocated for promotion on the Irish market or will this be devoted solely to the export market?  It is very <Col N="1355" /> important that some of this money should be spent on the Irish market.</P>
    <P>What are the arrangements for the long-term financing of the commission? Are any changes envisaged in their powers? Does the Minister intend extending their powers to make them similar to those given to CBF under recent legislation? Will they be allowed enter into actual marketing arrangements?  I know the Minister will introduce legislation relating to levies, but how may the commission use these levies?</P>
    <P>This is a time of great worry in the pig industry for two reasons, first, the threat of imports and, second, the failure of the Government, as perceived not just by myself but by many people in the pig industry, to adequately enforce quality regulations so that the producer who sends a good pig into the factory can be assured it will be properly processed and sold to the consumer.  If that does not happen it is the producer who will lose, because he is not in a sufficiently strong marketing position to ensure that the failings of the processor are not passed back to him in lower prices.</P>
    <P>These were a few points I wanted to make, but obviously I welcome this proposal.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for his contribution.  I share his concern about the threat of imports.  The best and only solution to any such threats is to have available a good home product at a competitive price.  Irish bacon producers and curers have the means to put such an Irish product on the market and, as long as they are doing that and continue to do it, they need not worry too much about the threat of imports.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned about the substantial and increasing dependence of Irish industrial development, employment and economic growth on foreign and multi-national capital, and about the implications of such trends for the future:</P>
      <P>calls on the Government immediately to ascertain and publish details of the extent to which our industrial base and employment is dependent on foreign and multi-national capital;</P>
      <P>&mdash;asks the Government now to review the policies of the Industrial Development Authority in relation to over reliance on foreign and multi-national capital; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;agrees on the need for the establishment of a National Development Corporation with legislative and <Col N="1358" /> financial bases adequate to enable it to launch an industrial development programme based on Irish resources and utilising the most advanced technologies under Irish control.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Labour Party have tabled this motion because we clearly wish to see our rate of growth in industrial development accelerate in the coming decade.  There are now some 130,000 adults unemployed including those who are on short time and school-leavers not on the live register.  Indeed, when one considers this motion one must bear in mind that there are some 90,000 persons unemployed in Northern Ireland.  That means there are close on a quarter of a million adults now without work on this island as a whole.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing those responsible for the development of enterprises in Ireland therefore is immense.  The Labour Party believe in a mixed economy based on strong and efficient public and private sectors supplemented by a dynamic cooperative sector.  I believe these sectors are complementary to one another in the process of economic growth.  All of these sectors must contribute to economic growth to a far greater degree than they do at present if we are to have any prospect of full employment and stopping the resumption of emigration.  A growth rate of 1 per cent for 1980 and 1½ per cent for 1981 is a policy no politician can endorse. We must act now to reverse this prospect. I would point out that we are now in the legislative process of spending an additional £464 million of borrowed Supplementary Estimates just to keep the ship of State afloat this year alone.  The prospect of increases in employment arising from these Supplementary Estimates looks very bleak.  Moneys which should have gone towards industrial development have been frittered away in popular political consumption.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to employment in this motion.  I wish to deal with that very briefly because I want to get on to the issue contained in the motion itself.  Some years ago the then NIEC estimated that a national growth rate of at least 5½ per cent would be required in the seventies. There is no doubt now that, with our <Col N="1359" /> much increased population, a growth rate of 6½ per cent at least will be required for the eighties.  This would involve a massive expansion of our industrial sector. Clearly this is the area to which we must look for any prospect of significant increases in employment.  Therefore every possible structural and innovative policy measure must be tried and adopted, if it is proved successful, to ensure this increase in employment. Even now all the indications are that, despite the relatively optimistic assumptions contained in the national understanding for the manufacturing sector, there will be net job losses of some 2,000 this year instead of the projected 7,000 job increases.  Indeed I would point out that in the recent Report of the NESC, Report No. 53, they state that the prospects are that total employment will decline between mid-April 1980 and mid-April 1981 by approximately 4,000. Coupled with a projected increase in the labour force of approximately 10,000 that would imply an increase of 14,000 in unemployment.  Therefore the prospect could not be more grim.  I would make the point that those who were quite hysterical about the situation in 1976-77 seem to be as mute as mice today.  One might even ask: whatever has happened to the Construction Industry Federation?  For example, whatever has happened to the former Brother Vivian Cassels who spoke about unemployment so frequently amongst young people?</P>

      <P>There is not a peep to be heard today.  If I may deal with the issue of reliance on foreign investment, there appears to be a growing volume of evidence in support of the contention that there is an over-reliance on the decisions of foreign multinationals to advance our industrial development.  Of course foreign investment is a key ingredient in the mix of any development strategy.  There is no way I would deny that.  But, like any cake, if one ingredient unduly dominates the mix, then the cake is no longer edible.  Therefore exclusive reliance on <Col N="1360" /> the market and investment strategies of the major multinationals creates a dangerous imbalance in our national programme of industrial development.  One must question if it is in our long-term interest that the growth sectors of our economy should be so dependent on decisions made abroad.  One must stress that the investment policies of such companies, based as they largely are on export tax concessions and the benefits of the system of transfer pricing arrangements of their Irish subsidiaries, are extremely volatile.  In the words of an ICTU discussion document way back in 1972, there is a danger of excessive dependence on foreign enterprise in the development of new industries, and external control of large sections of industry yields too many Irish hostages to foreign fortunes.  I make these comments in fairly strong terms because I do not have any blinkered ideological hostility towards the many foreign entrepreneurs who have contributed towards Irish industrial development.</P>
      <P>I have always been restrained and, I hope, constructive in my approach to this issue.  There is a clear role for enterprise in Ireland.  I have always been extremely sensitive to the promotional role of the IDA.  There is far too little discussion on the overall strategy to be followed which is the responsibility of the Government. I would submit there must be a countervailing industrial force under Irish control. It is the function of the State and its principal agency in this area, the IDA, to use a substantial proportion of our resources to redress the balance.</P>
      <P>Of particular concern has been the substantial relative decline in the domestic industrial sector in the past two decades. In his paper to the Dublin Economics Workshop last October, Eoin O'Malley, of the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex, summarised the present position rather well.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most striking feature of the performance of these industries over the past two decades, taking the period as a whole, is the failure to make any <Col N="1361" /> contribution to employment growth. By 1976 they actually employed 3,000 fewer people than in 1960.  Although their employment probably increased by about 4,000 from 1976 to 1979, presumably some, if not all, of this gain has been wiped out in the present recession.  Consequently we can be reasonably sure that Irish domestic industry today employs very few more, and possibly less workers than it did twenty years ago.</P>
    <P>A major goal of the policies introduced in the late 1950's and sustained ever since was to increase the export orientation of industry.  As the table shows, the proportion of domestic industry's output going for export did increase, but the increase has been small &mdash; from 19 per cent in 1960 to 25 per cent in 1976.  Furthermore, virtually the whole of this increase was accounted for by only two sectors, Food and Textiles, while the rest showed scarcely any change in their export orientation.  These were strong words.  His comments are quite perceptive.</P>
    <P>  Mr. O'Malley went on to say:</P>
    <P>At any rate, the overall increase must be regarded as a disappointing response to the opportunities afforded by the introduction of export profits tax relief and the free access gained to much larger markets by EEC membership and (to a lesser extent) the Anglo Irish Free Trade Agreement.  This point is underlined by the fact that the exports of domestic industry actually grew more slowly than the manufactured imports of our main trading partners, so that this export performance represents, in fact, a declining share of growing markets.</P>
    <P>That analysis is of great importance to the future of Irish Industry and it has to be compared with the role of foreign companies established here.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out that many foreign companies have benefited enormously over the years from our system of incentives.  Our corporate tax system over the years has become increasingly <Col N="1362" /> incentive-oriented, and ranges from complete exemption of export profits to 100 per cent first year write-off of the main costs of any industrial investment.  Our most recent change has been the introduction of a new, specially low, 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to apply to all manufacturing industry as form 1 January 1981.  Needless to say, firms that already enjoy tax exemption on export profits will continue to do so until 1990. The new 10 per cent manufacturing tax regime will continue until the end of this century, this assuring that stable fiscal environment which is so crucial for the growth of investment.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party would certainly favour the continuation of these incentives but, side by side, we would endeavour to build up, with a parallel system of incentives, the influence of native Irish industrial output.  This is not a crude chauvinistic or nationalistic aspiration but rather an essential safeguard in the national interest.  There must be a domestic counter influence to the situation described in page 6 of the major IDA document for foreign investors.  It is headed &ldquo;The Irish Miracle&rdquo; and says:</P>
    <P>Ireland maintains a completely open approach to foreign investment.  There is no obligation on foreign subsidiaries to take an Irish partner; profits and capital can be freely transferred abroad, and there are no withholding taxes.</P>
    <P>There should be a counter-balancing approach to that open-ended approach.</P>
    <P>Since 1960 more than 700 new manufacturing operations owned by companies abroad have located in the Republic mainly to obtain tariff free access to EEC markets.  The value of their exports is the equivalent of some 50 per cent of GNP, one of the highest such ratios in the world.  Therefore there is a need for a critical but constructive examination on our part of the implications of the situation.</P>
    <P>I now come to the dominant role of American investment in this development. The United States has been the most important source of overseas investment in Irish manufacturing industry.  US <Col N="1363" /> firms approved for grant-aid by the IDA up to the end of June 1980 represent a total investment in fixed assets of £1,124.9 million, which is over half of all overseas investment.  New US projects, including expansions by American plants already in production in Ireland, were at one stage this year being approved by the IDA at the rate of almost one per week. The reasons for this success, as stated by the Minister for Finance, includes our proximity and free access to the EEC market; an environment here that encourages and favours private investment, a consistent Government policy of encouraging investment from abroad; availability of English-speaking labour and so far we have maintained competitive production costs and financial incentives.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, told the US Chamber of Commerce in Ireland that:</P>
    <P>It is particularly important and encouraging to note that US plants in Ireland are the most profitable American subsidiaries abroad.  Your Department of Commerce data show that US affiliates in Ireland earned a 29.9 per cent average annual return on investment between 1974 and 1978, the highest in the world.  The average for the EEC was 14.2 per cent, while world-wide it was 12.9 per cent.  Over the same period the stock of US investment increased by 33 per cent annually in Ireland, compared with 11.7 per cent in the EEC and 10.8 per cent throughout the world.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my main point of concern in relation to US investment, namely, that any shift in US Government policy relative to US investment abroad should give these companies concerned a bad cold but could give Ireland a fatal bout of pneumonia.  Mr. Ronald Reagan may be an apostle of free enterprise but anything I have seen or read of the incoming President does not give me much optimism about his concern for US overseas investment.  Rather does the thrust of his pronouncements to date seem to <Col N="1364" /> favour a regression towards internal expansion of the US domestic industrial base.  This issue is of considerable concern because 90 per cent of approved US investment in Ireland by the IDA has come since 1973.  Hence there is a serious need again to ensure that our industrial development strategy does not confine all its eggs to the one basket.  The Labour Party favour a balanced strategy rather than a Fianna Fáil policy of any plant, any jobs, put them anywhere and get them from anywhere, it is employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress our approach to public sector enterprise because in a fair, reasonable and democratic way it would be a countervailing influence against domination by foreign industrialists in the Irish economy.  Our party have for long advocated a substantially enlarged role for public sector enterprise in the achievement of full employment here. This policy is not based on an uncritical attachment to abstract political ideas and ideals.  Its relevance to present circumstances derives from a realisation that an excessive preoccupation with the development of private sector enterprise in the past has utterly failed to meet the employment requirements of our people. If out of conservatism or as a result of pressure from vested interests we adhere exclusively to such an approach in the future, full employment will cease to be a realisable target and will continue to be a pipe dream.</P>
    <P>I regret to record that successive Irish Governments have constrained public sector enterprises and have rarely allowed them to make their full potential contribution to Irish economic life.  In spite of the constraints imposed, many of our State companies have shown imagination and initiative in discharging their statutory role.  Public debate on State enterprises, and their performance, almost invariably converges on those State enterprises which operate or have operated in deficit situations.  The reality is that many of the companies in this position are by statute required, and rightly required, to be responsive to social as well as commercial considerations to which, in most cases, the deficit can be attributed.  I make this point <Col N="1365" /> because, in particular, as a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I have demanded of the State sector the highest level of operational performance from such companies in the national interest and to prove that public enterprise can and does work.  A selective pre-occupation with companies in this situation ignores the important contribution which public sector enterprises have made and can make in the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that about 100,000 persons are now employed in the 20 main trading public enterprises in the Republic and many of these are making major contributions to employment and to the development of the economy.  Such enterprises as Aer Lingus, Irish Shipping, Bord na Móna, and the Electricity Supply Board have outstanding records not just in satisfying their mimimum statutory obligations, but in extending their activities and employment into wider fields of enterprise.  When it is recognised that the six public enterprises in the manufacturing sector employ only 6,000 persons or 3 per cent of all employment in manufacturing industry, the scope for the development of this sector can be seen to be immense.  Therefore, there is a strong case for the development of public sector enterprise here.  We have only started slowly on the road and we have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>In this motion the Labour Party reiterate the concept of a National Development Corporation.  Since the early sixties there have been many versions of this approach floating around the body politic. We now have the Enterprise Agency of the national understanding and the mark III version of the consortium launched three years ago by Fianna Fáil now has a new coat and is called an investment plan for the eighties.  It looks like a general election gimmick by the Fianna Fáil Party and will probably be unveiled at the time of the Ard-Fheis.  I am not cynical about this concept although I have seen it become such a political football that I could be excused if I was.</P>
    <P>I submit that it is high time that a NDC was established which would adopt, <Col N="1366" /> supervise and stimulate investment programmes for the State-sponsored sector. The current work of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies has underlined this great need.  The NDC would have a clear role in proposing measures to rationalise the State manufacturing and services sectors which are not domestic monoplies, for example, the role of An Bord Gáis <i>versus</i> the ESB.  That kind of involvement in policy decisions could be a useful innovation.  The NDC could plan for the establishment of new State industries and insure that we avoid such major disasters as Arklow Gypsum, £10 million irrecoverable or NET, £80 million plus losses.  The NDC could supervise the State shareholdings in the private sector, whether in companies such as Asahi or in other major private sector investments. It would also supervise State shareholdings in the natural resources sector, such as mining.  It appears that there is 40 per cent more gas off Kinsale Head than first estimated and it seems likely from available information that by the mid-eighties we should find oil.  I have no doubt that there are additional mineral resources within the confines of our national boundaries or off our Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>The State has a clear obligation to ensure that the development of these resources does not enrich just a few persons, whether they be Irish or from abroad.  There is a role for private sector development, both native and foreign, in the exploitation of these resources but our State agencies such as the NDC, as we have advocated, should have the determining role and influence in the strategy relating to that kind of development.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made in this country for State participation in the new technological industries, particularly in the area of micro-technology.  They are the growth areas of the future.  It is all very well to say that 14,000 persons in Ireland are now in employment in these companies.  We know the volatile, explosive rate of decelleration of that technology and overnight these companies, having different markets and different prospects, could transfer their plant out of this country, leaving behind 5,000, <Col N="1367" /> 6,000, 8,000 or 14,000 Irish workers unemployed.  We must do what the Japanese do.  When the technology comes in we must adapt it, innovate on it, purchase it, develop our own native base out of it and we will have a secure hold on technology rather than being very dependent on imported technology for these industries and having no real influence or control over it.</P>
    <P>The role of the NDC also should be quite clear in the exploitation of our mineral resources.  It is a national scandal that for several years now we have been one of the largest suppliers of mineral ore to Europe.  We have been exporting a finite asset to Europe and we have been using none of it in the context of local industry.  I recall that prior to the last general election very many assurances were given by this Government party that that situation would be terminated and we would have a more positive and definite use of our mineral resources, yet it has not happened.</P>
    <P>Many people in the IDA would be rather concerned about the role of the NDC <i>vis-à-vis</i> the IDA.  It might be that they are being subsumed or taken over or that some new bureaucratic industrial monolith in the Irish scene is going to emerge in yet another office block in Merrion Square and they will all be out of employment.  This need not happen. The IDA are established.  I pointed out in this House that my own party, the Labour Party, were largely instrumental in ensuring that the IDA were set up. There was terrible opposition at the time but the late Deputy Norton, the late Liam Duffy and a few others, to their credit, did establish the IDA.  Therefore, the IDA have nothing at all to fear from us. It is of vital importance that there be no duplication in that area.  I have met many of the staff involved in the State sectors, many of them of outstanding expertise, but the resource is spread farely thinly. Therefore, I would not favour any multiplicity of organisations in that area.</P>
    <P>There are some other areas where the NDC could become involved.  I was listening earlier today to the Minister for Agriculture and we have a situation <Col N="1368" /> regarding the promotion of Irish food products to Europe.  It is outrageous, disgraceful that now we are exporting massive amounts of food products at little or no added value.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has stated recently:</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to note that the food sector, which is one of the largest providers of employment in the Irish economy, takes up less than 5 per cent of the IDA's total research and development fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to one commodity alone, cheese production.  He said, &ldquo;Between 1975 and 1978 our cheese production fell from 57,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes.  This decrease must be seen in the context of the EEC where total cheese production increased by 11 per cent in the same period.&rdquo;  That is the kind of area where we have failed manifestly to develop our own natural Irish-based native, domestic, entrepreneurial skill. There is reason for a review in that regard.</P>
    <P>I conclude by quoting once again from the paper which I commend Members to read, that by Eoin O'Malley on that workshop in Dublin last October when he stated in respect of the policy conclusions&mdash;and I do not think that anybody can put it better than he did in this regard&mdash;&ldquo;Present policy relies mainly on private enterprise, the short-term profit motive and free market forces assisted by State efforts which, although quite substantial, concentrate mainly on servicing the needs of industry through grants, tax concessions, advice and the provision of infrastructural facilities, but the task of long-term domestic industrial development in a late-industrialising economy requires primarily that free market forces should be resisted and that the profit motive should not be trusted as a guide. If protection is no longer a realistic option for us, which is probably the case, then the need for a much more active interventionist policy is all the greater&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The main elements of such interventionist policies, especially in a small <Col N="1369" /> economy such as Ireland's, would be to tackle the problems of economies of scale and the external economies by promoting strongly the formation of larger enterprises in a more highly specialised and more highly integrated industrial structure.  These bodies would tackle the marketing problems through more intensive and centralised use of State marketing organisations and they would tackle the problems of finance by exerting greater State control on Irish financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I share his views in that regard.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to criticise our motion because one will always be accused of being opposed to investment and foreign companies coming in here.  I have no doubt that we will be classified as idealogical gurus with nothing to do but yell about foreign enterprise in Ireland.  I hope that the debate will be a little more constructive than that.  It is time to have a balanced industrial strategy in this country which we do not have at present and the lack of which could cause grave concern for the future of our economy. In that context I urge our motion.</P>
    <P>I have already explained to the Minister and my colleague, Deputy O'Toole, that I have another commitment with Deputy O'Kennedy in RTE at 10.00 p.m. and I am not in a position to stay.  I regret it very much and I appeal to you, Sir, to excuse my absence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the industrial development strategy being pursued by the Government and its Agencies and notes with approval that the Government has already announced the carrying out of a fundamental review of industrial development policy by the National Economic and Social Council which review commenced early in 1980.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are justly proud of the achievements over the years of the <Col N="1370" /> IDA.  Their approach to job creation and securing of new industries is most professional. They discharged their tasks within a planning framework which takes account firstly of our manufacturing job needs on both a national and regional basis, and secondly of what can realistically be achieved to harden endeavour and intensify promotion.</P>
    <P>The central target in the IDA's Industrial Plan 1978-1982 is the creation of 75,000 new grant-aided manufacturing jobs during the plan period.  This will require the negotiation of projects with an ultimate job potential of nearly 150,000.  The Authority plan to secure more than half of these jobs from industry within Ireland, principally by established Irish industry and including the expansion of existing overseas firms here. The IDA's strategy envisages that the balance of the jobs will have to be provided by foreign industry.  Because of the size of the target, there is no realistic alternative, in the medium-term at least.</P>
    <P>Without mobile overseas investment there would be no prospect of achieving the industrial development targets in the regions, particularly the less-developed regions.  The native industrial base is weak in these regions and Irish firms generally expand at, or near to, their existing locations.  Accordingly, the overseas promotion campaign has to be integrated closely with the ambitious regional targets set in the plan.  The rapid expansion in manufacturing employment in the less developed regions is largely attributable to the introduction of new overseas industry.  This will in turn lead to spin-off in small and medium-sized domestic firms to supply materials, components and services.</P>
    <P>The job potential of natural resource based industries is fully examined in the plan.  However, natural resource based industries tend to have very high capital intensity, long lead times and difficulties in marketing products.  The plan aims to maximise the job potential of natural resource based industries but recognises that the contribution will be small in relation to overall job needs.</P>
    <P>Small indigenous industry is one of the main focusses of the IDA plan and there <Col N="1371" /> is now an intensive nationwide campaign in progress which includes the participation of Shannon Development in the mid-west region and the areas of west and south-west Offaly.  These agencies operate a generous and flexible scheme of incentives for small industries and first-time entrepreneurs because of the national importance of fostering native enterprise.</P>
    <P>Complementary to the special mandate given to the Shannon Development Company in 1978 the IDA in November 1979 launched a promotional campaign to encourage new small industry investment on a trial basis in County Galway under the small industries programme. The results were very encouraging.  Fifteen new firms are expected to come into existence as a result of contacts initiated. The campaign was extended to the rest of the country in 1980.  In 22 more counties IDA personnel visited towns and held day long clinics and evening discussions where people interested in setting up their own businesses discussed their ideas and learned about the incentives and advisory services available to them. The campaign met with an overwhelming response from nearly 4,000 callers, over 1,400 at the day clinics and more than 2,500 at the evening presentations held in 104 towns.  Over 300 possible new projects were identified as a result and preliminary indications are that these could at minimum translate into 2,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>Trade promotions were also held in Dublin to give information on the opportunities for new industry.  These have resulted in contact being made with over 100 likely new ventures which are now expected to commence business within one year and create over 500 jobs when they are fully operational.  This represents another initiative by the IDA to promote and encourage potential Irish entrepreneurs to go ahead with their projects.</P>
    <P>Spin-off benefit from new overseas industry is an encouraging and growing feature of industrial development in Ireland, and small industry has undoubtedly been a substantial beneficiary.  Over the first four months of 1980 the IDA's project <Col N="1372" /> identification unit carried out a study which identified market opportunities valued at £38 million per annum arising from the needs of manufacturing companies which had set up in Ireland.  Of this total it is estimated that about £16 million worth of products could be manufactured by small industries.  In 1979, a total 110 projects were approved in the metals and engineering sector as a result of opportunities arising from the establishment of large manufacturing industries in Ireland</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that the full range of IDA incentives is equally available to Irish and overseas companies.  There is a popular misconception that the IDA in some way favours the foreign investor.  This most emphatically is not the case.  The incentives and services of the State agencies are fully available to Irish industry and, indeed, the facilities for small industries &mdash; which are almost invariably Irish-aimed &mdash; are far more generous than those offered to any large multinational.</P>
    <P>The new 10 per cent scheme operative for 20 years from 1 January 1981 which will apply to earnings from both home and export sales, will represent a tremendous boost to the Irish sector and represents a unique opportunity to expand and develop our indigenous industrial base. The IDA's and SFADCo's advance factory programmes are designed to cater specifically for the needs of the small indigenous entrepreneur through the provided cluster units.</P>
    <P>In their efforts to encourage medium and large Irish firms to expand, the IDA provide grants of one-third towards the cost of work within the firm on investigation and refining proposals which lead to new product ideas, new investments or research and development.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable in certain quarters to be critical of multinational corporations without at the same time presenting any firm evidence of grounds for criticism. Ireland has benefited greatly from investment by multinationals in this country.  This investment has been a vital factor in attaining national and regional job creation targets.  Apart from direct employment in the industries concerned, <Col N="1373" /> the establishment of multinational companies in Ireland has generated a continuous high level of activity in the construction and allied industries and has equally benefited many other commercial activities in the country.  The industries have brought a wide range of completely new technologies to Ireland and have created a substantial demand for technical and professional staff, thereby providing highly-paid work opportunities for graduates from our universities and technical institutions.</P>
    <P>New technology is crucially important to the development of the Irish economy. The advanced types of computers and computer systems now coming on sale will result in substantial time saving and increases in productivity.  The utilisation of the new technology will enable Irish industry to become more competitive and the manufacture of advanced technology products here will provide the potential for future expansion in employment.</P>
    <P>Some of the world's leading electronics firms have decided to manufactgure here: Digital, Mostek, Fujitsu, Wang, Varian, Amdahl, Beehive, Prime, Apple &mdash; the list is now very long.  Each of these firms offer high quality employment to a wide range of technicians, engineers and so on.  In the electronics sector alone employment has almost trebled since 1973.</P>
    <P>New technologies introduced to Ireland by overseas companies include those in the fields of electronics, healthcare/pharmaceuticals and mechanical engineering.</P>
    <P>Without the introduction of these technologies by overseas companies, Irish firms could not hope to develop these processes in the same time period on their own.  Multinational companies tend to be totally export orientated and have good access to such markets.  Export growth is essential if the desired level of job creation is to be obtained and access to export markets is vital.  These companies have well developed marketing strategies and expertise which is vital if their subsidiaries in Ireland are to succeed.  There is very clear evidence to show that foreign-owned companies have not only contributed to growth in exports but have been <Col N="1374" /> a major factor in obtaining market diversification.</P>
    <P>This is a good time to refer to matters that are under our own control.  Much has happened that has not been conducive to the setting up of industries.  The world does not owe us a living.  We must provide job opportunities for our young population.  We are unique in Europe in that 50 per cent of the population are less than 25 years and approximately 1.1 million of the population are less than 16 years.  It is our duty to ensure that as many jobs as possible are created for those young people.  Constraints on our industrial development are, to a large extent, the result of our own actions.  We have many clean industries that are vitally needed in rural areas but many of the industrialists are frustrated by frivolous or vexatious objections.  The IDA are committed to providing industries in urban and rural areas.  I do not agree that our environment should be ruined by pollution or that we should encourage &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; industries here, but in my political life I have noted that many people do not seem to care about jobs for others so long as they are employed themselves. Politicians should condemn such an attitude. Some wellheeled citizens approach their public representatives and try to twist their arm to ensure that industry is not brought into their locality.</P>
    <P>Most local authorities prepare county development plans and they earmark areas for development of industry, housing, agriculture and so on.  However, these plans are not sacrosanct.  Often it transpires that the areas set aside for industrial development are not suitable for that purpose.  Local authorities should discuss all matters with the IDA before they draw up their county development plans.  For instance, the area set aside for industrial development may be near a hospital and naturally objections will be raised.</P>
    <P>Local authorities spend a considerable amount of money on providing water and sewerage services and on other development work but in some cases they impose what is known as a development charge per acre and this means the land is very expensive.  Sometimes the charge may be <Col N="1375" /> as much as £2,000 or £3,000 per acre.  We must remain competitive in our efforts to attract foreign industrialists to set up industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond in his speech referred to employment.  In the United Kingdom there are one million fewer people employed in industry now than was the case ten years ago.  They have a rather different population structure in that they have not the young population we have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have more young people and this makes the situation more difficult to some extent.  Our population is scattered throughout the country but in the United Kingdom their population is concentrated in large centres and this makes it easier to pay for services and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say they were a problem.  The IDA are willing to discuss matters with local authorities.  I should not like Deputy Desmond to think that the public sector will be excluded in any job creation plans.  When the IDA go to a rural area to investigate the possibility of setting up an industry, some local people increase the price of land quite considerably. The IDA are trying to level out the price of land.  It must be realised that the cost of servicing land varies considerably. I should like local authorities to take steps not to charge the IDA the full development costs at once.  Areas should be developed as industries move in.  It is only right that industries should pay development charges when they move into an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to a practice that has existed during the tenure of successive Governments, that is, the announcing in advance by some public representatives as well as by some private individuals, of the establishment of factories <Col N="1376" /> in their areas.  A great deal of damage can be done in this way.  Consequently, everything should be signed, sealed and delivered before anyone announces the establishment of a factory. Any foreign or native industrialist establishing a factory here will not want to hear the announcement from a local person. This responsibility should be left to the people who are putting up the money &mdash; the industrialists concerned and the IDA.</P>

      <P>We could talk about many different ways of improving the employment situation.  It is very sad, for instance, that we import so much agricultural produce.  At this Christmas time I appeal to our people to buy Irish.  Perhaps if they once began buying Irish they would continue to do so.  They should think of the fine Irish produce that is available.  We must encourage our people also to eat Irish, to buy more of our own agricultural produce and, finally, we should encourage them to spend their holidays at home.  All of these appeals relate to employment because if they are heeded the extra money spent at home will create more employment.  It is sad that many of our people are able to discuss the far-away places they have visited though they have not been to many places in Ireland.  It is reasonable to expect that our young people would want to travel abroad but they should be encouraged to see Ireland first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism will contribute to the debate <Col N="1377" /> tomorrow evening and I am sure that he will expand on the many points raised by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody would disagree with me when I say that the IDA are bending over backwards to help indigenous industries to develop and to help anyone who has any plan that might lead to the provision of jobs.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Government, the NESC have retained consultants to undertake a detailed investigation of our industrial development policies.  I am confident that this timely review will signpost the way for the Government in forming appropriate policies for the challenging years ahead.  In addition the Government have a commitment within the terms of the national understanding to bring into being a national enterprise agency in the very near future.  While there may be disagreement among us in many respects, there is an onus on each and every one of us to play his part in ensuring that as many jobs as possible are created at home.</P>

      <P>When my colleague, Deputy L'Estrange, came into the House he inquired if there was a wake in progress, having regard to the low key of the Minister's contribution.  Indeed, the Minister's contribution was very low key and he might be regarded as having presided over the obsequies of 115,000 jobs.  He gave us a long detailed dissertation on the work of the IDA.  The motion to which the Minister was speaking reads that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" />&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the industrial development strategy being pursued by the Government and its Agencies and notes with approval that the Government has already announced the carrying out of a fundamental review of industrial development policy by the National Economic and Social Council which review commenced early in 1980.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the second section of that amendment regarding the review that the NESC have been asked to commence but I object to the fact that the Minister of State should have seen fit to give us the long dissertation on the activities of the IDA while speaking to a motion dealing with the industrial strategy being undertaken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Regarding the IDA I must put my views briefly on the record.  I am privileged to belong to the party that established the IDA 30 years ago.  At that time, despite the fact that the functions of the authority were outlined, Fianna Fáil described the establishment of the IDA as a typical Fine Gael idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were in power 40 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Their comment was not intended to be in the sense that one might expect.  It was intended to be in the most cynical and destructive sense.  However, not long afterwards, that same party on realising how well the authority were working and realising how indispensable they had become, admitted that there had been very good sense in setting up the IDA.  Nobody on this side of the House has ever criticised the IDA and I hope that they never will criticise them. The IDA are doing a first-class job.  They have done a first-class job down through the years regardless of which party were in power.  The authority continue to carry out their functions as a promotional agency for the encouragement and establishment of industry, both for the inducement of mobile investment from abroad and for native industrial projects.  Therefore, the Minister could have spared us that long dissertation on the IDA. <Col N="1379" /> Instead, we might have expected from him some positive, imaginative and innovative thinking on how to come to grips with the enormous problem with which we must deal.  I refer to the 50,000 jobs that are being lost now.</P>
      <P>The IDA have done their work in fulfilling their job creation target for this year and yet 28,000 jobs have been lost. On top of that, we have a situation where over 8,000 people are on systematic short time.  Yet the Minister did not advert to the fact that this was so and did not give any positive suggestions as to how this enormous problem could be tackled. The most damaging aspect of all this is that with the enormous job losses that have occurred this year there is an inbuilt figure which indicates that the increase in unemployment in the case of people under 25 is 45 per cent.  This is the sector over which crocodile tears are shed.  The Taoiseach said at his first Ard Fheis as Taoiseach, that he did not regard the increased youth population as a problem but as a challenge.  A year later that challenge is becoming a problem of major dimensions which the Government seem unable or unwilling to tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this debate commenced the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, gave us the benefit of his wisdom in relation to an industry which is on the floor at the moment.  At the end of his speech the average farmer could have hope of no great improvement.  The Minister was right in saying that we have a very young and increasing population. To add further to our problems in relation to providing jobs for them we will note the breakdown of the incidence of those engaged in agricultural pursuits.  In 1960 413,000 people, or 37 per cent of the labour force were engaged in agriculture but in 1978 there were only 220,000 or 20.6 per cent of the labour force engaged in agriculture.  The people who would have been engaged in agriculture had it expanded sufficiently, have gone to Leeds, Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and so on.  About 20.6 per cent of our workforce are engaged in agriculture as compared with 2.7 per cent <Col N="1380" /> in the UK, 6.8 per cent in West Germany, 15.9 per cent in Italy, and 9.4 per cent in France.  We have the task of providing work for those people in the industrial sector and in the services sector.  The enormity of this task did not seem to cause any problems three years ago when the present Government were seeking votes and the people were told that tens of thousands of jobs could be created through the development of our natural resources.  The manifesto now makes sad reading particularly for those on the dole queues.</P>
    <P>I will give Fianna Fáil credit for putting their promises on paper but regrettably they stayed on paper.  A target of 5,000 jobs in 1977 was reached because of the economic climate and the state of the economy when Fianna Fáil came to office.  In 1978 a job target of 2,000 was almost achieved.  In 1979 a job target of 25,000 showed where the slippage started, when the payment for votes began to work its way down through the economy.  In 1980 a job target of 30,000 was achieved by the IDA in their job creation programme but since this time last year there has been a reduction of 28,000 people in employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a list of factories that are in operation.  Last week I asked the Minister's colleague through a parliamentary question the number of manufacturing businesses which have closed since 1 January 1980 and I have here three foolscap pages of them.  In excess of 68 factories closed and that is apart from the number of factories operating on a two-and three-day week.  Yet there is not a word from the Minister who is endorsing Government policy in relation to industrial development.  One would have expected some positive views, an admission that the problem exists and something to relieve the human tragedy which is now around us in the form of an intolerable level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of import substitution. We had in the manifesto the now infamous transfer of purchases of 3p in the £ which to Irish products was supposed to provide 10,000 jobs.  The Government seem to have thrown discretion <Col N="1381" /> to the winds.  They seem to have lost control of prices and production costs, which causes loss of competitiveness in the export market and they have closed their eyes to the problem of imports. They are giving it lip service but are doing nothing.  At the moment we have the ludicrous situation where we are importing £5,500 million of goods, which comes to £5,000 per person.</P>
    <P>The position here in relation to the multinationals bears examination. Indeed, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism some months ago in the House during a debate on SFADCo said that it was something to which he was at present giving some attention.  We cannot reach a stage where there will be over-dependence on overseas investment. Let me state categorically, on the subject, and not for any ideological reasons, as it is a question of practical application in relation to what is happening at the moment, that if we find ourselves very dependent on foreign investment, we shall be subject to the vicissitudes of economic pressures thousands of miles away.  There was a time when a conflict in Iran, Iraq, the Far East, Latin America or the United States was something about which we read now and again in the newspaper and the effects of which never reached our shore. That day is gone.  The world is now a small place where we are interdependent and where any kind of upset in the balances which keep things going causes ripples right around the globe.  We are subject to the effect of these ripples.</P>
    <P>The reason why I suggest that we should, in so far as we can, look to a more concentrated development of indigenous industry is simply that they would not, to the same extent, be subject to the effect of these ripples.  In 1975, for example, overseas job new approvals comprised 44 per cent of the total; in 1977, 49 per cent; in 1978, 45 per cent, and we are now hovering around 45 to 50 per cent.  This is not too high provided that, parallel with this input through mobile investments from abroad, we develop our own native industries, using imported raw materials or, better still, our own <Col N="1382" /> materials.  I am in full agreement with the Minister that there is room here for development.  There are problems.</P>
    <P>At present, we have four different Departments involved in industrial promotion. We have the Minister's Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism to which the IDA are responsible, the Department of Finance which presides over the activities of the county development team who normally engage in the promotion of small industries, the Department of the Environment in relation to the promotional functions of the local authorities, both through the planning aspect and the forward purchasing of industrial sites and so on to hand over to other agenices when the time comes. We have a further Department, the Department of the Gaeltacht, to which Údarás na Gaeltachta is now responsible. There we have four agencies and in view of the traditional rivalries that can exist between Departments, there could be a dissipation of effort and, indeed, duplication in some cases.  It is time something was done in relation to this.  Could I make a solemn proposal to the Minister?  He is at present one of three Ministers in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism with his colleague, Minister of State Deputy Gallagher and his Minister, Deputy O'Malley.  Would it not be possible to have one Minister of State, either himself or his colleague Deputy Gallagher, solely responsible for the development of our small firm sector?  In addition, a national small business agency should be set up for the administration of all grants and incentives for small industries.  Responsibility could be given to the Minister's Department to co-ordinate the efforts of the agencies now travelling in the same direction but on different tracks.  Many of these tracks never meet, being parallel lines.  The future of our economy and the solution of our enormous unemployment problem lie in that sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking the House to endorse the industrial development strategy. How can we be expected to do that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Chair for being allowed to speak on this matter in the House tonight.  Today, on the outskirts of Tullamore, a large meeting was held by the workers employed in Cappincur Joinery because of the imminent closure of this firm.  The workers are concerned because next Friday a group of those workers are being let go permanently. This firm at one period employed approximately 300 people and are due to close their doors finally on 23 January next.  This is a serious blow to all the workers concerned, the people in the surrounding locality and the town of Tullamore. It will mean a loss now of 83 permanent jobs, 78 men and five women in the Cappincur Joinery.  Job opportunities in this area are very limited and it will be quite a while before those workers can obtain permanent employment.</P>
      <P>This firm was opened originally by the Spollen Brothers in the early sixties in a small way.  It was taken over by the Mclnerney Group and later on by GWI, Collooney. This firm made doors and windows and also roof trusses.  The roof trusses section was transferred to the GWI factory in Collooney.  This factory will close unless immediate action is taken.  The skills of the people employed in this firm, which were built up over the past 20 years, will be lost.  This firm had a small beginning but it was built up into a household name throughout the country. It is a tragedy to see a firm like this closing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers are very critical of the parent firm because of their intention to remove all the machinery and plant and leave nothing except the factory premises for sale.  It is not good enough to allow this to happen.  If the Government are serious and they make a determined effort I believe with the help of the IDA and Fóir Teoranta those jobs could be kept in existence until the firm are taken <Col N="1384" /> over as a going concern.  It is very important to every person employed in this factory that this should be done.  It is also of importance to the people of Tullamore and the surrounding area.  I ask the Minister to do everything possible to see that this factory is taken over as a going concern.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at the general situation in regard to this firm.  Some timber was imported to make the doors and windows in this factory but the vast majority of the raw materials were native.  The cost of imports for this firm was very small.  It is important for the Minister to bear this in mind.  We have not many firms involved in the joinery business.  The two largest are GWI in Collooney and Cappincur Joinery.  There are also some small firms employed in the joinery business who are managing to survive.  It is important that those firms are helped to survive the difficulties we are going through at the moment.  If this is not done we will have to import a lot of those doors and windows.  It would be a tragedy if we had to do this when we have people in the country with the ability to manufacture those items.</P>

      <P>The IDA made projections in regard to jobs in this area and in regard to jobs throughout the country. Between 1973 and 1977 the employment situation remained more or less static in this area.  There was a projected job creation between 1978 and 1982 of 1,800 for Offaly, 1,250 for the Tullamore, Carragh and Edenderry areas and 550 for the Birr, Banagher and Kilcormac areas.  We are now at the end of 1980 and it is obvious that these targets will not be achieved unless positive action is taken by the Government to secure new projects in 1981 and 1982 and unless the Minister takes steps to maintain employment in existing firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offaly has been ignored as regards the decentralisation programme.  This would have been of benefit to many firms.  It is important to ensure that firms are given help and assistance in their hour of need <Col N="1385" /> to get them over the difficult period in which they find themselves.  If not a serious situation will develop.  I hope something will be done quickly about this firm. It is important because of the job opportunities that are there.  Unless something is done the projections made by the IDA will not be maintained.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest firms in Tullamore, Burlington, announced recently that their Irish operation has gone through considerable difficulty.  They stated that while there will be no redundancies in the Tullamore-Longford area there will be natural job wastage.  The IDA were basing their forecasts to some extent on the way Burlington was going.</P>

The Minister will have to take this into account.  I hope they will maintain employment at its existing level. However, according to Burlington's statement they will not be doubling their capacity as had been envisaged.  The work force was to have doubled from 300 to 600.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that these 83 jobs are maintained because if this firm closes and the plant and machinery are taken from it, it will be difficult to set up a similar type industry in the factory premises.  I hope the firm continues as a going concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to maintain industries in Offaly.  A firm closed in Birr recently <Col N="1386" /> and this one is to close next month.  I appreciate that this firm is a private one and that the Minister is limited in what he can do.  However, closure of firms is a serious matter for the localities concerned. The IDA may be able to provide help and assistance.  Fóir Teoranta can provide proper financial help and technical assistance.  We will face a serious situation if firms of this kind which have existed through difficult times are to close now.  The Minister should use his good offices to ensure that the IDA take immediate action to see if some positive help can be given to the firm.</P>
    <P>I am not fully acquainted with the financial affairs of the firm.  I have not had access to their accounts, but one of the main factors that will cause concern is the removal of the plant and machinery. It is not as if it were some kind of rationalisation project.  The closure of the firm will have serious repercussions.  This area and the county in general have experienced savage job losses.  To see a firm that had been expanding closing down is a serious matter.  I hope some positive effort will be made to save it. Further meetings will be taking place about this matter and Offaly County Council discussed it yesterday.  It was discussed at a workers' meeting today.  I hope the Minister will ensure that some positive action is taken immediately and that he will be helpful and positive in his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy living only six miles from Tullamore I am deeply concerned about the closure of the Cappincur Joinery which is situated one mile from the town centre.  Like Deputy Enright, I hope every effort will be made by the Minister and Fóir Teoranta to help out in the serious development which has taken place in the past few days.  I have already been in contact with the Minister, the Department and the IDA.  I received assurances from them that every effort will be made by them to attract a suitable industry into this building if the closure takes place.  Naturally I hope it will not and that the company, GWI, Collooney, will receive some help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright mentioned job creation <Col N="1387" /> in the Tullamore area but during the period of the National Government in 1973-77 one could count on two hands the number of jobs created in the area but since Fianna Fáil came to office there have been 500 more&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Enright, it does not give me any pleasure to get up here and talk about a factory that is about to close.  Cappincur Joinery has been in operation in Tullamore for many years. It is a tragedy in any area when jobs are lost.  Even one job loss is too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last recession Cappincur in common with others in the joinery sector ran into severe financial difficulties.  GWI in Colloonery also ran into difficulties at that time and because Fóir Teoranta had considerable investments in both companies, they promoted the idea of a merger in order to prevent cut-throat competition between them which would eventually result in the closure of both companies.  The merger came about in 1977 and after a lot of rationalisation and reduction in employment the merger group traded profitably until late 1979 when the present recession began to pinch.  Short-time working was introduced in both plants and this has continued practically during the whole of 1980.  As a result, the profits of the merged group <Col N="1388" /> fell by about 70 per cent in the year ended 30 September last.</P>
    <P>In order to prevent further deterioration of the position, bringing about the closure of both plants, the company have now decided to close the Tullamore plant, causing 83 redundancies.  The manufacture of doors and door frames will now be transferred to Collooney where 20 additional workers will be employed bringing the work force up to 170.  The company have stated that reduced demand for joinery is the single most important cause of the closure.  The facilities available to GWI are more modern than those in the Tullamore plant and accordingly the company have decided to centralise production in the GWI plant in Collooney.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta state that the company's decision to close the Tullamore operation, though not unexpected, is regrettable: the company were always likely to come under pressure in the event of a fall-off in trade &mdash; I have been quoting from the Fóir Teoranta statement.  Both Fóir Teoranta and the IDA advise that since the merger in 1977 the company have been attempting to diversify and to expand production in order to take up the slack at the two plants.  These efforts have not been successful.  At the outset of this debate I asked Deputy Enright a simple question, when was he in touch with the Department?  He did not answer me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, through the IDA, are trying to help industry in that area.  In a debate earlier <Col N="1389" /> I spoke about our interest in maintaining and encouraging indigenous small industries, and SFADCo in the mid-west are to take in an area in west and south-west Offaly.  I am aware this will not take in Cappincur but the Government are concerned about the need for industrial improvement in the area.  The Government and the IDA are only too willing to help if at all possible and as far as industries in that area are concerned the Deputy is pushing an open door.</P>
      <P>There have been some complaints about imports of joinery, but because the greatest volume of these imports comes from the EEC there is no action open to me to prevent them.  Earlier this year the EEC examined the question of dumping of doors from Taiwan, but the complaint was not sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the closure of the Tullamore plant the IDA will promote the premises as a matter of urgency for a new project.  In addition, they will be promoting a new, 27,000 square foot factory in the town.  Employment in manufacturing <Col N="1390" /> industry in Tullamore at the end of last June was, 1,587 compared with 1,369 in 1973, an increase of 218.  Employment in manufacturing in Offaly during the same period increased by more than 300. The IDA will continue to promote Tullamore, and Offaly in general, as a location for new industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism met a deputation from Offaly County Council last June and informed them that the IDA were confident that their employment target of 1,800 jobs for the area in the period 1978 to 1982 would be achieved and I have no reason to contradict that forecast.  It is inevitable that during a recession certain vulnerable industries will run into difficulties and the only alternative in such circumstances is to promote other industries to replace those that may have to be closed.  This will continue to be the IDA policy.</P>

    <P>I would point out that the 1978-82 IDA <Col N="1203" /> Industrial Plan has set a very high target to provide 75,000 new grant-aided manufacturing jobs in the period.  A central target of this plan is that over 50 per cent of these jobs should come from within Ireland.  This reflects my desire that the employment creation potential of Irish industry should be developed to the maximum, while at the same time recognising that in the medium term at least overseas-sponsored investment will continue to make a very important contribution to the industrial base.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for keeping manufacturing enterprises in production rests with the proprietors and management of such enterprises.  As the Deputy is aware, the objective of the various changes in the ownership of the company in question that have taken place since 1965 has been to put the business of the company on a sound footing.  To this end, all possible assistance had been made available by the relevant State agencies.  In particular, assistance totalling £653,000 in grants and share subscriptions had been given to the company since it came under its present ownership in 1977.  It was therefore with great concern and regret that I learned that, despite the substantial State aid provided, the management had been forced to the conclusion that, because of the company's loss-making situation, there was no alternative but to cease production on 19 December 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explored with the company the possibilities of their being able to find further orders that would at least keep the works in operation for a further <Col N="1204" /> period of some months but the company advised that, as no such orders on a profitable basis were available, they regretted that they could not see their way to defer the closure.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the interests of the workers concerned and of the Wexford area can now best be served by the attraction to Wexford of new industries to provide alternative employment and intensified efforts are now being made to achieve this.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the present rate of corporation profits tax on exported goods; and the estimated extra yield to the Exchequer, on the assumption of a maintenance of the volume and value of such exports, that would accrue from a doubling of the existing rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing export sales relief scheme a manufacturing company is effectively exempted from corporation tax &mdash; that is, charged at a nil rate &mdash; for 15 years on profits arising from the export of goods and is entitled to marginal relief for a further period of five years.  The relief will, however, cease altogether in 1990 and, for new businesses, will, generally speaking, be replaced by the scheme provided for in Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 1980.  The latter scheme provides for an effective corporation tax charge of 10 per cent on a company's <Col N="1207" /> profits from sales of its manufactured goods whether on the domestic or export market.</P>
      <P>The cost of export sales relief was £52.9 million in 1978-79, a typical year.  If the relief were to be effectively reduced to one-half of its present level the effective rate of tax on most export profits would amount to 22½ per cent &mdash; i.e., half of 45 per cent &mdash; and, assuming that there were no change in the volume and value of exports, the saving to the Exchequer would be approximately one-half of the cost of the existing scheme, say £26 million. However, in such circumstances, companies would be entitled to opt, as from 1 January 1981 for the new 10 per cent scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if inquiries have now been completed by Customs and Excise personnel into the case of a car imported illegally into this country and sold to a person (details supplied) in Dublin; the reason for the long delay in this case since representations were first made over a year ago and subsequent undertakings given to have the matter cleared up; whether every consideration will be given to the plight of this person in view of the obvious financial loss and hardship which this incident has caused; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Inquiries in the case in question have now been completed.</P>
      <P>I brought the matter to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners in June 1980 on receipt of the Deputy's representations. It had not been brought to their attention up to that time.  The circumstances of the case are quite complex and the delay since June in completing the inquiries is not regarded as unreasonable.</P>
      <P>As the vehicle appears to have been imported into the State illegally it is liable to forfeiture and it may not be retained in the State unless an import authorisation is obtained from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968.</P>
      <P>If an import authorisation is obtained, the commissioners are prepared to agree to the retention of the car in the State on payment of the appropriate import charges.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, in the circumstances of the case, the commissioners are prepared to allow exportation of the vehicle without payment of any penalty.</P>

      <P>The total of royalties and fees received from mining companies from 1940 to end-November 1980 is £6.64 million.  It would be contrary to secrecy obligations to disclose any information about the profits or liability to tax of a small group of companies.  For that reason, I regret I cannot supply the other information requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>This is primarily a matter for RTE who say that the new high-power transmitter at Holywell Hill is providing a two channel colour service for a significant area of Inishowen.  The remainder of the area is served by transposers at Fanad and Moville.  RTE expect, subject to the successful international co-ordination of the necessary frequencies, that the Fanad transposer will be equipped to transmit RTE1 in colour before the end of January and RTE2 in colour next spring.  RTE also plan to equip the Moville transposer to carry the full 625 line services to the remainder of Inishowen as soon as possible, but they cannot say at this stage when these transmissions will commence.</P>

    <P>Local authority craftsmen generally are early starters for the purpose of national pay agreements.  Accordingly, the pay scale applicable to them with effect from 1 January 1980 included the second phase increase payable under the 1979 National Understanding; this scale also applied on the date (viz. 30 June 1980) on which that understanding terminated in relation to early starters.  Similarly, the scale applicable with effect from 1 August 1980 included the first phase increase under the 1980 understanding; it also included a special pay increase negotiated with effect from that date.</P>

      <P>I understand that the carrying out of electrical wiring in houses provided by Dublin County Council is undertaken by contractors in accordance with the specifications for electrical installations in local authority houses.  This specification applies on a national basis and was approved in December 1976 by my Department following consultation with the Electro-Technical Council and the Electricity Supply Board.  The specification requires that all electrical work must comply with the latest edition of <i>National Rules for Electrical Installations</i> published by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>When electrical work in Dublin County Council houses is completed the general contractor or electrical sub-contractor certifies that the electrical installation in each house complies with and has been installed in accordance with the national rules published by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland and has been found to be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>A small number of fires have occurred in Dublin County Council houses in recent years and the causes, where established, have differed in each case.  In no case was it established that the cause of a fire was due to faulty electrical wiring. However, the county council considered that it was desirable and necessary to have electrical work inspected and have appointed two electrical inspectors, sanctioned by my Department, to ensure that all electrical work is carried out satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>While I am not aware of the extent to which the practice is followed, I understand that the installation of immersion heater switches inside hot presses is a practice which was recently investigated by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland and that they are satisfied that it is safe.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the cost and extent of remedial work carried out in Mourne View Estate, Skerries, County Dublin, following a fatal fire in November 1978; if he is satisfied that the wiring certificates issued for the houses were in order; and, if not, the steps he has taken to remedy the position.</P>

      <P>The provision and maintenance of their rented housing estates, including electrical wiring, is primarily a matter for each individual local authority.  Up-to-date specifications for electrical installations for incorporation in contract documents for local authority housing schemes are issued periodically to local authorities by my Department following consultation with the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland and the Electricity Supply Board.  I have had inquiries made of Dublin County Council, however, and I understand that the cost of repair works carried out to the four houses damaged by the fire in Mourne View Estate, Skerries, in November 1978 was £34,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no evidence to indicate that the cause of the fire was faulty electrical wiring.  Nevertheless, the City and County Manager requested the National Building Agency to have an urgent independent examination made of the electrical installations in all houses in the estate.  This was carried out by a specialist firm of consultants who reported that, apart from minor defects in some houses, <Col N="1255" /> in particular the fitting, presumably by tenants, of fuses of a higher rating than recommended, the electrical installations complied with the Institute of Electrical Engineers <i>Regulations for Electrical Equipment of Buildings</i> as amended by the <i>National Rules for Electrical Installations</i> and <i>Requirements for Earthing in Electrical Installations</i> of the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland and the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report stated that generally the defects were such that the increase of fire risk from them was very slight.  All defects, however slight, were rectified at the time under the supervision of the consultants.</P>
