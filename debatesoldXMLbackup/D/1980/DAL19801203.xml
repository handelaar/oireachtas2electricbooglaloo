      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Ceann Comhairle why he has taken the unprecedented step of removing from the Order Paper the Agricultural (Emergency Provisions) Bill?  Could I ask him, further, if there is any precedent at all in this House for the Ceann Comhairle, on his own initiative, removing from the Order Paper a Bill which he himself had ordered to be printed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I say, first of all, Deputy, that it is not in order to raise this matter.  I have already communicated with the Deputy and have given him the reasons, both orally and in writing, as to why the Bill was removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Ceann Comhairle not agree that it is not a matter of private interest between himself and myself but a matter of public importance, and that if he takes an unprecedented procedural step of removing a Bill from the Order Paper of the entire House, he has an obligation to the entire House to explain why he has taken such a step?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the Deputy what the situation is.  On a preliminary examination, the Bill appeared to be one which the Deputy could proceed with under Standing Orders and it was circulated and put on the Order Paper on that basis.  However, it later became evident that the main object of the Bill was the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the sum of a very considerable number of millions of pounds.  Standing Order 119 (1) provides that such a Bill can be initiated only by a member of the Government.  It would not, therefore, be in order for the Deputy to proceed with the Bill and the Bill was deleted from the Order Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Ceann Comhairle not agree that as stated in the long title, the main purpose of this Bill was to make provision in relation to finance in regard to agricultural prices and that it is a most unfortunate situation that the House is being prevented by the decision of the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last Thursday I spent a short time dealing with a few matters that had arisen on the Supplementary Estimate.  I indicated that so many issues had been raised that I would take the full time available to me to deal with them in a comprehensive manner.  Many groundless allegations were made and the Deputies who made them took off to the hills and were not present to listen to some of the explanations I had to give, and to listen to some of the facts.</P>

      <P>That is what I am doing. The Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is before the House.  Wild allegations were made last week and some of the people who made them are now here so perhaps it is as well to deal with some of them first.  The most serious allegation, an allegation of corruption, was made against the civil service.

      <P>The Deputy had an opportunity to listen on Thursday but he was not here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The only test referred to by Deputies opposite was the interview. I was accused of not following the usual practice in the appointment of trainee installers.  I admit I did not follow the practice adopted in previous years for this reason; I was left short of personnel in the Department because recruitment was banned during the period of office of the Coalition Government.  After recruitment it takes a couple of years to train people.  As the applicants became available off the list after an interview, a medical examination and cross reference, I took them on to have them trained immediately.</P>

      <P>Wait for it.  If I am to be condemned for not following the practice, so be it.  I was accused of not changing any of the old practices and of not doing anything to improve the situation. This is an area where I took the initiative. If I am to be condemned for that, so be it.  I did it in the interest of getting people into the jobs as soon as possible and of getting them trained so that they would <Col N="217" /> be available to improve the quality of the service, which was complained about on the last occasion, and also to improve the installation rate, which was complained about on the last occasion.</P>

Everybody knows the position expect a few people on the opposite side of the House who tried to could the issue with charges of political influence and corruption.  These people will not lose their seniority because they will be fitted in where they should be fitted in.  If I am to be condemned for taking them on as soon as they were ready, rather than leaving people to wait for two months and rather than waiting for No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 to go through all three tests, so be it.  I took them on because I knew we had enough places for all of them.  I would have taken on more of them if possible but I did not have the training facilities to take them on.  That is more than were ever taken on in the period of office of the Coalition Government. Nobody suffers.  People are recruited earlier than they would be. They will be trained earlier and they will be on the job earlier.  Their seniority is not affected.</P>

      <P>The three main issues raised in the debate last week related to telephone installations which incorporates the waiting list, the quality of service and details of the development programme as raised by the various Deputies.  As I said last Thursday in answer to a parliamentary question put down by Deputy Corish the figures for installations for the first nine months this year are 44,744 and in relation to the first nine months last year they were 23,412. That is a clear indication of what is going on this year.  It is not as Deputy Deasy says a nice concept.  It is solid proof, if that were needed, of the progress being <Col N="223" /> made in the installations field.  That raises the question of the size of the waiting list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a waiting list of 94,000 but of that about 70,000 applied this year.  That is the greatest demand made in a single year for telephones.  The concept of putting in 60,000 telephones this year, 80,000 next year and 100,000 the year after was treated as euphoric promises by me being carried away in the heat of the moment last February.  It is clear to everybody now that the target of 60,000 telephones was not the fairytale story that Deputies opposite and others thought it was.  It has now become a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it but why does it take six years to get a telephone in Letterkenny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 80,000 telephones next year is not as crazy a figure as people might think because on the recent figures handed to me only yesterday our installation rate at the moment is running at 1,750 per week.  If we take a 50 week working year, allowing for bank holidays and so on, we would have an annual installation rate of 87,500. What I started out to do last February and have continued during the year is to build up the momentum of installations so that it could reach the figures.  This is vitally necessary to make an impression on the waiting list.  The momentum has been built up and we hope to increase it next year.  The projected figures were not crazy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last February I was accused of projecting fantastic figures but it is interesting that the people over the far side who accused me of that have in recent months switched their attack from the number of telephone installations to the quality of <Col N="224" /> the service, to the question of whether we should install telephones at all, and to the question of whether the infrastructure is capable of coping.  This is like an each way bet, putting both sides against the middle.</P>
    <P>The Deputies cannot have their loaf and eat it.  Deputy Tully said last May on the Estimate that if we put in 60,000 telephones he would clap us on the back. The people over there however would not dream of things like that.  Even their Leader at Question Time said that when his Government were in office they had increased the installation rate by two and a half times over a period of four years, quoting a figure of 17,000 to 34,000.  I have all the lists and I would have to go back to the early seventies to find a basis for the 17,000 figure which the Deputy was talking about.  The figure for the year before the Coalition took office was actually 25,000.  If one multiplies 25,000 by two and a half one would arrive at 62,500.  The highest number that the Coalition Government ever put in was 38,000.  If that is the way that Deputy does his figures I am not surprised that he got so many figures wrong in the past. The record does not show that the Coalition doubled the telephone installations in a four year period.  There is no point in throwing out figures like that.  I deal with facts not with fairytales.  I will accept constructive criticism, ideas and advice from every Member of this House but I deplore the attitude of coming in here with half-baked stories.  Deputy Deasy says that he has his contacts.  If the Deputy has them he should present the facts in total, not in selective statistics.</P>
    <P>I was accused of not giving the public enough information or telling them the facts.  Many people come to me in clinics and tell me that a telephone line passes their house and ask why they cannot have an installation.  The fact that a telephone line passes a house does not mean there is capacity there to connect one in.  People think because a line passes their house it is the same as an ESB line and that one can tap into it and get the service.  That is not the position.  For every subscriber who is to be connected there must be a <Col N="225" /> second pair of wires running from the exchange through a cable, perhaps a multiple cable.  The cable must contain a separate pair of wires for every subscriber so that his privacy can be protected.  If one were to break into a telephone wire running along the road in which there was no capacity there would be that problem. We often hear talk about ten subscribers on the one line listening to the one telephone.  That is not the position. In addition, the fact that a a line runs by a house does not in itself mean there can be a service.  Any Deputy or anyone else who does not convey that message to the public should be put right.</P>

There will be 60,000 installations, and hopefully in excess of that figure, this year.  There will be 80,000 by next year, and hopefully I will exceed this figure.  These are the kind of connection figures needed to put a dent in the waiting list.</P>

      <P>/Deputy Deasy made allegations about putting in telephones without having the infrastructure.  The objective set in the development programme is to double the size of the network in a period of five years.  What is involved in that and where will there be <Col N="226" /> improvements in the infrastructure?  It starts with sites, buildings, trunk exchanges, local exchanges, trunk cabling and local cabling.  All that goes to make up the national network of the telecommunications service.</P>
      <P>The position regarding sites is that we needed something in excess of 450 to complete the programme.  All of the sites have been identified.  Most have been purchased and the rest are under negotiation. There are only 18 sites to be located.  Most of the others have been purchased and transferred or are in the process of legal transfer.  Some are in the course of negotiation.</P>
      <P>In regard to buildings, the position is that we need something like 540.  Up to 233 have been built or are in the course of being built.  Approximately one-third are going out to tender or are at an advanced planning stage.  There is no hold-up on buildings or sites.  As regards trunk exchanges, in my opening statement on this Estimate I named the key centres in the network that needed telephone exchanges.  Apparently they fell on deaf ears.  I know where they are and if anybody read my statement at the time he would know where they are.  Most of the key switching exchanges are on order and the first of these, which is a new digital exchange, will be installed in Athlone in June-July next year.  This is the start of the new digital exchange programme upon which I took a decision last February, to switch from the existing technology of crossbar and go into the modern era of digital exchanges which, when we have our programme completed, will raise the standard of the service up to, if not surpass, that of our EEC partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of local trunk exchanges that serve into the main switching centres is being tackled vigorously.  Up to 280 of the smaller exchanges needed for the conversion of the network to automatic are on order or are in the course of installation. It is not a question of simply putting in 60,000 telephones and ignoring the infrastructure and framework of the whole operation.  What is being done is to bring along each and every section that makes up the infrastructure on a planned <Col N="227" /> basis.  It is no good at the end of the day if any section is left out or left without attention.  All that would happen is that seven-eighths would be working and one-eighth missing.  If that was the case no national network could function and all the investment of earlier years would be set at naught.</P>
    <P>As I have said, all but 18 of the sites have been purchased; the massive building programme which is a major contributor to the construction industry is well under way; trunk exchanges are on order; subscriber exchanges are on order and as they are installed we will see a progressive improvement in the telephone service.</P>
    <P>In bringing in the Estimate I was criticised about a figure of £23.4 million for sites and buildings and asked why it could not have been envisaged at the beginning of the year and why the Estimate had to be increased by such a phenomenal amount.  The explanation is simple.  The procedures associated with the provision of building have been streamlined with the introduction of working parties in the Office of Public Works and in my Department. They have monthly meetings and work to a planned programme.  The result of that planned, monitored approach has been that at the end of this year we needed £23.4 million because so much progress had been made in that area. That progress will continue into next year.  There is no point in saying that the infrastructure is being left without anything being done to it and the concentration is on telephone installation.  I would welcome any constructive criticism that can be offered from the Opposition but I will not wear destructive hypocritical criticism.  People did not bother to find out the facts.  They did not want them. All they wanted was to try to give a false impression not only in the House but to the public.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Deasy speaking about the amount of money put into buildings and sites in the period of his party's term in office.  I am not a person to look back, nor did I enter this Supplementary Estimate to look back, but when progress over the last few years is raised I have no <Col N="228" /> option but to answer the criticism.  He talked about the great contribution made in the area of sites and buildings, but if he did he ignored facts.  The facts are that in the four years that they were in Government they put in just less than half the money that we put in in this year alone. That puts it into perspective.  I do not have to go into the details.  In four years of the one Government the amount of money thrashed out here by Deputy Deasy in relation to their contribution to the infrastructure was so massive that he thought it worth mentioning.  In 1979 £14.9 million was invested by this Government in infrastructural development, or double in 1979 for the whole four years of Coalition Government.  In 1980 alone we have invested two and a half times more than the previous Government invested over a four-year period.</P>
    <P>The absolute nonsense thrashed out here last week was that we gave the impression to the outside public that, so much money having been spent, the system should be right today.  I have never set out to give the impression that there was an instant solution.  There is not, and I said so in my opening statement here last Thursday.  It has to be on a planned basis and it is only as the exchanges that I have spoken about as having been ordered are brought into service that there will be a progressive improvement in the quality of the service.  It will not come by any waving of a magic wand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy claimed that because I was installing so many telephones now the service was deteriorating and that the local service in Dublin was a disgrace. Let me put some facts on the record in relation to the whole service.  On the tests of local service in the Dublin area there is a three per cent failure rate in the local telephones.  I have heard Deputies say in this House that when they go abroad they find it much easier to ring from Hamburg, London, Paris or Rome to their own house and they get through direct with no trouble at all, and why can we do it on an international service and not on the local service?  That, of course, is ignoring the reality of the situation.  No matter where you ring from abroad, Rome, Paris, Hamburg or anywhere else, you <Col N="229" /> must come through the local service. When you arrive at the Dublin switching station you must come through the local service to get to your home, office and so on.  To say that they can ring easily from abroad and get through every time and that you cannot ring from Dublin and get through every time is ignoring the reality. The call must find its way into the local services, into your house or your office, and if you can get it from abroad you can get it from here.  To try to paint a picture of a collapse in the telephone service is absolute nonsence, rubbish and the Deputy knows that.</P>
    <P>Our international service is of a fine quality, but it is not being left at that. Further investment is being made in it and within the next year to 18 months a new international exchange will be brought into service in Dublin which will add to the capacity of that.  We know it is a good service and we recognise it as such and it is our aim to bring the local and trunk services up to the same quality.</P>
    <P>In relation to the trunk service the Deputy said that people now were using the phone much less than they ever used it before because the capacity is not there, the service is on the point of collapse, it is only the tip of the iceberg and so on.  What is the reality in relation to the usage of the telephone and the traffic in the telephone network?  Recent surveys have shown that the increase in the telephone network is between 12 and 15 per cent.  Does that show that people are using the telephone more or does it compliment Deputy Deasy's allegation that they are using the telephone a lot less? One thing that needs to be borne in mind is the allegation that telephone traffic has decreased, that subscribers were not using the telephone as much as they used to and that the whole thing is on the point of collapse.  That is not so.  There is an increase in telephone traffic of between 12 and 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about improving the telephone network and the quality of service?  As I said in my opening address, a new major exchange will be opening in Dublin towards the end of this year which will release into the network a substantial number of trunk lines both into and out <Col N="230" /> of Dublin.  I want everybody to put this in perspective and not to run away with the idea that this is the answer to all the congestion in the Dublin area.  It is not, but it will make a good contribution in releasing additional capacity into the network and relieving the pressure and congestion in the various areas around Dublin.  When it comes into full working order over a period of some months, then you can expect more relief in the Dublin area, but it is only as the other exchanges which are on order are brought on stream that you will see a progressive improvement in the quality of the service.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about trunk cables and local cables?  No evidence is needed of that.  For any Deputy of this House from any part of this country there is the ample evidence of the staff and vans of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in every country throughout the country. They are out on the roads laying the construction lines, erecting the poles, doing the cabling.  They are being augmented, having got agreement from the unions on the employment of contractors to work side by side with them, mostly in the Dublin area.  This is the progressive approach to the whole problem that is being taken.  It is showing results and will show greater results next year and greater still the year after that.  It will take this type of results to meet the escalating demands being made on the telephone service and on the traffic in the network in the number of applications that pour in daily to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I have listened to arguments that the service was on the point of collapse.  I heard special notices being read from newspapers and I was asked if I ever read the papers.  Of course I read the papers, and I want to put the false position in perspective.  As a basis I will take the review body who sat and produced an excellent report in relation to the whole situation in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who recommended what the objectives should be in relation to the number of faults and how the Department should react.  The number of subscribers in our network is over 500,000. The review body set a target of one fault <Col N="231" /> per telephone per annum which in effect means approximately 1,500 faults per day.  At the end of the first six months this year we had got that figure down to just over 1,300, but because of the very bad weather that we had in July and August that figure went up again.  We had a very bad August in relation to faults, so bad that I had to take people off installations and put them on fault repairs.  Subsequent to August, having got the position under control, again in October we had disastrously bad weather.  It is interesting to see from the records that 84 per cent above the average rainfall in October fell this year and everybody knows what effect that has on our underground network and the damage it can do.  Deputy Deasy comes into this House and talks about three, four, five, six, ten or 20 cases &mdash; and I believe him &mdash; and says there could be 30 or 40 others who did not bother to put the notice in the paper.  To put that in perspective the review body, who have been quoted extensively by many Members on the far side of the House, set the objective that it would be realistic for the Post Office to aim towards one fault per telephone per annum, which is 1,500 faults per day.  In June and July it was well below that but the figure rose again in August.  However, we are now marginally below that figure.  Any one of these 1,500 people will see the position as being bad for business and for the whole network, but we must put things into perspective. The target set by the review body was 1,500 faults per day and our aim is to be well below that figure.  This will happen only when all the projects I have mentioned come on stream.</P>
    <P>Many people have asked why such damage is caused to the network by heavy rain and flooding.  All our cables need to be pressurised against dampness. Already a pilot scheme has been carried out with great success in the Whitehall area and we have a programme to pressurise all existing cables over a three-year period.  All new cables are jelly filled so that they will stand up to dampness. Another pilot scheme is being started in Cork where much damage is being caused <Col N="232" /> by tidal conditions and we are optimistic that this operation will be successful.  The situation regarding faults has been put clearly in perspective and there is no point in saying that the system is on the point of collapse &mdash; it is far from it.  The evidence is available for anyone who wants to see it, but some people would prefer to come into the House and make glib statements and unsubstantiated allegations while ignoring the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>The quality of the service in relation to local calls is quite good and the failure rate is 3 per cent, although it is higher in the trunk situation.  We are improving capacity in the trunks and local exchanges and we can then reduce the incidence of faults.  The international service is quite good and investment is being made to ensure sufficient capacity for future needs.  If I wished to do so I could bring in letters which have been received by the Department complimenting them on improvements in various areas.</P>

      <P>Then we come to the figures tossed out about the length of the waiting list in various areas.  In Waterford city, Deputy Deasy's constituency, the average waiting time is about six months, while in the county area it is 17 months.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not make weird allegations and cast aspersions on the staff.  Anyone listening to the debate would think they were not capable of doing the job, but I have always maintained that they are capable and that we have the experience and expertise.  We <Col N="233" /> simply needed to give them the tools for the job.  Money has been the problem in the past but this is not the case where the Fianna Fáil Government are concerned. They recognised that from the mid-seventies there was a build up of demand for telephones which necessitated the putting together of this development programme.</P>
      <P>I have been asked what we are doing about the report of the review body and it is obvious that those who asked this question have not been following the trend of events.  On receiving the report of the review body, my predecessor immediately acted on it.  The recommendation was to set up a board for the telecommunications service.  Both he and the Government felt that the postal service should not be put in a less favourable position and they decided to set up two interim boards, one for the telecommunications service and one for the postal service.  That was done immediately.  Last May I published a Green Paper which called for the widest public debate on the reorganisation of the postal and telecommunications services and set out how the task was being approached.  It is a task of enormous magnitude because nearly 30,000 people will be moved from the civil service into the semi-State sector. Forty-two submissions have been received on the Green Paper and consultations have been carried out with every staff association and union and with the two interim boards.  All these inputs have been considered and it is expected that the White Paper will be ready by January. Draft legislation is being prepared in conjunction with the White Paper and it is expected that this will be introduced in the House next year.  Anyone who says that nothing is being done in relation to the report of the review body is living in a fool's paradise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of priority for applicants was raised by Deputy Hegarty and others. At present priority is afforded to 40 per cent of those on the waiting list and it would not make sense to raise that percentage.  Deputy Hegarty has great appreciation of the problems existing in the service and he paid tribute in this House to the staff of the Department and <Col N="234" /> the reaction he got when he contacted the Minister's office in relation to a problem in Cork where jobs were at stake. When this approach is contrasted with the approach of others, we can see who is serious about getting to grips with the problems.  I take Deputy Hegarty's point about the priority list and I should like to extend it to include people who have one or two employees.  However, the figure is set at five employees and until there is a general improvement in the situation it would make nonsense to extend the priority list.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty made some good suggestions about more extensive use of mobile exchanges.  He mentioned the time when the Pope was in Ireland and the fantastic telephone service which was provided by the use of mobile exchanges in addition to the existing network.  Most people fail to realise that during those few days the telephone network was not being used by the business community or by the public at large and this contributed to the success of the service provided. Already up to 60 mobile exchanges are in use and more will be used if the situation allows it.  Where there is a problem of capacity there is no point in using a mobile exchange because it can help the situation only in certain circumstances. We have used them to the maximum and wherever the situation arises that demands their use in future, Deputy Hegarty can be assured that they will be used to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies said public telephones should be installed here, there and everywhere in rural areas and asked when there would be a change in policy.  There has been a change in policy recently and the criteria have been changed.  There must be some relationship to the revenue to be got from telephone kiosks if we are to incur the cost of installing them.  It is not unreasonable to expect the local community through the local authority, to share some part of the burden of the cost in erecting a telephone kiosk in an area where the Department, having assessed the situation, feel revenue will fall far short of what they expect.  In other words, central funds in the Department make their contribution to a social situation in <Col N="235" /> a particular area and, in my view, it is not unreasonable to expect the local community, through their local authority, to make a contribution as well.  The old criteria have been changed and as a result a long list of priorities has been established in an effort to bring kiosks into many areas where the Department have agreed and accepted that they will be provided.  This change will take time; kiosks will not be installed overnight.</P>
    <P>Deputy White asked about modernising coinboxes.  He said he had been abroad and used coinboxes where a person could put in his money, he would not be cut off by an operator and the telephone call is not interrupted because he had to put in more money.  Already 2,000 such coinboxes have arrived in the stores branch of the Department.  One thousand are ready for installation.  We will start to install them this month and progressively over the next few months in the areas where there is most demand for public coinboxes.  That will be extended around the country but I would ask the Deputies and the public to bear in mind that there are 35,000 public coinboxes and they cannot all be changed overnight.  Progress is being made in updating the type of coinboxes and the equipment for these boxes we have purchased.  Deputies may have seen the new design of aluminium type telephone kiosks which hopefully will stand up better to vandalism and the equipment being installed is the best vandal proof equipment that can be got on the world market.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies asked my views on public representatives making representations and not being given proper attention at local level.  I hold the same view as the Deputies.  Public representatives have the right to make representations and the right of access to whatever information is available.  I have sent that message through my Department to ensure that public representatives are given all the information available but I would ask Deputies to consider the amount of pressure these people are working under.  It is only reasonable to expect that at times the information the Deputies seek is not forthcoming as quickly as they expect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> Deputy McMahon complained about the siting of a sub-post office at Firhouse and said it was a ridiculous decision by my Department.  When that sub-postmaster's job became available, we advertised and canvassed it and there was not a single applicant from the shopping area to which he referred.  The only applicant found suitable was the person who got the sub-post office.  It is crazy to accuse the Department of moving a sub-post office from A to B without having researched the facts.  The same thing applies to the allegations he made about the telephones installed.  He said he had not seen very many of them and wished the Deputies representing his area would make the same point here.  He failed to recognise that only a week ago I answered a question relating to four housing areas in his own area, where there were 1,240 applicants.  In reply I told him that in the Kilnamanagh estate, Tallaght, there were 500, Belgard Heights, Tallaght, 120, Kingswood Heights, Tallaght, 400, and Aylesbury Estate, Tallaght, 220 telephones installed.  I also said it was expected that service would be provided for all these people by the end of this year or early next year.</P>
    <P>I want to nail another myth which has been floating around this House.  It is said that we are installing telephones which will not be working for six or nine months, that we are fooling the people and that we are taking their money.  The procedure being followed at present is no different from the procedure that was always followed.  It has always been the practice that we call people in advance to find out if they want to take up the contract being offered to them and then sign them up.  The reason for this is that we must establish in advance a work programme for installation gangs of workers going out.  To say that people were never called in advance is nonsense and to go further and try to convince the public that we are taking their money by supplying them with a telephone without providing a service is not true.  No telephone is counted in my figures until it has been connected to the service.  Anybody who has a telephone installed will be connected <Col N="237" /> to the service within three months, at the maximum, and that is a rarity.  If 60,000 telephones are being installed, of course you will find an underground fault or a faulty cable, but that is the exception to the rule.  To paint this as a general picture is rubbish and Deputies know it.  That is not the position and it never was.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and others raised the question of postal matters and asked if I ever looked at the situation and if it had improved.  I do not want to go back to the beginning of this year.  We all know the industrial problems that beset the Department for a number of years, but the service has progressively improved all through this year and at this moment 85 per cent of first-class letters posted are delivered the following morning.  That is an excellent service.  Our aim is for a 90 per cent service.  We are working towards that end and intend to achieve it.  People should put this in perspective.  Do our people ever go abroad and post letters? If they did, they would find out how long it takes to have letters delivered to Ireland. They would then appreciate the fine service we have.  Let there be no doubt about it, we provide a first-class postal service, especially when we compare it with others.  We had our problems in the past, but the service is being improved all the time.  Do not let us be a nation of knockers.  We should pay respect to the people who are doing the job and if they are not doing a good job we may then criticise them.</P>
    <P>Last May Deputy Tully said that if I was able to provide 60,000 telephones he would clap me on the back.  I am not looking for claps on the back.  All I am saying is, where staff are doing a good job, recognise it.  We all know what the problems are in any service, especially in an organisation of 30,000 people, but, in relation to the service they are giving, they are entitled to the respect and confidence of the people for whom they are acting.  I was asked how many people received telephones under the free rental system for people living alone.  The figure has now exceeded 10,300.  I have not the exact figure.  Some Deputies raised the question of giving priority to old people <Col N="238" /> living alone in rural areas.  Wherever possible they are given priority.  I fully appreciate the need for communication between them and their relations.  I know they are isolated and need a telephone. It is the policy to install telephones as quickly as possible in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised the question of the recruitment of engineers and the shortage of engineers.  There is a worldwide shortage of electrical engineers.  He also asked what I was doing about remuneration which is so far out of line with comparable jobs in private industry. When I became Minister, the first thing I did was to look at this area because I fully recognised and appreciated that if we did not have the people to plan the job for us we would run into bottlenecks from the very start.</P>
    <P>Already the remuneration of engineers in the Department has been adjusted twice this year, to bring them more into line with what is available elsewhere.  The gap has been closed in so far as it can be closed.  This has been done by the recruitment of civil and mechanical engineers to carry out duties which, up to now, were carried out by electrical engineers.  We are supplementing our engineering force in that manner and by the promotion of sub-professional engineers.  This is another step in the direction of supplementing our engineering personnel with people who have come up through the ranks in the area of executive engineers. The Government recognise it is a problem we have to face not alone in the Post Office but because of the great development in electronics and because we are now becoming one of the bases for electronic development in western Europe. We are going to face the problem increasingly in the future.  The Government are very conscious of this; we have a sub-committee working out a programme as to how it can be overcome.  The shortage is not as bad as it was.  When I am speaking to students I quantify what the job opportunities are in the engineering fields in the Department.  They are aware of them and are very anxious to help in whatever way they can because this is an <Col N="239" /> area where young people can find job satisfaction.</P>
    <P>With regard to the licensing of CB radio, as I said recently in answer to a Dáil Question, my Department are conducting tests on different types of citizen band radio equipment.  I hope the technical investigation will be completed by the end of the year and that recommendations based on the results of these tests will be submitted for my consideration early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Deputy White raised the question of licensing the 27 megahertz AM band and hoped this did not present any problems. It does present problems.  I am not saying that they cannot be overcome.  The 27 megahertz AM band seriously interferes with cable television.  That has shown up in tests.  It does not interfere so much with ordinary television.  He also raised the question of what wattage would be provided.  That will also be the subject of tests to be carried out.  As soon as this information is available I will pass it on to the Deputies and to the CB users because I recognise that it is a good means of communication.  We would like to accommodate them but we also have to protect the rights of the television viewers, who number 650,000.</P>
    <P>I have taken every opportunity to go into the points raised by the various Deputies.  It was unfortunate that we had to go back over the periods of other Ministers and other regimes.  I prefer to look forward in an area where there is so much work to be done.  I want to follow the plan I have laid out, the objectives which I set myself in last February.  Some people said we made euphoric promises which could not be kept.  I wish during this debate that people had taken the opportunity of producing evidence that we made promises which we were not able to fulfil.  No such evidence was produced and it is obvious that there is no evidence available to prove that any promise that I made at the Ard-Fheis or anywhere else has not been fulfilled.  I do not pretend to be the greatest Minister of all times, far from it, but the Post Office Users' Council said we in the Department do not say enough about what we are doing.  We do <Col N="240" /> not tell the public enough.  When I try to inform the public I am accused of being egotistic, euphoric or putting on a theatrical performance.  I am doing my best and will continue to do so.  Deputy McMahon says I should not make grandiose speeches at dinner dances and that he would not accept them as evidence.  I am not asking him to accept them as evidence.  I am asking him to accept the solid evidence that has been produced throughout the debate and in various answers to questions.  There is solid evidence available as to what has been and is being done, what is being planned and what our objectives are.  I will continue to give all that information to the public. It is absolutely essential that that solution is endorsed by the users' council and the public are entitled to know what our targets are and how we are trying to achieve them.</P>
    <P>I will continue to do that in spite of criticism because it is my duty to the public.  There is no instant solution to the telephone problem.  It is being done on a planned, progressive basis.  The objectives we set last February are being continued. We are meeting the targets which we set.  If we fall down in any area, we will openly and honestly admit it.  That is the frank and honest approach that we have adopted and we will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>That is not what I said. Perhaps I may be permitted to give an explanation, with the permission of the Chair, because it is an important point and should not be misrepresented.  What I said is this: there are three tests that any young man looking for a trainee installer's post must undergo.  There is the interview board, the medical examination and the other cross-references.  All three are important.  If he is picked by the interview board first, he must then undergo a medical examination and also his background references must always be checked before he is taken into the service.  If he fails on either of the other two &mdash; it does not matter whether he was first, in the middle or anywhere else at an interview board &mdash; he is out.  Therefore the fact that he is placed first at an interview board does not automatically entitle him to be recruited.  I wanted that to be clear: if he fails the medical examination, he is out or, if he fails in the other area, he is out also.  The first test is that carried out by the interview board.</P>

There is absolutely nothing being done to any man who passed all three. Nobody will suffer on the seniority list.

I took them, employed them and got them into the job as fast as possible. Some people do not pass through the other areas as fast as others.  There may be questions that have to be checked, rechecked and so on.  I am not prepared to wait and was not prepared to wait. What I am saying is that nobody has suffered, everybody has been put on a panel and everybody is being employed. There is absolutely no basis for either a charge of corruption or use of influence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion there remained for me only to make <Col N="243" /> a few further points in relation to matters raised by Deputies Keating and Lemass.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating asked me how the Bill precludes the charges of rape within marriage being brought.  I want to make the point that rape is crime under common law.  It has always been a rule of the common law that a husband cannot be liable to the charge of rape on his wife subject, of course, to the exceptions I have already mentioned.  This rule is confirmed in the Bill by defining rape in terms of unlawful intercourse, that is, intercourse outside marriage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass asked about the possibility of a rape charge in the case of a common law marriage.  In the first place I should explain that there is no such concept as a common law marriage in this country.  In other words, the persons to whom the Deputy is referring are not validly married in the eyes of the law. Accordingly, in such a circumstance the male partner could be convicted of rape on his cohabitee.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass recommended&mdash;and this was a recommendation also of the Council for the Status of Women&mdash;that the presumption that a boy under 14 years is incapable of sexual intercourse be amended so that he would be regarded as being capable of being a principal in a crime of rape or attempted rape.  I agree that there is an anomaly here.  However, if the rule is to be changed it would be better to include the proposal in a wider Bill dealing with young persons or, alternatively, a wider Bill dealing with sexual offences generally.  The question also arises in the case of offences other than rape.  To change the rule in regard to rape alone would create further anomalies.  As I have mentioned already, a boy under 14 can be charged with aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring rape and incitement to rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening speech, the Council for the Status of Women recommended that sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, be amended.  These sections provide that it is a felony to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15&mdash;section 1&mdash;and that unlawful carnal knowledge <Col N="244" /> of a girl of 15 or 16 years is a misdemean-our&mdash;section 2.  The council recommended that these ages should be reduced to 13 years, below which the felony would be committed, and to 16 years below which the misdemeanour would be committed.  The council felt there was:</P>
    <P>... room for rationalisation in this area in view of the low marriage age, earlier maturity of young people and the relatively early financial independence of adolescents.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that these arguments would justify changes in the law enacted by the Oireachtas in 1935.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the law relating to indecent assault on a male person and also on young persons.  Under section 62 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861:</P>
    <P>... whosoever shall be guilty of any indecent assault upon any male person, shall ... be liable to be kept in penal servitude for any term not exceeding ten years.</P>
    <P>A man or woman can be guilty of the offence and the offence may be committed on a young boy as well as on an adult. It should be said also that a woman can commit an indecent assault on another woman and would be dealt with under section 10 of this Bill but homosexual acts between consenting females, commonly described as lesbianism, is not a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>I should make the point that the penalty for indecent assault is being increased in this Bill to ten years.  Bearing in mind that indecent assault, particularly on young persons&mdash;and more particularly girls&mdash;is such a serious and horrific crime that if any Deputy wishes to suggest that that penalty should be increased further, such suggestion would be considered. Deputies Keating and Lemass, who contributed very fairly to this debate, would, like myself, other members of the House&mdash;and indeed the public at large&mdash;be deeply concerned at the fact that indecent assault can be perpetrated against a young, immature girl with all the very serious consequences that most <Col N="245" /> certainly would hold for her throughout the rest of her life.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most if not all of the points that have been made during the course of the debate.  I think that possibly the two main issues that have arisen and that have been commented on by the Deputies who contributed as well as by others are the non-inclusion in the definition of rape of certain types of indecent assaults on women and the issue of rape within marriage.  Before I conclude I would like to come back to those two issues again.</P>
    <P>I feel that an impression may have arisen, because the Bill does not, as recommended by the Deputies who have spoken and by others, extend the definition of rape to cover certain acts of a depraved nature against women, that in some way the Bill does not sufficiently condemn these acts or cater adequately for their punishment.  Any such impression would be totally wrong.  What is important is that the law should provide adequate penalties for this sort of atrocious behaviour.  What is not important is the label that should be attached to them.  As I have already indicated, the Government's view is that this type of criminal behaviour is best dealt with under the offence of indecent assault.</P>
    <P>Depraved acts of the type in question will, as a result of the Bill, render the perpetrator liable to a maximum penalty of ten years which is five times the existing penalty for a first offence of indecent assault.  The proposed penalty of ten years is, incidentally, twice the maximum penalty which exists for the same offence in England.  There can be no doubt therefore about the Government's concern for women who are subjected to this type of aggravated indecent assault.  If, despite what I have said, Deputies consider that the penalty provided is not adequate it is of course open to them to propose that the penalty should be increased further and any such proposal will be given serious consideration.  It is, I suggest, nonsense to think that we can contribute to the solution of this problem by changing definitions.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to <Col N="246" /> make in this context.  It would not be helpful, quite the opposite in fact, to set out in the legislation a list of depraved acts of the type that have been mentioned in the House, whether in a definition of any crime or otherwise, because any such list could not possibly be exhaustive and, inevitably, equally serious and atrocious acts would not be covered.  It would not be possible to anticipate all the types of depraved behaviour that could arise.</P>
    <P>Much of what I have said about these aggravated assaults applies also to the question of rape within marriage.  It is totally wrong to assume that because the Bill does not include provisions that would make husbands liable generally for rape on their wives that there is a lack of concern for wives or that wives are not protected.  The very heavy maximum penalties that can be incurred by a husband who assaults his wife, indecently or otherwise, indicate clearly to me that there is very full protection for wives and I would suggest that that degree of protection would not be increased in practice by making husbands generally liable for rape.  For instance, in the notorious Morgan case while the husband was not charged with rape, he was charged with aiding and abetting rape by others on his wife and, in fact, received a far higher sentence than the persons who were convicted of rape.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputies, again, for their welcome for this Bill.  The Bill is an important piece of legislation in a very complex area.  While differing views have been expressed in relation to some aspects of the Bill I am glad to see that there is a general welcome for it.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister to what extent this will restrict or affect the rights of some markets that have been held consistently through the years. There are quite a number of such markets in different towns throughout the country and people have traditionally attended these markets which take place normally on a fixed day each month and sometimes more frequently.  Local people, particularly on special occasions during the year, attend with the intention of purchasing goods in these markets.  I should like the Minister to assure the House that such traditional markets and the people who have been conducting those sales will not be interfered with and that those who customarily attend such markets will continue to be able to purchase items in these markets.  One sees at these markets in certain towns the buying and selling of many types of items such as clothes, electrical goods and household items.  Frequently, people who are not well-off are able to purchase goods there at reasonable prices.  These markets are as much traditional in some of our towns as they are in cities or towns throughout the world.  Can the Minister assure us that these rights will not be affected?</P>

If the local authority in a particular area extinguishes the right to trade it will mean that an alternative trading area must be provided in the vicinity of the traditional trading area.  I agree with the Deputy that we have these markets of which we are all aware where people have provided these services for the local community over the years.  If the right to trade there is extinguished the local authority will have to provide an alternative area.</P>

Some of these market rights have been exercised in the market squares, as they are called, in the main thoroughfares of towns and provided excellent vantage points.  I am referring to a very limited number of areas only.  Will the local authority have power?  Will the elected members, as distinct from the country manager, have the authority?

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> In page 3, subsection (2), lines 23 to 25, to delete paragraph (g) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(g)  selling in respect of which it is shown by the seller&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that any profits therefrom are for use for charitable purposes or for other purposes from which no private profit is derived, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that no remuneration, emolument, gain or profit will accrue to the seller or his servants or agents therefrom,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the same matter in amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  It was intended that neither the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, nor this Bill would apply to charities or other worthy causes provided that no promoter of the selling, or any of his servants or agents, was paid a salary, wages or a commission and provided that there was no private profit from the charity or whatever it was this sale was in aid of.  It came to our notice that there was a possible loophole in section 221 of the Occasional Trading Act which exempts from the Act selling, the profits of which are used for charitable or other purposes for which no private profit is derived or intended to be derived.  We are advised that it would seldom, if ever, be possible for us to prove who was profiting from a sale and the further problen arose from the possibility that a person organising or helping out at a sale could be getting money out of it which could be classifiable as selling costs rather than profits.  This being the situation it could be that any trader who made a contribution to a charity out of the proceeds of his selling would be outside the Act no matter how high his wages of selling or commission earnings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion I mentioned the situation in relation to casual trading on some of our national primary and national secondary roads. These sales which are carried on on such roads outside certain towns are proving a dangerous hazard to traffic.  On the main Dublin-Limerick road sometimes between 20 and 40 caravans are parked, doing a brisk trade.  This can be seen on the heath near Portlaoise, at the entrance to Tullamore: television sets, washing machines, bedclothes, curtains, carpets, all sorts of things are being sold.  This causes a great traffic hazard because it is going on beside national primary and secondary roads.  There is also the hygiene aspect to be considered.  At the moment when these traders move off all sorts of refuse, cartons, bags, packing and other litter, is left behind.  These sites have no hygiene facilities whatsoever.  Hundreds of people attend these sales and the area is left devastated, causing a massive eyesore. Local authorities will have to impose strict conditions in regard to this matter, particularly to ensure that trading will not be allowed on national primary and secondary roadsides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy has said about this type of trading along national primary and secondary roads.  We have all seen the terrible mess being created.  This Bill will empower local authorities to designate places where outdoor trading can be a service rather than a nuisance to the public. When this matter was being discussed <Col N="252" /> by the Restrictive Practices Commission, 40 local authorities suggested that the legislation should be updated.  Under this Bill local authorities will be empowered to designate areas and I would be surprised if they do not make the best possible use of the authority given to them to ensure that the nuisance we are so familiar with will not be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it is up to local authorities to designate areas which they think suitable.  We are all aware of the concern of planning authorities in regard to sites along primary and secondary routes and I would be amazed if they allowed the trading or the continuation of a nuisance along such routes.  I feel certain local authorities will live up to their responsibilities under this Bill when it becomes law, that they will try to implement it in the best interests of the public at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This section and section 2 overlap in certain respects.  If occasional trading is carried out in the functional area of a local authority they will have power to impose certain restrictions in regard to distance from roads and so on. They will have to provide properly serviced sites.  They will have to have regard to infringement of market rights.  They will have to provide hard surfaces which will be tarred.  Toilet and water facilities will have to be supplied for cleansing purposes.  The licence fee for a casual trader will cost £100 and the permit will cost £20.  Surely it is not suggested that this will finance the servicing of the areas to be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is envisaged that in the designated areas local authorities will provide the facilities the Deputy has been talking about.  The intention is to provide proper facilities for traders and the general public.  There will be no objection in principle if a local authority <Col N="253" /> impose a charge on occasional traders for the use of any amenities provided or for the use of accommodation and so on.  I assume the local authorities will be empowered to make extra charges to cover facilities and amenities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the good intention in the Bill and the genuine efforts by the Minister personally and the Department, but is the Minister honestly telling me local authorities will be able to finance these projects?  These areas will have to be provided and maintained.  The traders have made a livelihood from this business and they cannot be crossed off completely.  They will continue to try to make a living in this way.  In future they will be expected to trade in properly serviced and hygienic conditions.  The bulk of those serviced areas will be financed by the local authorities, who are having financial difficulties at the moment.  I do not believe the local authorities will have sufficient finance to provide those areas. They may have to purchase sites or they may have sites which they have set aside for some other deserving purpose.  They could have set those areas aside for playing areas or for housing.  If they have lands which they have purchased for specific reasons will they now provide them for casual trading areas?  If they do not, will they purchase other lands?  Have they sufficient money to purchase them?</P>
      <P>There are many good points in the Bill and this side of the House welcomes it.  I do not want to see the Bill coming in with a flourish, because of the good points in it, and in one year or two years' time being useless because proper areas have not been set up by local authorities.  I do not want to see it breaking down because proper tarmacadamed areas have not been provided which people can drive in and drive out of.  If toilet facilities and water supply are not provided for those areas they are useless.  The amount of money coming in from the licence fees and permits will not be sufficient to pay the considerable cost which will be incurred on providing those casual trading areas.</P>

      <P>The Bill does not preclude local authorities from making <Col N="254" /> any extra charges they consider necessary to provide the facilities which the Deputy refers to.  The provision of those amenities is a matter for other Ministries.  The local authorities may collect £20 per licence issued and, if it is found that this amount is inadequate, there is provision in the Bill to bring in an order to increase it.  While it may not be the complete answer at least it leaves it open to increase the fees if local authorities find it necessary to have those extra charges made.</P>

      <P>If it is found that the licence and permit fees being charged by local authorities are not sufficient, the initial cost may be increased.  I believe it will be difficult to get those casual trading areas set aside.  The Minister is faced with a double-edged sword here.  Unless proper areas are set aside there will be difficulty in getting the casual traders to go into them.  Those people will do everything humanly possible to avoid going into those areas if the proper facilities are not provided.  They will continue their casual trading in the areas where they have been accustomed to do business. The local authorities will have to provide proper areas and I do not believe they will have sufficient funds to provide the proper facilities.  I am deeply concerned about this because I would like to see the Bill working properly.  If areas have not the proper facilities, it will be impossible to get casual traders to go into them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> On second stage I spoke about the fee which it is proposed to charge for a licence under the section.  A licence granted under this section will authorise <Col N="255" /> a casual trader to carry on business directly himself or through a servant or agent.  This means he could be operating in a number of towns at the same time and on the same day.  The charge for this licence is to be £100.  That is ridiculous. It might be adequate for a small casual trader who operates in one particular town, but it is absurd to prescribe a licence fee of £100 for a chainstore merchant, a man operating in a number of towns on the same day.</P>
      <P>Under one of the subsections of this section the Minister has authority to vary the licence fee as he sees fit, but as of now we are specifying that we think the fee of £100 is adequate to act as a deterrent or to compensate for the fact that the casual trader does not contribute rates to the town in which he operates.  I am convinced that the fee of £100 is inadequate. The section should be amended to provide that a fee of £100 will cover the casual trader in a named town or two named towns, but if he wants to spread his wings and multiply his selling outlets to cover more towns he will have to get a further licence and will have to pay a further fee.  It was announced on the radio this morning that a person who violates an Act &mdash; I cannot recall what the Act is &mdash; is guilty of an offence and he will be fined £100 or six months in jail. A fine of £100 is laughable in today's terms and could not be expected to be a deterrent.  The Department should have second thoughts about matters such as this when introducing Bills.  I mentioned this on Second Stage and I got the impression then that the Minister agreed with me.  That is why I am surprised that he has not brought in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy in relation to the fee so far as certain types of traders are concerned but in regard to having a graded system of licensing, there would be some problems.  We must bear in mind the type of people whom Deputy Enright referred to &mdash; those small operators who have been providing a service and who attend at local fairs and marts. These are people who could not be <Col N="256" /> regarded in any way as being well-off. But there are the other people, those who are operating in a big way and who are moving around from town to town.  At least what we are doing is a step towards trying to bring them into the net.  First, because of their having to pay a licence fee, they will be making some contribution to the State.  While a £100 fee may not be adequate in some cases, there would be many problems in endeavouring to have a graded form of licence and this was the dilemma facing the Department in arriving at this figure.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill to have the fee amended by way of order.  If the legislation is found not to be operating successfully the Minister will have the authority to amend it and, if necessary, to increase the fee substantially.</P>
      <P>There is the question also of the areas that will be designated by the local authorities for those traders, a number of whom are likely to find themselves restricted to a great extent if the local authorities implement the legislation properly.  Because the elected representatives will be responsible for designating the areas we can be confident that the local traders and any others who should be protected will be taken into consideration in the process of designating areas and of trying to restrict as much as possible the abuses that we all know are being perpetrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has touched the kernel of the problem in referring to the different types of traders involved.  I know of many small traders who have been trying to make a living in difficult times.  They have their problems.  Even those who operate from flashy caravans and who have colour television sets are very often only barely making a living. However, there is a large number&mdash;perhaps the majority of those involved in casual trading&mdash;who are making sizeable profits and who up to now have made little or no return to the State in the form of VAT, income tax or social insurance contributions.  Neither have they ever paid rates.  In some cases hot goods are being sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is still possible to amend the Bill so <Col N="257" /> as to allow for a graded type of licence and thereby to ensure that the larger traders involved in this type of business would be levied at a far higher rate of licence fee than would be the case of the smaller man.  The same applies in respect of rates so far as business people are concerned.  Those with the larger premises pay more.  They also have higher overheads.  Perhaps the problem could be resolved by basing the fee on the number of employees engaged by the applicant. In this way the family outfit, consisting, perhaps, of husband, wife and one child, would be protected against the higher outlay.  Many of those bigger traders who move from area to area are very wealthy. A fee of £100 would not mean anything to them.  Those traders have a responsibility towards anyone employed by them in that they should ensure that any such employee is paying income tax and social insurance.  All of this could be operated by way of graded licence and permit fees. I would not suggest that the smaller type trader should be interfered with.</P>
    <P>There is a danger, because of the way this section is worded, that a trader who obtains a licence can have many people working on his behalf.  I should like some clarification from the Minister on this point.</P>
    <P>In my opinion that is the way the Bill reads.  If that is correct the Minister will have to bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  If necessary, we will draft an amendment ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will note that the Minister makes the regulations in relation to fees and he may vary them at any time.  If in the light of experience we find it necessary to increase the fees, appropriate regulations will be made.  In addition, there is provision in the Bill for special rates of fees for specified classes of traders.  If the Department receive representations on the matter naturally we will take them into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Enright have been saying in relation to this matter.  At least the Department will have authority to deal with the specific matters the Deputies have raised in relation to fees.  At the moment we <Col N="258" /> must accept that with regard to some small traders who have been providing a service during the years the Bill might be a little harsh on them in the matter of increased fees.  I ask the Deputies to bear with us on this point.  We are aware of the questions they have raised.  We have authority under the Bill to introduce the kind of restrictions they have mentioned and we will be glad to deal with these matters when representations are made by interested parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I appreciate that there is machinery in the Bill to enable the fees to be increased but I have been around for long enough to know that this kind of inadequate provision can remain unchanged for a very long time.  At one time there was a licence known as a general dealer's licence which enabled a person to buy scrap.  The person had to apply to the District Court for a licence and for 50 years the fee for that licence was half-a-crown in old money terms.  The fee was never changed.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that once this section goes through with a provision for a charge of £100 for the entire country for 12 months, it will remain that way.  I suggest to the Minister that this proposal does not merit serious consideration.  Let us take the example of a small trader who has a PLV of £25.  He contributes in rates at least £300 to the local authority and if the rate is more than £12 in the £ he will pay more.  If that person's valuation is £50 he will pay between £600 and £900. In addition he has to pay social insurance and other charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are enabling a casual trader to operate every day of the week and in as many towns as he has agents to work for him.  That is nonsense.  We suggest that £100 for that kind of permission is ridiculous.  I agree that there is a case to be made for the small casual trader or the person who operates in only one town.  However, I do not think there would be any great difficulty in confining the licence to a specific town or towns.  It is my view that even in respect of a person who comes to a town each week during the year in opposition to local traders, <Col N="259" /> the sum of £100 is not sufficient.  If one divides £100 by 50 one gets £2 as the answer.  That is what a person who trades in a town once a week will be charged. We must take inflation into account. Money is not nearly as valuable now as it was but we do not seem to recognise that fact in this Bill.  This measure deals in antiquated money terms.  I did not put down an amendment on this point but if the Minister will not amend the section I will be forced in the interests of commonsense to draft an amendment for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to reply to the points raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  All of us accept that there may be some individuals who will not be caught to the degree that Deputy Fitzpatrick and many of us would like, but because of the provisions in the Bill the Revenue Commissioners will be able to catch those people for payment of the various taxes they have been avoiding up to now.  In itself that is a step forward and it will help to get rid of the unfair competition that existed previously.</P>
      <P>The local authority will designate the area in which these people may operate. They can designate an area which will prevent them from operating on the large scale on which they operate at the moment.  I should like to assure Deputies that we will keep a close watch on the situation and try to ensure that traders will not get away with things to the extent suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The Bill is a step in the right direction in that we are introducing necessary controls that have been demanded by traders, local authorities and by a large section of the community. That is the purpose of the Bill.  We are trying to eliminate abuses that exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I appreciate that.  In reference to the number of such licences issued over the years, the Minister may remember that on Second Stage I asked if he had any idea of the number of such licences issued in 1969 and in 1979.  I thought that there had been a huge increase in the number of licences issued because of the huge increase in the number of such traders around the countryside, particularly in the provincial towns. I was surprised at the numbers given to me by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, in reply to my question. The Minister for Justice, in a reply on 27 November, stated that the number <Col N="261" /> of pedlar's licences issued in 1969 was 65 and only 34 were issued in 1979.  In reply to a question about hawkers' licences the Minister for Finance said that there were 822 such licences issued in 1969 and 829 licences issued in 1979.  In actual fact there is an overall decrease whereas from my observations the numbers of such people have increased enormously.  They are a multiple of what existed in 1969. Can the Minister explain the reason for the huge increase in such trading and the fact that the number of licences overall has decreased?  I wonder if many such traders are utilising the one licence, trading in Birr, Thurles, Cavan and Dungarvan and all using the one licence &mdash; a number of people working for that licence fee and actually operating in a number of different centres.  Could that be the explanation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">

      <P>The question of limiting the number of these people will certainly be covered in the Bill.  From now on we shall be in a position to ensure that only people with licences will be entitled to trade.  The Bill gives a great deal of authority to the Garda to ensure that we shall not have illegal trading in future.  If, as is evidenced in the reply to Deputy Deasy's question, the indications are that the number of hawkers' licences have decreased rather than increased despite the fact that we all see this type of trading along the various roads and in the various towns, it shows how necessary it is to implement this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister has said that the Bill is an improvement on the present position and there can be no doubt about that.  Of course it is a big improvement and we welcome it.  However, because of the absurdity of section 4 with which we are dealing at present, the Minister is put in the position of apologising for the shortcomings of the Bill before it even leaves this House.  That is a great pity. No imagination whatever has been shown in the drafting or in the instructions to the draftsman in respect of section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (10) of section 4 gives the Minister authority to vary, either generally or in relation to a specific class, the amount to be paid for the licence fee. The Minister is very cleverly &mdash; and I admire him for it &mdash; taking refuge in using this subsection as an umbrella and as an excuse for the weakness of the Bill as it stands.  I wonder if subsection (10) gives him power to do any more than vary, by increasing or reducing, the amount of the fee charged.  Does it enable him to say that a man who is operating in a number of towns should be charged more than a man who is only operating in one town? I could see legislation being necessary in the future to enable the Minister to do what we say he should do.  What we are saying is that a casual trader who is genuinely trading in a small way in one town should not be bled white because he is <Col N="263" /> giving some sort of a service but, if a multi-town trader appears on the scene, he should have to pay and he is not being asked to pay at the moment.  Section 3 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>A person shall not engage in casual trading in a casual trading area unless he is, or is the servant or agent acting as such, of a person who holds a casual trading licence....</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the wording of that subsection.  A casual trading licence will cover every town in Ireland if the person operating under it is the servant or agent of the licensee.  That will be the only question and it will be a hard one to check on.  It might land him in other difficulties with the Revenue Commissioners or the Inspector of Taxes if he is operating all over the place.  It should be confined to named towns.  The Minister should bring this section back to his draftsman and have a further think about it.  He should bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  Any amendment we bring in will not be adequate.  It is very likely that it will be no more than a platform on which to mount an argument and we have made the argument fully.</P>
    <P>This is a flaw in the Bill.  It is a shortcoming. The object of the Bill is to do two things.  First, to regulate the place where these casual traders trade in a town.  The Bill will succeed in that objective. The local authorities have power to acquire the market rights, and they have power to override rights given by charters in certain towns.  The Minister assured me of that on Second Stage and I accept it.  When this Bill is enacted it will enable the local authorities to regulate the places in towns where these people can trade. That is an enormous improvement.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the Bill is to restore some sort of equality and equity between resident traders in a town and the people who come in one day a week or a month.  The Bill fails miserably to achieve that objective because the licence fee mentioned is absurd.  It would not buy more than a drink for the salesman and the lorry driver.  It would not buy a meal.  I appeal to the Minister to have <Col N="264" /> second thoughts about this and to bring in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has covered a number of points.  I will not repeat myself on the question of the fees. On the question of a number of people using the licence as a cover to trade in different areas, the problem is that a shopkeeper, for instance, can have any member of his family doing his business for him.  We are advised that it might be unconstitutional to provide a restriction which would limit the licensee in such a way that only he himself could carry on the business at a particular point.</P>

We have authority in the Bill to have grading in so far as we can introduce separate licences for certain types of trading. If we find the Bill is not operating in the manner in which it is intended, we can introduce these extra fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has raised a point which is worthy of consideration.  I am not brushing it aside when I say this.  On the question of using one licence to operate in many towns, if the local authorities limit their casual trading areas they will restrict the movement of many of these people who can move around quite easily at present. We do not envisage large areas being made available to these people for their trading.  Consideration will be given to the local people who have been providing a service and who have been carrying out <Col N="265" /> their operations over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>It is not very easy to cover all aspects of this type of trading.  In fairness to the Department, they have done a very good job.  They looked at every possible angle. This type of trading has been going on over a number of years.  Representations have been received from many people and, in the light of those representations, this Bill has been prepared.  We have gone as far as we can possibly go in relation to most of the matters raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I know there are certain loopholes and certain snags which people will try to avail of, but that happens in the case of every Bill introduced.</P>

      <P>I could not agree with the Minister's counterpoints to Deputy Fitzpatrick's arguments.  A good deal of the purpose of the Bill will be defeated if we leave it as open-ended as it is at present. It could mean, in effect, that one casual trader who has a licence could have 50 or 60 agents operating in different centres.  That defeats the purpose of any licensing system.  It is unfair to draw a comparison with the fixed shopkeeper. His location is known and his hours of business are fixed.  This is not the case with the casual trader who can have 50 or 60 different locations on any one day because of the open-endedness of this legislation.  There must be a definite restriction in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that other people operating under a licensing system are restricted in order to keep their numbers at a tolerable level.  A man engaged in the licensed trade has to state on his licence where he is doing business and <Col N="266" /> within what hours.  This is not the case with the casual trading licence.  A salmon fisherman has to work within certain hours on certain days and within certain weeks of the year; his licence is extremely restrictive and if he wishes to move from one area to another he must relinquish his licence and get sanction for the new area.  The casual trader is having the best of all worlds: he can operate in 50 or 60 different locations with the one licence as the Bill stands.  The casual trader should be restricted to one location and he should have to say in what hours he will operate.  The location need not be constant, it could be Birr on Monday, Nenagh on Tuesday, Thurles on Wednesday and so on.  That is the only way in which to get control.  Otherwise there will be a proliferation of casual traders.  There is nothing in this section to restrict the number of licences.  There is no mention of an upper limit.  The number for last year was 829 but 800,000 people could have the credentials to qualify for such a licence. The Bill is not restrictive in that regard and it does not go as far as it should to solve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister in his most recent statement. This Bill is like a colander it is so full of loopholes.  It will cause more problems than it will solve.  A trader with one licence can trade at many locations on the same day.  The licence should not be as open as that.  The person should have to apply to trade at different locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin city and county area people are coming in, sometimes straight off the boat, to trade for a few hours on bank holiday weekends at Easter and Christmas holiday periods, when the money is there and the local authority are not at hand to take any action.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has said that this Bill confines the trading to a particular area but I am not sure that it does.  If traders who come off the boat on Saturday are approached by a garda for a licence, they can fool the garda for a few hours and they are away again on Monday morning.  The only remedy for this is a fine on the spot for those who cannot produce the licence. We have this sort of trading in Blanchardstown, <Col N="267" /> Tallaght, Swords and so on. The Minister need only go to any of the satellite towns around the city to see the kind of casual trading that goes on.  This Bill will not tie these people down although many people looked forward to it to get rid of this terrible nuisance. People are being scourged by roadside traders selling anything from potatoes to window frames and carpets.  Many of these traders are not even now operating within the law.  They go around in 504 or 604 Peugeots &mdash; cars for which most of us have to wait &mdash; which are untaxed and in many cases uninsured.  How would the Minister pin these people down?  I appeal to the Minister not to push the Bill through today, to take it back and have a look at it and introduce some amendments so that he can be seen to be wholeheartedly tackling the problem.  This Bill will only restrict the man who is trading to earn a living for his family but the person who is trying to fool us is the person who will not be caught under the Bill.</P>

      <P>The local authority have not that authority at the moment. Casual traders can set up anywhere that is suitable to them.  Under this Bill the local authority can designate trading areas.  They can also decide on the hours of trading.  It will also be necessary for a trader, even though he may have a licence to operate in a number of areas, to have a permit in each area.  The interested elected representatives, whether at local level or here, will ensure that this Bill will operate so that casual traders will not get away with the things they are getting away with at the moment and so that small grocers and shopkeepers who <Col N="268" /> are paying rates and all the other taxes to keep the town going will not be put out of business, as has been the case up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The monthly rent of the tenant in question as determined by the county council was £3.42 under the 1979 national rents scheme.  This rent was payable from 1 March 1979, and was based on income from widow's pension payable at the beginning of December 1978, and estimated income from land valuation. The correct monthly rent payable from 1 May 1980, calculated in accordance with the terms of the 1980 national rents scheme is £16.51.  This rent is based on income from widow's pension payable at February last and estimated income from land valuation.</P>
      <P>I understand from the county council that the rent from 1 May 1980, as initially calculated, amounted to £21.97 per month.  This rent was incorrect due to confusion which arose in respect of the income from widow's pension payable at February last.  This matter has now been clarified and the rent reduced to £16.51 per month which will apply retrospectively to the beginning of May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the current rent is calculated on income payable at February last and that any subsequent increase in pension which may be granted to this tenant will not be taken into <Col N="273" /> account for rent purposes until the next annual revision of income takes place.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply but is he aware that the sole income of the tenant in this case is the widow's pension?  She is a widow with a large young family and her rent according to the Minister, was increased from £3.42 to over £21 and has now been reduced to £16.51 per month.  Does the Minister not think this is a brutal increase in the case of a woman who literally cannot make ends meet?  Is he also aware that the increase in the widow's pension barely took care of inflation so that while her rent has been increased by approximately five times, her income has remained the same?

Land was valued at £7.25, an income estimated at £15 per £1 valuation. Her rent was calculated at 79p per week or £3.42 a month.  That is the general breakdown.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister must realise that the valuation of the land is static.  Therefore, the only increase was the miserable increase in the widow's pension which did not take care of inflation.  Because of that her rent is increased from £3.42 to £16.50.  Does the Minister realise that this is the effect his rent order 1980 has had on these isolated cases, and this is not the worst of them, strange as it may appear? Some people had their rents increased from £4 or £5 per month to about £40 a month.  This is a poor way of paying for election promises.</P>

Local authorities are required to use for these purposes income from their capital receipts from special loan prepayments and 55 per cent of the proceeds of sales of local authority houses.  The balance is made up by borrowing from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council's expenditure on these schemes in the nine month period to 30 September 1980 was £5,039,400. This expenditure was financed by issues from the fund totalling £4,833,000 and capital receipts from internal sources should have been sufficient to more than meet the shortfall.  In these circumstances, it is not clear that any issue from the Local Loans Fund to meet supplementary grant payments would be justified nor is it clear why there should have been any delay in paying grants in the West Cork area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The maintenance and management of local authority rented dwellings is the responsibility of the authority.  I have no evidence to support the Deputy's suggestion that the recent fires in the schemes mentioned in his question were caused by electrical wiring faults.  I understand that the city engineer is conducting an investigation into the causes of these fires which occurred in the corporation's housing estates.  I may add that in the course of normal <Col N="280" /> maintenance work, by the corporation, electrical wiring is inspected and replaced where necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I am referring to houses built in the 1930's at which time they probably would have been accepted as being up to standard.  I am talking about houses where fires have been occurring because of obsolete wiring. Is the Minister not prepared to accept responsibility to ensure that all residents of local authority houses are guaranteed maximum safety.  I am informing the Minister here that people living in the houses referred to in the question are virtually sitting on a time bomb.  Indeed the local ESB have refused to connect lights in some of these houses because of their obsolete and inadequate wiring system.  I mean that, they are virtually sitting on a time bomb and there could be a holocaust in Limerick city if what I request is not done soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence to show that such fires were caused by electrical faults.  There is no evidence available to support that assumption.  The city engineer is conducting an investigation into the causes of the fires which occurred this year at the request of the corporation's housing department.  So far in 1980, ten have occurred in a corporation housing estate.  I have no evidence that the fault was an electrical one, and no evidence has come to my Department, but if the Deputy can give me evidence I will have it followed up.</P>

There are no funds available to me out of which a special allocation of moneys may be made to any local authority for increased maintenance works in the light of the already high subvention from Exchequer funds provided in subsidising local authority rented dwellings.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer generally meets in full the loan charges incurred in the provision of local authority houses for renting. Local authorities are responsible for the maintenance and management of their rented housing estates and for this purpose may retain all rental income and miscellaneous receipts in addition to a proportion of the proceeds of sales of houses to tenants.</P>

      <P>An initial capital allocation of £700,000 was made to Cork Corporation in respect of the payment of local authority housing loans and grants in the six month period ended on 30 June 1980.  This allocation is funded from the internal capital resources generated by the local authority with the balance being issued from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased demand for loan payments which followed on the increase in the loan and income limits last January, the needs of each authority operating the schemes since the end of June have been assessed monthly and payment made on that basis. At 30 September, the corporation's expenditure, including incoming debit balance, on the loan and grant schemes was £1,280,000.  Internal receipts generated by the corporation at that date were in the region of £570,000 and a total of £530,000 was issued from the Local Loans Fund to bring total receipts to £1,100,000.  On October 24 a further instalment of £170,000 issued to the corporation from the Local Loans Fund, and a further sum will be made available before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Available resources do not permit the issue of additional funds from the Local Loans Fund to the corporation but these amounts, together with the further amounts arising from internal resources, will ensure that payments on maturing loans will not be delayed unreasonably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason his Department delayed posting letters to Donegal housing grant applicants informing them that their grants were being refused particularly when the letters had been typed weeks before 6 November 1980 and in some cases typed for over six weeks, and were ready for posting in the normal way by the officials in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department did not, as implied in the Deputy's question, delay in any way the issue of letters, once they were ready for posting.  Because of the large volume of correspondence in relation to housing grants, there has been in some isolated cases a longer than usual interval between the typing of those letters and their checking, signature and issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me how many letters were typed in the month of September, lay in the Minister's office during the month of October until the by-election in Donegal was over and then had the dates obliterated and new dates typed on them?  What was the purpose in doing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment I get in my office about 800 letters a week in regard to grants.  I checked out in relation to Donegal to see how many were held up.  There were only four letters held up, two of them were bad news and one was good news and bad news, a sewerage grant allowed and the other one was the approval of an improvement grant. Those were the only letters held up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister's check as accurate as mine?  Constituents have come to me with letters and on the reverse side of them one can clearly see the month of September typed while on the front November is typed.  The news <Col N="286" /> was always bad.  Was there any cynical reason why the Department of the Environment kept back telling people bad news until after the by-election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of putting down this question was to ask the Minister if he would, as an exception, grant house improvement grants to the tenants of this particular estate.  It is a 90-house <Col N="287" /> estate in Tipperary town.  They have no fireplaces as the estate is centrally heated. I am aware that in the vast majority of those houses they have no central heating and in some cases no light.  This has been caused by the prohibitive ESB cost. Would the Minister reconsider his views on this and, as an exception, give house improvement grants to those people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>No applications for grants were received by 1 February 1980, the final date for receipt of applications for house improvements grants including solid fuel conversions in respect of the Carronreddy Estate in Tipperary town. Under the Housing Regulations 1980 a local authority cannot be paid a grant for the installation of solid fuel heating. However, local authority tenants, who were prepared to meet the net cost of improvement works could, with the consent of the local authority, apply for and be paid grants.  In certain circumstances, the local authority could get a grant for certain improvement works, carried out on housing estates, such as the provision of a hot and cold water supply, roof repairs, bathrooms and additional accommodation.  In all cases, applications had to be received by 1 February 1980.  We received no applications from those people before the closing date.  If we received the applications they would have needed the consent of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that while tenants did not apply individually for inclusion under this scheme the Tipperary Urban District Council together with the county council are actively pursuing it with his Department?  Will the Minister tolerate the position where, in this 90-house scheme in County Tipperary, there are houses without any heating whatsoever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that if they were so interested in that they were badly advised because in the first instance, they should have made application to my Department by 1 February last.  If they had I assure the Deputy I <Col N="288" /> would have had them sympathetically considered.  I regret, in the circumstances, I cannot be more helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the figures quoted by the Deputies which have been extracted from the recently published NESC report on economic and social policy.</P>
      <P>The measures taken by the Government since July 1977 to promote owner-occupation of new houses and in particular the steps taken to assist first-time owner-occupiers have largely been successful. This is reflected in the fact that the number of non-local authority house completions has increased from 16,700 in 1976 to 20,300 last year.  The corresponding figure for this year is likely to be a record.  The number of grants paid for first-time owner-occupiers increased from 7,200 in 1978 to 8,100 last year. The number of grants paid during the first 11 months of this year showed an increase of 1,000 on the corresponding period last year.  The proportion of first-time owner-occupiers of new houses obtaining house purchase loans from the main lending agencies increased from 62 per cent in 1978 to 66 per cent during the first nine months of this year.</P>
      <P>Apart from the £1,000 grant, the Government have introduced a number of financial incentives during the past three years to promote owner-occupation of new houses, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The SDA loan and income limits were increased on three occasions by a total of 166 per cent and 134 per cent, respectively;</P>
      <P>(2)  A temporary subsidy was introduced this year which enabled building societies to increase their investment rates and let mortgage rates stand at 14.15 per cent.  With the general downward movement of interest rates, there is now no need for the subsidy;</P>
      <P>(3)  The amount of personal interest, including house mortgage interest, qualifying for income tax relief has been increased from £2,000 to £4,800;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Since 1979, a grant is available to meet portion of the administrative costs of the National <Col N="290" /> Association of Building Cooperatives;</P>
    <P>(5)  The subsidisable cost limit on each housing site provided by local authorities for modestly-priced private housing was increased from £900 to £1,500.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the number of new house grants paid in 1977 was less than half the total paid in 1973.  This was due mainly to the introduction by the Coalition Government in 1976 of an income and valuation limit for the purpose of qualifying for the grant.  Furthermore, the following examples show the lack of concern of the Coalition Government as regards the owner-occupation of new houses:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The number of non-local authority houses completed declined from 18,600 in 1973 to 16,700 in 1976;</P>
    <P>(b)  The SDA loan and income limits remained static between September 1973 and July 1977 despite the fact that house prices and earnings more than doubled during this period;</P>
    <P>(c)  During their four years in office, they never introduced any incentive to promote non-profit housing activity;</P>
    <P>(d)  The subsidisable cost limit on sites provided by local authorities for private housing remained unchanged between 1972 and 1977.</P>
    <P>The adequacy of the measures necessary to promote owner-occupation of new houses generally and assist the first-time owner-occupier in particular is being kept under review by the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his knowledge of history but I would have preferred an answer to the question. Does the Minister agree with the NESC report to which he refers that the overall picture is one of increasing difficulty for new house purchasers and would he indicate also what action he proposed to make in the matter as distinct from looking at the record of more successful Ministers?</P>

      <P>When I came to the Department in January I increased the loan subsidy from £9,000 to £12,000 in respect of new houses and I increased the limit from £4,000 to £5,500.  Let us be clear about this.  I was told at the time by the people opposite that these increases were not sufficient but I can tell those people now that the changes have proved highly successful and that there has been an unprecedented flow of applications to the various local authorities for these loans.  In addition, house-purchase finance is being reviewed in accordance with paragraph 49&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It deals with casual trading where the licence is for the purpose of selling fish, horticultural and agricultural produce and articles made by the person who holds the licence.

I appreciate there may be difficulties in drafting and enforcing such a provision but it would be of considerable help to the producers and also it would benefit the economy.  I am rather disappointed that a person whose sells imported foodstuffs will be charged such a minimal licence fee.  I admit this is not of major importance but if we make a change it would be a step in the right direction. Perhaps the Minister will consider this matter before we take Report Stage.  It would benefit home producers of horticultural and agricultural produce and also those people selling fish.</P>

I hope the Minister will consider this on Report Stage.  If necessary, we ourselves can put down an amendment on it.  With the vast amount of imports of different commodities now coming into this country, it is important that, when we have an opportunity such as is presented by this Bill, we ensure that our own producers are helped.  Could I have the Minister's views on that?  Has the Minister no views on that?</P>

      <P>We all agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Enright in relation to trying to protect our own people. He must be aware that, because we are coming into the area of free trade and so on, we cannot insert any clauses in the Bill which would in any way be against the existing regulations.  This is the difficulty that I can see in regard to the Deputy's suggestion.  We all agree with his sentiments, but that is the problem.</P>

      <P>In subsection (b) there is a reference to articles made by a person who holds the licence, or his spouse or children.  That, in its own way, is a safeguard for people who are producing items for sale and is certainly a good idea.  In regard to the earlier point, a section can be provided which would be of benefit. I am concerned that at times one has great difficulty in obtaining produce, such as potatoes and vegetables, grown in this country.  Every effort should be made to entice the casual traders referred to in this Bill to purchase, sell and dispose of Irish produce.  I hope the Minister will go <Col N="312" /> a stage further than he is going to meet this request.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> To some extent, the point which I made on section 4 in regard to the charge for a licence authorising a person to engage in casual trading arises here in regard to a permit.  Under section 5, a local authority may issue a permit authorising the casual trader to engage in casual trading within the area of its jurisdiction and the fee is £20.  For that fee of £20, the person concerned is covered for 12 months, whether he attends once a week, once a month, or, indeed, whether he attends there every day, which would be most unlikely.  Some of these casual traders engage in casual trading within an urban area on, perhaps, the Tuesday of each week, with others attending on only the first Tuesday of each month.  Are these people to be charged the same fee of £20?  Again, while a permit fee of £20 might be reasonable in regard to one type of trader, it might not be sufficient in regard to another type of trader who was virtually engaging in full-time trading under the guise of casual trading.  I do not intend or wish to be in any way offensive but I say that these two sections, numbers 4 and 5, lack imagination.  They lack any evidence of thought as to how equality might be introduced into trading as between resident and casual traders or, indeed, under this section, as to how equality and equity might be introduced as between one casual trader and another.  It appears that if a person turns up on only one day of the year he pays £20 and if he turns up on 365 days of the year, he also pays £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also stated that the local authority shall issue a permit in respect of a specific place.  Does that mean that the holder of the permit will have the right to that place throughout the year?  What happens if he <Col N="313" /> turns up on only a couple of days of the year?  Will some other person be prevented from using that stall or selected place to carry on business there?  This section has overlooked a lot of things.  It has taken the easy way out by saying that a permit will be granted to a licence holder, without thinking how often he will turn up or how often he will use the area allotted to him.  I would like the Minister's views on all these things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy relates to the issue of a permit.  A permit will be granted by the local authority for a particular area.  That confers on the applicant the right to sell in that particular area.  It is a matter for himself as to how often he uses the area when he holds that permit.  It is very hard to write all the things mentioned by the Deputy into a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>One item concerns me in regard to permits and, in fact, in regard to licences, since they are closely interwoven. Quite a considerable amount of legislation has been passed through the House in regard to people purchasing items.  They are protected under the Sale of Goods Act and many other Acts.  On the other hand, one can purchase from these casual traders televisions which can cost over £600.  A sizeable quantity of goods can be purchased in this way.  If I purchase a coloured television for a sum of £600 and am not well up as to the quality of the television set and have no opportunity of seeing if it works, if on getting home I discover it is absolutely useless, a dud, where do I go from there? The permit fee is only £20.  Someone may decide on one day to get a permit to attend, perhaps, some where in Mayo, Offaly, Cork, Wexford or wherever. He goes to these places and may have 20 televisions valued at £500 each.  He gets all this money together and people in the locality may find that the television sets are absolutely useless.  This Casual Trading Bill leaves those people with no redress.  There is no protection for them. Will the permit be of any help to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The permit refers to the area of trading.  It is issued by the <Col N="314" /> local authority.  The licence gives the person the right to trade in that area.  I do not know whether the question the Deputy is raising comes under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there is no way of getting after these people if something which the Deputy outlined occurs.  Under the Bill they will have to display their licence to trade clearly, their names, and so on.  In that way it will be possible to keep a close check on the type of business these people carry out.</P>

      <P>Section 5 (2) provides:</P>
      <P>An application for a casual trading permit shall be made to the local authority concerned not less than 30 days before the first day on which it is intended to engage in the casual trading to which the application relates.</P>
      <P>I submit that before a local authority issue such a licence an applicant should be obliged to furnish a bond to the local authority setting out that there is some form of protection for the consumer.  It is necessary to have some type of protection. We are speaking of vast sums of money in some instances.  This would be one way of protecting the consumer who purchased a faulty television set.  I am not saying that these people will defraud their customers, but this would be a safeguard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Under certain sections of the Bill the local authorities can decide whether or not to grant a permit. Section 5 (4) provides that a local authority may refuse to grant a casual trading permit to a person who has been convicted of an offence under section 3 of this Act.  Everybody who applies for a licence or a permit may not automatically qualify.</P>

There are functions such as football matches or Macra na Feirme field days where traders may feel they <Col N="315" /> can give a service and they might not have 30 days in which to give notice.  Can the local authority issue a permit in these special circumstances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.  There is one point in relation to a question raised by Deputy Enright. Shopkeepers are not required to hold bonds.  We would be discriminating if we introduced the type of regulation mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point I was making.  We have now come to the nub of the issue.  A shopkeeper carries on business in established premises.  He has his assets, his shop, his house, and so on. Normally he is a member of the community. If faulty products are purchased from him the person who suffers the loss can bring an action against the shopkeeper. A casual trader may be in a certain place today and may never come back again.  A hundred television sets could be sold in a town, all of poor quality.  The people who purchased them would be entitled to bring an action against the person who sold them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no protection for somebody who purchases something faulty.  Legally he is entitled to redress under the legislation which passed through the House.  In this case a person may obtain a licence for £100 and a permit for £20.  For an outlay of £120 he can make a killing by selling substandard goods.  He may make £10,000 by selling shoddy goods.  People who paid out their hard-earned money then find they have no redress because that person may be a fly-by-night, a man of straw.  The Minister should have a look at this between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence and permit will help to identify the casual trader for the purpose of obtaining redress.  His permanent address will have been provided in his application.  In that way he is identified, and this is something we did not have previously.  In relation to the bond, it strikes me that if a person starts up in business in a town or village it would be unfair to suggest that he should provide a bond in the same way as the Deputy suggests a casual trader should provide a bond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This section should be more closely looked at.  I was not referring to the person who purchases a property and sets up business in town having to get a bond, but somebody who comes into an area for one day and disposes of a lot of goods should be obliged to have an insurance bond.  Many such traders sell radios, televisions and so on to consumers. How they get them working to display them nobody knows but when the consumer gets home he cannot get them to work at all and when he returns the following day for redress he finds that the trader has lifted camp and gone.  There are unscrupulous people who seize opportunities to make fast money and then leave.  They are living on the edge of the law and there is no redress for consumers.  I would hate to find that a lot of the fine legislation that has gone through recently could be skirted because we were not right enough in this.  We must protect the ordinary man and woman who wishes to purchase goods from a casual trader.  Bonds have proved necessary in a lot of businesses and as casual traders have no proper headquarters they should be obliged to have an insurance bond.  An insurance company would ensure that a person was creditworthy and an insurance bond would provide an asset which a consumer could claim against if necessary.  In this instance consumers would be happy that they would have some comeback if they bought furniture or anything else from a casual trader.  I would ask the Minister to consider this on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go along with the Minister in relation to having a licence and permit clearly displayed for members of the public.  That sounds well in theory but when I visited the Continent I norticed that in bazaars and market places run under the direction of the local authority not alone must the people have their licence and permits displayed but the person behind the counter has to be identified as well.  I raised this question on Second Stage and the Minister more or less said that it would be difficult to enforce as it would be difficult to arrange photographs and identification.  I appreciate that, but it is essential that people should be identified.  It is usual now in supermarkets for shop assistants to wear their names on badges on their coats. People in casual trading should be identified by their name and photograph so that they will be easily identifiable and can be stopped if they are conducting a shady business.  This would be slightly difficult to enforce but the advantages outweigh the difficulties.  We must protect the ordinary consumer in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We went through this on Second Stage.  This section requires the trader to display his licence or a copy of it which would include his name and address when he is trading and he must also display his permit issued by the local authority.  We would regard an obligation for the casual trader to wear a badge as being discriminatory as no ordinary trader has to do that.  The supermarkets do not have to issue their employees with badgets.  I understand that that is more or less a public relations exercise.  An obligation to have a photograph included in the licence is something that does not apply to any other trader.  In relation to what the Deputy saw on the Continent, it must be remembered that in many Continental countries every person is required by law to carry some form of identification.  I am not so sure that we would want to have our freedom interfered with to that extent here.  We have gone into these matters very closely and <Col N="319" /> we have gone as far as we can in relation to this section of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister did not take this point more seriously.  The Minister said that customers will have protection in so far as the trader must have his name and address displayed either on the licence or on the permit, but it is not the same as in the case of a normal trader who will have a permanent address.  Is the Minister saying that a trader without a permanent address will not get a licence?  If that is so, than there is some protection.  The greatest offenders in Dublin city and county are people without permanent addresses.  Many of them come in by boat on a Friday night, trade on Saturday and Sunday and leave on Monday.  I would hazard a guess that many of them do not have a permanent address.  I am sure the Minister is aware that many traders live in mobile homes and move from one part of the country to another.  There is no hope of protecting the purchaser from such offenders because it is not possible to track them down.  Deputy Enright was trying to get this point across to the Minister but the Minister is avoiding the issue.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been awaited with anticipation by many people who wish to see the regularisation of roadside trading, but I fear the Bill will not be effective in this respect.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider these points with a view to introducing amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided in this Bill that a licence and a permit will be displayed and the Garda will have power to inspect the licence.  If it is in order, that will limit them in what they can do.  If colour televisions are on sale for £500 which are absolutely useless the Garda will not have power to interfere.  The purchaser will not have any rights because there will not <Col N="320" /> be a bond.  If the trader had to display his name and address and photograph on his lapel and if this information were kept in a register attached to the licence, there would be a safeguard because he would be traceable.  If he were found to have broken some regulation the Garda could take action.</P>

Regarding Deputy McMahon's point about traders coming from England, this is exactly what the Bill is designed to tackle.  The Garda will have authority to move in and seize goods.  Permits will have to be issued by the local authorities and traders caught operating without authority will face the confiscation of their goods by the Garda.</P>

People come from Britain to Dublin city and county regularly to engage in casual trading.  The Minister does not have to take my word for this.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I have been reading this section and see that it gives power to local authorities to designate areas as casual trading areas.  Section 7 (1) (a) (i) says that the local authority may designate any land, including a public road, in its functional area to which the public have access as of right&mdash; that is all right&mdash; or any land occupied by and in the functional area of the local authority.  The words &ldquo;occupied by&rdquo; are troubling me a little.  I can see a situation where a local authority might not, as of now, have within their area and in their occupation <Col N="323" /> any land they might wish to designate as a casual trading area, but they might enter into an arrangement with the owner of land to make land available as a casual trading area.  That land could not be said to be in the occupation of the local authority and the authority might not want it for any purpose other than a casual trading area.  Some member of the public might challenge the order in court on the grounds that at the time the designation order was made the land was not in the occupation of the local authority. The second paragraph deals with land in the occupation of another local authority.</P>
      <P>Instead of using the words &ldquo;in the occupation of the local authority&rdquo; we might insert the words &ldquo;or any other land in the functional area of the authority with the consent of the owner and occupier of that land&rdquo;.  That would remove the temptation for somebody to rely on this occupation provision because, I repeat, the land might not be in the occupation of the local authority at the time the order was made and the local authority might never want to occupy it for any purpose other than for a casual trading area.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not think the Minister gets my point.  If the point I am making is valid I would not blame him for not grasping it because it is a technical point.  It is a question of occupation.  The local <Col N="324" /> authority cannot designate land uless they are in occupation of it.  The local authority might not have any land but might enter into an arrangement with the owner of land to make land available for casual trading, without the local authority being in occupation of it.  If they made an order in those circumstances, it might be challenged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is something here the Minister will have to look at.  This section <Col N="326" /> gives a local authority the right to extinguish market rights.  If this does not work a very important part of this Bill will break down.  It is essential in provincial towns to get casual traders out of places in which, as of now, they have a right to trade under old market rights whether granted by charter or otherwise.  These casual traders are there, they will not move and they are thumbing their noses at local authorities for as long as I have been associated with local authorities.  As I said earlier, this part of the Bill is all very well but, if it does not work, the whole Bill will be rendered void.</P>
      <P>The House may take it that, when this Bill becomes law, it will be gone through with a fine-comb in order to challenge it in the courts.  Local authorities have been defeated before in their efforts to charge tolls and to make it unprofitable for these people to trade in a particular place.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>A local authority may, with the approval of the Minister for the Environment, by order extinguish a market right owned by it.</P>
      <P>Then subsection (3) (a) says:</P>
      <P>A local authority shall not extinguish a market right under this section unless it provides alternative facilities in the same vicinity as the market or fair to which the right relates ....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four words there of which I am afraid are &ldquo;in the same vicinity&rdquo;.  What do those words mean?  How will a court interpret them?  For example, in my town at present the market places to which these people seem to be entitled are right in the centre of the town&mdash;they were on televesion the other evening&mdash;right outside the post office, with a built-up area either side, opposite and behind.  Certainly in that case there is no way in which an alternative market could be provided &ldquo;in the immediate vicinity&rdquo;.  Is there a difference between &ldquo;immediate vicinity&rdquo; and &ldquo;vicinity&rdquo;?  I suppose there is &mdash;&ldquo;immediate vicinity&rdquo; certainly means right beside where it was.  &ldquo;Vicinity&rdquo; would be a looser term but, in my opinion, it would not mean at the other end of the town.  Indeed if it were sought to <Col N="327" /> move these people to the other end of the town any solicitor would challenge that interpretation and say: this is not &ldquo;in the same vicinity&rdquo;, these people are now being shifted to a place much less lucrative, less convenient and matters might very well be upset.  Those words &ldquo;in the same vicinity&rdquo; appear in subsection (3) (a) and (b) in reference to the extinguishing of market rights and to the use of market rights where other rights have been acquired.  In my opinion in both cases those words are almost certain to be challenged in the courts.  If they are&mdash;to put it at its remotest&mdash;then there is every possibility it would be held that the rights could not be extinguished because alternative rights were not being provided in the vicinity.  Instead of the phrase &ldquo;in the same vicinity&rdquo; something like &ldquo;alternative reasonable facilities within the urban area or adjacent thereto&rdquo; might be used, or some phrase that would be sufficiently wide to allow a little elbow room.  I would suggest that &ldquo;reasonable facilities&rdquo; would be far more flexible than &ldquo;in the same vicinity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If one were to examine provincial towns one would see that these rights&mdash;in the days of donkeys and carts and slowmoving traffic&mdash;were provided in the centre of those towns.  But those towns have expanded and there is now motor traffic moving through them causing major problems.  While nobody wants to be unreasonable I would not be in favour of a local authority exercising their rights under this section by shifting those people, say, two miles out of the town.  That would be going to the other extreme.  But I see nothing wrong with moving them to the other end of the town or to the peripheral areas.  With what expertise I possess I would advise the Minister to examine this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The power to acquire and extinguish market rights is not intended to be used to kill off the traditional fairs or markets as such.  It is intended merely to enable local authorities to update arrangements in their areas, perhaps to change the location <Col N="328" /> slightly because of traffic hazards or the like being created, to change the market days and hours of trading, to substitute the licence and permit fees proposed in the Bill for stalls, rents and tolls and to limit the area that a trader may occupy as a casual trading area.</P>
      <P>I can see the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick in regard to a major change being made in relation to the areas now being used by these people.  Again the authority for designating these areas is vested in the elected representatives of the local authority.  These are people with commonsense who know what is required and who always work in the best interests of their areas.  If I might refer to this aspect of the Bill, at a time when we complain about central control and bureaucracy we can feel proud that this Bill vests a great deal of authority in local representatives in the various local authority areas.</P>

      <P>In relation to this section, that is what is meant.  We can have a look at the wording with a view to improving it.  It gives authority to local authorities to designate areas so that traffic will not be held up to the extent it is at present.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It is not so simple.  It is true that the powers of designation are being vested in local authorities but interpretation of the Act is for the courts and all local authorities can do is to depend on how the courts will interpret the language we have put into the Bill.  If the Minister leaves in the words &ldquo;in the same vicinity&rdquo; it may be held that local authorities cannot extend a market or fair unless they provide another market or fair in the same vicinity, and it may not do for them to provide such a facility at the other end of the town, half a mile away.  I am asking the Minister to substitute for the present wording &ldquo;reasonable marketing facilities in another area reasonably convenient&rdquo;. He would be well advised to do that.</P>

I was told recently about a case where the Revenue Commissioners seized a motor car, which was retained by them for about two months.  When the owner finally got the car back it was in a deplorable condition. Now we will have goods seized and in some instances they can be sold. I hope, whoever retains those goods, whether it is officers of the Minister's Department, the local authorities or the Garda, while they are investigating the case, will ensure that the goods are retained in a safe place where they cannot be damaged by outsiders or they will not be destroyed by the elements.  I hope the Minister's Department will ensure that this section is properly administered in regard to safeguarding the property which is seized.  I know of cases where property was seized and was not looked after.  It is very wrong of a responsible body to allow property to deteriorate.  If the Minister wants proof of this I will give it to him.</P>

      <P>I said earlier that problems will arise in regard to a person taking action against a trader who is selling those goods.  If the person succeeds in his action in the District Court under the Sale of Goods Act I hope that the registers of licences and permits will be used by the Minister's Department and by the local authority to ensure that if a decree is given against a trader and if the decree remains unsatisfied, that he will not be allowed to renew his licence and permit until he has made satisfaction for the decree.  I would forget about the bond, which I mentioned earlier, if I was satisfied that people will not be able to escape the law and if proper contact is made by the Minister and the local authorities concerned to ensure that people will not be able to evade their responsibilities.

      <P>Our information is that a refusal can apply only under this Act and not under any other Act.  The Minister and the local authorities will maintain registers of licences and permits, including any revocations of either. This provision is concerned mainly with efficient administration but it also envisages that such registers will be readily available sources of information for the Revenue Commissioners and any other authorities to establish reasonable claim to information about the holders of licences and permits.  It is not envisaged that the registers will be open to the public for inspection.  There are other methods for enforcing the decrees of the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a worry.  I hoped that this would be the most important stick which the Minister could wield so that people would not be able to evade their responsibilities.  If a working man buys a television set for £500, which is completely useless and he obtains his decree the trader can come back with his licence and his permit and do the same thing tomorrow and the following day. The unfortunate victim can get his decrees but we have no way of preventing the trader carrying on business in that particular area.  The Minister should look at that.</P>
      <P>Supposing that a trader did that in Birr and the person who bought goods from him took action against him if the goods he received were found to be faulty, I would like if, at that stage, the trader could not go to another town and do exactly the same thing and have a number of unsatisfied decrees against him in a particular area.  Could this particular section not be used as a safeguard against such traders?</P>

There would, therefore, be protection in that respect.  We should all be very interested in letting people know the dangers of trading with people like this.  We should try to ensure that people deal with established traders and those who have a good record in business generally.</P>

I believe that bank managers are the only people who read <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> nowadays.  It is not the favourite pastime of the ordinary working man to read this or a similar magazine to see if the person he is doing casual trading with is in it.  I do not believe we will be getting to the ordinary working man who is buying from those casual traders.  I believe it is necessary to tighten up this section.</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the question of equity, the cancellation of existing licences, permits and certificates and the concurrent issuing of licences under the Bill, there would arise very difficult administrative problems.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>With <Col N="337" /> the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I would propose to discuss the Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Minister for the Public Service, the Civil Service Commission and Superannuation and Retired Allowances together on this Vote.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for the Public Service is to meet additional expenditure on five subheads of the Vote &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses, Office Machinery and other Office Supplies, Post Office Services, Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí and a grant-in-aid to the Institute of Public Administration.  The total sum required for this additional expenditure is £203,000 of which £103,000 can be met from savings elsewhere on the Vote and from an increase in Appropriations-in-Aid. The net amount required, therefore, is £100,000.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £75,000 is required in respect of Subhead B.1 &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses:&mdash; £30,000 of this is in respect of travel and subsistence costs incurred by officers of my Department.  A further £13,000 is required for training staff.  The balance of £32,000 is for various services such as security and cleaning.  This extra sum is required because of an increase in the volume of services being provided as well as higher costs.</P>
      <P>An additional expenditure of £5,000 arises on Subhead B.2 &mdash; Office Machinery and other Office Supplies &mdash; to meet the cost of office equipment not provided for in the original Estimate and a general increase in the prices of equipment.  A sum of £30,000 is needed to meet expenditure on Subhead C &mdash; Post Office Services. This arises because of the carry over of telephone bills into 1980, increased usage of Post Office services by the computer unit of my Department and increased telephone charges which came into operation on 1 July 1980.</P>
      <P>Is mar gheall ar ardú ar tháillí múinteoirí páirtaimseartha i nGaeleagras agus leathnú ar réimse agus saghsanna cúrsaí atá an £5,000 breise ag teastáil faoi fo-mhírcheann F den Vóta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining increase is in respect of the grant-in-aid to the Institute of Public <Col N="338" /> Administration.  The amount required is £88,000 and is to offset the costs to the institute of the application of the terms of the first phase of the second national understanding.  It also covers the cost to the institute of pay increases analogous to those granted to certain higher grades in the civil service in 1980 in line with the recommendations of the Devlin Review Body.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the various increases have been offset by some savings, mainly £50,000 on Subhead A.2 &mdash; Consultancy Services &mdash; and by an increase of almost the same amount in receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Supplementary Estimate on the Vote for the Civil Service Commission.  The extra amount required is £171,000 and it arises on three subheads. A.1 &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances; B.1 &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses; and D &mdash; Examinations. The increase of £86,000 sought for A.1 is due to the cost of the first phase of the second national understanding and the Devlin increases, together with the cost of some additional staff which it was found necessary to recruit to cope with the heavy workload which the commission have been experiencing in 1980.  An extra £35,000 is sought under B.1.  This is due to both increased costs and an increase in the number of boards held outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Under subhead D the extra sum sought is £50,000.  It is required because of substantial increases in the cost of advertising examinations and the hiring of halls for them.</P>
    <P>Regarding Vote 20 &mdash; Superannuation and Retired Allowances &mdash; a net sum of £1.936 million is required to meet unavoidable outgoings in the current year. This figure is made up of an expected gross shortfall of £2.261 million against which is set higher receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid together with a small saving on one subhead which in all amount to £325,000.  The net requirement is, therefore, £1.936 million.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimate was originally compiled various pay increases have been awarded to serving civil servants.  Some of these awards were made retrospective <Col N="339" /> to July 1978.  The bulk of the shortfall on this Vote is the sum of the corresponding increases in respect of lump sums, pensions and gratuities for retired officers. Another factor contributing to the shortfall is a marginal net increase in the number of pensioners.</P>
    <P>The increases in Appropriation-in-Aid flow mainly from a rise in the amount received by way of contributions to the Widows and Orphans Pension scheme and to an increase in the amount received in respect of the purchase of notional service for pension purposes, both of which exceeded expectations for the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise the Minister <Col N="340" /> to be quiet and listen to me.  I will come back to the reason I am making these charges.  However, there are a few comments I wish to make on the Department.</P>
      <P>There was a much publicised declaration by the Government in the past 12 months that the second phase of the Devlin award would not be given to Ministers, Ministers of State, senior civil servants and chief executive officers of semi-State bodies.  This was with the evident intention of persuading those people who were engaged in negotiations on the national understanding that the Government were sincere in their efforts to reduce their own expenses.  What is the position with regard to the Devlin award? Are the four categories I have mentioned getting the second phase or are they not getting it?  I want the Minister of State to answer that question in his reply.</P>
      <P>In this Supplementary Estimate the Minister is looking for an extra £30,000 in respect of the Post Office services.  The original Estimate was £75,000 and they are now looking for an additional £30,000, an increase of 40 per cent.  How could the Minister have got his sums so wrong?  I could understand if the figure was out by 5 per cent or even 7½ per cent but it is difficult to understand how there could have been an underestimation of this amount.</P>
      <P>A major point about the Department of the Public Service is that this was the Department about which legislation was introduced to establish five new Ministers of State earlier this year.  When we were in Government in equally difficult times &mdash; I will not make a larger claim than that &mdash; there were seven junior Ministers and the normal number of senior Ministers, limited by the Constitution to 15.  When there was a change of Government the then Taoiseach made a statement and I should like to quote it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises because there is an item in the Supplementary Estimate for salaries and travelling and incidental <Col N="341" /> expenses and presumably some of this was incurred in travelling costs incurred by the Ministers of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Travelling expenses have been incurred by these people. Frankly, I am very disappointed with the performance of this Department.  At column 24 of the Official Report dated 5 July 1977 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, said:</P>
      <P>The creation of the new ministerial portfolio and Department</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;The then Taoiseach was referring to the Department of Economic Planning and Development and this has since been disbanded&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and the transfer of functions I have announced are but the first step in a phased programme of public service reform which I intend to have developed further under the aegis of the Minister for the Public Service.  In particular the institutional arrangements for planning in each Government Department will receive early attention <Col N="342" /> in order to ensure that the activities of the Department are responsive to and reflect the central responsibilities for economic planning and development of the new Department.</P>
    <P>.... The Public Service Advisory Council in their report have, rightly in my opinion, drawn attention to the fact that without conspicuous political will and commitment public service reform will not occur.  The new Government will not be found wanting in this respect.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need add anything further to that.  The political will to reform the public service has been conspiciously absent so far as the Government are concerned. I am speaking from memory &mdash; I am sure that the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; but in three-and-a-half years I do not think the Minister for the Public Service has been to this House other than to move an Estimate. Legislation has not been introduced other than to increase the number of junior Ministers since the then Taoiseach made that fine-sounding but evidently empty claim on behalf of his Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be quite pleasant to the Minister of State because he is one of the people I like to deal with in this House.  I always get a satisfactory reply from him and I am sure that any shortcomings mentioned by Deputy Barry are not his fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Question Time I have raised the matter of standardisation or equalisation of retirement pensions and allowances within the public service <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EEC countries.  Some time ago I read some statistics on this matter and I am afraid our retirement age is much higher than that elsewhere.  I would like to see a concerted effort to bring down the retirement age of people in the public service.  For instance, in the teaching profession a person has to serve 40 years in order to qualify for full pension.  In this day and age there should be a serious attempt to reduce the qualifying number of years.  It is much lower in other EEC countries.  Of course, we would first <Col N="343" /> expect that the age in respect of non-contributory pensions would be reduced from 66 to 65 years and we should then make an attempt to whittle away at the retirement age in the public service.  That objective should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>People who have retired from the public service complain they do not qualify for increases as do serving members.  Specifically this refers to people in the teaching profession.  The increase can be given to serving members in the earlier months of the financial year but retired teachers have to wait until the following July to qualify for an increase in their pension. I find that this is inequitable and I cannot argue with these people.  It is a justifiable case and something should be done to redress the imbalance.  I hope that the Minister, as a professional person, will look into the matter further.</P>

      <P>First of all, I am very sorry that Deputy Barry has no confidence in the Department of the Public Service.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, was in the House last year the complaint was that there were two of us speaking on Public Service matters.  I cannot understand now why Deputy Barry is &mdash; I shall not say attacking &mdash; criticising the Minister for not being here.  As I said, the Minister was here last night.  If necessary, he would have spoken on the Estimate, but if he had done that there might have been criticism from the Opposition that the Ministers of State were doing nothing.  I do not honestly see the point in Deputy Barry's attack on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised in relation to the 40 per cent increase in the postal services charge.  When the postal services Estimate was being made originally, it was based on earlier prices.  The Estimate since has had to be increased because of the increase in Post Office charges.  There was also a considerable increase in the use of telephone services by the computer unit attached to the Department of the Public Service.  Another factor was the delay in relation to the postal strike.  Telephone bills for five quarters were paid in <Col N="344" /> 1980 That is one of the main reasons for the increase in the telephone services which Deputy Barry estimates at 40 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>I accept the Deputy's criticism that it should have been, but it was not and that is the reason for the increase.  I should also like to inform him that the extra Ministers of State about whom he speaks are not on the Estimate for the Department of the Public Service, as he knows quite well.  They will be taken on the Estimates for their own Departments. The Deputy raised the point that he felt that the extra for travelling and incidental expenses being looked for was attributable to the extra Ministers of State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy raised two questions in regard to parity.  This is something which has been raised on very many occasions.  I saw one deputation and the Minister saw another.  Again, the Minister spent a considerable amount of time on this.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to give any guarantee to the people involved.  This is a matter which will have to be looked at in the light of budget discussion and budget estimates. The legislation brought in in 1974 mentioned 1 July.  Sometimes, people are lucky to have pay increases before that date.  I am afraid this year most of the increases came in August, September and October.  A lot of people, unfortunately, will have to wait six or seven months before they get the increases.  I have sympathy for the people about whom Deputy Deasy has spoken.  I shall certainly pass on his comments to the Minister for consideration when the budget is being discussed.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £982,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This amount is required to meet additional expenditure which will arise on subheads B1, C1, C3, D1 and E, of the Fisheries Vote.</P>
      <P>On subhead B1 this increase on the original provision of £210,800 arises because of increases granted in the rates of travelling and subsistence together with an increase in the volume of travelling arising from EEC fishery matters. Increased expenditure has also arisen on advertising in connection with the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On subhead C1 the original provision was £175,000.  The additional expenditure <Col N="348" /> is necessary to meet the cost of boat hire in connection with additional herring surveys in the Celtic Sea.  These surveys are necessary to provide essential data on the state of the herring stocks.</P>
    <P>On subhead C3 this provision, in addition to the original provision of £3,000,000, is required to meet expected expenditure on fishery harbour works in progress this year.  These works have progressed quickly and satisfactorily and contractual commitments which are difficult to estimate have to be met.</P>
    <P>On subhead D1 &mdash; An Bord Iascaigh Mhara &mdash; Administration and Current Development &mdash; £24,000 (Grant-in-Aid), the original provision was £3,760,500. The additional amount is required to meet the cost of pay increases due under the national understanding.</P>
    <P>On subhead E &mdash; Inland Fisheries Development &mdash; £435,700, the original provision was for a sum of £1,439,200. The additional sum required includes (1) £50,000 for the purchase of two fishery patrol boats for use in the Kerry and Waterford fishery districts and (2) £20,000 for additional expenses, mainly increased wages and rates, in connection with the operation of the Galway Fishery, which were not provided for in the original Estimate.  The balance of the additional provision is to meet the cost of special pay increases and pay increases due under the national understanding.</P>
    <P>On subhead J &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash; £11,900, the original estimated receipts of £126,740 are now expected to be exceeded by £11,900 because of increased income from the Galway Fishery.</P>
    <P>The net total of the foregoing provisions is £1,187,000.  It is anticipated, however, that savings amounting to £205,000 will arise on other subheads which will be offset against some of the excesses.  It is, therefore, necessary to have approval for a Supplementary Estimate of £982,000 and I accordingly recommend this to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in agreement with this Supplementary Estimate.  In the time alloted to me I hope I can explain why I intend to oppose it.  When a Fisheries Bill <Col N="349" /> was introduced in the spring of the year, the Minister and I were looking forward to developments in the fishing industry. We both talked about the different ways in which the fishing industry could and should be developed.  We agreed that we were sitting on one of our best industries.</P>
      <P>I want it spelled out exactly where this £1 million of State money is going.  Last week a Supplementary Estimate for £50 million for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was introduced and it was passed without a vote.  This Supplementary Estimate represents an increase of 16 per cent.  It is an increase of £1 million for the Department.  The Minister talked about boat hire for herring surveys and mentioned a figure of £30,000.  Am I right in assuming that the entire £30,000 was needed for herring surveys around the Irish coast?  If so, did we get a grant from the EEC towards these surveys? When we entered the EEC we were told that the EEC would bear their share of the expenditure for research, development and surveys.  On what date did we apply to the EEC for a grant towards this £30,000, if we did apply?</P>
      <P>The Minister then went on to talk about a sum of £674,000 for harbour development.  Surely it is not too much to expect that when they were making their estimates in the spring the Department would have made allowance for inflation and for increases in wages.  I take it this sum of £674,000 is for harbour development only and does not include the cost of wages.  If so, I should like to know exactly what harbour development he is talking about, where are the projects, and what schemes are in operation.  I am not talking about wages.  I am talking about the increased cost of harbour development since the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a figure of £435,700 for inland fisheries development. He said two boats had to be bought, which I accept, for use on the south-west coast at a cost of £50,000.  He talked about £20,000 for additional expenses.  He then mentioned the Galway Fishery.  Am I wrong in thinking that the Galway Fishery made a loss over the past nine months rather than a profit? Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the <Col N="350" /> House on that when he is replying.  I understood that since we took over the Galway Fishery it has been working at a profit.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a 16 per cent increase here, an increase of £1 million. It is high time we found out exactly where this money is being spent.  We have just gone through a disastrous period for Irish fishermen.  Everybody who knows anything about fisheries will have to agree with that.  We must also face the problem that we are now approaching critical times and critical decisions which will not just affect the fishing industry in the short-term.  As I see it, the decisions which will be made over the next couple of months will affect the fishing industry for years and years to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister is having and will be having more meetings with his EEC colleagues in Brussels.  If necessary he should not be afraid to use the veto available to him if he does not agree with everything being discussed in Brussels. There is no going back this time.  Whatever is decided now about the EEC fisheries plan, we will have to put up with that decision for many years to come.  It was bad enough in the past when we had to deal with the French, the Scots and the English.  The plan the Minister is now discussing must also take into consideration that, if Spain enters the EEC, there will be another excess fleet.  The Spanish have not got the waters in which many of them can fish.  If we do not take a strong position in Brussels they will be legally entitled to fish in our waters.</P>

The Minister must face the fact that the week before last the European Parliament defeated a proposal for an exclusive 12 mile zone for Ireland.  I am not worried about that but <Col N="351" /> I am worried about the outcome of the Council of Ministers meeting.  The Minister should go to that meeting with the view that we cannot and will not accept anything less than a 12 mile limit.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt, but the Deputy is going very far outside the Supplementary Estimate. The Deputy mentioned sea-fisheries development but that relates to the cost of boat hire in connection with additional herring fishing in the Celtic Sea.  The Deputy is ranging over the whole Fisheries Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair would bear with me, he will realise that I have only mentioned the three to 12 mile limit in which sea-fishery development must take place.  I do not wish to argue with the Chair but if the Chair is patient I will get through this quite quickly.  I am not endeavouring to widen the scope of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>There is no point in discussing a three mile zone because we will not just accept it.  We must at least get a 12 mile exclusive limit.  The main problem we have had up to this in relation to sea fishery development is that the Minister had not the full authority to decide what would be done inside that 12 mile area.  The Minister for Fisheries should have the exclusive right to decide the numbers and types of fish we should catch inside that area.  It is crucial that the EEC partners should have nothing to say in relation to the entire band, whether it includes the Celtic Sea or not, right around our coast. The Minister could make the point that Iceland has a 200 mile exclusive limit. Norway has a 200 mile limit and Canada has a 200 mile limit.  We are an island fishing country.  In my country 25 per cent of the income comes from the fishing industry.  A considerable amount of the income for places like west Cork, Kerry, Waterford and so on comes from fishing.  For us to consider allowing the Ministers from France, Germany and England to dictate to the Minister and his Department in relation to the types of fish and the quotas we should catch&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is totally wrong.  As far as sea fishery development is concerned, we are talking about herring and mackerel catches.  In recent years we have seen the closure of a lot of the herring fishing particularly off Donegal and the south-east coasts.  At present there are tremendous shoals of mackerel passing the north-west coast and these shoals are being caught mostly by Irish boats but not all by Irish boats.  I am not satisfied that these fishery beds are being properly patrolled by the Irish naval vessels. I know that boats cost a lot of money but the best way to deal with this would be to establish a base off the north-west coast, in Killybegs for instance.  We cannot expect boats from Cork to travel to the north-west part of the country and patrol it properly.  We should have a twopronged attack to ensure that our fishing areas are not interferred with by foreigners. It has probably been reported to the Minister as well as to me that the Dutch, the Scottish and the English have been plundering our waters off the north-west coast as recently as last week.  It is high time that some of these boats were pulled in and that we ensured that the trespassers are kept out.  Seeing that the Chair does not wish me to go too wide I will not speak about the 50 mile and 200 mile zones&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking here about the payments to the fishery harbours centres fund.  The boats have to go from the fishery harbours and the harbours have to be built.  Surely I can deal with that type of thing.  As far as harbours are concerned, one of the things that Irish fishermen were promised was an allowance when they take fish from harbours particularly in the west coast.  Fishermen are getting no allowance for transporting fish from the furthest point away to the EEC countries.  We understood that the price structure for fish coming from Ireland would be such that we would be on an equal basis with the prices of English, French and German fish.  This is not happening at present.  When speaking about the harbours, I would ask the Minister to tell us what new developments are envisaged in this provision of £674,000.  I hope he will not simply talk about the terrible rate of inflation which has been experienced during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money has been allocated to the new <Col N="354" /> boards but I am disappointed with developments to date.  The Minister will say it was not possible to get these boards into operation more quickly.  The Bill was passed early this year and the chief executives are only now being appointed.  In some areas which I know very well people have been appointed to these boards because of their allegiance to the Fianna Fáil Party rather than because of their knowledge.  When I welcomed the setting up of these boards I pointed out to the Minister that I would be looking critically at nominees and I am sorry that appointments have been based on political allegiance. It is an absolute disgrace at a time when the fishing industry is in such a critical state.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that there would be more leniency in regard to the issue of licences, but I notice that the number issued is 112 fewer than in 1977.  It appears that the first action of the central board has been to cut the number of licences.  The Minister will probably say that this had to be done because salmon stocks in some areas have not been increasing, but he knows that it is high time to consider development.  After two years the ESB and other bodies are coming around to my way of thinking.  We must first establish smolt-rearing stations to put stocks back into the rivers.  Secondly, we must ensure that there is not a repetition of the import of salmon for smoking and reexporting, as happened during the past season.  The price of salmon was low and naturally fishermen were complaining in the face of what was happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters is two new boats which have been acquired to <Col N="355" /> safeguard salmon stocks.  May I continue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that development is needed.  Firstly, smolt-rearing stations must be established; secondly, we must stop the importation of salmon; thirdly, we must try to educate interested parties regarding the potential in reared salmon.  The Norwegians have been very successful in the latter area and in 1979 they produced ten times more commercially reared salmon than we caught off our shores.  Cutting the number of licences by 112 is not the answer.  In the area of Letterkenny 33 fewer licences have been issued than in 1979.  Does that mean that a person who previously had a licence will not be able to obtain one this year?  There must be provision for those who have traditionally fished salmon and by right they should be able to secure licences.</P>
      <P>When introducing the recent Bill the Minister gave a half guarantee to the House that the State would endeavour to take over any fisheries which would come on the market.  He specifically talked about the Galway fisheries and I welcomed his interest.  During the past few weeks the valuable oyster beds in Galway are reported to have been bought by a foreign syndicate.  I am very concerned that his should have been allowed to happen and I would ask the Minister to confirm it.  If it is true, do the central board intend even at this stage to endeavour to keep these oyster beds in Irish hands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned previously the tremendous possibilities for aquaculture, including the development of salmon and trout. I went on to talk about oysters, mussels, scallops, clams and so on. In the Supplementary Estimate we were talking about extra money for Bord Iascaigh Mhara. We were told they were to start a development programme so that aquaculture could be developed here.  I said &ldquo;could be developed&rdquo;; I maintain it can be developed, but many things are needed.  First, <Col N="356" /> we need education, technology &mdash; which is provided by different research centres and the Colleges of Technology &mdash; and to train personnel and develop markets. The fishing industry could be a very valuable asset but we have failed to utilise it.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the year the Minister gave a commitment that we would have this type of development.  After almost a year I am very sad to have to say that damn all was done by BIM or the Department.  By naming these two bodies I may be putting my finger on the kernel of the matter.  As spokesman for fisheries I found that the two bodies do not always seem to work hand in hand.  Some of them do not want to take responsibility and others do not want to give up responsibility. Specific jobs should be spelled out by the Minister, and the Department, BIM and the central board should be told to get on with the job and develop this very valuable industry.  I am not satisfied that this is being done.</P>

I am not satisfied that there is enough determination or drive or that we are fully developing this industry.  Unless I can get some very good answers from the Minister, I intend to oppose this Supplementary Estimate and call for a vote because I am not at the way the fishing industry is being developed under this Government.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that a debate on a Supplementary Estimate of this kind must of necessity be limited and consequently my contribution will be brief.  At the same time the Chair will appreciate that we have not been afforded an opportunity of exchanging views with the Minister in detail concerning the sorry state of this industry.  This debate affords us <Col N="357" /> the opportunity of asking the Minister to address himself to the chronic situation in this industry, to the crisis situation which has arisen.  Views have been conveyed to the Minister by various facets of the fishing industry about the worsening situation.  It is a matter of great concern to everyone that the Minister has been so inactive rather than dealing effectively with the worsening situation.  This situation has come about as a result of spiralling costs, particularly in relation to materials fishermen are obliged to use, especially fuel oil, a corresponding fall in the price of fish commodities, a restriction on fishing and massive importation of fish from countries outside the EEC.</P>
      <P>Spiralling costs, massive inflation, restrictions, imports &mdash; this is a situation we never thought we would find ourselves in especially since joining the EEC.  As yet the Minister has not been able to reach agreement on a fishery policy in the Community.  The much lauded 50 mile limit, which was a firm commitment of so many Ministers when they were in opposition, has been abandoned in a disgraceful fashion.</P>

This semi-State organisation, which was an integral part of the fishery industry, an adjunct to the industry, was looked upon by many of us as a great aid and stimulant to the industry. We now find that the boatyards of BIM have been sold within a few months of this Government coming into office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the most effective ways of relieving the chronic situation in respect of fishermen's falling incomes is <Col N="359" /> to permit limited fishing in the Celtic Sea especially for smaller boats.  I know it is a matter that the Minister has been considering but he has been doing so for a long time and, in the meantime, hardship and suffering are accruing to the fishermen and their families.</P>
      <P>These are practical suggestions by way of help.  It is not as if they are in conflict with EEC regulations because we know that the British are subsidising their fishing industry to the tune of very many millions of pounds annually.  The French are subsidising a fuel scheme for their fishermen and many other countries are doing likewise.  Therefore it is a shame and disgrace that our Minister has not done something similar long ago to bring relief to our shattered industry.  It is not a matter of appealing to the Minister today to promote the industry as such. We are now seeking in this House to hold on to its very survival, to retain the last remnant of the industry which is falling asunder before the Minister's eyes.</P>
      <P>My colleague adverted to subhead E &mdash; Inland Fisheries.  We are surprised that the boards of conservators are not fully operational.  We are concerned that nothing tangible has been done to establish the headquarters of the regional boards. I understand from the Minister that the headquarters of the South Tipperary/West Waterford region will be in my home town of Clonmel.  I see no evidence of the Minister or his Department taking any steps to acquire property there.  I am not aware of any developments to establish headquarters in Clonmel. We would be grateful to the Minister if he would let us know what is happening. We know personnel have been appointed.  Where are the premises, where is the organisation to which we all looked with such hope and confidence in respect of these new regional boards of conservators?  There is a dragging of feet in this area.  Quite likely it is all because of a shortage of money but, if that is the case, we should be told because we all understood that these boards and headquarters would be established before this year had expired.  There are no signs of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> Those are some sentiments I wished to express at this point.  I would earnestly urge the Minister to avail of this unique opportunity to give some token of hope to the fishing industry, to give some indication to them of positive help, positive assistance in their plight in respect of an EEC fisheries policy which could provide adequate protection and eliminate these colossal imports of fish from countries outside the EEC.  It is a very strange irony of fate that when we joined the EEC we deliberately removed the swaddling clothes of protection around our industry and decided to accept free trade.  Many of us knew at that time that industrial graveyards would result.  But, in respect of the fishing industry, how is it that the Minister and his colleagues in Europe permit such vast imports of fish into the EEC from outside countries?</P>

      <P>With so many erstwhile Opposition Deputies, now Ministers, pulling at the leash to be in charge of fisheries one would imagine that we would have now a 50 mile limit, that we would have prosperity in abundance for our fishermen, that everything in the garden would be lovely.  Yet, within a few months of their assuming office, we saw one sell out after another, one abandonment of principle after the other.  The plight of our fishermen and their families has become progressively worse under the present Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this Estimate has to do with staff rather than fishermen and that the money, in so far as it goes, probably is necessary in those areas.  There does not appear to be much in it for the fisherman.  That is very disappointing, especially coming from a new Minister who admitted candidly that he did not know much about it when he assumed office.  He must know by now that this industry is in dire straits.  I place emphasis on the word &ldquo;dire&rdquo; because everywhere we public representatives go we meet fishermen who tell us that unless something is done quickly they will be out of business.</P>
      <P>We must ask: what is the Fisheries Ministry all about?  It is not about staff, a large building, about civil servants or even about a Minister; it is about fishermen and fishing.  I see absolutely nothing in this for fishermen.  It frightens me to see how little we are doing at present to ensure the very survival of these people against the massive Dutch, French and continental fleets literally raping our waters under our eyes in spite of the best efforts of our navy.  They are offshore every evening taking shelter, as they are entitled to do, every morning they drop their nets and fish, and before we can ring anyone they have gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must insist on proper fishery protection. Over the years our fishermen have never abused fish stocks.  We have been the guardians of these stocks and it is because of the responsible attitude of our fishermen that we have stocks which are the pride of the world.  Because of over-fishing the Dutch and the French have not got any.  It is our job to keep <Col N="362" /> them out and the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Defence, must provide adequate patrol vessels to see that this is done effectively.</P>
    <P>A lot of worthwhile work has been done on harbour improvement but there are many small harbours in a neglected condition, perhaps because the boats using them are small.  I refer specifically to Ballycotton, about which I have approached the Department repeatedly to get the harbour made safe.  Thirty to 40 families depend on small boats there but these boats are unprotected from the Atlantic and I appeal to the Minister to get that harbour made safe before the height of the winter and the bad weather. The work would not cost a substantial sum.  All we need is the will to have it done.</P>
    <P>I was interested in a reference to oysters. I should like to think that the whole business of pollution control and environmental protection would be put in the hands of the Minister for Fisheries.  There must be control immediately of the situation in Cork Harbour which has one of the largest oyster beds in Europe.  It is in danger of obliteration by raw effluent. When I approached the engineers concerned they told me it was the concern of the owners of the oyster beds, that they should have the oysters washed and cleaned.  &ldquo;We will pollute them but you will clean them&rdquo; seems to be their approach.  The Department of the Environment are supposed to protect us from pollution but it seems to me they have no interest in it at all.  Pollution control should be taken out of their hands and given to the man interested in fish.  The oyster fishery in Cork is a multi-million pound industry.  Those involved in it are courageous people and they are right to insist on proper treatment.  Cork harbour is more a lake than a harbour because the water rarely changes.  I appeal to the Minister to look into the matter.  When those of us who are fighting for the protection of oyster fishing in Cork Harbour make our voices heard we are told that we are irresponsible, that we are holding up a housing scheme in Midleton.</P>

      <P>There were references to salmon stocks.  Good work has been done in this respect and we on the Blackwater are showing how it can be done.  In view of the responsible attitude of the Blackwater fishermen I am disappointed the Minister has seen fit to cut down the number of licences, I thought the reverse would be the case because of the caring attitude of the fishermen there.  Not only do we preserve our own stocks but we have some for sale, if Deputy White wants any.  The responsible attitude of the fishermen in Youghal and Ballycotton should ensure that they would get more and not fewer licences.</P>
      <P>Another matter that worries me is that it is extremely difficult to find out what is on board Dutch vessels off our shores because when they are boarded all that can be seen are blocks of solid ice.  Have we come to any agreement in Europe to the effect that when cargoes arrive back at their destination they can be policed by somebody from here?</P>

As chairman of the Fishery Sub-Committee of the Council of Europe I have made a special case for small open boats because those using them are traditional family fishermen and they should not be included in embargoes. They are being penalised by the same rules governing bigger boats.  This problem is peculiar to Ireland and I hope <Col N="364" /> it will be given special attention by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with a particular Galway fishery, the St. George Fisheries in the Clarenbridge, Ballinderrean, Kinvara district.  Today I was given a written reply to a parliamentary question in which I asked if that fishery had been sold.  I asked the Minister if he was aware that a French company are reported to be in the process of purchasing it and if he would give an undertaking that the new central fisheries board would purchase it.  His reply was in the negative, that the St. George Fisheries is a private one, that the shares were sold recently &mdash; the first we in Galway heard of it.  The reply stated that the powers of the central board extended only to acquisition of fisheries for the implementation of development programmes.  It also stated: &ldquo;As the St. George Fisheries is not the subject of such a development programme the central fisheries board have no authority to acquire it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to the Minister's office during last week regarding this fishery.  At a recent meeting we were asked to communicate with the Department with a view to having the Department acquire this fishery for the benefit of local fishermen, some of them are part-time farmers.  There are possibly 250 of those men in that area.  It appears that a meeting was held between some interested parties.  I believe BIM were represented at that meeting, which was held about ten days ago.  Nothing fruitful came out of it because the people particularly interested were not invited to it.</P>
      <P>I see no provision in the Supplementary Estimate for purchasing this fishery. I am expressing the views of the fishermen in that particular area.  This fishery is along the coast at Ballinderrean, Kinvara, and is known as the St. George fishery.  There are already two public fisheries there, one east and one west of this one.  It was discovered by local fishermen in the early forties.  A Dean of St. George later claimed possession of it.  It was claimed that it was handed down by the people who were in occupation of the country years ago.  The Dean of St.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> George and other people formed a company under the Fishery Act, 1959, for the purpose of acquiring a fishery so that a licence would be granted to them by the Department of Fisheries.  If within a specified time of ten years they did not develop that fishery it was to revert back to the former position.  Title could not be proved at that time.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, this fishery is now being sold to a French consortium. Why did the Minister allow this to happen? Will he have the case investigated? In view of the fact that it is an asset to the local people and that 50 per cent EEC grants are available for the development of such a fishery, why did the central fisheries board or the Minister not purchase this fishery in order to develop it? I would like to refer the Minister to the debate on the Second Stage of the Fisheries Bill, 1979, volume 316, column 212 of the Official Report of 18 October 1979, when he said:</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made for the acquisition of fisheries and rights of way by agreement or compulsorily. These acquisitions will be subject to the payment of compensation and there is also provision for appeal against compulsory acquisitions.  It is not envisaged that fisheries efficiently managed will be compulsorily acquired.</P>
    <P>This fishery was not efficiently managed and it was not compulsorily acquired or any attempt made to buy it.</P>
    <P>The people of that area are very disappointed at the attitude of the Minister to date.  Possibly because of what I have said here today, because of representations which have been made to him already and some which will be made to him later, the Minister may look into the matter.  The area of ground in question is 810 acres.  When one takes into consideration that the income from an acre of fishing ground is about ten times the value of that obtained from an acre of land, this fishery should be acquired. When the Minister got this portfolio he said he did not know a lot about fisheries but he would learn.  Possibly he started from a good beginning.  I am not well <Col N="366" /> acquainted with fishing and fisheries but I am aware for a number of years that many of our fisheries, both inland and along the coast, are owned by non-nationals. There is a lot said in the House and outside it about the occupation of part of our country, which is officially in the hands of a foreign power but we allow people to own the best part of our own fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look into this case and have the St. George Fisheries acquired for the Galway people as well as for the rest of the people?  It is reported that a French concern have bought this fishery.  If a comparable situation arose on the coast of Brittany or on the coast of any other EEC country, would Irishmen be allowed to purchase in the same way as Frenchmen have purchased in this case?  Will the Minister look into this matter immediately, because the longer it is left the worse the situation will become?</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware but a few years ago a fishmeal factory was erected at Mornington.  It was closed and is in the process of being sold and used for something else.  It is situated on the estuary of the Boyne and the Northern Ireland sea is available for boats using that factory.  What effort was made to try to keep it in operation?  I know that springing this on the Minister is unfair and he may not have the information available.  Very substantial funds were invested in that factory by the Government. I am anxious to know what planning went into it, when it started to get into trouble, and what effort was made to ensure that it would be kept in existence?  Perhaps the Minister might be able to give a reply to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Minister's concern for the part of his portfolio dealing with the Supplementary Estimate and his deep concern for the advancement of fisheries generally.  I should like to comment on certain aspects of the Department's operations particularly in relation to herring fishing in the Celtic Sea.  This fishery is of very great importance to all the fishing ports along the east coast, in <Col N="367" /> particular to the fishermen from Balbriggan, Skerries and, to a lesser extent, those from the smaller harbour of Loughshinny. These three ports have considerable fleets and at certain times of the year the fishermen are dependent largely on herring fishing.</P>
      <P>Herring fishing in the Irish Sea goes back a long time.  In the middle of the last century Skerries in terms of fishing was the most important landing and trading port in these islands.  At that time the trade in herring was carried on by local lubbers and the fish was sold throughout Europe.  The landings were substantial and that continued to be the situation up to the turn of the century.  Paradoxically, with the introduction of the internal combustion engine and the more modern fishing boats which that development brought about, this herring fishing ceased.  The question posed is this. Since that was the situation with the more primitive methods in use in the middle of the last century and with the only power being by way of sail, what is the ground for saying that the more modern fishing methods are responsible solely for the decline in the herring stocks?  There is a genuine commercial question here as to the validity of that argument.  I suggest that the question be considered objectively and that the position of the total closure of the Sea so far as the east coast fishing fleets are concerned should be reexamined. Herring stocks, if fished heavily, tend to breed more quickly whereas if they are fished lightly, the fish take more time in coming to maturity so that it is older when processed.  This is an area which should be considered strictly from a commercial viewpoint.  The more altruistic characteristics that may be taken into consideration by the scientists should be considered in a very critical manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider this Celtic Sea area question in view of the difficulties that are being faced by the fishermen who depend on herring fishing for a substantial part of their yearly earnings.  If this area of activity is to be cut off from them the difficulties they are experiencing will become worse. <Col N="368" /> It is common knowledge that the courage displayed by the fishermen in investing in modern equipment and in attending courses for the purpose of equipping themselves to handle this modern equipment carries with it a very heavy burden of repayment.  Therefore unless every opportunity is made available to them to meet these repayments their difficulties, which very often are due to circumstances that are totally outside their control, will continue.  These men work seven days a week and very often for periods of 24 hours at a time.  We do not hear any talk of industrial disputes so far as they are concerned.  If the fish is available they seek it out.</P>
    <P>Fishing is an activity that represents a considerable source of foreign earnings. A very large proportion of the herring landings find their way to European and other markets.  Therefore, the work of the fishermen must be viewed in the light of their contribution to the national economy and also in view of the fact that they are positive earners of livlihoods in what is a very high-risk area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for drawing my attention to this, but the points I am raising are very important so far as this Supplementary Estimate is concerned. Naturally, the catches have to be brought ashore at some point.  In this context it is worth noting that harbour facilities on the east coast in particular are being improved dramatically.  The extensive works being undertaken at Howth, for instance, are the result of a report made some years ago by the Dane, Bjuke.  He examined the fishing industry around the coast and recommended that Howth be developed as a major fishing port.  unfortunately, when Bjuke was preparing his report he did not examine the facilities of Skerries nor take into account the fact that very close inshore there is a depth of water greater there than anywhere else on the east coast.  I refer specifically to that area on the north-western side of Skerries harbour where there is a depth <Col N="369" /> of 30 feet of water within 100 yards of the shore.  I would refer the Minister to a survey that was undertaken some few years ago by the Skerries Fishermen at their own expense.  This exercise was for the purpose of demonstrating the situation I have outlined.  It is possible to establish a deep-water port at Skerries at relatively small cost.  The materials for the construction of the port are very close at hand in the form of substantial limestone deposits within a mile or so of the possible location of a major fishing harbour.</P>
      <P>So far as fish landings are concerned, the position is that even with the modern trawlers and with the improvements that are being effected, the fishermen, will find it extremely difficult in certain wind conditions to avail of the substantial amounts of money that are being spent on this location.  The harbour at Balbriggan is in a similar position.  Considerable moneys would need to be spent in order to put that harbour into an acceptable condition for the fleet that are using it now.  The surface of one of the piers is such that it is impossible for drivers to take trucks down the harbour either to deliver oil for the boats or to collect the catches from the moored boats.  The large stones and the potholes and the general bad condition of the south pier of that harbour are a source of constant concern to the fishermen who use it.  In other words, another location for this fishing fleet is in a state of disrepair and needs to be looked at.</P>
      <P>The big problem about both harbours is that they are under the control of Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Since the board derive little or no revenue from the harbours they have no direct interest either in their maintenance or in their improvement.  The board are an independent authority.  Consequently, they do not have to answer to anybody for their operations.  This situation makes it impossible for the fishing fleets in those locations to expand and to operate in an efficient manner at the time of catches being landed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances I suggest that the control of the two harbours be removed from the jurisdiction of the <Col N="370" /> board and taken over either by the Department or by some other body who will do what is necessary to make sure that the harbours fulfil the function which the fishermen require.  It is regrettable that this function is not being fulfilled.  In one harbour there are more than 20 boats while in the other there are almost 30. This represents a considerable volume of employment in both locations, but for as long as Dublin Port and Docks Board control the harbours they will not function efficiently.</P>
    <P>Another problem in relation to fishing in the Irish Sea is the median line which runs up the Irish Sea and then curves in very smartly towards the Mourne mountains. This median line is of great concern to fishermen on the entire east coast.</P>

Difficulty arises with regard to the median line and I request that the matter be looked at so that some improvements can be made to the situation.</P>
      <P>In general, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his attitude towards the fishing industry.  I know he is deeply concerned about the fishermen and will do everything possible to help them.  I hope the good work he has started will continue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Supplementary Estimate. <Col N="371" /> It may be limited but it is nice to be able to speak on fisheries because we have not had an opportunity for a long time to discuss these matters in this House.  There are many aspects of the fishing industry that need to be aired and this is the only national forum where we can do this.</P>
      <P>The limitations of the Supplementary Estimate are such that my comments will have to be restricted.  Nevertheless, there are a number of items of interest that deserve comment.  Under subhead D. (1) the grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has been increased by £24,000 under the heading of administration and current development.  I should like to put a question to the Minister.  Do An Bord Iascaigh Mhara serve any useful purpose in the running of the Irish fishing industry or have they outlived their usefulness?  It is the opinion of the vast majority of fishermen that this agency, which was set up to help the industry to develop, has not functioned as was intended originally. Perhaps the time has come for a new attempt to be made to form a development agency that would truly look after the best interests of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question here last week I was told that of the 400 people who have loans for boats from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara more than 280 are in arrears with their payments.  I do not blame the board completely for that situation.  The blame lies with the manner in which the affairs of the industry are being run, or rather are not being run.  There is a serious omission so far as the marketing and processing of fish are concerned.  In my view the work of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is not up to standard.  There is an almost unanimous view in the fishing industry that they are not serving the purpose for which they were established. Serious thought must be given to the idea of disbanding An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and setting up an agency that will promote the fishing industry in a dynamic and successful way.  The fact is that we are importing almost as much fish as we are exporting &mdash; and we are a maritime nation.  We are importing more processed <Col N="372" /> fish than we are exporting.  The board was set up to promote the marketing and processing of fish and it is a sad state of affairs to find that we are almost net importers rather than net exporters. Even where we succeed in exporting fish and even where we sell on the home market, the price is so bad that one wonders about the functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the marketing area.</P>
    <P>Subhead C (1) refers to the sea fisheries development programme and it notes that there is an additional sum of £30,000 involved.  We are told the additional expenditure is necessary to meet the cost of boat hire in connection with additional herring surveys in the Celtic Sea.  It states that the surveys are necessary to provide essential data on the state of the herring stocks.  We know that the state of the herring stocks is not satisfactory and that there is a need for constant monitoring. We realise that the limited stocks in the Celtic Sea should not be over-fished. However, they have been over-fished. This kind of survey should have been carried out 20 years ago; the stocks should have been controlled and the over-fishing should have been banned at that time.  In the view of fishermen there are sufficient stocks in the Celtic Sea to allow the small boat fishermen off the south coast to earn a decent living without unduly affecting the stocks in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the motion put down last night.  I am seriously concerned about the continuing rapid rise in the rate of inflation in this country.  It is true to say that one section of the community which has been hit perhaps even more seriously than any other by this rapid rise in inflation is the farming community. There is no doubt in anybody's mind that farmer's incomes have dropped by something in the region of 40 to 50 per cent in the past two years.  The increased inflation rate has meant that all the materials used by farmers, such as manures, seeds, machinery, petrol and diesel, have risen rapidly in price, while incomes in some instances have fallen drastically and in others are only maintaining their previous level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in regard to our farmers is the most serious ever faced and is due absolutely to the rise in the rate of inflation. Last night I asked the Minister, and appeal again to him here this evening, <Col N="374" /> that he and his Department &mdash; I might add, in conjunction with the Department of Finance &mdash; put uppermost in their minds the problem of tackling and solving the ever-increasing inflation rate bedevilling our economy.  If this situation continues, I can foresee the already serious situation slowly but surely getting out of hand.  The Minister has a great responsibility to tackle and solve this matter.  The graph showing the rate of inflation can only be described as rising inexorably ever higher.  Unless firm action is taken to grasp this nettle, people will suffer and suffer severely because of the lack of Government initiative, Government enterprise and total ineptitude in tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>The excuse trotted out will be that the inflation with which we are faced is caused by factors outside the Minister's control.  That is not good enough.  If one looks at the rate of inflation in other countries, such as Germany, France and others within the EMS system, one has an example to follow of how these countries have tackled inflation.  I wholeheartedly urge the Minister to follow this example at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I have some National Prices Commission reports, one being report No. 92 for February 1980.  In this report price increases are dealt with from February 1979 to January 1980.  According to that report, £360.5 million in price increases were allowed.  The Prices Commission are very fair and very thorough and are to be commended for the excellent work they are doing.  However, their hands are tied in regard to these matters.  It is admitted in this report that they must proceed along certain fixed lines in issuing their report and must follow stringent guidelines.  A sum of £360.5 million in price increases in a twelve-month period is frightening and devastating.  It is something which must be tackled seriously.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 8 October 1980 an article was published by John Foley, a consumer affairs editor, in which it is stated that Irish consumers face a £38 million a year bill following the spate of price rise applications approved of during July.  Manufactures, service firms and <Col N="375" /> employers have sought increases which will cost nearly £60 million in a year.</P>
    <P>Increases were allowed of £38 million and during a period of twelve months there were £306.5 million in increases. Unless this problem is tackled immediately I regret to forecast that our whole economy will be seriously threatened. Last night, the Minister asked if we had any ideas.  I shall try to devote some of the short time left to outlining some efforts which could be made by the Minister's Department.  The first is one which has been repeated so often that it falls on deaf ears, but it was one of the efforts which succeeded during the period of the Coalition Government in regard to food subsidies.  This helped to break the upper spiralling of price increases.  I might add that when this measure was brought in the present Government members were in Opposition and they called for food subsidies.  This essential measure could help to break the rise in the rate of inflation. If that could be achieved prices would level off and, in fact, initially would actually drop once food subsidies are brought in.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I ask the Government to look at the present rate of taxation on petrol and other associated items.  The tax on petrol is having a very damaging effect on many of our industries.  The payment of this tax percolates through, causing price rises.  Can a reduction be made in this respect?</P>
    <P>In regard to increases granted on the postal and telephone services, I warned at the time that those increases would lead to job losses and similarly, when the vast &mdash; I think 89 per cent &mdash; increases in price to the ESB were granted in twelve months, I warned that this would lead to job losses.  Unfortunately, I have been proved all too correct.</P>
    <P>Our cost of transport is excessive by comparison with that in other countries. With a rate of unemployment at approximately 4,000 a month, action must be taken.  Inflation is leading to job losses and closing Irish firms which have withstood difficult economic periods before. But they are unable to cope with the rate <Col N="376" /> of inflation which the Government have allowed them to be faced with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution to the debate last night the Minister of State referred to the fact that since taking office the Government have been particularly concerned to ensure that the effects of price increases on the less well-off sections of the community are softened in so far as that is possible, taking into account all other considerations.  That concern has been expressed practically in two ways.  Price control procedures have been tightened up to ensure that only the minimum, unavoidable price increases are allowed to occur.  Improvements in social welfare benefits have been regarded as the central element in successive budgets.</P>
      <P>It is undeniable that the operating costs of companies providing goods and services have increased enormously recently. These are difficult economic times.  We are all aware of the reasons, both external and internal, for the huge cost increases which have occurred.  In a situation of rising costs the Government are faced with a number of options in the matter of price control.  First, applications for price increases could be refused point blank. The consequences would be predictable. If all applications for price increases were to be rejected while cost increases continued to incur, company bankruptcies and redundancies would follow within a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases supplies of goods to the Irish market would cease, given the increased cost of imported materials and the size of the increases in money incomes which have occurred in recent years.  Nowadays increased costs can very rarely be met from profits or fully offset by improvements in productivity and efficiency.  Every effort should be made by all concerned at every level of industry <Col N="377" /> to see where efficiency can be improved and the price of commodities can be kept to a minimum.  With price control operating in this way, cutting down profitability would be irrelevant.  No products would be available at the controlled prices and the effects would soon become intolerable.  The consequences of exercising this option would be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>The second option open to the Government would be to refuse to allow certain price increases which were justified and grant subsidies to make good the difference.  Deputy Enright made that point last night and again tonight.  A number of commodities are in receipt of a Government subsidy at present.  The cost of these subsidies runs at about £50 million annually.  Any increase in these subsidies or the introduction of subsidies on other commodities could be met presumably only by increased taxation.  It is the Government's belief &mdash; and I agree totally with them &mdash; that subsidies, applying as they do irrespective of individual needs, do not discriminate sufficiently in favour of the less well-off sections of the community.  Moreover, subsidisation can lead to distortion in consumption patterns and hide the real cost of products and services.</P>
    <P>The Government have not exercised either of these two options.  Instead, they have rigidly controlled prices, having regard to the economic facts of life.  They have made significant improvements in the level of social welfare benefits and payments to the less protected sections of the community.  In his speech last night the Minister of State gave some details of the increases which have been granted. They are impressive and they underline the Government's commitment.  In the most recent budget, weekly rates for contributory and non-contributory old age pensions, widows' pensions, invalidity pensions, deserted wives' benefits were increased by 25 per cent.  These increases were an addition to the temporary increases given in October 1979 which represented some 6 per cent of weekly rates on average.  As a result the weekly rates of benefit, which came into operation in April 1980, were on average 31 per cent higher in the case of long term rates and <Col N="378" /> 26 per cent higher in the case of short term rates than the rates of benefit in operation in April 1979.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances were increased in July last by £1 per month for the first child and £1.80 for the second and each subsequent child.  There were many other benefits, including one which will come into operation next week &mdash; the double week's benefit for those in the long term recipient category.  There are the free travel, the free fuel voucher, the free television licence, the ESB allowance, the abolition of rates on homes, living alone allowance and other small allowances as well.</P>
    <P>Taking the comparative figures, since 1979 the unemployment benefit increased by 64 per cent, the contributory old age pension by 78 per cent, the non-contributory old age pension by 79 per cent and children's allowance by 90 per cent.  The tightening up of price control regulations which took place during the term of office of the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, puts into perspective the simplistic nature of the attacks which the Opposition attempt to mount.</P>
    <P>Given the detailed and extensive reports published each month by the National Prices Commission, both this House and the public are kept well informed of price control matters.  Notwithstanding this, many Opposition Deputies continue to make contributions to debates on prices which display an obvious lack of appreciation of the controls which exist and how they are exercised. Every month the commission report details of the applications received.  In the period from January to September of this year the commission considered price increase proposals from 425 applicants totalling £395.11 million on an annual basis.  Of this total £310.64 million was actually allowed.</P>
    <P>As a result of the proper application of price control procedures during that period the prices of the products and services covered in those applications rose by 21 per cent less than they would have risen if the applicants had not been subject to the detailed price control, and the consumers had to pay nearly £85 million less than they would otherwise have <Col N="379" /> had to pay.  This figure underestimates the savings to the consumers.  Nearly all the commission's recommendations relate to the ex-factory prices and retail prices are generally fixed by adding a percentage margin to the prices at which the retailers buy.  If the average retail margin on costs were 25 per cent the savings to the consumer would reach nearly £100 million.  The £310.64 million which was actually allowed as increased costs, when broken into its constituent parts reveals some interesting facts.  Of the total figure £193.38 million was in respect of raw material costs, £52.35 million was in respect of pay costs and £64.91 million was in respect of overhead costs. It is abundantly clear from these figures that increases in material costs were of paramount importance, in causing price increases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright mentioned last night ESB costs.  About 80 per cent of ESB generating costs is for imported oil. The total energy costs in this year alone was £250 million bringing our energy costs up to £800 million.  Over 62 per cent of the total increased costs allowed was in respect of raw material cost increases.  The vast majority of raw material inputs have to be purchased on world markets and the prices are influenced by external factors outside the control of the Government.  For primary energy goods we have had to pay the going price on world markets to ensure continuity of supply, thus maintaining essential goods and services.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to refer to the serious effects of the huge oil increase on our economy and on our balance of payments situation.  The increases in the price of fuel oil have an overspill effect on the prices of numerous commodities. It is widely appreciated that it is essential for us to reduce our dependence on imported fuel.  The way in which we use oil is more appropriate to an era when financial consequences were of little concern.  The Government's action in their budget, in their efforts to promote energy conservation and to develop our own fuel resources, are designed to meet our needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> The National Prices Commission also referred to the need for improved efficiency in energy usage in firms.  In their report of April of this year they stressed that energy inputs are significant cost factors for nearly all firms.  A more efficient use of energy inputs would result in substantial savings, in increased competitiveness and it would also have a beneficial influence on our balance of payments. The commission say that there is considerable scope in the industrial sector for energy saving and for switching to cheaper forms of alternative fuel.  They also say in their report that they are considering the question of incorporating a section of energy utilisation to be included in efficiency for price contract firms.</P>
    <P>The emphasis the Minister has placed on the investigation of complaints of overcharging is worthwhile and has been welcomed.  The Minister has increased the strength of the price inspectorate during his term of office to ensure that all complaints are effectively and speedily dealt with.  The work of the inspectorate continues to increase steadily and that is evidence of the support which the Government give to this service.  It is also evidence that the Government are fulfilling their commitment to operate strict and effective price control.</P>
    <P>I note from the July 1980 monthly report of the NPC that the trend of increasing the workload of the inspectorate was maintained during the second quarter of 1980.  The volume of complaints received during the quarter increased by 52 per cent over the second quarter of 1979.  During that period the inspectorate investigated some 1,797 complaints, 63 of which were substantiated. In addition, the inspectorate dealt with 3,277 enquiries.  The commission report regularly on the operations of the prices inspectorate.  Evidently, the impact of the inspectorate is being increasingly felt in areas where retail prices are controllable and consumers are now more than ever aware of the development in the area of prices.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the increase is advertised in each of the national daily newspapers? If the Deputy is not aware of all these facts, which have been spelled out on numerous occasions, he should not seek to criticise the Government's price control record.  The Deputy has laid great emphasis on the fact that the price increases which he quoted in his speech have been taken from a reply to a Parliamentary Question, but he could not even get these facts right.  He said that meat had been increased by 35 per cent while the rate of inflation was only 19 per cent, but he neglected to state that this price <Col N="382" /> increase took place over the period from 1977 to 1980.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also made many references to recent increases in motor insurance premiums and made numerous insinuations without laying any facts before the House.  He tried to give the impression that the increases were introduced surreptitiously.  These increases have already been the subject of an Adjournment Debate in this House on 20 November last.  On that occasion the Minister of State outlined clearly the facts behind the increases and he emphasised the concern at increases in motor insurance rates which contribute to the rate of inflation.  The fact remains that it is essential for premiums to be adequate to provide for the cost of the service.  Insurance companies must be allowed to charge premium rates which will enable them to meet the cost of claims and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister of State said that the justification for the increases rested on the ever-increasing costs of claims. For most companies claims continue to rise at rates which are higher than the Consumer Price Index.  The purpose of any price increase granted is to allow a company to break even in its underwriting account so that insurance costs are covered.</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright referred to the analysis of price increases outlined in the monthly report of the NPC published in October.  This relates to price applications considered by the commission during July.  He highlighted a figure of £38.2 million as the annualised cost of price increases recommended by the commission during that month.  He said that these represented sizeable increases but he neglected to mention that the price increases sought by the applicant firms totalled £56.9 million on an annualised basis.  In other words, the increases allowed were £18.7 million less than the increases proposed, a reduction of more than 30 per cent.  It is quite evident that not all increases are sanctioned and not all of the recommendations made by the National Prices Commission are sanctioned in full.  On more than 30 occasions since he took office the Minister has refused to sanction increases recommended.  The National Prices Commission are a very responsible body and play an important part in price control. The commission are composed of a representative section of the community.</P>

      <P>The first thing I should like to say in relation to this motion &mdash; and it is something which will be clear to anybody who follows the proceedings of this House &mdash; is that it is the second in a series of motions which have been and will be put down by this party in the months ahead to concentrate the attention of the House and the public on what we regard as the key economic areas.  As a party we have always made the economy our first priority.  A fortnight ago we debated unemployment and this week we are debating prices.  There can be no more critical area after unemployment than the area of prices.  I am not surprised by it but I feel I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are more people who are prepared to make token gestures towards issues like this than they are to do anything about it.  In this House last week we had Deputy Blaney from these backbenches bleating about the economy and how the House was wasting its time.  Deputy Blaney has shown by his absence from this debate the real premium he puts on a key economic issue.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to talk in isolation about prices, but I will keep as closely as I can to the motion.  The movement of prices in an economy is related to a whole range of variables.  Our industrialists and businessmen will say that one man's price increase is another man's job.  The Taoiseach is prone to saying that from time to time as well.  We would argue that one man's job might mean another man's profit margin.  That is a somewhat sterile argument at this particular point of the game but the point might at least be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing we can agree on is that the level of price increases over the past couple of years in general, and over the last year in particular, has been so savage that it is promoting among wage earners generally two very sharp reactions.  The first is the traditional one: workers are looking for higher wages to cover the <Col N="385" /> costs with which they are faced at home and in the shops.  The second reaction, which can be seen in some of the other aspects of the national understanding, is that workers in general and organised labour in particular are beginning to ask themselves what use is money if it cannot buy anything and they are beginning to talk &mdash; rightly, in my opinion &mdash; about the standard of living a person can buy with his wages.  This is a key development which parties on all sides of the House would do well to comprehend.  There is not much use having money in your pocket if prices have gone up to the degree where you cannot supply yourself and your family with the same standard of living you had last year.  The facts and figures of wage increases must be set against the reality of prices.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the Government's price policy in two of the most fundamental areas we could touch on, shelter and food.  The price of housing and food is, I would argue, one of the most political elements in any discussion on prices.  Not enough attention has been given either inside or outside this House in the past &mdash; until tonight &mdash; to identify the causes of the price increases in these areas and to criticise the Government for what they are or are not doing about it.</P>
    <P>In the area of housing, the first main area I want to talk about, the situation is difficult to understand at first sight because houses are being built, bought and occupied.  On the face of it one would think that the housing market was in a splendidly healthy condition, but we argue that private housing, especially in Dublin, has become a paradise for speculators under Fianna Fáil.  The casual visitor might be excused for thinking that the evidence of house building, especially in the outer suburbs, was evidence that an increasing number of young couples were owning their own homes.  The truth is more complex.</P>
    <P>More and more new houses being built in Dublin are being bought by speculators and rented to young couples who simply cannot afford to buy them.  Then when the market price is right, they will be sold again, in all probability to other speculators. Ask any member of any political <Col N="386" /> party who has gone around looking for money or political support in some of these housing estates in Dublin and he will tell you the same thing.  You knock on door after door and find out that the house is owned by a speculator, that the couple with the young family have been in the house for only six months and are moving out again next month either because they cannot afford the rent or because they are emigrating.</P>
    <P>Houses are scarce because the price is high.  Speculators trade in scarcity and they can afford the price.  One of the ironies of this development is that many of these houses are occupied by couples who cannot afford to buy them; but because they can just afford to rent them at an exorbitant cost in terms of their incomes they are deemed to be adequately housed by the local authority and may not go on the local authority priority housing list.  At least, they may go on the list but they will not be considered in need of housing and effectively their chances are nil.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure can be clearly identified.  We all know what one of the major elements in the price of housing is &mdash; the price of building land in general and of developed land in particular. The Government's failure to control the price of building land is now little short of scandalous.  The average cost of a developed site in the Dublin area is now £6,000, twice what it was no more than two years ago.  The Government have not only failed to do something about this but they callously voted down in this House the Labour Land Bill introduced by Deputy Quinn, a modest enough proposal in all conscience but one which would have had the effect of controlling in the public interest the price of development land for house building.  This was done by Fianna Fáil in this House and the moral is obvious.</P>
    <P>To give another statistic in relation to the price of houses; when the famous £1,000 grant was introduced it was equal to about one-quarter of the deposit required for the average new house.  We all know what happened.  Within the two quarters immediately following the introduction of that £1,000 grant for a new <Col N="387" /> house the average price of a new house jumped by £1,000.  Economic arguments can sometimes fall prey to over-simplification and one could not prove in a court of law that one led to the other.  But the people who were waiting to buy houses are the people who were &ldquo;sculled&rdquo; of that extra £1,000 as soon as it was put into their pockets, allegedly by the Government, and taken from them immediately by the builder.  They know what you cannot statistically prove.  They know this scheme was a direct transfer from the taxpayer to the builder through the conduit of the unfortunate young couple who were trying to buy a house.  As I said, it was orignially equal to one-quarter of the deposit required for the average new house.  Today it is worth less than one-fifth of the deposit needed.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil came into office the average wage earner had to work for a third of the week to earn enough to cover his mortgage payments on an average house.  Today he has to work for over half a week to meet his mortgage payments, if he is lucky enough to get a mortgage in the first place.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I should like to give some irrefutable figures in relation to the average cost of new houses in the kind of period we have been talking about.  The figures come from the housing statistics published by the Department of the Environment.  Where building societies are concerned the average price of houses on which they gave loans in 1977 was £14,390.  The average price of the houses for which they gave loans this year was £25,000, nearly double.  The local authority picture is just as bad, if not slightly worse, in proportionate terms.  In 1977 the average price of a house for which a local authority gave a loan was £7,181; in 1980 it was £13,792.</P>
    <P>Of course, of late we have also had the associated banks coming into the housing market making mortgage funds available and, incidentally, criticising the building societies for their housing policy.  We have our own views on these benches about the banks.  In fact, the housing statistics published by the Department of the Environment would lead one to suppose <Col N="388" /> that the only people to whom the banks are lending money for housing are people who are very wealthy indeed.  This would appear to be borne out by the figures for the average price of houses bought with bank mortgages during the period concerned.  In 1977 the average price of a house for which a bank made a loan was £18,978.  In 1980 the average price &mdash; I stress, the average price because one has to stretch one's mind to accommodate it &mdash; of a house for which a bank gave a mortgage was £41,174.  I do not know about other Members of this House but that is not the bracket I am in and I doubt if it is the bracket that many young people looking for houses today are in.  And the proportion of increase in price in this category was greater than that in any of the other categories I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>These general observations have been confirmed dramatically in the past few days with the publication of the report of the National Economic and Social Council &mdash;<i>Economic and Social Policy 1980-83: Aims and Recommendations.</i>  They have identified and quantified the growing uselessness of the £1,000 grant, the growing cost of housing and the growing difficulty in meeting that cost.  Paragraph 5.23 suggests that the average deposit in 1979 &mdash; that is only a year ago &mdash; net of the £1,000 grant for a first-time owner occupier was about £3,600.  The report continues to say:</P>
    <P>This amount, equal to about 15 per cent of the total cost of the house, was nearly three-quarters of the gross average annual industrial earnings.  By the first quarter of 1980 the net cash requirement was near £4,200.</P>
    <P>I stress that it says &ldquo;by the first quarter of 1980&rdquo;&mdash; we are now in the last quarter of 1980 &mdash;&ldquo;the net cash requirement was near £4,200&rdquo;.  In other words, assuming prices were to remain constant &mdash; and that is some assumption &mdash; a young married couple starting out with nothing who were in a position to save £20 a week would be saving for five years before they would accumulate the deposit on a house. Of course, we know what happens: prices <Col N="389" /> do not remain constant.  Anybody who would suggest that the average deposit on a house would be £4,200 in five years' time would need to go to St. Brendan's.</P>
    <P>The plain fact of the matter is that when it comes to housing costs and prices many young people today are in the dispiriting position of the person on a bicycle who wearily breasts the brow of the hill only to discover that there is always another and bigger hill before him.  If it were not so tragic one might almost call to mind the famous clown's trick in the circus.  He drops his hat on the ground, bends down to pick it up and, as he does so, kicks it so that it rolls ahead of him. By the time he bends down again to pick it up, he kicks it again with his foot, so that he never catches up with the hat. The treadmill young couples are on in relation to housing and the price of housing will not end under Fianna Fáil.  I would argue most strongly that only radical action of the kind the Labour Party have proposed in this House &mdash; and that was voted down by Fianna Fáil &mdash; coupled with an integrated, overall approach to the price of housing will make housing a reality for many young people today and remove it from the luxury class and category into which it is rapidly moving.</P>
    <P>Table 34 of the NESC report from which I have already quoted has some daunting information about the repayments to building societies on mortgages on average-priced new houses between 1976 and 1980.  I will give the figures only for 1979.  I shudder to think what the 1980 figures will be when they are available because, unfortunately, they are not.  In 1979 the average loan was £18,746.  The monthly repayment was £238 which represented, in 1979, 58 per cent of the average industrial earnings in transportable goods industries.  What kind of society have we got in which we expect &mdash; quite apart from the question of the deposit, part of which may also have to be borrowed and repaid &mdash; an average family to pay nearly two-thirds of their income to put a roof over their heads? Unless we tackle the question of the public control of the price of building land we will be whistling in the dark as far as this issue is concerned.  It is the purpose <Col N="390" /> of this party to make unmistakably clear to everybody in Ireland looking for a house, everybody in Ireland who is labouring under an increasingly expensive loan at present, exactly where the responsibility for this lies.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the question of food.  There are many elements in the food package in relation to the consumer price index and I do not propose to go into them in any great detail.  Of course, one of the reasons for this is that food prices fluctuate seasonally depending on which quarter one takes.  For example, there could be an increase in the price of tomatoes from 60 per cent to 160 per cent.  We simply cannot make realistic comparisons on that kind of basis.  At the same time one has to be beware of the kind of approach which was evidenced by Deputy Cogan this evening, which was to attempt to blind us with facts and figures in relation to prices in general and not least to the price of food.  I am reminded of what the late and unlamented Marie Antoinette said when she was told that the mob outside were shouting for bread.  When she was told there was no bread she said: &ldquo;Let then eat cake.&rdquo;  The approach of the Government on this issue is to say: let them eat statistics.  Statistics have a high fibre content but very little nutritional value.  I would suggest that the people most affected by the rise in the price of food, and in particular of basic foods, know more and better than to believe that the barrage of statistics emanating from the Government benches on occasions like this will do anything to meet their real needs and problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan made the classic case against subsidies, that they do not discriminate on the ground of income and that therefore they benefit the rich as well as the poor.  That argument is not entirely confined to the party on that side of the House, apparently, but it is an argument from expediency.  If the Government in office could find it in their heart to provide the amount of money which is needed &mdash; I stress &ldquo;is needed&rdquo;&mdash; for subsidies on basic foodstuffs they would not be advancing this argument.  If one <Col N="391" /> were to follow up Deputy Cogan's argument you would have a means test for education because you could not suggest that bread, butter and milk are less necessary to the people than schools, books, education generally.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems here is that poverty in this country &mdash; it is the poor above all who are affected by high prices of basic commodities &mdash; has become increasingly &ldquo;ghettocised&rdquo;.  You will not see poverty in the average suburb built 20 or 30 years ago, you will not see it in many of our moderately prosperous provincial towns.  You will see it in some of the small homesteads dotted around rural areas, you will see it in the ghettoes built, often with the best will in the world by concerned local authorities, on the outskirts of our larger cities and towns, and in the rotting centre of Dublin and in the centres of some of the other urban areas.  It is not so long since the Taoiseach made a highly publicised visit to Seán MacDermott Street in the heart of Dublin.</P>

He went from there quickly but if he had taken another ten minutes and had called around to some of the little huckster shops still to be seen at street corners in the inner city and had asked the shopkeepers what proportion of their turnover comes from milk, bread and butter and whether people were complaining about the prices of these commodities, and if he had gone back to Government Buildings and had done something about it he would have done more to rejuvenate the inner city than all the rhetoric that had gone before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two reports of the Prices Commission for April and May 1980 might as well be the Book of Job for all the bad news they contained, indicating clearly that the incomes of the poorer sections of our population increasingly are concentrated on the purchase of basic food items.  More than half the weekly expenditure of <Col N="392" /> households whose head is out of work is spent on milk, bread, potatoes, a little meat and butter.  Thus, an alteration in the prices of these few items is particularly significant for that type of family group.  It is also significant for the elderly living alone who form the other major sector of the poor in Ireland today. Between mid-May 1977 and mid-August 1980 the price of butter was increased by 24 per cent, milk by 63.2 per cent and bread by 71.6 per cent.  It may be argued that these items are subsidised, but let us look at the subsidy then and now.  In mid-August 1975 when the subsidy on milk was first introduced, the subsidy was 2p or 33.3 per cent of the cost of a pint of milk.  The cost of milk is now 15½p, the subsidy is 1½p, or 9.7 per cent of the price, so the subsidy as a proportion of the price of a pint of milk has gone down from one-third to less than 10 per cent in a period slightly longer than I have been talking about.  In the case of bread, the subsidy was introduced in July 1975 when it represented 32.4 per cent of the price of the average loaf.  It is now 14.1 per cent of the price.</P>
    <P>The poor of Dublin and the other cities and towns in Ireland do not need to be lectured by me about these facts.  They know them in their pockets and in their bellies.  We do not know about them yet and if we did we might do something about it.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Health said that he would carry out the first nutritional survey in Ireland since 1940.  I should like to get a total commitment by that Minister and the Government to a full and adequate survey in this area.  It is not less than scandalous that all Governments since 1940 must bear the shame for the lack of such a survey, particularly because it is these matters that affect the health and strength of the poor.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that I would concentrate on prices policy in two key areas, shelter and food.  If the case I have made does not stand up I have yet to hear it answered adequately by anybody.</P>

      <P>It does not give me any great pleasure to support the motion, simply because there should not be any <Col N="393" /> need for it if we had a commitment to solving the problems of the poorer sections of the community.

      <P>Absolutely, and I will be before long.  Deputy Cogan tried to tell us the whole problem is the result of oil prices, energy costs.  There is no reference to that in the manifesto of 1977 which has now become a dirty word, the supposed programme for national restructure. We can look at the CPI record in the past 3½ years.  Fianna Fáil got in here on the benches on the far side on the basis of being able to provide the way to control and reduce prices.  They provided a manifesto and in that document they devoted a full chapter to the way in which they would control prices.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Cogan praising the NPC when that commission were castigated by Deputy O'Malley for not doing their job from 1973 to 1977.  He said he would restructure the commission in such a way that they would do their job.  He has done nothing since 1977 to restructure the NPC.  All the members of that commission are honest, hard-working people.  The Minister in his subtle, slick way has in the past three years given the impression that the NPC are responsible for price increases.  I note in the media, radio, television and the newspapers, that in many cases the information on price increases is given as recommended by the National Prices Commission, when we all know that it is the Minister who has to sign on the dotted line and approve those price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party not so long ago boasted that it was they who pressurised the National Coalition into introducing subsidies on food when they said that <Col N="394" /> inflation was rampant.  I sat here and listened to different members of that party giving me a lecture on when subsidies should be introduced and when they should be withdrawn.  According to them subsidies should be introduced when inflation is in excess of 15 per cent.  We have had inflation in excess of that figure for the past two years but there is not a word about subsidies.  In fact, as Deputy Horgan pointed out, the proportion of subsidisation on the basic foods is such that it is no longer relevant because it is a subsidy of under 10 per cent against what it was during our term in office. When the chips were down and we saw the need of the less well off, the old age pensioners and the low paid workers, we introduced subsidies of over 30 per cent. Fianna Fáil said that they pressurised us into doing that but now they are in power and the money is needed for other things which in their opinion will get them more votes.  There is great dissatisfaction in the country and the housewives are grumbling because everything they purchase every day in the week is rising in price all the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night Deputy Bermingham, on behalf of the Labour Party, introduced this motion to the House.  We went into a great deal of detail and he had his facts correct.  I assume, after listening to at least one speaker tonight, that he did not hear the motion or did not read it.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes the continuing failure of the Government to take decisive action in the area of the control of prices, notes the continuing attempts by the Government to evade its responsibilities in this area and further notes that the rate of inflation is still almost 19 per cent, and calls on the Government to implement its undertaking in page 10 in the Fianna Fáil Manifesto to discourage increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control or influence so that the impact of inflation on the community, and in particular, on the less protected sections of the community, will be abated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Fianna Fáil introduced an amendment to that which says:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and add:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes and approves of the measures being taken by the Government to control prices in the present difficult economic circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Government are attempting to control prices you can fool me.  In case people have any doubt about another matter, what the Government said they would do in the 1977 General Election, I want to read from pages 10 and 11 of their manifesto:</P>
    <P>Restructure the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>Did they?</P>
    <P>Discourage increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control and influence.</P>
    <P>Did they?</P>
    <P>Investigate middle men's margins.</P>
    <P>Did they?</P>
    <P>Fully disseminate, at least once a week, to radio, television and newspapers, comparative prices of supermarket consumer goods.</P>
    <P>Did they?</P>
    <P>Investigate why Northern Ireland prices are less, apart from tax reasons, than prices in the Republic for the identical product from the same supplier and the same factory, for example, motor cars, parts, tyres, detergents, processed foods, biscuits, clothing and so forth.</P>
    <P>Examine the accounting procedures of the ESB with a view to reducing the price of electricity.</P>
    <P>This is what Fianna Fáil said they would do.  What did they do?  After taking over control of the country the Taoiseach, <Col N="396" /> Deputy Jack Lynch, announced he was handing over prices to a woman member of the Cabinet.  There was dancing in the streets and some of the women's organisations went haywire.  One lady, who went on television, told everybody that it was a great day for Ireland, at last a woman had taken control and we would have what Fianna Fáil promised, a reduction in prices, price control.  She then quietly disappeared from the scene and she has not been heard of since then with regard to prices.  The male chauvinist pigs in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet &mdash; I assume that is what those ladies would call them &mdash; took over and they let prices run riot.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Fianna Fáil Party buy their goods in the same shops as the supporters of the other parties.  It appears they do not.  We have the list, which has not been supplied either by Fine Gael or Labour propaganda machines, but by the Taoiseach's office.  It shows that such items as firelighters are up 61.6 per cent and coal 65.8 per cent, which does not include the most recent increase.  An effort should be made by those who buy coal in small lots to get a scale and weigh the coal as they buy it because I had an example recently of a person selling an eight stone bag of coal with seven stone six pounds in it.  The unfortunate person who bought the coal cannot afford to pay for something like that.  Turf and briquettes are up by 52.4 per cent, paraffin oil 63.2 per cent, bottled gas 80.7 per cent and piped gas 137.9 per cent.  If one wonders why that was an exceptional increase it was subsidised by the National Coalition Government.  Town gas was subsidised and the subsidy was completely removed by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Last night we had an example of somebody here engaging in a practice that I dislike very much.  I am referring to the Minister of State, Deputy Meaney, who, as he is entitled to do, read a prepared script and gave us his side of the story.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the question of increases, the percentage increase in respect of electricity was 62.7, in respect of fuel oil it was 94 and according to the newspapers there will be an announcement of a further increase in this regard of 6p per gallon within the next couple of weeks.  This is what Fianna Fáil have produced despite their promise to control prices.  They told us they would deal with the problem differently from the way in which it had been dealt with by anybody else.  That part of the manifesto was a lie. Consequently, Fianna Fáil have been living a lie ever since.  Everything they do is contrary to what they promised.  One would not mind if they were a crowd of greenhorns who had never been in government <Col N="398" /> before but they have been in government longer than any other group in this country.  They made promises which they knew they could not keep but having got away with that attitude and having been returned to office they proceeded to break every one of these promises.</P>
    <P>They may say that they kept their promise in respect of car tax but this is not so.  In a reply to a parliamentary question on October 21 we were told that car tax has been reduced by 78 per cent whereas we know that there is still a form of tax for every car.  I am referring to the registration fee which was increased from £5 to £10.  We can only wait and see what the increase will be in this regard in the forthcoming budget. We were told also that there has been a reduction in rates and water charges to the extent of 100 per cent.  In other words we are not supposed to be paying rates or water charges at all.  The situation is that water rates have been increased in the period in question by from 300 to 400 per cent.  The official in the Taoiseach's Department who compiled the information given to us must not have been aware of this situation.  Are the local authorities wrong?  Should the water rates have been abolished?  If this is so I hope that those responsible will ensure that water rates are not charged to people again and that those who have paid them will be refunded.</P>
    <P>I must cut short much of what I have to say because of the time factor.  We are governed by a group of people who promised specifically to do certain things but who have failed to do so.  They have allowed increases under practically every heading.  In these circumstances they have a hard neck to put down an amendment of the kind that has been tabled to this motion.  While all this is happening those same gentlemen are going around the country lecturing the working people, telling them that they should not seek increases in wages because such increases would have the effect of putting other working people out of employment.  I was a trade union official for 30 years.  During that time I reared a family and I know from that and from going into the homes <Col N="399" /> of working class people now how difficult it is for those people to live.  A working man whose wages are not sufficient to meet the household bills will not be prepared to accept lower wages.  Neither will he be prepared to resist seeking an adequate wage increase in order to allow him to purchase the necessities of life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan was very polite in referring to what the working people are living on.  During my young days when times were very bad, it was said that the old people lived on bread and butter. When margarine was introduced it became a substitute for butter for these old people but now because both margarine and butter are about the same price, they are lucky if they have the bread.  They must pay for coal at £4.40 for an eight-stone bag in country districts. Milk is 15p per pint.  Is it any wonder, then, that they are not able to afford either margarine or butter?  Recently I was surprised to find people talking about the cost of meat and posing the question why there cannot be more meat for the people when there is so much being put aside in the EEC.  I know that many people have not eaten meat for a very long time.  Day after day I meet people who tell me that they cannot afford this commodity.  I receive many letters also to this effect, often with a little footnote to the effect that sometimes they can afford meat on Sundays.  This, then, is the glorious country which Fianna Fáil have been promising &mdash; a land flowing with <Col N="400" /> milk and honey.  That is the case for some, but it is not flowing with milk and honey for those who, as Deputy Horgan says, are paying up to £30 per week in rent for a house that they cannot afford to buy.  There is no question of a land flowing with milk and honey for those people who find it so difficult to buy clothes for their families or for those who are being asked now to pay examination fees for their children despite the fact that these examinations are not due to take place until next June.  I have met at least four people who have told me that the amount of money being sought from them in respect of those fees represents more than the breadwinner is taking home after his week's work.  Yet, Fianna Fáil tell us that only they can run the country.  Only Fianna Fáil would dare do what is being done now.</P>

      <P>When we handed over the reins of Government in 1977, the consumer price index, according to a reply to a question here yesterday, was 10.8 per cent.  The following year, because of the planning involved, this figure was reduced to 7.9 per cent.  In the following year it was 16 per cent while it is 19 per cent now and increasing.  In these circumstance anybody who votes against our motion this evening must be voting against his conscience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> At Question Time today I asked the Minister for the Environment to give particulars of the increase in the rent of a person living in County Cavan whose name I gave, and if he would take steps to have the rent reduced as it is beyond the tenant's capacity to pay.  The person I had in mind is a widow with two qualifying children and other children in the house who, while they are over the qualifying age, are still not bringing in any income.  The Minister replied that the rent of this woman in 1979 was £3.42p. In accordance with the ministerial rent scheme for 1980, the correct rent for that tenant had risen to £16.51p.  In fact, it was raised in her case to £21.97p but that was a mistake and I am not making any point out of it.  I am taking it that the rent has been increased in this case from £3.42p in 1979 to £16.51p in 1980.  Now, the only income that this woman has is a widow's pension to keep herself and her children.  The only increase, or alteration, in her means between 1979 and 1980, when the increase took place, was the increase in the widow's pension.  I have not the exact figures for that but, as we know, it about took care of inflation. As a matter of fact, inflation went ahead so rapidly that it did not cover inflation for the full year.  This woman finds herself with an increase in rent of something like £12 per month.  I am putting it to the Minister that that is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed that in my constituency there has been a dramatic increase in tenants' rents, which seems to hit hardest in the case of isolated cottages where the people are dependent on social welfare. That is because, for the first time the entire social welfare payment is taken into account this year.  The Minister, in <Col N="404" /> the course of his reply stated, by implication, that there was a hardship clause in the tenant's rent scheme of 1980 and that it was a matter for Cavan County Council to operate this hardship scheme and reduce the rent.  All I can say is that I am surprised that the Minister should make that case, at a time when local authorities, including Cavan County Council, are starved of revenue, when they were pinned down by the Minister's Department last year to an increase of 10 per cent while inflation is 20 per cent. One cannot expect local authorities in that situation to be very generous when, in fact, they are having to dispense with the services of some road workers and put other road workers on a three-day week.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to amend the iniquitious 1980 rent scheme in so far as it applies to people who are dependent on social welfare.  For all practical purposes this woman is dependent on social welfare.  The Minister stated in the course of his reply that she also has land.  I do not want to identify the lady, but the Minister knows the valuation of the land is £7.50 and the estimated income from the land on a poor law valuation basis is £2 per week.  The fact of the matter is that she is living on snipe grass and that the actual income in her case is nil.</P>
    <P>I put down this question for oral answer because of my experience and because I know that some rents have been increased much more than this one. Some of them have been increased from £5, £6 or £7 a month to as much as £40 a month.  According to any standards, that is a brutal increase from one year to another.  Why should these people who are living on the poverty line and below it be asked to pay five times their existing rent?  That is what is happening.  I have a file inches thick from this woman of letters saying that she cannot afford to pay this rent.  Other people throughout the country, and I am sure in every county in Ireland, have the same story.  The Minister cannot deny that people living in isolated cottages and depending on social welfare are the worst hit.  It is most unfair to hit them.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I should <Col N="405" /> like him to explain what change was made between 1979 and 1980 in the scheme for fixing rents of local authority tenants and particularly those who are dependent on social welfare.  There was a dramatic increase, as this question shows, and there must have been a significant change in the machinery for calculating the rents. In this case the only change was an increase in a widow's pension.  That increase was not generous by any means and it was said that it was intended to cover inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy should be aware, I have no function in relation to the setting of rents.  In the case of individual tenants this is a matter for the housing authority who have an absolute discretion to reduce rents where conditions of hardship so warrant.  The national rent schemes for local authority dwellings are worked out in the course of consultations between my Department and the Department of Finance with representatives of local authorities and the National Association of Tenants' Organisations.  Arrangements are already in train for the preparation of a rents scheme for 1981. Recently I received representations from the National Association of Tenants' Organisations about the impact of changes made in the 1980 scheme in the case of recipients of social assistance similar to the case mentioned by the Deputy. <Col N="406" /> The representations will be fully and sympathetically considered when the rents scheme for 1981 is being formulated.</P>
      <P>I have not got time to go into this in detail.  A circular letter H14/18 issued to the local authorities on 26 March 1980 explaining in detail the changes made. The main change was to cut out anomalies. Let us look at this in its proper context.  The average rent of a local authority house throughout the country today is £3.50 a week.  The subsidy the taxpayer has to pay for local authority houses is just over £60 million a year.  I receive very few complaints about this scheme.  In my own constituency I received none.  I have defended the scheme.  I have stated the facts about the scheme.  I outlined what they were and I received no direct representation from anybody in connection with them.  My Department did.  The National Association of Tenants' Organisations brought to my notice cases similar to that mentioned by the Deputy.  It will be looked into when we are formulating the 1981 scheme.</P>
      <P>The manager in Laois-Offaly is very sympathetic in cases of genuine hardship and I have no doubt that the Cavan county manager is equally sympathetic. There is a section in the scheme under which he can adjust the rent accordingly in any case of hardship.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 December 1980.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, which came into operation on 16 May 1978, local authority houses sold to tenants must be disposed of in fee simple, subject to certain temporary restrictions on the use and resale of the houses. Where a housing authority have not the fee simple interest in land on which they have provided houses, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, <Col N="298" /> 1978, empowers the authority to acquire such interest.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Dublin Corporation are experiencing some difficulty in acquiring the fee simple interest in some of the older housing estates, including those in the district mentioned by the Deputy.  The acquisition of the fee simple interest in these cases can in many instances be complex and time consuming, involving as it does, negotiations with private landowners and corporate bodies.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Corporation are dealing with this matter in a responsible manner and as expeditiously as possible and that the tenants of the houses involved are not being denied the opportunity of buying out their houses under the various tenant purchase schemes.  I understand that the corporation are examining means of accelerating the process of acquisition of the fee simple, including the deployment of extra staff where necessary in order to expedite the sale of the houses involved to the tenants in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate requirements involved in this matter, namely, the issue of a hunting licence and the issue of a firearms certificate.  A hunting licence is issued by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry who also prescribes by regulation the type of weapon which may be used in hunting deer species.  A firearms certificate is issued by the Garda Superintendent of the district in which the applicant resides.  The conditions governing the grant of a firearm certificate are set out in the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1971, the most relevant one being that the superintendent must be satisfied that the applicant &ldquo;can be permitted to have in his possession, use, and carry a firearm or ammunition without danger to the public safety or to the peace&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Firearms Acts contain no provision for the making of regulations by me in the matter of safety standards.  While I do not exclude the possibility that some changes in the present practice in relation to the issue of firearms certificates may have to be considered, I would find it difficult to see how regulations as such could effectively deal with the sort of risk that can arise where the holder of a certificate is actually engaged in hunting.</P>

      <P>An EEC directive on legislation regulating and registering the practice of architecture has been the subject of discusions for many years.  Following the meeting of national experts on 22 July 1980 which ended in deadlock, further consideration of the matter has been adjourned.  The question of legislation many in due course need to be considered in connection with proposals in this regard from the E.E.C.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a difference between the nominal and the actual rate of interest paid on loans from building societies.  I understand that this arises because mortgage interest is calculated for the whole year on the amount of capital outstanding at the beginning of the year and that this system of charging interest, of which borrowers are fully aware, is well established practice, has considerable administrative simplicity and to change it would not in practice help borrowers.</P>
      <P>I understand also that the apparent difference between the nominal and actual rate of interest holds true only if all loan repayments are paid on the due date.  This, of course, is not the case and societies, unlike many other financial institutions, treat loan repayments which are paid within a month of becoming due as being paid on the due date.  In practice, therefore, the difference between the nominal and the actual rate of interest is reduced.</P>
