I do so fully discharge it.  I do not think it appropriate that I should be queried here on the kind of details asked in the question, namely, how often I visit Áras an Uachtaráin, where I meet the President or anything of that nature.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the cost of the provision of a dining room in his Department; (b) whether tenders were sought for this work; (c) whether tenders were sought for the provision of catering services and (d) whether the catering accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a dining room in Government Buildings forms part of the ongoing refurbishment <Col N="567" /> scheme for the north block, Government Buildings.  The expenditure on the dining room is not recorded separately and to segregate the cost of these works would require a detailed examination by a quantity surveyor which would involve an inordinate amount of time and expense. The order of cost, however, of providing the dining room and ancillary facilities is approximately £20,000.</P>
      <P>Tenders for the refurbishment of the north block of Government Buildings were invited in January 1979 and a contract was placed in April 1979.  The question of inviting separate tenders for the dining room did not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>Three catering organisations were approached in connection with the provision of catering services.  One of these indicated that it was not capable of providing the service required.  One of the remaining two concerns was then selected, on the basis that it was best equipped to provide the quality of service required and had the necessary experience in the field.  No formal contract has been entered into with the catering organisation concerned, pending experience with the operation of the dining facility.</P>
      <P>The expenditure involved in the operation of the dining facilities will be charged to my Department's Vote or to subhead C of the Vote for Miscellaneous Expenses, which covers State entertainment, as appropriate.  These Votes are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General in accordance with normal procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the ongoing refurbishing scheme taking place in his offices.  He mentioned that three catering firms had been approached.  May I take it that they were approached to furnish tenders for the catering facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Taoiseach considers the catering facilities of this House inadequate, since he has <Col N="568" /> provided facilities in his own office for his own purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think that at all.  This is an entirely separate matter. The facility which I have thought it necessary to provide is largely an economy measure, a saving of both time and money in so far as this particular matter is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach why, in his reply to parliamentary question No. 11 of 21 October 1980 under the heading &ldquo;housing&rdquo; he had shown a 100 per cent reduction in rates and water charges between mid-May 1977 and mid-August 1980, although water charges, while still being collected in all cases, have been substantially increased in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore) Séan Moore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the present consumer price index representative price indicators are used for each item included in the index.  The individual price indicators are weighted by their share in consumer expenditure to give a composite index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price indicator specified for the <Col N="569" /> item &ldquo;rates and water charges of owner occupied dwellings&rdquo; referred to by the Deputy was obtained by combining the changes in the rate poundage struck by all local authorities in the country.  When domestic rates were abolished in 1978, it followed that there was a 100 per cent reduction in the relevant price indicator as I indicated in my reply to the parliamentary question of 21 October 1980.</P>
    <P>As charges for public water supplies to the majority of householders in the country located in urban local authority areas were incorporated in domestic rates, a separate price indicator was not considered necessary for domestic water charges levied separate from rates for householders in other areas when the present consumer price index was introduced. In fact, it is estimated that the level of these separate water charges in 1977 would have to be more than quadrupled to increase the consumer price index by even one-tenth of 1 per cent, a negligible increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is most remarkable that the Taoiseach's office should issue a document which says that there has been a 100 per cent reduction in rates and water charges when, in fact, everything was going up, throughout this country?  Dublin is not Ireland, as the Minister seems to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The water charges for most local authorities have been increased by between 300 and 600 per cent.  Is the Minister telling the House and me that since water rents were being collected along with rates in certain areas and are not now collectable, water rates, as such, should be completely abolished?  Is the Minister saying that there was the intention when this was done, because that would appear to be logical?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my answer, even if the change which the Deputy is suggesting were made, it would increase <Col N="570" /> the consumer price index by only one-tenth of 1 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to ask a question. What the Minister is saying is that because it is small it is not necessary to show it in the returns given by the Taoiseach. In fact, although there have been tremendous increases amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds throughout this country in water rents to people who can ill afford to pay them, the Minister says it is insignificant and does not need to be mentioned.  Will he answer my first question, which is, will the people who are being charged water rents, illegally according to the reply received here, now get a refund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not make any guarantee. I would, however, point out to the Deputy that the Government, in abolishing rates, have brought tremendous benefits to people.  The Deputy's point is only a very small one in the whole matter.</P>

      <P>I am merely trying to determine the level of unemployment. Would the Minister agree that 8,500 persons on systematic short-term work were included in 1979 but excluded from 1 January 1980?  If they and the 1,200 over 65 are included that would give a real figure, in fact, of at least 124,000 now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have accepted that.  I would point out, however, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, that the Government <Col N="572" /> are concerned about the level of unemployment.</P>

      <P>Could I get clarification on the figures given?  Am I right in thinking that the figures just given and referred to on this side of the House show that the increase in the number of short-time workers has in two months risen from something like 900 to 7,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am endeavouring to find out, to confirm the figure.  The Minister mentioned a figure for September which left a difference of 2,100 of which 1,200 are accounted for as being the people over 65 and for October a difference of 3,600, and for November a difference of 8,200</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for confirmation that that means that the figures rose from 900 to 7,000 for short-time working in two months.  That is what these figures give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very concerned with the whole matter but I would point out that the impact of these new figures is reflected in the fact that the adjusted increase in the live register for November was less than half the average increase in the previous six months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the total expenditure on Third World aid by the Government for the first nine months of 1980; the total figure provided for in 1980 by the Government for this area of expenditure; and if it is the intention of the Government to provide further assistance in the final quarter of 1980 in the light of the continued major public criticisms of Government policy concerning the cut-back in the budget provision of 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 25 March 1980, the total allocation for Ireland's official development assistance, ODA, in 1980 is £16,226 million, an increase of 12 per cent on the amount available in 1979.</P>
      <P>The question of the out-turn for the first nine months of 1980 cannot be easily answered.  The Deputy will be aware that a substantial portion of our ODA takes the form of multilateral payments to various agencies involved in third world development.  The rate of call-up of these funds varies and no significance attaches to a particular level of expenditure at any one time of the year.  The important thing is that all, if possible, of the moneys allocated to official development assistance should be expended in that way and not lost through failure on the part of the agency concerned to effect a call-up. Having said that, I can tell the Deputy that it is estimated that approximately £10 million, or 62 per cent of the total allocation, was spent in the first nine months of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been able to meet our commitments this year in the bilateral aid programme as elsewhere.  Not all of the amount we had set aside as payment to the European Development Fund was required this year.  We therefore were able to transfer these savings within the Vote for International Co-operation so as to give an additional £100,000 each to <Col N="583" /> APSO and the Fund for Disaster Relief. We also have an additional £159,000 for the UN Development Programme and, finally, we have added £1,202,000 to the grant-in-aid for the Bilateral Aid Fund. This very substantial additional sum has enabled the bilateral aid programme to meet all its commitments this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly 62 per cent of the budgeted figure was expended in the first nine months.  Has the Minister any additional explanation to give to the House for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that that is not unusual.  It is a variable matter.  The important fact is that at the end of the year it is expected that the total allocation will have been spent.  I have been able to effect this by reason of the internal transfers that I mentioned, particularly the substantial transfer of £1,202,000 to the bilateral aid fund.  I moved an Estimate on this aspect about a month ago in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the original estimate showed a cut-back of 28 per cent in bilateral aid, what will the effective cut-back now be, having regard to the internal transfers to which the Minister has referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can work out the percentages from the figures I have given.  The main point is that the overall global increase was of the order of 12 per cent on the amount available in 1979.  That includes both bilateral and multilateral aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

Similar arrangements are possible for people in the public sector other than civil servants.</P>
      <P>The granting of leave of absence in similar circumstances to somebody in the private sector is a matter for arrangement between the individual and his or her employer.  There is already a general provision in the Social Welfare Acts whereby persons who have acquired pension rights under the social insurance system and cease to be insurably employed may protect those rights by becoming voluntary contributors.</P>

      <P>The 11th Special Session <Col N="585" /> of the UN General Assembly on international economic co-operation for development took place in New York from 25 August to 15 September last.  In my view some very important and constructive results were achieved by the special session.  The text of a new international development strategy for the third UN development decade was completed. This will be formally adopted by the General Assembly at its current regular session.  A text on procedures and time-frame for a round of global negotiations, within the UN system, on international economic co-operation for development was agreed on by all delegations, except three.  Discussions of the proposed global negotiations, notably on the agenda, are being continued at the current regular session of the General Assembly, with a view to the launching of these negotiations in 1981.  These were the main achievements of the special session.  In addition, a resolution on measures to meet the critical economic situation in the least developed countries and a resolution on suggestions recently made by the UN Secretary-General to overcome the critical economic situation of many developing countries were adopted by consensus by the 11th Special Session of the UN General Assembly on 15 September 1980.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports of persecution of adherents of the Baha'i faith in Iran have come to my attention.  These reports are a matter of serious concern to the Government, as are reports of interference with other religious communities in Iran.  In my address to the United Nations General Assembly on 30 September last, I specifically called on the Government and people of Iran to respect the rights of others with whom they may differ on <Col N="587" /> a political or religious basis and to uphold fundamental and humanitarian principles.</P>
    <P>The internal situation in Iran has been unstable for some time, and has been characterised by the absence of a clearly identifiable centre of political power.  The situation is now further complicated by the hostilities between Iraq and Iran and the effects of these hostilities within Iran. Given the absence of a central authority which is fully in control of the country, and the current hostilities, representations to the Iranian authorities in regard to religious freedoms can be expected to be of limited effectiveness for the present and might even prove to be counter-productive. At the same time there are hopeful signs that Iran is becoming increasingly aware of its isolation in the international community and may possibly be more responsive in the future to international concerns on issues such as religious freedom.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to follow developments in Iran closely and to examine, along with our partners in the EEC, suitable opportunities which may arise to convey to the Iranian authorities their concern on the matter of religious freedom, including the treatment of the Baha'is.  The Government are prepared to support any initiative to have the treatment of the Baha'is discussed in appropriate international fora.</P>

      <P>The Deputies may wish to be aware that a resolution calling for human rights and fundamental freedoms in El Salvador was adopted in the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, on 3 December.  I feel that the adoption of this resolution will serve to focus international attention on the appalling situation prevailing in that country.  I can assure the Deputies that our delegation at the UN played a major part in the informal discussions on the drafting of this resolution and that we supported its adoption.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to express the abhorrence of the Government at the most recent atrocity committed in El Salvador and to extend sympathy to the Irish relatives and friends of the murdered sisters.</P>

      <P>I take the opportunity of joining that expression of sympathy. With respect the Minister does not appear to have dealt with the main part of my question, which was also mentioned in Deputy Dr. Browne's question, the position in relation to the continued US support for the junta.  I understand that that support was suspended in the last week but not totally stopped.  Bearing in mind that 9,000 people have died there over the past year, would the Minister voice our view to the Americans that all aid to the repressive junta in El Salvador should be stopped?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall from previous replies I have given on this matter that the British and Irish Governments have agreed to refer the delimitation of the Continental Shelf to an independent settlement of disputes procedure <Col N="591" /> in the form of an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration.  I should stress that the delimitation embraces a very large area extending over the entire extent of the Continental Shelf contiguous to Ireland and Britain, consequently the arbitration will not be dealing only with Rockall or any other feature in isolation, as the Deputy's question suggests, but will adjudicate on all relevant matters affecting the delimitation of the shelf between the two countries.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated, the agreement to submit this matter to arbitration was subject to the two Governments having agreed on the terms of reference of the tribunal, its composition and other related matters.  To this end negotiations at official level are continuing between the two Governments.</P>
      <P>Of the different options open to the two sides, <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration, which was first proposed by us to the British Government in April 1976, offers the most appropriate form of procedure for settlement of this issue.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration by its nature means that there is no existing institutional or procedural machinery which the parties can have recourse to, consequently a great deal of work must be done before the arbitration proper commences.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department, in co-operation with the Attorney General and other interested Departments, is giving this matter the highest priority and that it is progressing as rapidly as is prudent given its complexity and importance.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Keeffe</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he made an address to Irish-Americans at the New York Statler Hotel on 25 September 1980; and, if so, if he made any appeal not to support Noraid and the Irish National Caucus in line with the call made by the Taoiseach in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I delivered the speech to which the Deputy refers in the Statler Hotel, New York on 25 September 1980 to prominent members of the Irish-American community.  In my speech I was concerned to spell out a positive role for the Irish-American community in relation to Ireland, in line with the Taoiseach's speech on 27 July in Cork.  This in itself was an important counter to organisations tainted by support for violance since these have on many occasions gained propaganda points by portraying Irish policy in this area as a purely negative posture.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the strong emphasis in my speech on exclusively peaceful means, on reconciliation, and on the democratic process clearly amounted to an appeal, couched in positive rather than negative terms, to repudiate all who do not subscribe to these values in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Fitzgerald Dr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not refer to the two organisations to which the Taoiseach had referred previously in his speech?  Why did the Minister omit them?  It was noted in press comments that he had done so and it was referred to as buttering up those elements. Why would the Minister want to butter them up and why was he not explicit, as the Taoiseach had been in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quite explicit in a number of radio interviews I did subsequent to the speech.  I should like to emphasise that the middle of the road <Col N="593" /><i>Irish Echo</i>, a very sensible and responsible paper with a circulation of 40,000, reported my speech on the front page of its issue of 4 October and devoted a favourable editorial to it.  They took the view that it was welcome to have somebody coming from Ireland to speak about Irish issues in a positive rather than a negative manner.  I made my appeal on those terms and I felt it was the right approach to be positive rather than negative in regard to getting across to Irish Americans the importance of following the Irish Government, no matter what Government was in power, in regard to dealing in a democratic and responsible manner with the Northern problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Fitzgerald Dr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister appealed to them not to give assistance to those who might be undertaking improper activities, why was he so coy about naming the bodies named by the Taoiseach?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not speak to them in any condemnatory manner.  Irish-Americans have tended to feel rather cut away from the realities of the situation when people lecture them.  These are a mature community making their way within the American way of life and I sought to speak to them on a mature and constructive basis which was the right approach to mature people rather than going over there to lecture them and condemn sections of them in any particular manner.  I think it was a reasonably successful speech on that account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly asked people <Col N="594" /> not to support Noraid and they are undoubtedly identified with the raising of funds for the Provisional IRA and other illegal activities of violence in Northern Ireland.  In regard to the Irish National Caucus I said here in answer to a previous question that there are many well-meaning people within that organisation and I sought to pitch my appeal to them and to well-meaning people within Irish American organisations generally who unfortunately do not know the facts about Ireland and do not realise that there is an Irish Government, democratically elected, with an Irish Army and Irish police and that this is the democratic body that speaks for all sensible Irish people in dealing with matters in the North.

      <P>The basic function of the United Nations Security Council is laid down in the United Nations Charter which provides that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations, its members confer on the Security Council <Col N="595" /> primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. </P>
    <P>The work of the Security Council derives mainly from this responsibility.  The Charter provides that the Security Council may investigate any dispute or any situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute, and that members of the United Nations may bring disputes to the attention of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The Security Council thus tends to deal with international disputes or threats to peace as they arise and, to a considerable extent, the issues and the manner in which they come before the Council are not predictable.</P>
    <P>During Ireland's two-year membership of the Council beginning on 1 January next, the Government intend to play their part in efforts to resolve whatever international disputes are considered by the Council.  Where the Council has already set out the principles on which the settlement of a dispute should be based, the Government will join in the effort to promote implementation accordingly.  We shall do so in keeping with the general aims of our foreign policy for a more peaceful, stable and just international order which I mentioned in my Estimates speech in June this year. Where we have established positions on particular issues, our policy will of course continue to be based on these positions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has never been any ambiguity regarding our unequivocal support for the common agricultural policy which, apart from the Customs Union, and its associated Common Commercial Policy is as yet the only fully developed Community policy.  The policy itself is enshrined in the Treaty and its fundamental principles (<i>viz:</i> Free Trade and Community preference and the creation of a market organisation based on common prices coupled with financial solidarity to bear the cost of this common policy) have been repeatedly reaffirmed by the Council of Ministers&mdash;(most recently in its decision of 30 May 1980 on the British budgetary problem).  The CAP has over the years acted as a major force for European integration, ensured security of food supplies and contributed to the economic and social stability of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the Community is financed by common customs duties, agricultural levies and such proportion of member states' VAT revenues, not to exceed the presently agreed ceiling of 1 per cent, as is required to cover agreed expenditure.  The fact that Community policies are financed by the Community's independent &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; marks in a special way its nature as a Community.  The Community is now approaching the presently agreed ceiling of 1 per cent of VAT receipts.  We have repeatedly stated our view that an increased maximum of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; is vital&mdash;not just for the necessary development of the Common Agricultural Policy, but also for continuing the process of European integration through the development of comprehensive and effective Community policies in other areas.  For instance, any serious attempt at &ldquo;reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions&rdquo; as called for in the very preamble of the Treaty, will require a substantial increase in funds such as the Regional and Social Funds, while the enlargement of the Community <Col N="598" /> and the development of its policies in fields such as energy, industry, transport and so on are likely to require additional budgetary resources.  For these reasons the current debate on the Community's own resources will be conducted, not just within the confines of the Community's agricultural policy, but rather in the broader terms of the future nature of the Community.</P>

      <P>Talks on a bilateral basis have already taken place between the Danish Foreign Minister and myself and I propose to see the Dutch Foreign Minister shortly on this basis as well.  It is clearly in the interests of the smaller countries within the Community, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and ourselves, to ensure that the 1 per cent ceiling is eliminated because it is clearly a barrier to future Community progress in terms of the Community itself rather than in terms of the bigger members.</P>

To run the Community and to provide a proper Community policy they have preferred to seek an increase of funds to that end and have a proper common agricultural policy. All of this was estimated three years ago in a report and should mean a VAT level of 3 per cent rather than 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>No grants are directly available from EEC funds to assist in the provision of sporting facilities, club pavilions or community halls.  However, the Department of Education operate a temporary youth employment scheme under <Col N="600" /> which young people are recruited to work on certain projects beneficial to the community and the majority of these projects provide for the building of dressing rooms, clubhouses, community centres and other sporting facilities.  Financial assistance has been obtained for this scheme from the European Social Fund in 1979 and in 1980 and an application for aid in 1981 has been filed.  £213,345 was granted in 1979 and an amount of £124,000 has been approved for 1980.</P>
      <P>Certain sporting facilities linked to the development of tourism in Border areas may be aided under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2619/80 of 7 October 1980 providing for aid for border areas from the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Brandt report, officially the Report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues, published earlier this year, is a uniquely important contribution to the discussions and negotiations on international economic issues between the developed and developing countries, the so-called North-South dialogue, which has assumed major importance in the international agenda in recent years.  The report looks at the main issues of the dialogue and makes numerous recommendations regarding steps that need to be taken to overcome the many economic difficulties that now confront developed and developing countries.  As I said in a recent Seanad debate on the subject, the Brandt report is probably the most important document on North-South matters to appear in our time.  I have no doubt that it will exercise a strong influence on future negotiations in the North-South dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here at home, as elsewhere, it has attracted much attention.  Its recommendations are many and not all of these, of course, apply to this country.  It is much too early yet to say in what way precisely Ireland can contribute effectively to follow-up work on the report.  Several of the recommendations relate, as the report acknowledges, to work that is now in progress.  It is, however, clear that new initiatives and new approaches are needed.  We will play our part, individually and as a member state of the European Community, to try to ensure that the decade of the eighties will see a progressive <Col N="602" /> involvement of the developing countries in the running of the global economy at all levels.  Bilaterally, we will continue to strengthen our co-operation with a number of the poorer developing countries; and we will move, as rapidly as our resources allow, towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for Official Development Assistance (ODA).  What we can do as a small country is obviously limited by our resources and our circumstances, but we have built up a good track record in recent years and we will not be found wanting in our overall response to the Brandt report in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the enthusiastic welcome that the Minister obviously is giving to the very important Brandt Report.  Everybody knows the fate of reports all through the centuries. Are the Government prepared to make any special arrangements to the extent that the recommendations referring to our country are dealt with as expeditiously as possible?  Is there any likelihood of a Government sub-committee being established to see that the matter is dealt with rather than simply pitched here, as happens with reports under all Governments? It is particularly important, as the Minister has said.</P>

      <P>As far as the Brandt report is concerned, there is no question about its importance and I am, as the Deputy suggests, having it examined in my Department in regard to ways that we as a nation can help in the follow-up.  We are playing our part already in the Community. We are concerned with the main theme of the Brandt report, which is the impact of our strategy in the new international world order.  In effect this means the organisation of the finance mechanism generally, both public and private, in the developed world to ensure a massive transfer of funds to the developing world.  This is one of the accidents of history.  Unfortunately, side by side with the report there was the very serious situation caused by the hiking up of oil prices which does not make for the Government <Col N="603" /> having the budgetary freedom to do what they would like to do in many ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement on the European Council held in Luxembourg on Monday and <Col N="660" /> Tuesday of last week which I attended with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Greece, which will become a full member of the community on 1 January next, was represented at the Council for the first time by its Prime Minister and foreign Minister. I have had the Presidency Conclusions on the proceedings laid before both Houses in the usual way.</P>
      <P>The prevailing mood of the meeting was one of concern arising from the very serious economic and social situation facing the Community, the danger of further increases in the price of oil, developments in Poland and the growing tension in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>The meeting began with a discussion of the tragic situation in Southern Italy following the recent earthquake.  The Italian Prime Minister informed the Council that on his latest information 5,000 people died, 10,000 were injured and 500,000 rendered homeless, as a result of the catastrophe.  The Council willingly responded to the Italian Government's request for exceptional Community aid to be given in the form of both food and finance.</P>
      <P>The Council emphasised again the shock to the world economy of the increases in the price of oil, which have impinged severely on Europe and, particularly so in our case, given our very open economy and our relatively high dependence on external sources for our energy supplies.  The Council accepted that the increases contributed in a major way to the economic recession.  The surplus on current account of the oil producing countries this year is estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars.  A large proportion of this is money and wealth withdrawn from the Community countries. We are that much poorer as a direct result of the price rises and there is no way we can make up the difference except by measures to conserve energy, substitute other products for oil and increase productivity generally, the size of the effect on our economy alone can be gauged from the fact that oil imports cost Ireland over ten times more now than in 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stressed particularly the continuing increase in unemployment which is now <Col N="661" /> at unprecedentedly high levels in some member states and is forecast by the Commission to rise further in the Community in 1981.  There was widespread acceptance of the need for renewed efforts both at national and Community level to alleviate unemployment, particularly among youth.  Unemployment in the Community is now over seven million and is forecast to increase further unless corrective measures are taken.  The Commission's communication which we had before us provided a useful assessment of the situation and recommended measures to promote investment as well as to strengthen competitiveness and the structure of the member states' economies.</P>
    <P>As a result of these discussions there will now be a special Council meeting comprising Economic, Finance and Social Affairs Ministers and this meeting will have before it a number of studies in the sphere of employment policy prepared for it by the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall here that the policies of some of the larger member states remain restrictive and are dominated by concern with reducing inflation. In pursuit of this they are aiming at single figure wage settlements this year and again in 1981.  Furthermore, trading prospects in our main export markets are doubtful, with the Commission forecasting that economic growth next year in the Community will be less than one per cent.</P>
    <P>With this approach by our partners, whose economies are stronger and richer than our own, it would be irresponsible on our part to think that we can ignore these realities.  It is essential then that in our wage bargaining we remain competitive and take account of the difficult trading conditions facing us.</P>
    <P>I availed myself of the opportunity provided by the Council to impress on our partners the need to arrest the steep fall in farm incomes which has occurred over the last two years in every country of the Community.  I emphasised the provisions of the EEC Treaty dealing with fair living standards for the agricultural community. I argued, in particular, that the Community must have full regard to the economic and social importance of the <Col N="662" /> family farm as well as the importance of agriculture to our security and economic well-being.  Between now and the end of this century, the population of the world will grow by more than it has grown in all time up to now.  The prospect makes a sound and efficient agriculture in Europe imperative.  We must not put our food at risk in the same way as our energy supplies now are.  I succeeded in having recorded in the Presidency Conclusions that Community instruments must primarily be directed at improving infrastructure and the economic situation in the less-favoured rural regions as well as reducing structural unemployment.</P>
    <P>During our discussions on monetary and financial matters, it was agreed that the EMS, which is now nearly two years in existence, has functioned well despite disequilibria in currencies caused by balance of payments difficulties associated with oil price increases.  We confirmed the previous commitment to developing the EMS made at the Bremen and Brussels European Council in 1978 and asked the Commission and the Council to continue their work to this end.  In the meantime, existing agreements on support arrangements are to be renewed.</P>
    <P>There was also some discussion at our meeting of the need for measures to encourage innovation, which is essential if industries in the Community are to remain competitive and to sustain, if not increase, employment.</P>
    <P>It was accepted that these measures could only be introduced successfully following consultation with the social partners. The Council have asked the Commission to see if fragmentation of the market which works against innovation can be diminished and to look as well at measures for improving the flow of information.</P>
    <P>We discussed the Council mandate of 30 May last to the Commission on the restructuring of the Community Budget. This, of course, assumes particular significance now that budgetary expenditure is reaching the limit which can be financed under the 1 per cent vat and other own resources arrangements.  It is our view that in an enterprise the size of the Community, there can be no such <Col N="663" /> thing as immobility and that if the Community does not develop, it will regress.</P>
    <P>We attach particular emphasis also to the fact that any attempt to alter the basic principles of the CAP would run counter to the mandate and create the unacceptable situation for some member states which it terms ruled out.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Community approach should not be restricted by any arbitrary limit on resources.  Rather should we increase and make more effective convergence instruments such as the regional and social funds.</P>
    <P>On Community institutional matters, the new Commission, the seat of the European Parliament and the Report of the Three Wise Men were discussed. With the exception of one of the German members, the persons who will comprise the new Commission to take office from 6 January next were designated.  The members will be formally appointed in accordance with Treaty provisions later this month.  I was happy to tell the Council that the Minister for Finance, Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, T.D., was the nominee of the Irish Government.  I know that all Deputies will join with me in wishing the Minister well in the challenging tasks which lie ahead of him.</P>

      <P>At this point I should like to take the opportunity, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, to pay tribute to the outgoing Irish member of the Commission, Mr. Richard Burke.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the continuing violation of basic international principles and the growing threats to peace in a number of parts of the world, political co-operation matters figured largely in our discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We viewed developments in Poland <Col N="664" /> with very serious disquiet.  Our agreed position on this has, understandably, received the greatest media attention.  In essence, we have appealed to all participating states to the Helsinki Final Act to abide by the principles of that Act, in their relations with Poland and the Polish people.  Otherwise there will be very grave consequences for international relations in Europe and in the world.  This entails respecting the right of the Polish people to develop freely their own political system and without any interference from outside.  In keeping with these commitments and with our concern for the Polish people we indicated our willingness to respond favourably, as resources allow, to the requests from the Polish authorities for economic assistance including food.</P>
    <P>On the Middle East, we reviewed developments in the situation since the now historic Venice Declaration which we made in June last.  We noted the success of Mr. Gaston Thorn's mission which confirmed the basic soundness of the principles set out in the Venice Declaration. We, therefore, asked Foreign Ministers to develop further these principles: parallel to this examination the Dutch presidency will carry out new contacts.</P>
    <P>On East-West relations, we underlined the importance we attach to the Madrid Conference on Security and Co-operation and insisted that compliance by all concerned with the principles of the Helsinki Final Act was the basis of this process and a condition for its continuation.</P>
    <P>Once again, we launched an appeal that the integrity of the frontiers of Lebanon and the security of her people be fully respected and again expressed our wish that UNIFIL should be allowed fulfil the mandate given it by the UN Security Council.  As regards the Syrian-Jordanian situation, we called on both governments to settle their differences by peaceful means including, if necessary, assistance from the UN.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by expressing our condolences with the people of Italy on the appalling tragedy that struck them and to express the hope that in addition to the aid which the Community <Col N="665" /> is giving to Italy and to which the Taoiseach referred, we ourselves would also be able to contribute generously from the resources at our disposal.  The Minister a short time ago mentioned that the disaster relief fund has been replenished by additions under Supplementary Estimates and I hope that as a result of that we can give some assistance and some small indication of our concern for the tragedy that struck that country.</P>
      <P>Coming to the communique and the section dealing with the economic and social situation, it is difficult to see in this section anything other than the same meaningless verbiage that has been incorporated in all such communiques for years past, when we were in Government and since the present Government have been in office.  It contains the usual platitudes concerning the effect of oil price increases, the need for vigilance and attention to future prospects, concern about the rapid increase in unemployment, the need for reduction in rates of inflation and so on and the need for combined efforts of governments with the collaboration of employer and labour organisations.  All these feature in all these communiques and they are so many words that add up to nothing in terms of concrete action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had intended mentioning one other matter as another example of platitudes, that is a reference in the communique to various &ldquo;Community instruments must continue to serve first and foremost policies aimed at reducing structural unemployment and at improving infrastructure and the economic situation of the less favoured rural regions&rdquo; because anything in a communique which talks about things continuing to happen does not contribute anything new, but I was really taken aback to discover that the Taoiseach claims great credit for this and says he succeeded in having recorded in the Presidency Conclusions that Community instruments must be primarily directed at improving infrastructure and the economic situation in these regions.  That is not what the communique said.  It said &ldquo;must continue to serve first and foremost policies aimed at&rdquo; achieving these <Col N="666" /> things.  So, there is nothing new here at all, it is one more platitude and the Taoiseach's contribution to the platitudes was not perhaps made as clear by him in his speech as it might have been.  There is nothing new here; it is only a continuation of existing policies.</P>
    <P>This is all desperately thin and disappointing. It is clear that the Taoiseach's efforts which we support and applaud to get the heads of governments to concentrate on the overwhelmingly important problem of the Community's economy and unemployment have essentially failed.  It is obvious that major member governments will not face this issue, believing they can get away with it in their own conscience and are not greatly bothered about economies such as ours. I believe that the interests of truth and the interests of progress in the Community would be better served if, when they returned from meetings of this kind Prime Ministers said bluntly that in areas of this sort there has been a failure to achieve anything, rather than try to cover up that failure.  I understand the temptation&mdash;I am not suggesting that we, in Government, managed to avoid succumbing to it.  All Prime Ministers coming back from European Council meetings naturally tend to try to avoid saying too bluntly that they have not achieved very much.  It would be better if we were more plain speaking about this and that might lead to more progress in future.  I know the Taoiseach did his best because of the importance of the meeting to this country.  I am making no criticism whatsoever of him but I do not think he should be covering up the failure of other people to respond to those efforts.</P>
    <P>One matter arises which is of considerable importance, the mandate given to the Commission.  I hoped the Taoiseach would have told us something of the Irish input to this, as to how he sees further development of Community policy and what prospects there are for any further development in Community policies within the 1 per cent limit that remains. Is there any prospect for anything other than contraction of and perhaps undermining of Community policy so long as this remains?  I would like to ask the <Col N="667" /> Minister a specific question but this form of debate does not allow him to answer it, so it is a rhetorical question and I shall put it in that form.  Did the Minister raise the question of the 1 per cent limit?  It is interesting to read in his speech the following two phrases:</P>
    <P>It is our view that in an enterprise the size of the Community, there can be no such thing as immobility and that if the Community does not develop, it will regress.</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>We believe that the Community approach should not be restricted by any arbitrary limit on resources. </P>
    <P>We are all aware the Taoiseach believes this.  It would be useful for the House to know whether he said this at the meeting. The very fact that he confined himself to a restatement of his own beliefs and made no reference in his speech to having raised the matter would suggest he did not raise the question of this limit.  It is a pity if he did not do so because time is running very short and the more plain speaking there is on this point, the better. I asked, on a previous occasion, whether we had sought any allies on this matter. I got an evasive reply but I note from what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said today that since then &mdash; I am glad if my pressing of the matter had anything to do with it &mdash; he has had contact with his Danish colleague and proposes contact with his Dutch colleague, so some effort is now being made, very belatedly, to seek allies on this crucial issue.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this to which I have to come back again.  The Taoiseach will recall we made pre-conditions for the successful conclusion of the Greek negotiations about decision making in the Community and also at the outset about additional resources being provided to cover the needs of new members joining the Community.  Having dropped one pre-condition, what does the Taoiseach propose the Government should do with regard to ensuring the implementation of our first pre-condition, that Community resources be increased <i>pro rata</i> with the needs arising from enlargement in relation <Col N="668" /> to the proposed admission of Spain and Portugal and given the 1 per cent limit?  Is it not the case, factually and arithmetically, that these two countries will be beneficiaries from Community membership because of the nature of their net economies, and that the scale of the Spanish economy is such that the amounts involved, by any calculations, will be very large and that even if we were not now iminently facing the problem of the 1 per cent limit, the addition of these countries would completely undermine the present financial circumstances of the Community?</P>
    <P>Given that we had the assurance in July 1976 that the resources of the Community will be enlarged <i>pro rata</i> with the need arising from the extension of its membership, the logical consequence of that must be the increase of 1 per cent limit.  Why has it not been pursued?  I suppose the excuse could be made that at the point when Greek membership became an issue finally to be settled, we had not reached the 1 per cent limit but we were near enough to it for the matter to be raised at that point.  We are certainly now at the stage where, before Spanish and Portuguese membership becomes an issue, we will have reached the 1 per cent limit.  At that point we had in writing, as a result of the negotiations in 1976, a commitment that Community resources would be increased <i>pro rata</i> with the needs of new members.  Given that commitment of 1976, our position has to be that there can be no enlargement until the 1 per cent limit is raised unless we are going to give away everything we won in 1976.  While I would not be too surprised if the Minister for Foreign Affairs did that, I hope the Taoiseach would not.  I am thinking back to fish when I say that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should make the fullest use of that guarantee written in, in July 1976, to the Greek negotiation as a basis for argument in relation to the 1 per cent. There is no way in which, given the needs as net beneficiaries of Spain and Portugal, they can become members without pushing us past the 1 per cent limit and, therefore, as I foresaw when I put down that requirement and got agreement to <Col N="669" /> it, we have in our hands a powerful negotiating weapon which cannot be denied. There is no logical answer that any state can make to this.  Once they agreed to that in 1976, and you could make the case for letting Greece in without raising the 1 per cent limit, there is no way in which you can make a case for any other country without raising the 1 per cent limit.  That provides the Taoiseach with a very powerful argument and he will need powerful arguments to deal with this whole issue. As other member countries are as concerned as we are that Spain and Portugal should join we have something here that should be used not just for our benefit or selfishly, but also for the benefit of new members.  If this matter is not settled they too will suffer, because the benefits they will get from EEC membership will be correspondingly reduced, quite apart from the fact that the common agricultural policy would be undermined completely at that point and be an additional demand on Community resources.</P>
    <P>I note the Taoiseach dismissed in a single line the whole page of the communique dealing with the Three Wise Men.  He was a wise man to do so.  It is the most unconsciously funny document which has come from any European Council since they started in November 1974 arising from the meeting in Paris.  It tells us this report is a rich source of ideas and suggestions and that these ideas and suggestions are so plentiful that the European Council's deliberations and the specific conclusions to which they give rise for the time being do not entirely cover all the suggestions in the form of the Three Wise Men, nor do they exhaust the matter.  It says that independent of any decisions which may be taken in the near future the report is and will continue to be a fertile seed bed of ideas and suggestions on which the institutions of the member states may draw for their deliberations.  Whoever wrote that either had his tongue in his cheek or he must be a very dull man.  The latter is possible.  I can see why the Taoiseach dismissed it in one line.</P>
    <P>The excuse that it is such a wonderful report and so full of ideas and suggestions <Col N="670" /> that the European Council cannot possibly cope with them all &mdash; without any commitment they will ever cope with them at all or ever refer to it again &mdash; is a typical evasion by that body of an issue it does not want to tackle.  It would be better if the Taoiseach were more blunt about matters of this kind and when things are shelved with this kind of verbiage he should say so to this house, he went on to refer to the appointment of the new Commissioner, the Minister for Finance.  I would like to offer our congratulations to the Minister on his appointment and assure him of our support in that capacity when he has been appointed.  We will give him our co-operation and, in due course, we will be seeking his co-operation whether in Opposition or in Government, and I am sure we will get it.  I am sure he will contribute to the work of the Commission constructively and in the tradition established by his two predecessors.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his courteous references to Commissioner Burke whose efforts in a number of different and disparate areas have been extremely productive, much more so than anybody foresaw at the time of his appointment.  It was thought that the complexity of the issues and the number of questions he was given to handle might make it difficult for him to achieve very much, but he has achieved a lot and from our point of view and that of Northern Ireland he has achieved a considerable amount.  I congratulate him on his handling of the matter of aid to Northern Ireland and aid for cross-Border projects. This has helped to unite all parties in Northern Ireland against the neglect of the British Government and its attempts to divert some of the funds.  The skilful way in which this was handled by Commissioner Burke achieved one of those rare moments of unity between the different parties in Northern Ireland.  It particularly helped to ensure greater British attention to the economic needs of Northern Ireland.  I am asking the present Minister for Finance, when he takes over, to show the same concern for Community help to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> On the Middle East, my understanding is that the visit by the Belgian President of the Council and future President of the Commission, Gaston Thorn, will be followed up by a visit or visits by the Netherlands Foreign Minister to the Middle East.  It is important to use the present vacuum period to ease out possible elements of a solution in the Middle East and to clear the way for a new initiative. It is a vacuum period because of the change of Government in the US.  It will certainly be next spring before we have a clear-cut US policy on the Middle East. The electoral position in Israel means that there cannot be any political move by Israel until an election takes place.  It is not due until next autumn, but perhaps it will take place in May or June.  In the Arab camp the divisions arising in large part from the Iraqi-Iranian war make it difficult for their side to pursue a clear-cut policy.</P>
    <P>A time when all three parties are all inhibited from making any positive moves is the time when something needs to be done to keep the peace and to get some forward movement going, and the Community's involvement at this stage is primary.  I hope the Community will either do or avoid three things.  First, in their approach to the problem I hope the Community will avoid getting caught on the Camp David hook.  The Camp David issue should be fudged because strict adherence to the Camp David formula could block progress towards the gestation of a solution, but the ditching of it could weaken Egypt, the phrase used to me by one of the Labour Party leaders in Israel, when I was there at the end of September and early October, &ldquo;opening a new window in Camp David&rdquo; indicates the kind of flexible approach the Community should adopt in this matter.</P>
    <P>I think the Community are right to explore the parameter of a solution on such issues as withdrawal from the occupied territories, the issue of self-determination, of security, which is vital for Israel but is important also for the Arab countries who have suffered conflicts in the past 30 years, and the difficult issue <Col N="672" /> of Old Jerusalem.  They are issues in which all of us of all religions have an interest.  The work of the Community of ten will be co-operation in looking into the areas and in preparing possible alternative solutions to these problems.  It will be an important contributory factor in regard to an ultimate solution.  It will ensure that when the different parties are ready to get down to negotiations some of the preliminary grounds will have been covered in a constructive way.</P>
    <P>A third thing the Community can do, apart from avoiding the Camp David hook and looking at the possible shape of the solution, is to explore various negotiating formulae, ways of getting over the obstacles posed by Israeli objections to negotiating with the PLO, which are very widely held and which I found to be universal in Israel with one single exception, the Minister for the Interior who has publicly expressed to me and people with me his willingness to negotiate with the PLO if they change their charter and if terrorism ceases to be a factor in their approach.  Apart from that single politician, that is clearly an obstacle to progress. Various ways of getting around that must be explored and the Community through the mission of the Netherlands Foreign Minister can help to look at these options and prepare the ground for the negotiations that will take place, we hope, when the various political situations have been resolved and when the situation on the Arab side has clarified itself following the termination of hostilities between Iran and Iraq.</P>
    <P>In my visit I was encouraged by the evidence of a clear desire by the people to look towards a solution.  All were trying to see how a solution could be arrived at even though a very wide gap exists between them.  The fact that that will to find a solution is universal, even though the gulf between them is deep, means that the European initiative at present is timely and offers some hope of progress.  I passed over my notes on my trip to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in case anything may emerge from them that would be of some use to him in conjunction with his and the Government's findings and those of other countries. <Col N="673" /> I am glad Europe is playing a useful role in this area.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the Madrid discussions.  I agree with what he said, which effectively means not making the mistake of having another Belgrade where the conference proved disastrous from the Western point of view.  I am glad there is greater firmness on the part of the West on this occasion.</P>
    <P>On Poland the Taoiseach's statement says all that could be said helpfully at present.  We all hope the Polish people, through the channels of communication open to them, are aware of the intense concern and sympathy of the peoples of the world in regard to their situation and of the universal hope that they will be left to resolve their internal problems without outside intervention.  However, Community aid to Poland is not very forthcoming. The reference &ldquo;in so far as resources allow&rdquo; in relation to the question of aid is grudging.  The Community should not stint themselves in any way to help the Polish economy during the winter and thus help to head off the unrest that could otherwise arise and provoke a terrible tragedy.  None of us would forgive it if failure on our part to provide that aid contributed to a disaster.  From what I have read of the European Council meeting or from the wording of the communique I do not think there is sufficient determination to give this matter the necessary priority.  Indeed it is not the first time that the Community have been unwilling to take up their responsibility.</P>
    <P>On the Lebanon the communique does not bring things any further.  UNIFIL is still left in an impossible situation.  In spite of all the words that have been spoken, action has not been taken to put this right.  Our soldiers are still at risk and without any kind of political backing from the powers, especially the US, to which they are entitled.  My overriding impression from the meeting &mdash; I suspect it is the Taoiseach's as well &mdash; is that the Community turned away from their own problems, preferring to comment on, without in most cases being able to do much about, the rest of the world.  Except in the case of the mission to the Middle East and the possibility of some aid to <Col N="674" /> Poland, the rest does not add anything or achieve anything, involving words rather than action.</P>
    <P>At the same time, in the internal forum, we have the disturbing situation of the evident determination of some countries to strangle the development of the Community by holding to the 1 per cent VAT limit.  Our role here must be to mobilise support for the expansion of the Community's role, as we did when in office, working with the smaller countries on this issue.  I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs, even if belatedly, has decided to do this, as we did on issues of regional policy and fisheries when we were in power.</P>
    <P>It was, as most of these meetings were, a disappointing one.  I do not think we can fault the Taoiseach for that.  He is only one amongst ten and there are a number of large countries, whose determination to do nothing, so often blocks progress, but he must have been somewhat disappointed by the outcome even if he has felt it more dramatic not to express his disappointment here.  We can only hope that the pressure of events and a more enlightened and long-term sense of self interest than at present prevails in the larger powers, will lead them, and through them the Community as a whole, to play a more constructive role in the future, both in regard to the internal problems of the Community area and in regard to some of the problems in world affairs, where its reluctance to act constructively and on large enough a scale as could yet be the case with regard to aid to Poland, remains a disappointing factor.</P>

      <P>Before formally responding to the Taoiseach's report on the Summit meeting I would like to join with him and the Leader of Fine Gael in expressing the Labour Party's concern and deep sympathy with the people of Italy over the terrible catastrophe of the earthquake. I am glad that the Community responded to a request by the Italian Prime Minister.  I hope that the maximum amount of practical support and help is forthcoming from our Government on behalf of the Irish people.</P>

    <P>I would like to comment on the <Col N="675" /> appointment of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, and to wish him well in his new position as Commissioner representing this country.  I assure him of any help and support in the fulfilment of his duties that the Labour Party, either inside or outside the House, can afford him.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Labour Party, to say that we consider the performance of Commissioner Burke to have been very considerable, when one takes into account the type of portfolio he was given initially and the tremendous use he made of that portfolio in the interests of the people making up the Community.  It is appropriate to say that he filled his position as Commissioner with distinction and certainly with dignity.  His co-operation with all Irish representatives, in Brussels and elsewhere, during his term as Commissioner, is appreciated by all.</P>
    <P>I note in the Taoiseach's report to the House on the Summit meeting that there is no reference whatsoever to the meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, in relation to the H-Block issue.  While I appreciate that it was not part of the formal proceedings of the Summit meeting, in past reports where such meetings took place in the course of a Summit meeting, reference was made by the Taoiseach and on the basis of that reference in his statement, Members on this side of the House had an opportunity to respond.  I would like to ask your guidance if it is appropriate for me at this time to comment on this?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Summit meeting, judging by the agenda, appears to have been a very wide-ranging one and judging by international media coverage the increasing political tension in central Europe was <Col N="677" /> uppermost in the minds of heads of state and government at last week's European Council meeting in Luxembourg.  The increased possibility of direct Soviet intervention in the affairs of Poland was rightly viewed with concern.  The buildup in Soviet military movements on its Polish border in recent days is ominous.</P>
    <P>At the very least, this threatens political stability in that part of the world and at worst, it signifies a further step down the road to a total breakdown in <i>dátente</i> and consequently the possibility of war. Since 1976, we have witnessed increasing political tension between the Eastern and Western power blocs.  Simultaneously, we have witnessed a dangerously rapid build up in nuclear and conventional armaments.  Incredible as it may seem, the growth of the military mentality in international affairs has reached the point where strategists on both sides now speak in terms of a controlled nuclear war.  Against this background the Council was quite correct to warn the Soviet Union of the grave dangers of interference in the affairs of Poland.  We in this House must reiterate that warning.  In doing so, we must join with the Council in urging the Soviet leadership to honour the Helsinki agreement concerning the conduct of international affairs.  In particular, we must reaffirm the view that the Soviet Union has no right to interfere in the process of political development in Poland.</P>
    <P>While the Council was right to devote a considerable proportion of the time available to consideration of this latest threat to world peace, it does not seem to have achieved a great deal during the remainder of its discussions.  Indeed, one of the noticeable features of European Council meetings in recent years has been their failure to come to grips with any of the increasing number of difficulties facing the Community.  The same items are discussed at meeting after meeting, analyses are offered but solutions are rarely, if ever, found.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, so far as the internal affairs of the Community are concerned, there has been a profound loss of will on the part of Europe's political leaders <Col N="678" /> to come to grips with the major economic and social issues which beset the Community.  Indeed it seems that the political vision and determination, which was last evident at the 1972 Paris Summit and which offered hope of a willingness to deal decisively with common issues of concern, has virtually died in the interim period.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was quite correct last week, in highlighting the unemployment crisis in Europe and in urging joint policies to deal with it.  Instead of taking initiatives, instead of taking the hard decisions which are so obviously needed, however, the Council referred the matter for further study by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I find that decision incomprehensible. It is not as if the unemployment crisis in Europe has materialised overnight.  It is not as if enough analysis of the scale of the problem has not been carried out. What was missing, clearly, last week, was the political will to take the decisions which are needed.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Government here will bring pressure to bear in every way possible in the period ahead in an effort to ensure that the Community's institutions respond to the crisis of unemployment in the member states.  If, in the end, the Community has nothing to say about seven-and-a-half million unemployed then it will have failed to respond to its greatest single internal problem and it will be seen to have failed by the electorate.</P>
    <P>I note, too, that no progress appears to have been made in relation to Community budgetary problems.  That these are complex is beyond doubt, but the fact remains that the continuing failure of successive Councils to reach agreement on the future financing of Community policies is jeopardising progress.</P>
    <P>This country has correctly welcomed the prospect of the accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain.  We did so on political grounds to support the fragile democracies in each of these countries.  When we in the Labour Party welcomed their proposed accession in principle, however, we made the point strongly that new financial arrangements would be <Col N="679" /> required to offset the effects of their entry on underdeveloped regions such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>Greece will join the Community in January but the necessary new financial arrangements have not yet materialised. This seems to me to be grossly irresponsible and it pinpoints again the apparent inability of the Community's institutions to respond to major challenges within a reasonable time scale.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises in relation to the common agricultural policy.  Despite the fact that political leaders in each member state are aware that this policy must be modified to take account of realities, there is no sign of progress.  Serious discussion and decision-making is pushed off from one meeting to the next.  In the meantime opposition to the CAP in the present form is growing throughout Europe with the danger that, in the end, the baby will be thrown out with the bathwater unless modifications in policy are made.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I should like to repeat a point I have made before.  It is inevitable that the CAP will be modified sooner or later.  It is unsustainable in the long run in its present form and we all know this, including our farming organisations. There are two courses open to the Government here.  They can either attempt to hold out for no change and thereby lose the potential to influence the course of events or they can decide on what forms of modification are best suited to our interests and seek to influence change in that direction from here on.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend the second course of action and urge it on the Government as being in our best long-term interest.</P>
    <P>Because of your ruling, Sir, it is not possible to discuss other aspects that are within the broad framework of the Summit meeting.  But there is precedent for such discussion.  In the past we have been allowed to comment on bilateral meetings which took place during the course of a summit.  Because of the very wide difference in interpretation regarding yesterday's communique and because of the seriousness and the urgency of the H-Block <Col N="680" /> question, I urge the Taoiseach to make an early report to the House on the meeting.  I suggest that this report be made tomorrow morning, if possible, at the commencement of business.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 2, after &ldquo;activity&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(including the establishment of a national film archive)&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage I agreed, at the specific request of Deputies Quinn, Desmond and O'Toole, to introduce an amendment on Report Stage relating to the possibility of the film board becoming involved in the establishment of a national film archive.  The amendment as drafted is in somewhat similar form to that which was included in the text of the Film Industry Bill, 1970.  As I said on the earlier Stages of this Bill, I recognise that the establishment of a national film archive has merit and is a matter that the board will have to consider.  However, for a number of valid reasons which I do not propose to repeat since they are on the record, I am opposed to the inclusion of a mandatory statutory obligation on the board to set up such an archive.  I am satisfied that the amendment as drafted <Col N="681" /> is such as to put down a marker in the legislation in relation to an archive without placing a specific statutory obligation on the board in this respect.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Deputies will accept this amendment as an indication of my willingness to accommodate the alternative view on this subject as expressed in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Minister has kept his promise to bring in this amendment on this Stage.  While, as the Minister has said, there is no statutory obligation being put on the board to establish a national film archive, I should hope that the members of the board would realise the importance of such a facility in the context of the whole industry and that they would undertake at least to commence the collecting and the safeguarding of material which would ultimately find its way into a fully-fledged archive.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In so far as it considers it appropriate, the Board shall have regard to the need for the expression of national culture through the medium of film-making.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage also a number of Deputies recommended that the Bill should contain some reference to what I might refer to as an Irish dimension. In the course of my Second Stage speech, I indicated that there were certain difficulties in incorporating such a reference and that the original text of the Bill had been drafted deliberately in very broad terms.  I am aware that the pressure to incorporate such an amendment comes mainly from a number of independent Irish film-makers who considered they should have a statutory right to the overwhelming part of the film finance fund. As I have said on innumerable occasions, I recognise that the board and the film finance fund should be used in part to <Col N="682" /> further native film-making talent. Indeed, this is one of the principal reasons I proposed the establishment of an independent film board.  However, one cannot disregard the interests of the National Film Studios and, for that reason, it seems to me it would be inappropriate to impose any statutory obligation on the board to favour any specific group and that it is most appropriate to leave it to the discretion of the board to decide which projects should be supported.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I said I was prepared, if the parliamentary draftsman could come up with the appropriate words, to introduce an amendment on Report Stage containing a non-binding reference to an Irish dimension.  I might add it has been extremely difficult to come up with a suitable amendment.  The difficulty was in relation to the incorporation of the expression &ldquo;film culture&rdquo; as proposed in the amendment of Deputies Quinn and Desmond on Committee Stage.  In the opinion of the draftsman, the expression &ldquo;film culture&rdquo; is a jargon phrase or a colloqialism which could be used in the precise context of a statute. In order to include an appropriate reference to an Irish dimension the draftsman borrowed from the phraseology of section 17 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, where the expression &ldquo;national culture&rdquo; is used.  The parliamentary draftsman is satisfied that the amendment now proposed is a non-binding one which nevertheless gives expression to an Irish dimension.  I have some misgivings about the nature of this amendment and the fact that I am prepared to accommodate as far as possible the views of the Deputies and the independent Irish film-makers indicates I am adopting a reasonable and open-minded approach to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this is a non-binding amendment which expresses an aspiration that the board would have regard to the need for the expression of national culture through the medium of film-making.  At the time the point made by this side of the House was that the absence of any reference to national culture, as now expressed in the <Col N="683" /> amendment, would leave the board in a position where they might feel obliged not to give due regard to this aspect of their activity.  The amendment, albeit a very broad and vague amendment for the reasons mentioned by the Minister, is now there.</P>
      <P>The reasons for suggesting an amendment on these lines was not pressure from private sources engaged in the industry but that it was obvious from experience gained during the years that opportunities were not being given to personnel in the higher ranks of film-making, such as directors, producers and so on, by people who came to this country to make films here.  We know that the training of such people and the experience they gain through involvement in the industry at these levels is of the utmost importance if we are to have a viable film industry.</P>
      <P>That was the reason we requested an amendment on these lines.  I am glad the Minister acceded to the request, albeit in a way which seems his heart is not in it. He gave reasons that were valid at the time, such as constraints due to our membership of EEC, for not being more specific on this matter.  I hope that the board, when selected, will get the message as contained in the amendment now before the House.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) A directive under this section shall not relate to any artistic aspect of a film.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputies Quinn and Desmond put down an amendment to section 31.  I accepted in general the principle involved and I undertook to put down a specific amendment on Report Stage.  The amendment, as drafted, excludes any artistic aspect of a film from ministerial directives under section 31.  I trust the amendment will remove the reservations of the Deputies in relation to the text of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for certain amendments to the Industrial Alcohol Acts, 1938 to 1947 which relate to Ceimicí Teoranta, a State-sponsored company currently engaged in the production of industrial alcohol, potable alcohol and glucose.  The main objects of the Bill are: to provide for an increase in the authorised share capital of Ceimicí Teoranta from £500,000 to £10 million, as a consequence, a similar increase in value of share capital which the Minister for Finance may take up; the guaranteeing by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance of borrowings by the company up to a limit of £10 million; the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the revocation of certain restrictive provisions in the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1934, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was empowered to undertake the manufacture, distillation and sale of industrial alcohol so as to provide an assured outlet for potatoes surplus to market requirements and, at the same time, to provide employment in areas where it was not previously available. Accordingly, five factories were established &mdash; one each at Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; Cooley, County Louth; Corroy, County Mayo; Carndonagh, County Donegal and Labbadish, County Donegal.  This Act was superseded by the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1938, under which Monarchana Alcóil na hÉireann Teoranta was set up to manage the undertaking.  The Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Act, 1947, changed the name of the company to <Col N="685" /> Ceimicí Teoranta and under this latter Act the company was given wider powers for research in relation to the manufacture of substances by chemical process and the manufacture and sale of such substances.</P>
    <P>Although the original objective in setting up the company was to provide an outlet for surplus potatoes, from as early as the 1938-39 season, sufficient quantities of this raw material were not available to keep the five factories going and the company began to use imported sugar cane molasses to supplement the available supply of potatoes.  In the early 1950s in order to rationalise the company's activities and in view of the overcapacity for production for the market then available, the Government decided that starch should be produced from potatoes at Corroy and Labbadish and glucose from the starch, also at Corroy.  The production of industrial alcohol continued at Cardonagh and Cooley.  Production of industrial alcohol continued at Carndonagh and Cooley.  Production of industrial alcohol continued at Carrickmacross until 1954 and these premises were finally disposed of in 1962.  The production of starch from potatoes continued seasonally at Labbadish until 1971, when, owing to a lack of raw materials, this operation ceased.  Ceimicí Teoranta have continued to produce glucose at their Corroy plant, using imported maize starch.  The company diversified into potable alcohol production in 1971-72.</P>
    <P>Ceimicí's operations are currently, therefore, confined to the following areas of activity:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Industrial and potable alcohol production at the Cooley, County Louth and Cardonagh, County Donegal distilleries and</P>
    <P>&mdash;production of glucose at their plant at Corroy, County Mayo. </P>
    <P>Industrial alcohol is sold to the petrol companies who, under the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1938 are obliged to purchase it in quantities stipulated by the company with the consent of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism at a price fixed by the Minister with the <Col N="686" /> concurrence of the Minister for Finance. The price is fixed at a level adequate to give Ceimicí Teoranta a profit on alcohol production.  A small proportion of industrial alcohol is also manufactured for use as a solvent and other related uses.</P>
    <P>Potable alcohol is sold to Irish companies which require neutral spirit for the production of vodka, gin, white rum and certain liqueurs.</P>
    <P>Liquid glucose is sold to producers of confectionery, chocolate, jams and so on, and Ceimicí Teoranta are the only native supplier of glucose to this industry which employs in excess of 15,000 people.</P>
    <P>Employment by Ceimicí Teoranta itself is of the order of 150 persons and in addition imports of maize starch through Ballina harbour provide part-time employment for 33 men.</P>
    <P>The company's activities were reviewed by the IDA in 1973 at the request of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and following this review, the Government in May 1976 decided that the board of Ceimicí should be reconstituted and that the new board would be instructed, <i>inter alia</i> to phase out those activities found to be non-viable. They would also be instructed:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to consider the possibility of association with another Irish firm in the field of potable alcohol,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to study urgently the establishment of an integrated maize/glucose plant, perhaps in association with a major foreign producer and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to examine the prospects for producing fine chemicals. </P>
    <P>It was noted at that time that it could be necessary for the Government to give capital backing for any sound projects which might evolve and this would involve amending legislation to increase the share capital of the company.</P>
    <P>The board was reconstituted with the appointment of three new members in 1977 and 1978 and a new chairman was appointed in 1977.  Two new general managers were also appointed who are specialists in their own fields.  For various reasons, and despite the best efforts of the company, it was not possible for Ceimicí to secure the interest of a joint venture partner in either the potable <Col N="687" /> alcohol or glucose fields.</P>
    <P>As the company were unsuccessful in their efforts to secure a joint venture in glucose, the board decided that the only realistic option was to refurbish their existing glucose factory at Corroy in order to maintain the company's position as prime supplier of glucose to the Irish market and to achieve viability in this product, while providing time for a new project to develop.  The cost of the refurbishing &mdash; now £1.6 million &mdash; was approved in April 1979, to be financed by means of an IDA grant of £445,000 and temporary borrowings by the company of the balance of the finance required, pending the enactment of amending legislation which would permit an increase in the company's equity base.  This is necessary because, of the company's existing authorised share capital of £500,000, £495,755 is paid up and held by the Minister for Finance.  This equity participation is the only Government investment in the company.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the company expended £150,000 on the Corroy project, all of which was borrowed, and, in order that the refurbishing of the Corroy plant can proceed with the utmost speed, the company have had to resort to further borrowings in 1980 to finance the project, which is expected to be completed at the end of this year.  A provision of £585,000 from Exchequer sources had been included in the Public Capital Programme for 1980 but this capital cannot be provided to Ceimicí without amending legislation.  Meanwhile, with the present high level of interest rates, the company are finding these borrowings an unbearable burden which can only be relieved by an immediate injection of equity.</P>
    <P>In 1980 two major developments have occurred in relation to the future activities of the company.  One of these has been the consideration by the company of proposals to refurbish and modernise their two distilleries at Carndonagh and Cooley.  In considering the proposals account will be taken of the use of industrial alcohol in the context of gasohol production, which is a blend of petrol and alcohol.  Studies into the use of gasohol <Col N="688" /> have been undertaken in several overseas countries and in some countries &mdash; Brazil and the United States, for example &mdash; programmes involving the use of gasohol as a transportation fuel are already under way.  Information available to me at present would seem to indicate that such a programme would not be a viable proposition in an Irish context due to the large difference in price between alcohol and petrol, alcohol being considerably more expensive.  However, in the long term, with the ever-increasing cost of petrol and technological improvements, this situation may change.  For this reason, further study of these possibilities appears to be warranted.</P>
    <P>The second development in the company during 1980 has been the commencement of negotiations with an overseas company with a view to a joint venture in a milling/glucose/dextrose operation based on wheat.</P>
    <P>The proposed new venture would be the largest of its kind in Europe producing starch and gluten for the home market and starch, gluten and animal feed for EEC and world markets and would provide a valuable spin-off benefit to the Irish farming Community.</P>
    <P>Employment would be created for about 120 persons and the proposed new enterprise will be the first major manufacturer of gluten on the Irish market. The project will be of strategic importance in the development of the food industry, providing inputs for the flour and sugar confectionary industries, with the prospect of further downstream employment in these industries.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on this project are now at an advanced stage and, while the details of equity provision and borrowings cannot as yet be finalised, Ceimicí estimate the main equity requirements at £4 million, £2 million for each partner.  Ceimicí have also indicated that there may be several further stages of development in the project involving a doubling of investment and employment.</P>
    <P>The company have also been actively investigating possible opportunities for the manufacture of fine chemicals, particularly in terms of a joint venture with an overseas company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> An increase in the authorised share capital to £10 million and provision for guarantee by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism of borrowings in a similar amount would allow for the financing of the Corroy glucose project and also provide the necessary financial backing for further projects which may be approved.  The company have found in their negotiations on joint ventures that the fact that their authorised share capital is only £½ million is a minus factor. Although this level may have been adequate in 1938, it could hardly be considered realistic in 1980.  In the circumnstances it is clear that a more realistic share capital base for the company is now necessary.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity in this Bill to seek the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism. These functions are mainly of an administrative nature and are being transferred on the recommendation of the Public Services Organisation Review Group.</P>
    <P>Finally, this Bill provides for the repealing of sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Act, 1947.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Act prohibit the manufacture by Ceimicí Teoranta of certain chemical products except under licence from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  This provision was originally intended to prevent Ceimicí Teoranta cutting across any chemical manufacturing operations being carried out in this country by private enterprise, but this position can be achieved without these legislative provisions, which have been found to have an inhibiting effect on possible joint ventures by the company with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Act, 1947, which provides that the Government may prohibit the importation of any specified chemical product, is contrary to our EEC commitments and it is accordingly necessary to repeal it.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Bill, 1980, will commend <Col N="690" /> itself to the Dáil and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to introduce this Bill, with its provisions for the broadening of the equity share base of Ceimicí Teoranta. In his statement he has gone through the history of this State-sponsored body since 1934, since its establishment under the Industrial Alcohol Act. I have a special interest in this as one of the plants' locations mentioned is in my constituency.  I have watched its progress down through the years.  The Minister is right in saying that the production of industrial alcohol from potatoes had to be terminated because of the lack of this raw material.</P>
      <P>The most welcome aspect of the current development in Ceimicí Teoranta is the work being carried on by the new board in the imaginative programmes they are initiating on their own in conjunction with other private bodies from abroad.  From what I know of the plants operated by Ceimicí Teoranta, a debt of gratitude is owed to the staffs of these plants who in many cases worked with obsolete plant and equipment and kept the show on the road down through the years.  As the Minister said, one of the inhibiting factors against any substantial progress was the fact that the company's authorised share capital was limited to £500,000.  In the present day context this must be seen as a not too serious approach to business.  This Bill provides for a major increase in share capital to £10 million and one cannot but express the wish that this will have a variable effect on the efforts of Ceimicí Teoranta to engage with outside companies in forming joint ventures for the production of certain chemicals and in doing so they will provide badly-needed employment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the production of gasohol and he is right in saying that in time it may become a feasible product.  If petrol continues to increase in price at its present rate we might find that gasohol would be a cheaper energy agent even though at the moment it does not seem as competitive as the traditional <Col N="691" /> types of energy.  The second development during 1980 which the Minister mentioned was the negotiations with an overseas company with a view to establishing a joint venture on the glucose/dextrose operation.  That would be a boost to the agricultural sector.  Anything that can provide extra employment, and in so doing can provide an outlet for agricultural produce, is very well worthwhile.  I hope this venture will meet with success and I am sure that hope is shared by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is a welcome measure in this Bill.  A problem which comes to light now and again in times of strain on the economy is a general dissipation of effort because of the splitting of responsibility for different functions that exist in the promotion of economic development.  The tie-up of functions under the one umbrella is a worthwhile and sensible approach to this problem.  In this context, seeing that the Minister has seen this as a sensible and feasible approach, will he throw his net wider and apply the same principle in other spheres where other Departments have responsibilities in conjunction with his Department?  There is no reason why this type of tidying up operation should not occur throughout the Departments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because of the provision increasing the share capital from £500,000 to £10 million.  This relieves Ceimicí Teoranta of having to borrow money at exorbitant interest rates which militates against their viability in the long run.  That is the main provision in the Bill and it will give them some breathing space.  With new ventures in mind and the new joint ventures for the production of gluten, that breathing space could be badly needed in the present economic climate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill. There are very exciting possibilities in this area, expecially in relation to gasohol, which should be developed.  I can accept the Minister's statement that gasohol might be uneconomical but there has been a lot of development in relation to <Col N="692" /> making low grade fuels with gasohol and we should keep an eye on that aspect.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase in the share capital to £10 million for the purposes of investigating areas where jobs may be created.  A joint venture with an overseas company seems to be worthwhile and I hope this joint venture in glucose and dextrose will go ahead.  We would have starch and gluten for the home market and starch, gluten and animal feed for export.  The potential is very great there. In this area we can compete with anybody in the world.  Some of our winter varieties of wheat are very high yielding.  They may not be of the greatest quality for milling but they are excellent for these purposes.  This is something that the continentals have not done much about, and perhaps we can get in first and capture a valuable market.</P>
      <P>Not only would there be a substantial quantity of wheat involved but there is also the question of creating employment. The Minister was modest when he spoke of 120 people likely to be employed because in my view it could be a substantial industry if it takes off.  If we plunge on this we will be well ahead of the UK and our European partners. French wheat is suitable for milling and is quite expensive but it is not suitable for a project such as this.  We have a winter type wheat which is suitable and any extra sugar that might be available can also be used.  I should like to encourage the Minister to delve into this area and ensure that the amalgamation takes place.  There is nothing mysterious about it; it is straightforward.  The market is there for it and we have the raw material in abundance.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the two Deputies who spoke for their contribution in support of the Bill and their encouragement for the efforts being made in connection with this company's operations and proposed operations. Deputy Hegarty was right to lay emphasis on the starch side of its operations. There is great potential there.  Surprisingly, European industry generally <Col N="693" /> has not developed that side of things at all as much as the Australians have.  I was glad when in Australia recently to be able to further in a significant way the joint venture proposals between this company and a leading Australian company in that field, Fielder-Gillespie.  I referred to that in a statement I made when I returned from Australia.</P>
      <P>The investment that is likely in the first stage of that proposed plan, which it is thought at this stage will be located at Ringaskiddy, County Cork, will be in the region of £10 million or £11 million.  It is not a tremendously labour intensive industry but it is an important one because of the considerable amount of imports it will save and because of the utilisation of native wheat rather than the importation of starch.  It was not until I became involved in the more detailed discussions with a company in Australia that I began to realise how little wheat we produce.  This plant alone could use almost the entirety of the Irish wheat output each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The millability in flour terms of the wheat is of less significance in the manufacture of starch.  It may be necessary to adapt some of the strains of wheat but those who are expert in the matter do not foresee any difficulty in the growing of those different strains here. One would hope that the farming community would respond to the market which will be there for the production of increased quantities of suitable wheat for this project.  The other field in which I see a future for this company if it can so arrange its affairs is in the whole field of fine chemicals.  We have not had any State involvement in that field up to now. As a matter of fact we have only had limited Irish owned involvement in the field although we have quite a thriving fine chemical industry here.  By and large it is a profitable industry and I see no <Col N="694" /> reason why this company should not seek to get involved in it.  I see no reason why the company should not make some money from it, avoid imports and create employment.  We have people who are skilled in many aspects of the industry.</P>
      <P>I do not believe any problems were raised in the course of the debate that I need reply to.  I confined myself to speaking in a general way of the prospects I foresee for the company.  It is important that I should avail of the opportunity to repeat that the company will have to become and remain profitable.  In fairness, it has been profitable in the most years.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a permanent formula for determining the constituency for which the outgoing Ceann Comhairle may be deemed to be re-elected as a member of the Dáil at a general election.  Article 16.6 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law for such re-election and the statutory <Col N="695" /> provision to give effect to this requirement is contained in section 14 of the Electoral Act, 1963.  Under the terms of this section as it stands at present the Chairman is deemed to be re-elected for the constituency for which he was a member before the dissolution or, if a revision of constituencies takes effect on the dissolution, for the constituency declared on the revision to correspond to that constituency.</P>
    <P>For this purpose it has been the practice at each revision of constituencies since 1963, to include in the relevant Bill a statement indicating which of the new constituencies corresponded to the constituency represented by the Deputy who was Chairman of the Dáil at the time of the revision.  Earlier this year the Oireachtas passed a constituency revision Bill, entitled the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1980, and this measure identified the new constituency of Donegal South-West as the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle could be deemed to be elected without a contest.  The death of the former Ceann Comhairle, our esteemed colleague, the late Deputy Joseph Brennan, has meant that this provision has become ineffective.</P>
    <P>It would be possible to resolve the immediate difficulty by way of a short Bill simply naming the constituency for which our new Ceann Comhairle may be deemed to be re-elected.  However, I think the House will agree that it is preferable to deal with the matter in general terms and this Bill makes a permanent provision under which it will be possible to identify the appropriate constituency in relation to any Deputy who may be elected to the office of Ceann Comhairle, without the necessity for further legislation. The Bill amends section 14 of the Electoral Act, 1963, so as to provide that where a revision of constituencies takes effect on the dissolution of the Dáil, the Chairman shall be deemed to be re-elected for the constituency which is identical with or contains all the constituency for which he was a member immediately before the dissolution.  If, however, his present constituency is divided between two or more new constituencies, he <Col N="696" /> would be deemed to be re-elected for a revised constituency selected by him which contains part of the constituency for which he is at present a member.  The Bill provides that the selection of a constituency by the Chairman shall be made by means of a declaration in writing addressed to the Clerk of the Dáil.  The Chairman will be required to notify the members of the Dáil of the declaration. The precise manner of notification will be such as the Chairman considers appropriate in the particular circumstances, but it may be expected that in the normal course he would make an appropriate announcement to the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that any such declaration shall cease to have effect in the event of the person who made it having ceased to be Chairman of the Dáil.  This ensures that there can be only one such declaration in force at any time.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in the Bill constitute a small but worthwhile improvement in the electoral law and will remove the necessity for fresh legislation whenever a change takes place in the office of Ceann Comhairle after a revision of constituencies.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister of State has said this Bill is necessary because of the lamented death of the former Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Joe Brennan, and the appointment of his successor, Deputy Padraig Faulkner.  Section 14 of the Electoral Act of 1963 provided that if a Ceann Comhairle did not notify the Dáil before its dissolution that he did not intend to stand again he was deemed to be automatically elected for the constituency which he represented at the time of the dissolution, or if there was a revision of constituencies he would be deemed to be elected automatically to the constituency which was declared, in the Bill giving rise to the revision, as the constituency which corresponded to the constituency for which he had been last elected and that was the provision made in the Electoral Act of 1963.  When the Electoral (Amendment) Act of 1980 was going through the Dáil it was provided in section 5 that for the purposes of section 14 <Col N="697" /> (1) (b) of the Electoral Act of 1963 the constituency of Donegal South-West, specified in the Schedule to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill of 1980, was declared to correspond to the constituency of Donegal specified in the Schedule of the Electoral (Amendment) Act of 1974 and if the late Ceann Comhairle had been spared until the next general election he would have been deemed to be re-elected to the constituency of Donegal South-West. But regrettably he was not.  It is in those circumstances that this Amendment Bill is necessary.</P>
      <P>But, strange as it may appear, when the Amendment Bill of 1980 was going through the House and when it was being discussed, a number of Deputies asked on Committee Stage what would happen if Deputy Brennan resigned before the next general election and Deputy Barrett, the Minister dealing with the Bill at the time, stated that it would have to be dealt with by a short amending Bill.  It was pointed out that this seemed a clumsy way of doing things and that, in the words of Deputy Tully, there must be a better way than that.  But the easy way was tabling and the amendment Bill of 1980 followed section 14 of the Act of 1963 and declared Donegal South-West as the constituency corresponding with the former constituency of Donegal.  As events turned out it was regrettable that the advice given from this side of the house was not taken on that occasion and that the procedure now being adopted was not adopted then.  At any rate it does show that Committee Stage debate is good and that it alerts Ministers and Departments to the desirability for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill, without the Act of 1963, would not make sense at all.  But at any rate what is being proposed to be done now is to delete subsection (1) (b) of the 1963 Act and substitute another paragraph (b), and I will have something to say about that on Committee Stage.  In certain circumstances the Ceann Comhairle is returned for the constituency which he represented if it is identical, and if there is a change in certain other circumstances he is returned automatically for the constituency which is substantially <Col N="698" /> the same as the one he represented.  If neither of these eventualities is appropriate he must make a declaration declaring what constituency he wants to be elected for and the only condition is that part of the old constituency must be in the constituency for which he declares.  It is provided also that he shall make this declaration as soon as may be after the Act is passed if he is Ceann Comhairle when the Act is passed and, if he is not, that he will make it as soon as may be after he is appointed Ceann Comhairle.  I do not see anything wrong here.  I think that this is an improvement on the 1963 Act and it will avoid the necessity for amending Bills like this in the future.  To that extent it is an improvement on the 1963 Act which did not foresee the human happenings and the eventualities we are dealing with now.</P>
    <P>I accept the Bill.  One thing that strikes me that I would like to raise on Committee is in connection with the new section 1 (b).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what I wanted to say about this Bill has been said already by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  One of the most telling points he made is the merit of the Committee Stage debate, which, unfortunately, is very seldom listened to by the people at whom it is directed.  The earlier Committee Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, in regard to which the Minister seeks to mend his hand, was debated on 19 June 1980.  On section 5 of that Bill the point was raised by Deputies Fitzpatrick, White, Tully and myself that the provision naming the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil would be returned was not a very enlightening section and that a far better way of dealing with the matter would have been to instal a section saying that the Ceann Comhairle shall be elected for whatever constituency he happened to represent when the general election might come about.  Nonetheless at that time the Minister of the day was adamant that he was obliged to introduce the provision naming the constituency of Donegal South-West as being the constituency that this is applied to.  At that time I asked what the situation would be if the Ceann <Col N="699" /> Comhairle at the time represented the constituency of Dublin-Finglas who then could find himself faced with the option of standing in any of the new constituencies of Dublin North-Central, Dublin North-West or Dublin Central.  I said that I understood there were Deputies in the existing Dublin-Finglas area who at the moment were in a quandary to know which of these Dublin constituencies they might represent now.  I am still not satisfied that this Bill mends the hand of the Minister entirely in this regard.  This seems to be going from one extreme to another.  In the earlier extreme, which unfortunately proved to be unworkable, the Minister insisted on naming the constituency of Donegal South-West as being the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle of this Dáil was to be returned.  As we all know, the tragic death of the Ceann Comhairle at the time means that that provision cannot apply now.  I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who asked what might happen if the Ceann Comhairle were to resign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The scenario that he spelled out did not come to pass but he suggested that that might mean that Deputy Browne from Wexford would end up being returned as one of the Deputies for Donegal South-West.</P>

When Deputy Tully asked what might be the position if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle were left representing Donegal, you said:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>None of that came to pass. Now we have a Bill providing that the Ceann Comhairle, whoever he might be, is to be returned by the constituency that he happens to represent at that time, assuming that there is no revision.  If there is a revision he is to opt for either the constituency that represents a majority of his initial constituency or for a new constituency which contains a minority share, section or division of his existing constituency.  On the face of it that may appear fair enough, but that could still leave us having the result of the election pre-determined to some extent.  Suppose the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle is one of the Deputies happens to have a minute section, say one parish, taken out of it and put into another constituency for the purpose of the revision.  I will take the example of the present Ceann Comhairle.  If one parish in, say, south-west Louth was removed and put into Meath, the Ceann Comhairle who represented the constituency of Louth would then discover that one parish had been added into the new constituency of Meath and could opt to declare that he was to be the Ceann Comhairle elected for the constituency of Meath and absorb like a sponge, remove from the electoral processes one of the three seats from Meath.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the existing Ceann Comhairle would do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the example that I have given of Louth the same could apply to the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  If one parish or even one townland of County Louth were to be added to the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan the Ceann <Col N="701" /> Comhairle could announce that he wished to be returned as a Deputy representing not Louth but Cavan-Monaghan. If it were not for the narrow neck of County Meath that Deputy Tully represents he could announce that he wanted to be returned representing my own constituency of North County Dublin because he is no more than four or five miles away from the borders of my constituency as it stands.  Therefore, I am not sure that the new section 1 (b) by which section 14 of the former Act is to be amended is a provision with which I would agree lightly.  It is not inconceivable that a constituency can split into four or five different parts.</P>
    <P>Under the present revision my constituency has been divided into four different parts.  The majority part still remains the constituency of North County Dublin but three other sections along its southern boundary, each of sizeable proportions, are being added to three of what are basically the Dublin City North constituencies. A Ceann Comhairle in North County Dublin would have the option of announcing that he would represent any one of four different constituencies.  He would want to be a man of the highest principle to come off a Government bench or from the Cabinet and not be tempted in the scenario which is envisaged here, where a Ceann Comhairle has to be elected half way, two-thirds of the way or, perhaps as we are now, seven-eights of the way through the life of a Dáil, to say, looking at four different constituencies, that he will represent a constituency which would do most harm to the Opposition and put his own party in the most beneficial position.</P>
    <P>There should have been some safeguard contained in the Bill that a Ceann Comhairle may only opt for whatever happens to be the majority portion of his present constituency or lest that might be unfair to him if the minority section was the area in which he lived himself, the area in which he is domiciled.  That might be a fairer way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy made a very interesting contribution to the debate on 19 June. He said that Donegal South-West, which <Col N="702" /> was to declare and elect three Deputies who would act as political representatives on behalf of that constituency, would be deprived to some extent because the Ceann Comhairle of the day is not entitled to become involved in political activities with his political organisation and must maintain impartiality; he is at one remove from the political mainstream of the constituency.  Deputy Murphy made the point that perhaps the constituency revisions ought to be done on the basis, assuming a 148 seat Dáil, of 147 seats being allocated to constituencies and that a seat without constituency should be allocated to the Ceann Comhairle so that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle would know that he was returned elected but not for a specific constituency.  I imagine that would involve constitutional difficulties but if there is ever another attempt to revise the constituencies this is one of the more useful ways to do so rather than the abortive ways of the recent past.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Committee Stage is not acted upon more often because if the Committee Stage on 19 June last had been listened to it would have obviated the necessity for this Bill.  This Bill does not make the situation perfect.  It is placing temptation before a Ceann Comhairle to disrupt the process by choosing a small section of his existing constituency which is being lumped in with an adjoining constituency and thereby upset the balance of power in that constituency and perhaps change the result of the entire election.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to suggest it, but it could be represented as placing temptation before those who are compiling the constituency revision to so divide and fragment a Ceann Comhairle's constituency in their report as to leave the House with little option but to accept the report and leave the Ceann Comhairle with a multitude of options as to which constituency he wants to represent.  For that reason the House should be slow to accept Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can guess the urgency for this Bill.  With a long pile of legislation before the House which was listed earlier in the year and has not yet been produced <Col N="703" /> I was a little surprised at first, and then not so much so, when I heard the Bill was being introduced this evening.  I know every effort will be made to try and get it through as quickly as possible.  Without its being passed a general election cannot be held, unless one intends to appoint somebody in Donegal South-West as Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>Last June I pointed out that it was rather foolish to put in the section as it was.  I asked the question what would happen in the lamentable event &mdash; which subsequently turned out to be true &mdash; of the Ceann Comhairle not being there.  I was told by the then Minister that he would introduce a new Bill, which I thought a waste of time and effort.  It should not have been done.</P>
      <P>I am not happy about the wording of the section.  As Deputy Boland clearly explained, it gives too big an option to a political Ceann Comhairle.  Do not let us cod ourselves about this.  The one argument against Deputy Murphy's reasoned arguments last June was the fact that such a Ceann Comhairle who would be appointed odd man out would have no constituency.  In the event of his not being re-elected &mdash; it has been known for a Ceann Comhairle not to be re-elected when a new Dáil is formed &mdash; it would mean he would have no constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amazing how quickly a Ceann Comhairle who has been in the Chair for a period of years picks up the threads and becomes a politician although during his term as Ceann Comhairle he is not supposed to take part in politics.  The only examples I know of were two Labour men.  Deputy Paddy Hogan and Deputy Seán Treacy, and the latter would not go to his own victory celebration because people would say he was taking part in a political function.  There should be some way to regulate it so that a Ceann Comhairle can be re-elected for the constituency he represents.  To say he can select either the constituency he represents or any portion of it is wrong.  It is far too wide.  They are ex-politicians and become politicians again very quickly.  We should have Committee Stage at a later date on this Bill where we can have the matter <Col N="704" /> properly teased out and submit amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider such an amendment.  I am sure he can see the strength of the argument.  His party will not always be in power, thank God, and this could work to the advantage of his party as well as anyone else's.  In the interest of fair play the wording should be changed to ensure that if a Ceann Comhairle wants to opt for a constituency it should be one or a large portion of one he has represented but not a little corner that would give him the out in the Bill as now proposed.</P>
    <P>A big mistake was made last June.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that another bad mistake does not occur now. I am perhaps more anxious than he is that every opportunity should be given to the Taoiseach to take his trip to the Park when he wants to.  Despite that I am also anxious to see sensible legislation passed through the House.  I was surprised at the wording included the last time and I am surprised at it now.  The parliamentary draftsman and people who decide what way it should be put in know and it would appear to me &mdash; perhaps I am over-suspicious &mdash; that this is a political input which we could very well do without.  It is wrong that it should be worded in this way and, having made a mistake before, let us not make one again and if the Minister is prepared to have it changed on Committee Stage I would be happy with that and we shall see what the outcome will be.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who have spoken in the debate and I am glad that there is general acceptance of the Bill.  As regards points made by Deputy Fitzpatrick about when the Bill was previously before the House and was being dealt with by the Minister for the Environment at that time, I do not accept that any error was made then. I am sure that if I say it was rather difficult at that stage it will be understood because it was then known that the former Ceann Comhairle, the late Deputy Brennan was ill at that time and it was not the time to <Col N="705" /> discuss future changes and the appointment of a successor as Ceann Comhairle. It was felt better to leave things as they were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I take it that the Minister was sincere when he said that a short amending Bill would put the situation in order.  Deputy Boland and Deputy Tully mentioned the choice given to the Ceann Comhairle as regards the selection of a constituency.  No doubt there is merit in their arguments and there would be no great problem about putting in the words &ldquo;but would represent the greater part of the former constituency.&rdquo; I can also see that this would lead to difficulties and it would be very foolish of us to close our eyes to them.  We do not want to make any mistakes or do anything that would tie anybody's hands unduly.  However, it occurred to me that if it were my own constituency, which has been revised many times between Waterford and South Tipperary, and if I happened to be in the position of Ceann Comhairle at that time and say west Waterford on a revision came back into south Tipperary and the Bill were narrowed down to say that I would have to accept and be deemed to be re-elected for what contained the greater portion of my former constituency, that would mean it would be the part of the constituency from Dungarvan down to Waterford city which at that stage might even be taking in a portion of Kilkenny in a revision.  I am being realistic about this.  If one supposes there was that revision and that was the situation I would have to be deemed to be re-elected for a constituency which would not represent the area in which I lived or the area in which I got the great bulk of my support when elected in the previous general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the former Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Brennan, I think the same situation would apply.  His constituency had been revised.  If you took the greater part of his constituency in that case it would mean that he would be deemed elected for a constituency in which he <Col N="706" /> would not be residing and from which the greater part of his support had not come.  I say this only so that Deputies may realise that there is another side to the story and it is a matter that requires much thought.  I do not think the flexibility allowed to a Ceann Comhairle in this Bill is too great.  A Ceann Comhairle should have this flexibility.  I think any Deputy or Ceann Comhairle would object if he were denied the right to be deemed to be elected for the part of the constituency in which he lived and the part from which he got most of his support.</P>
    <P>The same argument could be made when Deputy Tully mentioned Deputy Treacy, a former Ceann Comhairle.  If the part of South Tipperary in which he lived during his term of office had come into County Waterford in a revision I think it would be entirely wrong to say that Deputy Treacy should be deemed to be elected for the remainder of South Tipperary containing Cashel, Fethard and so on and exclude perhaps the town of Clonmel which could happen, on a revision, to come into County Waterford. There is a case for and against a narrowing down of the options open to a Ceann Comhairle and the matter deserves more thought.  I again thank Deputies who participated in the debate.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1980, Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide authority for the Minister for Finance to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Shipping Limited by 10 million additional ordinary shares of £1 each.  In addition the Bill provides for an increase of £10 million in the amount of borrowings by the Company which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and <Col N="707" /> for the guarantee of the Company's borrowings by the Minister for Finance in currencies other than the currency of the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill will raise the ceiling on the Company's total authorised capital to £22 million and will raise the limit on guaranteed borrowing to £15 million.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the present Bill is necessitated by the need to make provision for the capital and borrowing requirements of Irish Shipping Limited in respect of a new bulk carrier and for the financial needs of the Company over the next few years.  This vessel is one of the proposed contracts for Verolme Cork Dockyard which the Government announced on 30 July 1980.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited will place the order for the vessel without delay and it is expected that the vessel will be completed about December 1982.  It is estimated that the final cost of the bulk carrier will be in the region of £25 million.</P>
    <P>The Company has been in a position to fund the acquisition of vessels in the past without recourse to the Exchequer. Indeed 1959 was the last occasion on which the authorised share capital of the Company was increased.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping's principal activity is the operation of deep-sea ships on the international tramp shipping market and this vessel will be used in that trade.  This market has been depressed over a number of years because of an oversupply of tonnage and the reduced demand for it. Indications are that this position has corrected itself to a considerable extent and freight rates have improved.  In spite of this improvement shipowners still have to contend with the problems arising from worldwide inflation and, in particular, the ever-increasing burden of fuel costs.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping, in consideration of its objective to operate within the framework of a commercial company, would have deferred the acquisition of this ship for some further period.  In deference to the Government's concern to provide contracts from the public sector for Verolme Cork Dockyard it advanced its plans in this regard.  The Company is not, <Col N="708" /> however, in a position to finance the building of the ship without Exchequer assistance at this stage.  It is therefore proposed that the cost of the vessel will be funded by a combination of equity to the Company, borrowing by the Company and the payment of subvention to the yard.</P>
    <P>When the company was incorporated in 1941 the mandate given to it was to maintain a fleet to meet national requirements in time of need and to operate commercially thereafter.  The measure of its success is that for the past thirteen consecutive years the company has made a profit and has financed its operations and capital programme entirely from its own resources.</P>
    <P>The company is involved in a number of ancillary activities which provide alternative sources of revenue to compensate for the inevitable slumps which are endemic in the shipping industry.  These activities have made a major contribution towards the achievement of the company's profit record over the past thirteen years and has helped to overcome the adverse effects of a prolonged and severe recession in the world shipping industry.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited are confident that they can operate the new vessel successfully and profitably when it comes into service.</P>
    <P>The recession which has been affecting the shipping industry has also in turn caused problems for the shipbuilding industry.  Verolme Cork Dockyard has been facing serious financial problems and a lack of orders.  The Government took steps to alleviate the situation by arranging for contracts to be placed for the building of two new naval vessels for the Department of Defence, a fisheries research vessel and the bulk carrier for Irish Shipping Limited, in order to protect the jobs of a highly skilled work force.</P>
    <P>The continued development of Irish Shipping Limited is important in the furtherance of national development and its activities are of very considerable direct benefit to the economy.  It provides well-paid employment for 950 people and its total annual payroll is over £5 million. The present bulk carrier order will provide <Col N="709" /> employment at Verolme Cork Dockyard for the next two years which is a very valuable contribution at the present time to the Government's campaign to maintain existing employment and create new jobs.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the present Bill will enable Irish Shipping to expand its deep-sea fleet.  I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an enabling measure to provide extra capital for Irish Shipping Limited.  I note that the annual report expressed cautious optimism.  From the 1980 report, this optimism has been fulfilled and there is at least a partial improvement in the position of Irish Shipping, despite the major imbalance which has dogged the shipping business for the past five or six years, an imbalance of supply over demand.  As is stated in the annual report, it is ironical that the increased cost of transport and, in particular, the increased cost of energy &mdash; in this case oil &mdash; had a favourable effect on Irish Shipping in that it sorted out the men from the boys.  Many old ships were sent to the scrapyards, which left room for other ships to operate on a more viable basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that, since 1959, Irish Shipping had no reason to call on the House to provide it with any increased facility for share capital.  It is now seeking this facility on the advice of the Government.  The concern expressed by the Government in relation to jobs in Verolme Dockyard, resulted in bringing forward the order for this bulk carrier. This is something about which we, on this side of the House, do not quibble.  In a time of depression we should seek to at least maintain our work force and, in the case of the dockyard and ship building facility, such as Verolme where there is skilled labour, it would be unfortunate if we were to allow these people to join the dole queue.  Irish Shipping is to be commended for bringing forward this order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, the cost of the vessel will be funded by a combination of equity to the company, borrowing by the company and payment of a subvention to the yard.  The combined funding from <Col N="710" /> these three sources will ensure that the work in the dockyard and the labour force will be maintained at its present level over the next two years.  Irish Shipping will benefit from having a new vessel, which will be up to date, will take its place in their present fleet and be an incentive to new business on the many lines they operate around the world.  The fact that Irish Shipping has, since its inception, provided this country with a guaranteed facility in times where this might be necessary is imperative if we are to have insurance against the danger that exists in the case of international conflicts and so on.  They have done that admirably by going abroad and seeking to pay their way through contracts in foreign countries.  The depressed state of the economy is placing a heavier burden on transport.  Even the increased fees charged by shipping companies seem to be insufficient to allow such companies to break even, because of the massive increases in fuel in recent years, and because of the reduction in supply of older vessels.</P>
    <P>We hope that the more progressive companies, such as Irish Shipping, will be able to stand up to the recession and find themselves in a position to take on new work when the international economic situation improves.  This is a worthwhile Bill which serves the dual purpose of ensuring continuance of our skilled labour force in Verolme Dockyard and providing Irish Shipping with a new vessel for its fleet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>For quite a long time we have seen semi-State bodies in some difficulties and there has been criticism of them from many sectors of the community. It is very pleasing, therefore, to note, as far as Irish Shipping is concerned that, while they did have quite a number of difficulties in recent times, it is still one of the most successful semi-State Bodies. At this stage we should remember those who had the courage and the foresight to establish Irish Shipping back in 1941.  The credit must go to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Seán Lemass, the Secretary of his Department, those who were recruited to the <Col N="711" /> board of Irish Shipping and those who worked in it also.  In the middle of World War II if it had not been for Irish Shipping and the acquisition of a fleet we would have been in serious difficulties in regard to supplies and exports.</P>
      <P>In recent years, apart from that kind of work, Irish Shipping have been engaged in trade throughout the world and we should be proud of the fleet.  For that reason, as well as others, we give our wholehearted support to the proposals in this Bill that the share capital and the authorised borrowings of the company be increased.</P>
      <P>I must confess that although I come from a maritime constituency I do not know what a bulk carrier is, and perhaps the Minister will enlighten us, even if it has not much bearing on the provisions of the Bill.  The most favourable outcome is that jobs will be protected in Verolme. That is very important at present when we see so much unemployment, so many factories being closed down weekly.  I understand that the Government have decided to exercise their powers to direct Irish Shipping to have the bulk carrier built at Verolme.  Irish Shipping have a licence to acquire ships from other areas but the Government have power to direct them in respect of the building of new boats in Irish shipyards, in this case Verolme.</P>
      <P>On the subject of employment, the Minister mentioned a figure of 950 jobs. I should be obliged if he would give us some information as to the employment trend in the Cork shipyard in the past three or four years, whether this figure of 950 represents an increase or a decrease. In recent years we have learned from the media of the depressed state of shipping worldwide, aggravated by increased fuel costs.  In many countries governments and government agencies have been getting rid of boats, and therefore we should be pleased at the prospect of the bulk carrier being built in Verolme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that in the past few years Irish Shipping have made a profit.  Many of our semi-State bodies were not expected to make profits: if they <Col N="712" /> broke even we were pleased.  In many cases they have to be subsidised heavily by the Exchequer.  Considering these things, Irish Shipping have been a success and I again welcome the Bill and repeat my tribute to Irish Shipping who have been the success story of Irish companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>As a representative of the constituency in which Verolme are situated I welcome the Bill.  I have given the Minister a bit of a shake up recently by putting down a few questions to him on this subject and I am sure that the shop stewards there have also been on to him in the last few weeks.  In that area we have been concerned seriously because for the first time in a long period the docks have been empty, and without this new work there would have been many lay-offs in the new year.</P>
      <P>For that reason I hope the Minister will ensure that the work will be started soon. Such companies get tied up in paperwork and in bargaining but now that there is direct Government interest in having this carrier built I hope the Minister will ensure that time will not be lost.  We had been told there would be lay-offs and the 1,200 or 1,300 families depending on Verolme have become frightened.</P>
      <P>The knowledge has emerged that our yard in Cobh is one of the best in the world.  We are told that orders lost to more competitive undertakings in the past were a loss to the shipping companies concerned because ships like the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> built by other companies fell to bits on the high seas.  Verolme are now rightly regarded as first class and that is appreciated by Irish Shipping who have an excellent sea-going record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, it is important that this work be got under way without delay.  As well as ships such as this carrier we need smaller boats but there is not much work involved in such ships.  I hope the Minister will get this work going quickly so that there will be a full complement employed, and perhaps increased employment.  This is most welcome news coming on to Christmas.  The people in the area were depressed because they did not think that with the best will in the world anything could be done about it. <Col N="713" /> The work on the carrier will have to be got under way quickly if it is to be completed by December 1982.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping have done Trojan work for the Irish flag worldwide.  They have a great record in regard to the transport of goods throughout the world.  A bulk carrier of this type is just a massive container for grain and so on.  It is the shell of a ship with accommodation for crew.  There is a lot of welding and other work in it.  This is a very substantial order at a time when other dockyards around the world are having problems.</P>
    <P>It is because of the dedication of the workers in Verolme over the years that this order has been given to them.  Irish people often regard themselves as not being equal to the Germans and other nations but in this particular case we have the highest skills in shipbuilding in Verolme. They are turning out the best product in the world.  There has never been a serious accident with any ship built in Verolme.  People are starting to look at the cheap ships and have come to the conclusion that quality ships that will last are the best value.  We very often do not think about electrical work on a ship.  I believe that a ship can be grounded because of electrical problems.  I was shown once how electrical work was done by another company and I could almost do better myself.  The wiring was very bad.  We have seen top quality work in our naval vessels as well as in other ships which were built by Verolme and which are sailing all over the world.</P>
    <P>The order for this boat will give great confidence to the people in Verolme.  I hope the Minister and his Department will look around for further orders for this dockyard.  We are in the era of gas and possibly in the era of oil.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the massive tankers that are required will be built at Verolme.  We should not go abroad for them because we have the skill to build them in Verolme.  As soon as the Minister hears that we are likely to find oil off our shores I hope he will ensure that the large tankers are built in this dockyard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a step in the right direction but I believe <Col N="714" /> the Minister has failed to grasp the golden opportunity presented in this Bill when he did not decentralise Irish Shipping. He should have sent Irish Shipping to Rosslare harbour, where the major activities take place.  It is ridiculous having the head office in Dublin when the main harbour is Rosslare.  Now that the Government have embarked on a decentralisation programme it is regrettable that the Minister did not use this opportunity to decentralise Irish Shipping to Rosslare.</P>
      <P>I have a few criticisms to make about Irish Shipping.  When passengers are waiting to go abroad one of the vessels that are late, Irish Shipping never make an effort to provide temporary accommodation or notify the intending passengers that the ship will be late arriving in port.  I have heard this criticism from many tourists who come here.  I hope the Minister will ensure that those tourists will not be inconvenienced to the extent they have been during the past few years. If we have dissatisfied tourists waiting at a port for a ship that is late and they do not know when it is likely to arrive they will not come here again.  I hope the Minister will do something about this because I have got this criticism from many people visiting Kerry during the past few years.</P>
      <P>I am reliably informed that Irish Shipping spend at least £250,000 a year training personnel in nautical colleges outside the country.  Surely there should be some liaison between the Department of Education and the regional colleges to provide this facility in the Cork Regional College where I believe there are some facilities available for nautical training.  I hope the Minister will tell Irish Shipping that this training outside the country has gone on for long enough and that he sees no reason why our boys and girls cannot be trained in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Wexford or wherever the regional colleges can provide the facility.  He should inquire what efforts have been made by the Department of Education in co-operation with Irish Shipping to provide this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Shipping have done a wonderful job.  The criticisms I have made about them are ones I have picked up during <Col N="715" /> my travels.  I believe there are a number of slot machines in the Irish Shipping boats.  Who has the concession for them? I do not believe in slot machines.  I might have an odd flutter on the dogs or horses but the slot machines are out.  The Minister should ensure that the concession in relation to slot machines is regularised.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and for their concurrence with the Government decision to place this order for the bulk carrier with Verolme.  Deputy Corish paid tribute to where it all began, with the late Sean Lemass for his foresight in setting up Irish Shipping in the forties.  We see the fruits of the foresight of people like that.  He complimented the chairman, the board of directors and the management and staff of Irish Shipping on their magnificent record of success during the past 13 years. I join with the Deputy in that tribute and I am sure that in doing so I speak for every other Deputy here having regard to the fine performance of this company. They are a shining example to all other semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish raised the question of employment in Irish Shipping and asked whether the trend in this regard has been upwards or downwards.  The situation is that employment in the company has increased by almost 15 per cent &mdash; from 825 to 947, according to the annual report for the year ended 31 March 1979, and from 947 to 950 according to the annual report for the year ended 31 March 1980.</P>
      <P>Deputy Begley raised a few points by way of criticism of the company <i>vis-à-vis</i> inconvenience to tourists.  Naturally, tourists can become very annoyed if they have to wait for ferries.  Though this is a matter for the day-to-day management of Irish Shipping I shall convey the Deputy's remarks to the company as well as taking a personal interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the existence of the slot machines to which reference has been made.</P>

However, should this not be the case, I shall have the situation investigated for the purpose of ensuring that the concession is advertised.</P>
      <P>The question of training is one that I have been considering for some time not only in relation to Irish Shipping but in other respects also.  The situation is that there is a suitable course in Cork and I have been in touch with the Department of Education concerning the provision of suitable accommodation for the people who undertake that course.  The responsibility in respect of accommodation rests with that Department but in the event of their not being able to provide the necessary accommodation.  I have made other suggestions to them as to how the problem might be overcome.</P>

I am endeavouring to have this situation rectified because I agree fully that we should make full use of our training facilities at home.  I shall communicate with the Deputy when a resolution of the problem has been found.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hegarty complimented the fine skilled work force at Verolme Cork Dockyard.  The fruits of their work is proof of the fine job they have been doing down through the years.  It was precisely to protect those skills, to ensure that they did not become scattered, that the Government took the decision in July to place with the yard not only the order for the big vessel but also an order for two naval vessels and for one fishery research vessel. Orders have been placed for the two defence vessels and for the fishery research vessel.</P>

      <P>The orders were placed within the past few days and work is ready to begin.  In relation to the order from Irish Shipping, no time has been lost in bringing the negotiations to a conclusion. We are talking of a 70,000-ton bulk carrier which will be able to transport commodities such as steel, timber and coal. Irish Shipping considered commissioning a vessel of the order of 60,000 tons but they opted for the bigger carrier because Verolme had built a 70,000-ton vessel and had done a certain amount of planning in that area.  This will help speed up the whole operation because there will not be any delay in starting the work.  We are in the final negotiating stage so far as the price is concerned and it will be only a matter of weeks before the order is placed.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the amount of activity in progress around our coasts in relation to oil and gas exploration.  In this context I take this opportunity of saying to the management of Verolme that they too should have regard to the opportunities that exist in the area of servicing the offshore exploration vessels.</P>

      <P>I put this suggestion to them some months ago because I was aware of the difficulties which arose between last summer and last Christmas in the dockyard.  I will not lose any opportunity in trying to identify any potential order in this regard.  We have a fine skilled work force and our primary objective is to ensure that, wherever possible, the work that can be done at home is done by Irish workers.  This is one way out of our present recession.  The Deputies have my assurance that anything under my jurisdiction is being viewed in that context.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill Deputy O'Toole paid tribute to the many years of success of Irish Shipping and emphasised the contribution they are making to the national economy.  That contribution is vital.  A good deal of the earnings are in hard foreign currencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing I might mention that the <Col N="718" /> provision of this 70,000-ton carrier will put Irish Shipping into the position of being able to quote for the transport of coal to Money Point power station when it comes on stream eventually.</P>
    <P>The main reason for people going to England to be trained in nautical services is the lack of accommodation here.  I understand that no accommodation is being provided in Cork by the Department of Education for this purpose but as I have said I shall be taking the matter up with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the proposal to increase the share capital of Irish Shipping Limited from £12 million to £22 million.  This is a welcome move.  Any help that can be given to Irish Shipping by way of additional funds should be given.  As the main Opposition party in this House we welcome the proposal.</P>
      <P>The operation of Irish Shipping is a credit to the senior personnel involved in the shipping line.  It speaks for itself that this is the first time since 1959 that the company have come here looking for additional finance.  I do not know of any other State-sponsored body with such a good record so far as providing revenue for their own equipment is concerned.  It shows that Irish Shipping have been operating most efficiently.  If they need £10 million to assist them in providing the bulk carrier, which I understand will cost £25 million, we should got out of our way to see that they get it.  Their operations have been a credit to the entire work force.</P>
      <P>They were faced with severe difficulties in the current year because of the blockade by French fishermen.  This cost the company a considerable amount because of the extra travelling involved and because of the cancellation of sailings from Rosslare to Le Havre and other French ports.  However, despite all these factors, which were due to circumstances outside their control, the company are operating in a very efficient manner and I am glad we are assisting them.  Many of the other State-sponsored bodies are getting handouts year after year but this is the first time in more than 20 years that Irish Shipping have come to us for assistance. It is our duty to see that they get this £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are glad that the building of the ship will be carried out in the State and will provide employment in the Verolme shipyard.  We have no objection to the <Col N="720" /> passing of this section.  It is what anybody would expect to do in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>We have no objection to the Bill.  As I said on Committee Stage, we are glad to support it and any assistance we can give to Irish Shipping will be forthcoming from this side of the House. During the past ten or 15 years the tramping industry, as it is known in shipping, has had a very depressed time.  There are few companies who have not suffered heavy losses and it is great credit to Irish Shipping that they have kept their head above water in such circumstances.  At the moment there is a surplus of heavy cargo vessels, including oil tankers, and it is difficult to make the business pay because of this excess capacity.  Irish Shipping have shown themselves to be extremely astute in the way they have kept the tramp cargo vessels in their fleet busy during this depressed period.  It is the duty of this House to pay tribute to the directors, management and work force of Irish Shipping for that achievement. Because of over-capacity there is much cut-rate shipping.  In fact, the Transport Commissioner of the EEC, Mr. Burke, has had reason to complain about this undercutting not only by EEC countries but also by the Soviet Union. They have been providing bulk carriers and tramp shipping at enormously reduced prices and this has made it more difficult for companies such as Irish Shipping to pay their way.  In the circumstances they have done an extremely good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see why some other State companies cannot operate in as efficient a manner as Irish Shipping.  They have had as difficult a time as anybody but yet they came out without any losses except in the <Col N="721" /> current year when the losses were in the region of £1 million.  This was largely due to the blockade of the French ports. Obviously there is considerable expertise at the top of the company, they have good labour relations and have an able and willing work force.  All credit is due to them for their performance not just in recent years but over 20 years and particularly when the competition has been so keen.  They have performed to the credit of the country and without any cost to the taxpayer.  On this one occasion when they have come back to us because of the very large amount of capital required, we should be in full agreement that the money be provided.</P>

      <P>I hope Irish Shipping will never be caught in a situation similar to what occurred recently when a cargo of greyhounds was exported from Rosslare to England even though the greyhounds were supposed to go to Spain.

I ask that an official from the Department of Agriculture should examine the containers in which dogs are placed.  There should not be too many dogs in each container and they should be muzzled so that they will not eat one another as they did not long ago.  That gave a very bad name to the Irish greyhound industry.  If the owners thought <Col N="722" /> their dogs would be savaged in that way they would not have sold them.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £982,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, including sundry grants-in-aid. </P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on this Estimate last week I questioned the manner in which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were functioning and I said I was not at all happy that the board were performing the task they were set up to do on behalf of the fishing industry and Irish fishermen. As I see it, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were originally given a mandate to assist our fishermen in acquiring their own boats and in helping to get loans for the purchase of these boats.  They were also given the job of providing markets for the fishermen's catch.  Amongst other things, they were asked to look into the research and development of the fishing industry, which, really, is their primary function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry has been a colossal failure.  That failure must be an indictment of BIM as presently constituted. It must also be an indictment of the lack of will on the part of successive Governments down through the years, and particularly the present Government, to generate enthusiasm in the <Col N="723" /> Department of Fisheries, to strengthen that Department and to enlarge it to meet modern-day needs.  As a maritime nation, we have never fulfilled a fraction of our potential in fishery matters, in the yield of fish from the seas around us.  As a maritime nation with some of the best fishing grounds in the world, we have been singularly unsuccessful in developing a major industry from such a valuable resource.  It is fair to say that our fishing industry has not progressed in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has retrogressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara are the agency primarily concerned with the development of our fishery industry.  We have seen a decline in our fishing stocks. We have seen many thousands of disillusioned fishermen some of whom have already left, and many of whom are considering completely leaving, the industry. Rather than having the type of development hoped for, especially with the introduction of 50-mile or 200-mile limits, we have actually seen a diminution in the size of the fishing effort by the Irish fleet around our coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics can always be shown to prove that you are right even when you are wrong, once you can manipulate them in a certain manner.  A very small number of people have been heavily financed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and are catching a lot of fish, but the bulk of our fishermen today are having tougher times than probably ever before.  To produce statistics which show that the catching power and the amount of fish landed have increased somewhat does not altogether tell the true story.  Quite often the bulk of the catch is being taken by a small number of boats and hence helping a small number of fishermen.  In this case, the catch is of a variety which is not very valuable in terms of price fetched on the market.  I am referring specifically to the mackerel fishing off the Donegal coast, which seems now to be the staple part of our fishing industry, where the very large trawlers are concerned.  It is not a great deal of good to our fishermen if there are six or seven super-trawlers operating out <Col N="724" /> of Killybegs, catching mackerel, when 95 per cent of the fishermen are catching less than they caught in previous years and getting less, in terms of finance, than in previous years, which is the present case.</P>
    <P>The bottom has fallen out of the market and our fishermen are in a sad plight at the moment.  This was reflected here in the last couple of weeks when the Minister, in reply to questions about the number of loans which were overdue for payment by fishermen, told us that of the 400 loans &mdash; 440, I think &mdash; which had been sanctioned by BIM, some 280 of the fishermen concerned were in arrears with BIM.  That figure alone reflects the plight of the fishing industry at the moment. Most of our fishermen cannot make ends meet.  There has been a colossal failure in the marketing area.  People simply cannot sell their fish and this is one of the major areas of responsibility for BIM. Could the Minister tell us what is going to be done to improve the situation?</P>
    <P>In my view, what is needed is a complete restructuring of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and probably a restructuring of the Department of Fisheries, for that matter.  Fishermen complain constantly to me that they get a highly impersonal service &mdash; if you can call it a service &mdash; from BIM.  A board which was set up to act in the interests of Irish fishermen at times seems to be acting at variance with their interests.  Fishermen tell me that they find it much easier to deal with their bank manager, despite the fact that they might be very much in the red, than to chat with the officials of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  They tell me it is a case of being spoken down to.  There is no progressive type of discussion.  It is a case of being told what to do, how to do it, or when it should be done.  There is no two-way communication at all.  If An Bord Iascaigh Mhara cannot operate in a more rational and flexible manner, surely there is a strong case for its abolition and the setting up of an agency which will truly look after the interests of Irish fishermen? When I say look after the interests of Irish fishermen, I mean all fishermen, whether fishing in a 50-foot or in a 150-foot boat.</P>
    <P>There has been an over-emphasis on <Col N="725" /> the very big trawlers and a very sad neglect of the small, inshore fishermen who make up something like 90 per cent of the total number of people engaged in our fishing industry.  It is time that there was a national programme drawn up to plan the future of our fishing industry. Such a plan does not exist and the uncertainty which exists at the moment is causing great anxiety for fishermen who do not know if they have a future.  How could they when we have not yet a common fisheries policy and when they are not able to sell their fish?  We should have an intervention system for the fishing industry.  It is not good enough to tell fishermen that there is no point in fishing as they will not be able to sell their fish if they catch them.  There is no logic in not having an intervention system for fish as there is for beef, butter and other milk products.  There is a system of withdrawal for certain species of fish where a price is paid, but there is no intervention.  In recent times in Dunmore East there have been cases where top quality fish had to be dumped because there was no cold storage facilities as in an intervention system. I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, could hold out some hope that intervention will be introduced in time.</P>
    <P>One of the items on this Estimate relates to the cost of hiring boats in connection with additional herring surveys in the Celtic Sea.  That is a very necessary type of survey.  We have had such surveys under the guidance of a biologist, Mr. Molloy from the Minister's Department, over a number of years.  This man has been doing excellent work with other members of the Department, but by and large the Department are vastly undermanned. The Department cannot be expected to do the job they were set up to do and which the public expect them to do when they are understaffed and when they have not the money to do research on a large scale.</P>
    <P>While a 200-mile fishery limit off our coastline is open to all the nine members of the EEC, our fellow members of the EEC know more about our fishery grounds than we do.  That is an undisputed fact.  We have little or no knowledge <Col N="726" /> of what exists outside of a three to six mile band.  It is a sad reflection of the development of our fisheries industry that we are still at a stage where we know little about the quantities of fish and where they are.  I am quite certain that the French and the Spanish, who are not yet members of the EEC, know more about our fishery grounds up to 200 miles off our coast than we do.  Traditionally they have been fishing 50 and 100 miles off our coasts.  They have data that should be at the disposal of Irish fishermen.  If they are to fish within 200 miles off our coasts they have a duty to help in the surveying of the fish within that limit.  I have not yet heard of any assistance being offered from the other member States. They are happy to take our fish, legally or illegally, but they have not volunteered any information regarding the location of fishing grounds.  They undoubtedly have very detailed information by virtue of the fact that they had boats large enough to fish these grounds when Irish fishermen could go out only six or seven miles.</P>
    <P>In his reply would the Minister tell us if he got any information from the other member states?  Have they told us where they are catching huge quantities of hake?  The main interest of the Spaniards around the Irish coast is hake, a species which they prize most of all.  Are we getting any reciprocal assistance in these matters?  They have the benefit of fishing in our grounds and I wish to know if we are getting the benefit of the knowledge they have gleaned down through the years.</P>
    <P>I know that the surveying of the herring grounds in the Celtic Sea is of importance in relation to conservation.  However it is obvious that these very grounds which are supposed to be a prohibited area for herring fishings are being fished by Continentals, particularly by the Dutch under the pretext of fishing for mackerel and catching a by-catch of herring.  These people are catching large quantities of herring.  We should either have a proper ban or else open the Celtic Sea to Irish fishermen.  This is causing more bad blood and anger among Irish fishermen than any other item.  Irish fishermen <Col N="727" /> realise that we must have conservation but they maintain that the Dutch are catching a considerably greater quantity of herring in the Celtic Sea than all the Irish boats put together.  I have no reason to question their assertion in this matter.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the <i>Irish Independent</i> made very interesting reading.  I hope the Minister paid attention to the report, which stated that, although the North Sea is closed for herring fishing and has been for several years, the French fleet at the moment are catching enormous quantities of herring there and they are blatantly landing these catches in French ports.  Not a thing is being done about this by the French authorities.  They are condoning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;illegal fishing on an enormous scale.  Why has something not been done about it?  Will the Minister say if he raised an objection at the Council of Ministers about this illegal fishing?  Not alone are they catching the fish and landing them in ports such as Bologne but they have actually built new processing facilities to deal with them specifically.  I have been told that a new smoke house has recently been erected on the quayside in Bologne to process illegally caught fish.  If we are to be honest about conservation we should be honest with our fellow members in the EEC.  I have not heard of an objection by our Minister to this illegal fishing although it has been widely publicised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I see Irish fishermen fishing from 15, 20 and 30 feet boats being brought before the courts for doing the same thing on a vastly reduced scale I get annoyed.  It is only a drop in the ocean compared to what the French are doing.  It is time we made our stand.  Have the French Government prosecuted the 150 foot trawlers which are presently taking these huge catches of herring in the North Sea? I have not seen any reports that they have done so.  It ill behoves our Government <Col N="728" /> to prosecute people who have only the capacity to catch a few boxes of herring when people are catching thousands of tons of herring in prohibited areas in the North Sea.  As we all know, the Dutch are catching them in the Celtic Sea under the pretext of catching mackerel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving this motion after consultation with my colleagues because of the extreme gravity of the national emergency that exists arising from the situation in agriculture.  We are not talking here of a sectoral problem or a sectional interest but of something which is of national importance.  Having throughout <Col N="729" /> my career over the last 25 years since the EEC was established looked on it as the means of this country getting out from under economic dependence on Britain and its cheap food policy and having dedicated myself to securing EEC membership for this country because of the possible benefits for agriculture.  I am anxious to contribute to this debate and emphasise in doing so the gravity of the situation as we see it.  I believe it is seen in a similar way by the nation as a whole. I am not speaking alone for the party but for the whole country.  I am sure that most of what I have to say will be shared by Members on the Government side although on some points of criticism of the Government they will naturally wish to demur.</P>
    <P>The policy of joining the Community as full members, which I was engaged in from an early stage when I first helped to sound out unofficially from the Government of the day the possibility of full membership in April 1961, is one which proved its worth in the seventies.  From the time when membership became a probability in 1971 to 1978, apart from a brief dip in 1974 because of the temporary world cattle surplus, Irish agriculture benefited to an extraordinary degree from membership of the Community. During that period of seven years the purchasing power of income arising in agriculture rose over 70 per cent.  In that period farm incomes rose four-and-a-quarter times, far beyond even the massive increase in consumer prices that occurred during the oil crisis.  In 1980 farm incomes are back well below the 1972 level in terms of their purchasing power.  In fact, they are almost down to the 1971 level.  There is every indication that next year, unless there is a major intervention by the Government, hopefully with the co-operation of the EEC, the purchasing power of farm incomes will be below that of 1971 with farm output falling, as it is at present, bringing incomes down in money terms even if there is a significant price increase.</P>
    <P>Before we consider what measures should be taken to deal with the situation it is worth considering why it has happened. There is some confusion in people's <Col N="730" /> minds about this.  A factor in the situation is the EEC farm price situation but it is not that the prices have fallen. The reality is &mdash; I have just checked the latest agricultural price index figure for the month of September &mdash; that over the two years.  September to September, there was no change in farm prices.  There has been a failure of farm prices to rise for the Irish farmer because of the small increases in the EEC some of which have been eroded as far as we are concerned by special factors including the effects of the measures taken in regard to dairy production.  The problem as far as prices are concerned is not that they have fallen but that they have not risen.  The fact is that two-thirds of the drop in the purchasing power of farm incomes is accounted for by the increase in consumer prices eating into this purchasing power and one-third is due to the drop in farm incomes.</P>
    <P>When one comes to analysing why there has been a drop in income one finds that it is not because farm output has fallen.  On the contrary over the two years, from the figures available in the Central Bank Bulletin, there appears to be no change in gross output and a small increase of 2 per cent in net output over that period.  The drop in incomes is not due to a fall in output but to the very rapid increase in the price of inputs which have risen by 30 per cent in the last two years.  Once again, inflation.  What we have is a situation where farmers are squeezed by inflation at both ends.  They must face inflation which eats into the purchasing power of incomes derived from static prices and are at the same time eroded by the fact that they have to pay more for their inputs.  That has the effect of discouraging them from buying inputs and using fertiliser.</P>
    <P>Almost all of the farm problem, therefor, is due to inflation when one analyses the situation and most of that inflation it has to be said &mdash; perhaps three-quarters &mdash;is our own fault and is due to domestic causes.  Any analysis of inflation has to give a certain amount of consideration to the effect of oil prices and other import prices.  When one looks at inflation over the last couple of years it is clear that <Col N="731" /> much the greater part of it is due to our own domestic policies, the increase in taxes and cuts in subsidies made necessary by the cost of the Fianna Fáil manifesto and by the large pay settlements that resulted from the price increases brought about by budgetary action and which are now running at double the level they were running at in 1977.  The Government must accept a primary share of the responsibility for this situation.  It is not primarily due to the EEC although it would have been helpful if EEC farm prices had risen over the period more rapidly than they did.  The primary problem is inflation at home rather than the EEC situation.</P>
    <P>In addition the Government have chosen during those two crucial years of unparallelled difficulty for farmers to make the whole situation worse by such measures as the 2 per cent levy, the resource tax &mdash; both of which were payable regardless of whether there was any farm income out of which to pay them &mdash; the imposition of a disease eradication levy &mdash; the more a farmer sold the more a farmer had to pay &mdash; and by the elimination of rates relief on small to middle sized farms.  It is significant of the extent that the Government were out of touch with reality in regard to the farming situation throughout that period that even when they saw the damage done by the levy and were forced to pull back from it they insisted on substituting for it another tax, also unrelated to income, the resource tax.  That action was taken at a time when the adverse trend in farming was evident to anybody who knew anything about Irish agriculture.  It is hard to believe that any Government could have acted with such gross irresponsibility towards agriculture or that even today that the Government would fail to face reality.</P>
    <P>When one reads the complacent terms of the Government amendment to our motion one is forced to have grave doubts as to the capacity of the Government to see something that is staring them straight in the face.  What does their amendment do?  It recognises that farmers generally have been experiencing <Col N="732" /> serious difficulties.  It welcomes the consultations that are taking place between the Government and farming organisations &mdash; so do we.  It applauds &mdash; it is rather a strong word.  I would have thought, for what is involved &mdash; the range of financial and other measures already introduced by the Government to relieve the difficulties being experienced by farmers.  I would not have thought that the measures involved merit the word &ldquo;range&rdquo; and I would have thought that &ldquo;applaud&rdquo; is a somewhat strong verb to use in relation to them.  It acknowledges that these measures will encourage investment and improve farm incomes. The measures are, of course, grossly inadequate to do either of those things as anybody who knows anything about agriculture knows.  It says that they provide a stimulus for agricultural production when in fact these measures are so inadequate that agricultural production is bound to fall because of the destocking that is taking place at the moment and the reduction in the use of fertilisers on the land.  It goes on to note that the Government are continuing to explore ways and means of assisting the farming community and promoting the expansion of agricultural output.  It is not a question of promoting the expansion of agricultural output at this stage; it is a question of trying to stop the rot, to halt the decline in output which is looming up ahead of us not just for one year but for several years ahead.</P>
    <P>The whole of that amendment reeks with complacency and of a failure to face reality.  What we have to face, all of us in this House, however inconvenient it is &mdash; and as a party which is seeking Government and hopes to be in Government before very long it is as inconvenient for us in prospect as it is for the Government today because we will face the consequences of what is happening now if we are in Government, as we could be in months &mdash; is that if the farmers of 1980 were to have the same purchasing power as in 1978 they would need to have a family farm income of £1,216 million as against £895 million in 1978 just to stand still in terms of purchasing power because in that period this Government have <Col N="733" /> managed to push the cost of living up by 34 per cent.  Rather, to be fair to them, they have contributed the greater part of the 34 per cent increase in the cost of living that has taken place in the last two years.  But family farm income in 1980 is not going to be £1,216 million.  The figure estimated by the ESRI is in fact £755 million.  That is a shortfall of £461 million compared with what they would need to stand still and have the same purchasing power as two years ago, never mind being better off, never mind having the capacity to invest in increased output.  The Central Bank have similar figures.  They are slightly different but as far as I could calculate from their figures they see the shortfall of farm income as £479 million. Whether it is £461 million or £479 million it is of that magnitude.  Those two bodies have independently arrived at these figures and, in terms of income by comparison with what they need to have the same income and no more than in 1978, the farmers are short of £461 million to £479 million.  That is the measure of the crisis we face today and those figures are ones which can be calculated by the Minister himself from the Central Bank bulletin and the ESRI report if he is prepared to do a little simple arithmetic.</P>
    <P>This is not just a question of hardship for farmers.  What we are talking about is not just a social problem, people being hard up and facing financial difficulties. Farmers are used to facing financial difficulties. They have had their ups and downs &mdash; more downs than ups here in the past sixty years.  Others in the community too have faced downs as well as ups.  Many of us had a difficult time in having to face the problem of a drop in income &mdash; I faced it twice in my own life. But we are not concerned here simply with a drop in income because it imposes a hardship on people.  That is certainly something this House must consider.  But if people are entrepreneurs &mdash; and farmers are entrepreneurs &mdash; there are bound to be downs as well as ups and they cannot expect and do not expect to be baled out every time there is a dip in income after a period of income at a higher level.  What we are talking about <Col N="734" /> here goes far beyond the hardship of not being able to buy a new car, the hardship of not being able to buy new clothes for Christmas or something like that.  We are talking about something fundamental to the continuing output of the farming community.  We are talking about something which affects the output of our whole country, employment here, the whole of our economy.  There is the drop in the input of fertiliser arising from the increase in prices, in lack of farm incomes and there is the sale for slaughter of cows in-calf happening on a massive scale with one meat factory two months ago claiming that 60 per cent of the animals going through were cows in calf.  This is ensuring a drop in farm output not just for next year but for several years ahead.  Farmers cannot survive the pressures they are meeting from the banks and hold on to their farms unless they allow their farms and stock to be run down disastrously and that is what is happening at present. That is not just something which is bad for them; it is bad for us, bad for the whole community and the scale of it is alarming.</P>
    <P>We can see production falling in different areas.  Milk production for example looks like being down 2 to 3 per cent this year.  Elsewhere in the EEC it is rising.  Indeed a figure of 4 per cent has been mentioned but I think that may be on the high side.  Let us ask ourselves why it is falling here in this country with its clear comparative advantage in milk production, a country in which we always believed or had good reason to believe that under conditions of fair and free competition &mdash; if we could only get such conditions &mdash; the comparative advantage of our farmers in milk production would lead to a rapidly rising output, an expanding share in the total Community market. All we needed to be given was conditions of fair and free competition.  Yet in this year the output of milk is falling here when it is rising in the rest of the Community. Surely we must ask ourselves why that is happening.  Surely we must be concerned that it should be happening against all the tide of probability, against all that any of us predicted or foresaw would be likely to happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> It is not just a question of milk.  The national cow herd is seriously on the decline.  The level of destocking this year is estimated by one authorative source at 300,000.  That would be valued at about £120 million at farm gate prices.  At export prices, allowing for added value in the case of beef and some added value in terms of getting the livestock to the ports to be exported live, it is probably £140 million.  In other words, our balance of payments deficit this year is being held down to the tune of £140 million by de-stocking of livestock.  The figure of £550 million balance of payments deficit of which the Taoiseach was boasting in this House is in reality a figure of about £700 million.  It would be that but for the de-stocking, the selling off of our herd which, in the ordinary way, we would be keeping to sell next year and much of which at the moment consists of breeding stock.  The real balance of payments situation, so far as that goes, is of the order of £700 million instead of £550 million.  Let me add, although it is not particularly relevant to this debate, that were it not for the fact that the Government have got the economy so depressed that imports generally are falling by 7 per cent this year, the balance of payments deficit would be another £400 million higher at £1,100 million; if we just had no increase in imports, if we had had stagnation in imports as we had in the economy, if we had no destocking, it would be a deficit of £1,100 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get on with my speech without any further interruption. This is a serious matter we are talking about and interruptions do not help.  The Minister ought to know that and he should be able to control himself. Only because of a temporary running down of stocks affecting the level of imports into the country and the stocking of the cattle herd is our balance of payments deficit under £1,100 million.  The failure of the Government to face that is one of the most worrying features of the situation at present.  That is what should be on the Government's mind in the drawing up of the budget and on the Minister's mind in so far as he is still engaged in that activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of that 300,000 de-stocking it is estimated that 70,000 more cows are being slaughtered this year than there were last year.  Should the present pattern of cow disposal continue much longer cow numbers very soon will return to their pre-EEC level and this will make it impossible to maintain the level of agricultural output.  This is dangerous for all of us and not just for farmers.  We are not talking about sectional interests but about the national interest and this is widely realised. Early last year, due to the Government's <Col N="737" /> mismanagement of farm tax proposals when feelings were running high outside the farming sector over the injustices of PAYE, there was a short period when an urban-rural rift appeared, something that I have always hoped would be avoided.  The whole argument that I put forward in the EEC campaign was the mutual dependence of town and country and the multiplier effect of farm spending upon the urban areas.  On looking back we realise that the reason why we survived the first oil crisis as well as we did was that we had a prosperous agriculture and the spending by farmers managed to see us through that difficult period.  That rift which appeared momentarily was healed quickly when we all stood together on the platform in Nenagh. Deputy Cluskey, trade union and farming leaders and myself.  Thank God we got over that difficulty.</P>
    <P>At this moment the country &mdash; and by the country I mean the cities and towns as well as the countryside &mdash; recognises that there is a real agricultural crisis, not just farmers complaining about their lot. People see jobs disappearing, some in the food processing and farm machinery industries connected directly with farming and they see them disappearing in every sector with unemployment reaching unparalleled heights.  They see that happening when farm spending, which helped us through that first oil crisis, has dropped like a stone.  The interdependence of the farming sector and the rest, demonstrated positively in the mid-seventies when it kept us going, is now being demonstrated negatively in a way which has brought home to people that their jobs are in jeopardy because of the difficulty in the farming sector.  That is why Fine Gael have brought forward proposals &mdash; recognising that these proposals will be costly and that the cupboard, due to the mismanagement of the Government is bare &mdash; to deal with the situation because the need is vital.  We believe that EEC help should be secured to finance these proposals.  I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture is looking for such aid and I hope that we will be told in plain language in this debate just what he is seeking.  I am not clear as to what <Col N="738" /> exactly is being sought.  Perhaps due to a deficiency on my part I have not been able to get a clear picture of what he is seeking.  We propose that he will seek assistance with the kind of programme which we set out in the Bill which we put before the House, but, to the extent by which the EEC aid falls short we shall have to find the money here and not by further borrowing.  The money required will have to be found in the context of the Government's overall taxation expenditure plans for 1981.  These measures appropriately are being put forward by us in advance of the completion of the 1981 expenditure Estimates.  Even if in this context certain other expenditure programmes have to be curbed temporarily, this would be justified.  That is essential in view of the emergency situation in this productive sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>We chose to put forward our proposals in this matter by way of a Bill because we thought it most appropriate to do so, and that the more concrete we could make our proposals, the more specific and ready for legislative action they would be, the more likelihood there would be that they would produce some concrete results.  The Bill was allowed to be printed, but for reasons which I do not understand and which I cannot believe are sound within the Standing Orders of this House, we were not allowed to proceed with the Bill although we had been given permission to print it.  It seems to be suggested that remarks made in the presentation of the Bill made it out of order in the House although it had been in order before those remarks had been made.  This is the most extraordinary contention ever put forward by the Chair of any parliament previously.  Therefore, we are forced to submit our proposals by way of motion instead of by way of Bill. I regret this because the Bill in its complete form pinpointed the issues in the way they needed to be pinpointed.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the individual proposals, with which I will deal very briefly given time, I want to make one general point about them.  The aim of State intervention in agriculture should be to provide help in bad times while encouraging <Col N="739" /> farmers to proceed on their own resources in the good times.  Our present tax and grant structure does just the opposite.  It gives more to farmers when the going is good and less when it is bad. In introducing this emergency Bill, now a motion, we are seeking to establish that when times are really bad and the structure of the whole agricultural sector is in danger, Dáil Éireann and the Government can and will provide the special aid to agriculture needed to put things right. We want agricultural policies that are a stabilising, counter-cyclical influence rather than the policies we have at present which tend to accentuate the slumps as well as the booms.  Against that background our emergency proposals are put forward.</P>
    <P>The first section of the Bill as we put it forward proposes the abolition of the resource tax and the refunding to farmers before 31 December of anything collected under that during this year.  I do not need to dwell on this.  Everybody knows that the tax should never have been introduced.  At any time there were strong arguments against it.  To introduce it in 1980 when farm incomes had already dropped so drastically in 1979 was extraordinarily irresponsible.  The money should be refunded at this stage.  It would provide some small assistance to farmers who have been deprived of this financial resource, this liquidity which they needed so badly.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill would abolish the bovine disease levy.  This levy is a tax on agricultural output to pay for disease eradication and it has the effect that the more one produces the more of this levy one is asked to pay.  It is a penalty on production charged even on products sold at a loss and it has the same effect as the resource tax.  This Government seem to spend a lot of time thinking up ingenious methods of taxing farmers so that they have to pay money even when incurring losses.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes the abolition of agricultural rates.  Everyone is aware that our present rating system for agriculture is highly anachronistic. Even in the non-agricultural sector there <Col N="740" /> are anachronisms as seen in the case of commercial and even private dwellings, although in the case of private dwellings the matter is no longer serious since they were derated.  In agriculture this anachronistic system is based on the valuations of farms made in the mid-19th century when the factors which determined the value of farms were quite different from those of today.  My great-grandfather was engaged in the valuation process and I doubt very much if he ever thought that the work he was doing would stand the test of time so well a century and a quarter later and that the valuations put on farms in the light of prevailing conditions would still stand.</P>
    <P>One factor which determined the valuation of land was whether land was near the sea because at that time seaweed was the only fertiliser readily available. Therefore, land near the sea where seaweed was available was valued more highly.  That is irrelevant today when fertilisers of another kind are normally used. Another factor which determined the value of land was whether it was near a navigable waterway.  In the last few months in the midlands I have seen the banks of the Shannon, land which is under water in one instance for ten months of the year and in other instances for eight months of the year which is valued more highly than land elsewhere because of the value of having the Shannon navigation, steamboats going up and down the Shannon.  Steam had just been invented at that time and it was thought that there was a great future on the Shannon for transport.  The land there, of course, effectively is valueless.  Virtually nothing can be grown on it during the brief period when it is above the waterline. To base any system of taxation on something as out of date and anachronistic as that is absurd and leaves gross inequity between farmers, some land being valued at twice or more the price of other land of equivalent productive capacity.  Indeed, the system is being challenged in the courts at present and may well be found to be unconstitutional. Given the extent to which judges have brought questions of equity into their judgments on legislation in recent years <Col N="741" /> it would not surprise me if it were found to be unconstitutional.  To collect substantial sums of money on such a basis is unjust.  It may not have mattered that much years ago, when the level of rates were low and the scale of the injustices were small, but today with rates at their present level injustice is on a large scale. The rates system takes no account of family circumstances, so a farmer with ten children pays as much as a single farmer.  It is not related to the capacity to pay and as a form of taxation in that respect is unjust.</P>
    <P>In good years when farmers have an income they may use their rates as an instalment off their income tax but in bad years when they have no income they have to pay their full rates without any relief.  It represents a double injustice.  It is singularly inequitable form of taxation which is not only unjust in a distributive sense as between the different people paying it but which imposes an additional penalty when incomes are low or nonexistent and losses are incurred.  When there are profits they can be set in such a way against them so as to afford relief to farmers.  It is a totally counterproductive tax in this respect.  It does the exact opposite to what any tax or levy should do in agriculture.  It hits farmers in bad times and helps them in good times.  That is a good reason to remove it.</P>
    <P>The section in the Bill being proposed provides that the revenue loss to local authorities by the non-collection of rates from farmers should be paid by the Exchequer in the same way as rates on houses are.  The Exchequer already lays down the extent to which local authorities may increase rates in a given year because the Government seek to limit their own liability for domestic rates.  It is unfortunate that we have this situation where the autonomy of local authorities is being undermined.  This Bill involves no additional diminution of existing local authority powers because the Government are already exercising this control.  There is a serious problem of local authority financial freedom and this will not add to the problem as it exists already but it is something which, in Government, we <Col N="742" /> will have to look at.</P>
    <P>Section 4 proposes to treat breeding stock as capital for income tax purposes. The present decline in the numbers of breeding stock is of crucial importance. Our cattle breeding herd is at its lowest level since before we joined the Community. We have a diminished capacity to produce cattle for export in the foreseeable future and this decline must be reversed.  One way of doing so &mdash; it is only a small contribution but every little helps at this point &mdash; would be to allow farmers to set off the costs of purchasing or retaining extra breeding stock as a capital allowance against their income for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The farmers in greatest difficulty are those with high borrowing.  Many young farmers borrowed heavily in recent years to expand their stock numbers, drain their land, modernise their farm and so on.  In doing so they were acting according to the best official advice and often, in terms of development plans agreed with their agricultural adviser.  Sometimes it is true they are pushed into it unwisely by banks or financial institutions.</P>
    <P>One of the things I regret is the collapse of medium term economic planning in the country.  It left us without a mechanism which would have helped foresee this problem.  If anybody had sat down and looked at the way in which inflation and prices were likely to move over the years they would not have foreseen the scale of the present disaster but they would have foreseen the trend and in doing so would have provided guidance to farmers not to over invest or be pushed into borrowing too much during this period.  The absence of any such medium term plan or any attempt to look ahead helped to produce this situation.  These farmers find themselves in serious difficulties about repaying loans.</P>
    <P>In order to give direct relief to these farmers our fifth proposal in the motion requires the Minister for Finance to prepare an interest subsidy scheme.  It is envisaged that the subsidy would be paid, not to the bank, but directly to the farmer.  It would be administered by the revenue commissioners on the basis of <Col N="743" /> statements of interest supplied by farmers. These statements are already required for tax purposes and this would reduce the administrative cost.  Detailed criteria would be drawn up to ensure that a subsidy would be payable only for genuine family farm development and only on loans up to £25,000 per borrower.  This is one of the most important aspects of the Bill.  I urge the Government in considering alternative ways of helping agriculture to pay particular attention to this area.  The situation is extremely serious. Farmers are forced to let the land run down and sell their breeding stock.  In some cases they are forced to contemplate selling their farm or part of it.  It is a situation which no Government can allow to continue whatever the cost or however the money is found.</P>

      <P>The problem has to be met.  The Minister for Finance faces real difficulties and I sympathise with his task in preparing this budget.  What I am proposing will not make it any easier for him, but he knows as well as I do that it is necessary and that something must give somewhere in order to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>The sixth proposal in the Fine Gael motion is designed to facilitate the transfer of land to trained young farmers.  In order to encourage people who may be considering transferring land to young farmers to act now, we are proposing a two-year abolition of stamp duty on transfers of land to such farmers.  This will apply to transfers within and outside the family.  This is important and the two-year time limit is designed to encourage people to act now to ensure that a significant transfer of land would take place to younger hands so that in trying to come out of the present crisis as much land as possible would be in the hands of farmers with energy to tackle the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our proposals will fill only a small part of the gap in farm areas.  I do not claim that they solve the problem.  The scale of the problem is far larger &mdash; a deficit of between £460 million and £480 million in <Col N="744" /> farm income.  The cost of our proposals we estimate at £70 million.  In some cases the benefit would be far beyond the actual cost to the Exchequer because it would make possible the avoidance of action which would cut income very much more next year and the year after.  The multiplier effects of the £70 million we propose to be spent is considerable and the package was put together with that very much in mind.  It is a package in the general public interest.  I hope the Government will accept and implement the measures proposed here as soon as possible. The need is desperate, urgent and cannot be ignored.  Whatever blunders the Government have made in the agricultural sector or elsewhere in the past two years, they must put those behind them and grapple with the problem.  We have shown the way ahead in producing this Bill, not in the belief that we have all the wisdom available but that we are on the right lines.  We have identified some of the more significant problems.  We have picked out solutions which will have a multiplier effect in setting things right. While our proposals only go a small part of the way towards resolving the problem, they are an important first step.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government see it in that light and that putting down the amendment is to be seen as no more than a temporary holding mechanism, because they have to sort themselves out and need time to decide on a particular course of action, and that it does not mean they will ignore the proposals but will take them seriously and that the package along the lines we propose will come forward in the near future.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister in respect of some of the proposals not to wait for the budget because the damage that will be done between now and the date of the budget will be considerable.  If he could indicate that some proposals put forward here &mdash; for example, the interest subsidy &mdash; is under consideration by the Government even if he cannot commit himself to a particular figure or proposal, but anything of that kind which will restore confidence at present and persuade farmers to hold back on stock they would otherwise sell and encourage some farmers <Col N="745" /> somewhere to put fertiliser on land which otherwise will not be productive next year.  In that way there is a chance to save something from the wreckage, but very little time to do it in and no time to be wasted.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will not be put off doing any of these things because we propose them.  They are all things that arise from common knowledge of the nature of the problems.  Anybody sitting down to examine the problems would come up with a package along these lines. We suggest that what we have put forward is on the right lines and we urge the Government not to hesitate to act now decisively and to give new hope to the farming community before any more damage is done to a section upon which so much depends and on which the livelihood of all our people depends to a degree that I think is now widely appreciated, though not perhaps completely understood by everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 in my name and in that of the Minister for Agriculture:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises that farmers generally have been experiencing serious difficulties; welcomes the valuable consultations taking place between the Government and Farm Organisations in regard to these difficulties; applauds the range of financial and other measures already introduced by the Government to relieve the difficulties being experienced by farmers; acknowledges that these measures will encourage investment and improve farm incomes and provide a stimulus to agricultural production and notes that the Government are continuing to explore ways and means of further assisting the farming community and promoting the expansion of agricultural output.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it is important to note that there is one matter on which all sides of the <Col N="746" /> House are agreed &mdash; perhaps more than one &mdash; that farming is going through a difficult period.  Secondly, I think we are also agreed on the significance of farming in the economy and in the whole social and cultural structure of the country. Where we obviously disagree is in how we should approach the problems that exist, the implication from the motion being that the Government have not been concerned, have taken no effective action and are not now taking such action.  I propose to demonstrate very clearly that not only have we taken effective action but that we are continuing to do so within the scope available and to the extent that the Government have the responsibility and obligation to do so.</P>
    <P>By way of introduction I can say that we have demonstrated this in the various actions taken, in the consultations we have had which have been unprecedented in nature and scope and understanding between Government and farm leaders and also in the unprecedented discussions we have arranged between the farm leaders and the Revenue Commissioners among others.  All this clearly shows that the Government in the past 12 months, and even on this very day and night through my colleagues in Europe, are aware, are concerned and are taking action.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion ignores all the actions taken.  I propose to outline in some detail those actions from the first time within days of my taking on the responsibility of Minister for Finance when I met farmers in pre-budget meetings. Since then the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and myself individually and collectively have had very constant and very fruitful meetings with them.  The motion ignores what has been achieved and the fact that actions already taken whether by way of tax concessions or by way of extra grants or moneys applied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the face of these unwarranted attacks.  He merely added to the accumulated total this evening. Action we have taken by way of grants, incentive grants and tax concessions already represents over £80 million in this year in addition to what was being done.  This will enable Deputies opposite, if and as they wish, to suggest that there was another slippage in the borrowing requirements because it appears on the current budget.  Deputy FitzGerald, particularly, will be conscious that these have been deliberate Government actions.  Deputies opposite should bear this in mind when they come, as they undoubtedly will, to criticise what they will refer to as &ldquo;slippage&rdquo;.  The Minister for Agriculture will deal in detail with actions taken by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are particularly conscious of the problems that have occurred particularly in the past year for the developing and development farmers, those who invested in their future and in the country's future.  Because of the nature and level of their development, obviously the repayment requirements of the banks, the ACC or other lending agencies have been a problem in a period when interest rates were running very high.  We took direct action to help that very important section of the community. Because of high interest rates particularly becoming a burden on those farmers we took action by way of raising loans guaranteeing the exchange rate for the ACC and the banks, such action being unprecedented <Col N="748" /> in anything done here or elsewhere. If Deputies opposite can give me any example of commercial banks having a guaranteed exchange cover by a Government in respect of loans they raise to pass on to any section they will turn up something I have not become aware of in my consideration of the matter.  That is one example of what we have done.  As a consequence of Government action in this area the House will have noticed that interest rates have reduced very considerably. In passing, may I say that a comment made recently in a statement by Deputy Cluskey in which he said that interest rates in Ireland were the highest or among the highest in Europe is not correct.  The reality is that now and for some time, much as a result of direct Government action, interest rates in Ireland are the third lowest in the EEC. That has particular significance for farmers.</P>
    <P>In view of the farmers' difficulties &mdash; they did face losses &mdash; we met the banks and told them that because their interests and the national interest depended so much on the success of farmers that when the farmers are in difficulties the banks must share some of the difficulties and if the farmers had losses the banks should share them also.  It was not just in the interest of the banks that we guaranteed £50 million extra by way of special loans at concessional rates for farmers: it was for farmers.  The banks agreed with the Government to share losses, to restructure loans and they guaranteed that this would be done and be seen to be done. Both they and the ACC have established liaison committees at our suggestion with farm organisations so as clearly to show that things would be done.  From reports coming back from these liaison committees &mdash; I can speak directly about the ACC because they have immediate responsibility to me &mdash; I find that 97 per cent of the cases referred to them in respect of restructuring have been dealt with satisfactorily.  There will be 3 per cent in the best of times, never mind the worst, where farmers will perhaps use loans to buy land at too high a rate or sometimes buy land on loans made available for something else.  One cannot cope <Col N="749" /> with all of them all the time but that record speaks for itself.  The ACC go through each case for restructuring, case by case, with the expertise available to them in the district office.  A special team has been established in the ACC since this scheme was launched to review every one that may have been turned down at the initial level by the local district office. I &mdash; in so far as it is my responsibility &mdash; and the Minister for Agriculture, have been in constant contact with the ACC in relation to restructuring the loans, which was one of the purposes of the allocations we applied to them.  It is very significant that we remain in constant contact. Where, perhaps, the original conditions in applying the Euro loans might appear to be somewhat restrictive because we were concerned that they would be used for new development loans to maintain the output that is so important to agriculture, where some of these conditions are restrictive we hope and expect we will be able to relax them.  No one pretends that there is an immediate prescription but we are taking a very flexible, tolerant and reasonable approach, because the real purpose now is to restore confidence in what is a difficult period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can ask in his own time.  Normally, the operating margin that the ACC are expected to achieve, because they too have an obligation to balance their books, is of the order of 4 per cent.  The ACC operate on a margin of 2½ per cent which represents &mdash; if you want so to call it &mdash; a loss of £¾ million to them and that is something the Exchequer are prepared to take on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a much greater reduction in the rates on the seasonal loans advanced to farmers through this period than on the rates to depositors with the ACC, at considerable cost either to them or to the Exchequer as the residual guarantor. The ACC are passing on the benefit of the moneys, which we arranged on this unprecedented move they would raise, in Euro currencies to the people <Col N="750" /> for whom they were intended.  If there are difficulties in respect of existing loans, raised before these arrangements were made, we will encourage the ACC, within the obvious criteria, restrictions and disciplines that apply to any lending institution, even one which is backed by State resources, to be flexible.  I wish to pay tribute to the people in that organisation and also to the understanding that developed with the farmers in the liaison committee.  They, with the expertise they have, are working daily and I, who live amongst them as most Deputies on the other side do also, know what is happening in district offices.  I do not have to be told from any side of the House, apart from the experience I have as Minister for Finance, what is happening in that area.</P>
    <P>The last thing the Government want to see is a cut-back by farmers on essential fertilisers and selling breeding stock.  Not only would that be against their interests, but it would be damaging to the banks and the ACC if they were obliged to do this because of commitments they had entered into.  It would be a major blow to the economy of which they represent such an important part.  I want to say, very deliberately, that farmers who feel they are obliged to take action of that sort should now note, because we have said it more than once, that they are not so obliged.  If any local bank is pressing action of that sort which would inhibit development&mdash;and I do not believe they would&mdash;farmers do not have to take those negative, counterproductive actions, because that is what these liaison committees are for.  Fertilisers and breeding stocks are essential, not just for the farmers but for the banks, the ACC and the economy.  No one would benefit if that were to continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty seemed to think I was concentrating too much on the ACC.  I will give some examples of precise actions.  This year, in relation to the farm modernisation grants, which is a matter specifically for the Government but the Minister for Finance has to face the criticism for the slippage in his borrowing requirements, we took a deliberate decision to increase from £36½ million to £59 <Col N="751" /> million the amounts made available for farm modernisation grants.  At a time when people are talking about doom and gloom&mdash;and I recognise there are difficulties&mdash;would they, for goodness sake, sit up and take notice of the fact that the level of activity of these grants, which I presume the farmers are not spending on fridges, are more buoyant than at any time in the history of the State.  This year £60 million compares with a total of £160 million since 1976.  Is that evidence of total depression?  It is evidence of determination and confidence and it is evidence to everyone of the reaction of the Government where in this year alone we have taken that unprecedented step.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture will deal with other aspects but I will give examples of the cost in relation to the disadvantaged area schemes.  Annual expenditure will increase by approximately £17 million.  Note that figure.  The Government did not take that on lightly at what is&mdash;as Deputies opposite know&mdash;a difficult time.  This year it will be £10.6 million. In a full year it will be £17 million.</P>
    <P>We have also had the introduction of beef suckler schemes, whereby the grant of £13.18 is financed by the EEC on cows and beef suckler herds and a further £12 out of national funds, making a total of £25.18 which would, in respect of disadvantaged areas, bring the total to £57.18 in respect of each additional cow in the disadvantaged areas.  We introduced a fertiliser usage and first time silage scheme, as Deputies will be aware, at the request of the farmers, which applies to almost each case.  I hope I have time to refer to this.  This cost £1 million.  There were also Exchequer grants to maintain the cost of warble fly dressing at the levy which applied in 1979.  I will refer to the cost of this shortly.  I think Deputy Bruton thinks it is a source of amusement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents close on £40 million which is almost 30 per cent of that which otherwise this year would have gone directly to the farmers' pockets by <Col N="752" /> way of Government action.  That is how significant, unprecedented in scale, scope and extent the actions we have taken over the last few months have been, as a consequence of our concern and the consultations we had with farmers.  We have had these consultations and we have met the requests that have been made to us. The farmers wanted immediate funds&mdash;I do not think that this is unreasonable from their point of view&mdash;to restore their incomes, something in the order of £300 million.  I do not think even the Opposition would expect that to be done quite like this.  We met each issue the farmers raised during the course of these very satisfactory consultations.  There may be one or two in principle which still remain.  This started in my pre-budget meeting on 4 February and the first thing I told them was that I would not be insisting on the yield which had been determined of £100 million.  That £100 million that looked like coming up last year will, in fact, be approximately half that, a total yield from income tax, resource tax and rates, of about £50 million. That is a consequence of a number of the actions, not all of them due to a fall in farm incomes, which the Government took in the area of income tax and rates.  The yield from income tax in the-last one and a half years represents a reduction of £25 million.  I told the House earlier about the other part of the story. We in this Government have been tailoring our budgets to what we expect the realities to be.</P>

In June I met the farm leaders, with the Minister for the Environment, and we discussed rates and other such matters.  We have made concessions.  On 9 September Deputies <Col N="753" /> will be aware that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and I met them. On 17 October I met them again.  On 8 July the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture met them&mdash;I was not present on that occasion.  On 21 August, 12 September, 17 October and 27 November we had discussions with the farmers' leaders.

      <P>Some of us have been reared among them.  All our relations are part of them.  I have been referring to the actions we have being taking and the concessions we have made.  All of this cannot solve the problems because, as even Deputies opposite will appreciate, as the farmers' leaders appreciate, that the real problem is not here, apart from the climatic conditions we have had this year.  The problem is related to the CAP and its significance for farmers and the whole price structure.  That is the main <Col N="754" /> element.  Yesterday and this evening and in the last number of weeks the Minister for Agriculture has been and is in direct consultation on these matters.  These consultations are continuing and we do not know yet what will emerge from them.</P>
      <P>However, the farmers are well aware that the Minister for Agriculture is making a determined effort on their behalf. It is important that all of us in the Government should do this because 31 per cent of our total exports in 1979 came from the agricultural sector.  That is not the full story.  The 31 per cent amounted to £1,089 million.  To that can be added receipts from the EEC Agriculture Fund which brought a further £415 million. Then we can understand the significance of the farmers' contribution to our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>I hope it is clear from what I said earlier that I do not take solace from that contribution to our balance of payments, which is being corrected, and to our inflation, which is not running at the rate Deputy FitzGerald so confidently forecast it would be at budget time, 21 per cent or 22 per cent.  Our balance of payments position is better, the inflation rate is working out better, but I do not want to see the considerable improvement in the balance of payment coming about at the expense of the slaughter of our breeding stock.  That is the last thing I want to see and that is why I made my statement here earlier in relation to the roles of the financial institutions and the ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who preach gloom should realise the damage they do in a difficult time. The important thing is that farmers should feel encouraged by every action the Government are taking.  These actions should be supported and promoted by all political representatives. Farmers should be encouraged to increase production.  Through the loans that we are continuing to apply, by way of exchange risk guarantees particularly, we will minimise the situation.  Through these measures interest rates here now are 4 or 5 per cent less than they would otherwise be.  Were it not for the actions we have taken the interest rates would not have moved down to 3 or 4 points below those in Britain.  Direct Government <Col N="755" /> action was responsible through the Central Bank.  People do not want to give us credit for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to give positive views rather than reactionary opinions, which is what the Deputy has been at. Deputy FitzGerald is known to be garrulous. While he was speaking I interrupted him only once to use the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  I got a response from Deputy L'Estrange which was typical of him.  We cannot expect Deputy FitzGerald to sit quiet for the three minutes I have left. The operation of the CAP is vital in this. We did not join a common market.  We joined the European Economic Community in which the common agriculture policy played a central part.</P>
      <P>That is what we will promote at European and every other level in every institution. Any attacks on the CAP or any undermining of its role will be resisted by us.  Ireland has played no mean role in the EEC and we will not have anyone undermine that role.  As well, we are aware that farmers play no mean role here and we are determined to ensure by all the actions we take that the Community will recognise as we do that the CAP is a vital element in our economic success, in our programming for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> Because of the number of meetings I have had with our farmers, indeed long before those meetings, I am especially conscious of the role of the agricultural sector in keeping our economy going through difficult times.  We have a commitment to those who have commitments to us, not because of their economic significance but because of what they represent in value terms to this country, social and cultural values.  Without a buoyant, prosperous farming community we would be a different country.</P>
    <P>Even today I have taken action to ensure through the EIB that we will further develop agricultural activity, because today I arranged for further loans from the EIB amounting to £17.5 million to be made available to the ICC and the ACC for lending to small and medium manufacturing and agri-business firms.  As I said earlier, we have met the farm leaders, we have worked with them, we have listened to them, we appreciate their problems and we respect them for the way in which they have consulted with us.  I believe they respect us.  They may have pressures which are not all due to the difficulties that farming is going through.  There may be other pressures on them.  It has been a privilege for me to work closely with those people. I assure them that the Government will continue to take effective action at home and abroad to maximise the benefit of agriculture to our economy.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises, in view of the decline in agricultural incomes and production, that there is an urgent need for special measures to aid agriculture, </P>
      <P>It has become apparent to everybody including the Minister for Finance that the farming community have problems. The first words of the Minister's amendment state:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann recognises that farmers generally have been experiencing serious difficulty... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both sides are apparently agreed on that. <Col N="757" /> My party certainly agree with it.  Anybody who disagrees about the serious difficulties which the agricultural community are experiencing at the moment must be unacquainted with the area.  The Minister could have fooled me when he said that he had full co-operation from the farmers, that they understood him and he understood them and everything was very well.  I come from a farming area, I have a farming background and I know that what the Minister is saying is not the truth.  I do not mean to imply that he wishes to say an untruth but he is apparently misled because the farming community are saying the Government are doing nothing in their favour.  The Minister is fooling himself if he continues saying that the farming organisations understand him and he understands them.  I fail to see how any Minister for Finance can stand up and say that the measures the Government are taking at the moment are practical.</P>
    <P>It was principally the farming community who ensured that we joined the EEC, with the two major parties in the House.  The farmers campaigned for our entry into the EEC on the basis that they would get the same prices as our European partners.  Our farmers want to be able to sell their products at the prices obtaining in Europe.</P>
    <P>The two previous speakers said that farming is our chief national asset.  We know now after eight years in the EEC that our agricultural produce is not commanding the same price as that of our European partners.  The Minister for Agriculture stated last week he was going to Europe to try to negotiate that our agricultural produce would get the same prices in Europe as our competitors.  It is not to the credit of any Government to have to admit that they are only doing that now.  Our meat and dairy products are not obtaining the same price as the European farmers are getting.  Our farmers are thus at a serious disadvantage even before we start talking about inflation or anything else.  The feeding stuffs for our cows and all the other inputs to agriculture are costing our farmers a lot of money.  In fact, they are treble what <Col N="758" /> the European farmers have to pay.  The reasons the farmers backed our entry into the EEC was because of the common agricultural policy which should mean equal returns to all members of the Community.</P>
    <P>I know that our marketing is not built up enough to get the prices we should be getting for our produce.  We have the land to produce the best in meat, dairy products and vegetables but we find that we are not able to compete.  I believe the responsibility must rest on the Department of Agriculture and the Minister because no attempt has been made to produce the type of marketing to ensure that our produce can be sold for the highest prices available in the European Community.</P>
    <P>We have an inflation rate which does not favour our farmers in keeping their costs down.  The inputs to agriculture increased over the last year by around 30 per cent.  Our rate of inflation has added to the problem.  Because we are accepting a lower price, the profit available to our farmers is well below that available to farmers in Europe.  There are small farmers as well as large farmers in County Kildare.  Many of those small farmers, on the advice of instructors, have borrowed money to build milk parlours to try to increase their incomes and the production from their farms.  These people are under pressure from banks and other institutions to repay that money but they are not in a position to repay it.  Recently I made representations on behalf of five small farmers to the Eastern Health Board.  Their situation was so bad that they found it necessary to have recourse to the health board for what is known as sustenance.  If the Minister doubts what I am saying, I can produce the details. These are people who have been trying to make a living from their small farms and who have been trying to build up dairy herds on very small amounts of land, some of which may have been bought at very high prices.  It is not enough for the Government to say that the banks will not put pressure on such people for repayments because even if, say, a five-year loan is extended to 20 years, the interest will be so great that <Col N="759" /> the farmers will never be able to come to grips with it.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Finance has intervened in this debate.  I would say to him in particular that unless the Government can subsidise the interest on these loans, there is no point in saying that pressure for repayment is being eased.  We must subsidise the interest until such time as the problems of the farming community are resolved.  There is no denying the difficulties in the agricultural sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely after almost a decade of EEC membership we should be receiving similar prices for our produce as are being paid to our competitors but that is not the case.  There is talk of capital being restructured but what is most important is that there is brought about a levelling-up of prices.  Inflation rates have been levelled up and we find that our cost of living generally is higher than is the case in the rest of Europe. However, our farmers continue to receive lower prices for their produce than is the case in the rest of Europe. Can the Minister for Agriculture tell us the reason for this situation?  The Government tell us about all they have done for agriculture but I venture to say that what they have done in this sphere amounts to very little.  The farmers were grateful for small mercies but the time has come when something must be done to help them in their present difficulties. I should like to hear during this debate from those people on the Government side who know very well what the situation in agriculture is.  In particular I should like to hear from Deputy Callanan regarding the small farmers in his area, farmers whose problems are similar to those of the small farmer in Kildare.  I would remind the House that, despite general belief, there are small farmers in Kildare, some of whom owe substantial amounts of money to the banks and to other financial institutions but who realise <Col N="760" /> that, even if the terms of their loans are extended, they will not be in a position to keep up with the interest repayments. There is some poor quality land in Kildare, too.  Many of the small farmers I am talking of borrowed when interest rates were of the order of 10 per cent but they are now repaying at rates that vary from 16 to 19 per cent.</P>
      <P>There must be a levelling-up of incomes right across the board in the EEC.  Our farmers should be receiving as much for their produce as are the French, German or Dutch farmers.  Life in the EEC is supposed to be all about equality but how can there be equality when there are such differences in price structure as between one part of the Community and another?  The situation in respect of farm prices is difficult to understand when our cost of living is probably the highest in Europe.  I understand that there are moves in France to help the small farmers there, particularly those whose land is bad.  The idea is to put these small farmers on an equal footing with the rest of the people.  I suppose that if we suggested something similar here, we would be told that any such action would be against the rules of EEC membership but we must be prepared to stand up and be counted and to be serious when we talk about agriculture.</P>
      <P>If the problems in the agricultural sector are not resolved, not only cow herds but land itself will have to be sold off in order that farmers may meet their mortgage repayments and these are debts which they incurred on all the advice available to them, from the Minister for Agriculture and from the agricultural advisers.  In addition, the banks were willing to lend money to buy land which we all knew was too dear.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 December 1980.</P>

      <P>The Government had grave misgivings concerning the substance and the implications of the November 30 constitutional referendum for the future of democracy in Uruguay.  However, as the Deputy is aware, the people of that country voted overwhelmingly against the proposals put to them by the military government.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government will keep subsequent events in that country under review.</P>

      <P>The Madrid follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe began on 11 November and is expected to continue until about March 1981.</P>
      <P>The procedural issues on which the nine-week preparatory meeting had failed to agree and which threatened to disrupt the main meeting were finally resolved on 14 November.  At present the meeting is examining implementation to date of the Helsinki Final Act and will continue to do so until the Christmas break on 19 December.  After the New Year resumption on 27 January, new proposals for improved implementation of the Final Act will be examined and a concluding document will be drafted.</P>
      <P>As regards the issues before the meeting, the Deputy will find in the Dáil library a copy of the opening statement which I made on 13 November.  In that statement I described in some detail the Irish Government's attitude to and expectations of the Madrid meeting.</P>
      <P>In the first weeks of the meeting the atmosphere has at times been strained but given current tensions in East-West relations this is hardly avoidable.  While I recognise the difficulties confronting the Madrid meeting in present international circumstances, it remains my hope that some concrete and significant results will emerge from the meeting and the Irish delegation are certainly working towards such an outcome.</P>

      <P>In the period 1 January-30 November 1980 a total of 65 firms have come to notice as having ceased production.

      <P>The person concerned, who is a smallholder, was not entitled to the increases in the rates of unemployment <Col N="613" /> assistance introduced this year as he is a smallholder whose means are assessed on a notional basis by reference to his land valuation.  He applied to have his means factually assessed.  It was found, however, that this method of assessment was not to his advantage as it did not entitle him to an increase in his rate of unemployment assistance.  If he is not satisfied with the result of the factual assessment, he has the right to appeal to an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 12 August 1980. Payment was disallowed from 15 October 1980 following her examination on 9 October 1980 by a medical referee, who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She was notified on 24 October 1980 of the decision to disallow payment and of her right of appeal if dissatisfied with the decision.  No appeal has been received and no medical evidence of incapacity for work has been submitted since 28 October 1980.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance in November 1979 and the reason that he is not receiving payment is that his means were assessed at £20.10 weekly which exceeded the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case.  He subsequently appealed against <Col N="614" /> this decision in April of this year and the appeals officer requested a full reinvestigation of the claimant's means.  As a result of this reinvestigation, the appeals officer reduced the assessment of means to £18.00 weekly but as this amount still exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance applicable in this case.  £16.45, the person concerned did not become entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from my Department for three separate periods this year, commencing with a claim from 3 to 17 March 1980.  She is not qualified for payment in respect of these claims as she has less than the statutory minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in 1978/79, the contribution year governing her claims.  It is understood, however, that she was in Great Britain during 1978 and inquiries are being made regarding British insurance contributions, if any, which may be taken into account for the purpose of establishing entitlement to benefit.</P>

    <P> (i)  Table 1 gives particulars of the type and value of all property which was assessed to wealth tax in the period from the inception of the tax in 1975 up to 5 April 1979. The values shown represent the sum of the values for the three valuation dates when the tax was operative, 5 April 1975, 5 April 1976 and 5 April 1977.  Because of the manner in which statistics are kept, it is not possible to furnish particulars for each valuation date separately.  Information concerning cases assessed after 5 April 1979 is not yet available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> (ii)  The values shown in table 1 are net market values after deduction of debts, incumbrances and reliefs.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The value at (a) in table 1 refers to property of every description situate outside the State; the values at (b), (c) and (d) refer together to property of every description situate in the State.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The land referred to at (b) in table 1 is land of individuals only; land in the hands of discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies is included in the property at (d).</P>
    <P>(v)  Table 2 gives particulars of the numbers of persons assessed to tax on the property in table 1.  The numbers shown represent the sum of the numbers for the three valuation dates and where a person was assessed to tax for more than one valuation date that person is included more than once in table 2. </P>

      <P>Changes in the Exchequer borrowing requirement result from the interaction of all the factors which influence the level of both public expenditure and tax revenue. Some of these factors are discretionary changes determined by Government policy.  However, the actual levels of public expenditure and tax revenue are also affected by changes in overall income, in the rate of inflation and in the level of unemployment.  Even on the assumption that a reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement only reflected discretionary changes in Government policy, the direct impact on employment could vary considerably depending on whether the reduction in borrowing was brought about by increasing revenue or by cutting expenditure, or by a combination of both measures.</P>

      <P>The contractor who submitted the lowest tender for this project indicated that he would be unable to undertake construction work until March 1982.  Therefore, his tender was rejected and the next lowest was examined.  As the second lowest tender was significantly above the cost limit for the project, the school's consultants were requested to evaluate possible areas of cost savings.  When their proposals are received, a meeting will be held with the school authorities and consultants to resolve any outstanding problems and permit construction work to proceed.</P>
      <P>A specific date for the completion of the building has not ben envisaged. Should building work be proceeded with early in 1981, it is anticipated that the extension of the premises would be ready for occupation by September 1982.</P>

      <P>Her rate of pension is the rate appropriate to a person with a yearly average of 27 contributions paid and credited over a prescribed period.  In order to qualify for a pension at the maximum rate an average of 48 contributions paid and credited is required.</P>

      <P>He appealed against the decision disallowing his claim for disability benefit and, in connection with his appeal, he was examined on 19 November 1980 by a different medical referee who also ex pressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  His case has now been referred to an appeals officer for determination. The appeals officer proposes to hold an oral hearing of the appeal at an early date.

      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 22 of November 1980, £35 million of the additional £97 million provided under the national understanding was for services in the local government sector for which I am responsible.  The following is the breakdown of the £35 million: £12 million for local authority housing; £7 million for house purchase loans; £5 million for road works; £6.75 million for sanitary services; £0.25 million for recreational facilities; £4 million for housing grants paid by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as local authority housing is <Col N="652" /> concerned, I wish to refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 325 of 23 October 1980 which shows a breakdown of the additional capital allocations for local authority housing notified to the various local authorities in September 1980.  The total included the additional £12 million approved by the Government under the national understanding.  Of the £0.25 million provided for recreational facilities, sums of £50,000 and £10,000 have been drawn on the Local Loans Fund by Limerick County Borough and Clonmel Borough Corporations respectively.  Allocations made to individual local authorities arising from the additional money provided for sanitary services, road works and house purchase loans are set out in the tabular statement below, which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment when he expects to make a determination under section 13 of the Housing Act in relation to repairs to the house of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; when the request for determination was received in his Department; when the house was inspected; and if he is satisfied that this matter is being dealt with expeditiously.</P>

      <P>I received on 11 March 1980 a valid application under section 13 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1979, for a determination as to whether or not the house in question was in good structural condition when ownership of the house was transferred by Meath County Council.</P>
      <P>The house will be inspected at an early date.  It will not be possible to make a determination until a report is furnished, following this inspection, on the structural condition of the house.</P>
      <P>My Department's housing inspectors have been heavily burdened in recent times due to the huge volume of applications for housing grants.  In addition there has been a significant increase in the volume of applications for determinations under section 13 of the 1979 Act. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the application in question, and all other such applications, are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
