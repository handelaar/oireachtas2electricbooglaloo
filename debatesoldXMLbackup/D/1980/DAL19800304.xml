      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason the information contained in pages 291-303 of the Irish Statistical Bulletin of September 1979 for various categories of industrial production is no more recent than 1975 and if he considers information of this vintage is of sufficient value to justify the costs involved in its assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistical information to which the Deputy refers relates to results of the annual census of industrial production covering details of goods manufactured, materials used and so forth.  The 12 seqarate industry reports included in the September 1979 Irish Statistical Bulletin complete the set for the 1975 census&mdash;reports for that year for 68 other industries were published in previous issues of the bulletin.</P>
      <P>The 1976 census returns are being processed at the moment and some industry reports for that census year will be included in the next issue of the bulletin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistical information on current developments in the industrial sector is <Col N="1098" /> provided by the monthly index of industrial production for which results up to September 1979 have already been issued while provisional results for the final quarter of 1979 are expected to be available in about one month's time.</P>
    <P>The annual census of production results provide valuable detailed information not derivable from the current indicators and it is considered necessary to have both components in the national statistical system.  Inevitably there is a substantial time-lag involved for the census figures since completed returns are usually based by firms on their final annual accounts.  There is a further time-lag caused by the delay in making the returns to the Central Statistics Office. Regretfully this delay has been increasing in recent years with consequential cumulative delays in the compilation and publication of the census results.  Thus even in respect of the 1976 census year about one-fifth of the returns are still outstanding.  One factor which may have contributed to this development has been an expansion in the variety of data sought to meet statistical requirements of the EEC.</P>
    <P>In July of last year the Central Statistics Office appointed five field officers on an experimental basis to make direct contact with industrial firms and to encourage them to forward statistical returns for annual and short-term inquiries with a minimum of delay.  Certain progress has been made and the office is continuing with this direct approach to firms.  It will however take some time to make substantial reductions in the time-lag for census results.</P>
    <P>It would be of considerable help if firms would complete and return their outstanding census of production forms and enable the Central Statistics Office to produce the aggregate results with a shorter time-lag.</P>

      <P>The bulk of the payments received by Ireland from the EEC budget are made under the guarantee section of FEOGA for agricultural price support.  These are paid in advance to the Department of Agriculture as the Irish intervention agency.</P>
      <P>In the case of EEC structural funds, principally the regional and social funds and the FEOGA Guidance Section, a distinction is generally made between commitments and payments.  In these cases, certain amounts are committed for specific projects to be undertaken over a number of years.  Payments deriving from those commitments are made <i>pari passu</i> with national expenditure on the projects in question, in instalments as each phase of eligible work is completed, or on finalisation of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, procedures agreed in 1978 and 1979 whereby payments <Col N="1100" /> from the regional and social funds can be accelerated once a substantial part of the expenditure on the relevant project has been incurred.  Nevertheless, only some of the money committed for multi-annual projects is paid in the year of commitment.  Thus, the amounts committed for Ireland from the structural funds since our accession to the Community have been greater than the amounts actually paid over to Ireland during that period.  This was the inevitable result of the time-lag inherent in the system of spreading payments over a number of years.  The total amount of commitments and payments for Ireland under the main structural funds for the period 1973-79 inclusive was:</P>

    <P>While Ireland's utilisation rate of Community funds, that is, the rate at which commitments are converted into payments, compares quite favourably with that of other member states, the Government are concerned to ensure that payments will be speeded up as much as possible.  Following a recent approach in the case of the regional fund, the European Commission has agreed an arrangement which will result in a greater proportion of commitments being converted into payments during the year of commitment.</P>
    <P>I might add that our record in securing commitments is quite satisfactory.  In the case of the quota section of the regional fund, where national quotas apply, we have consistently succeeded in having the full amount of our allocation committed in the year to which it applies. Similarly we ensured that the full amount of the capitalised interest subsidy earmarked for Ireland in 1979 under the EMS was drawn down in the course of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a very considerable improvement in relation to utilisation of commitments in the past three or four years.  In 1975 the utilisation rate, that is, the receipts as a proportion of total commitments, was 21 per cent in regard to the regional fund.  In 1979 it was 61 per cent.  In 1975 in regard to the social fund the percentage was 43 and in 1979 it was 73.  The same pattern follows in the other fund where receipts were as low as 8 per cent in 1975 and 89 per cent in 1979.  The Deputy will agree that considerable progress has been made in the last two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that under the three funds referred to about £150 million was not collected in that six-year period.  Has that money been lost entirely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been lost at all but over the years actual expenditure has fallen significantly behind commitment.  It is fair to point out that some of the commitments are multi-annual and therefore it is not a question of measuring expenditure in any one year.  I assure the Deputy and the House that the position has improved significantly.  Now, it is guaranteed that the total amount of the moneys paid under the FEOGA Guidance Section can be paid within the year whereas previously 75 per cent only was envisaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of the total amount of £150 million&mdash;being the difference between the allocation and the receipts in the period to 1979&mdash;will we not recover at all?  Can the Minister indicate what proportion, if any, of that will not come through to this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only premature but ill-advised to suggest that some of it will not be recovered at all.  It is not our intention that any part of it would not be recovered at all.  We are <Col N="1102" /> now endeavouring to ensure, particularly through the FEOGA section&mdash;which is the area in which the speed of payments has been slowest&mdash;that the commitments will be followed as quickly as possible, through expenditure, within the year.  That has not been the pattern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the application of funds generally.  I do not have&mdash;and I do not think the Deputy could expect me to have&mdash;at this time the breakdown in respect of each individual subhead.  I do not have that information with me now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>But the figure I require is quite a substantial amount.  Surely the Minister would need that to get a general total?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that that would relate both to the quota and non-quota sections of the Regional Fund, which are to be found under two separate headings.  The Deputy will further appreciate that, within those subheads, there is a distinction made between Derry&mdash;Donegal, the Erne catchment and Newry&mdash;Dundalk. All of that involves an amount of detail which certainly could not be answered today on Deputy O'Keeffe's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a constant Interdepartmental Committee, there is a Government Committee, and I can assure the Deputy that in all of these areas&mdash;as is evident from the improvement in the expenditure areas&mdash;the Government are acting in a very determined and cohesive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not hear all of that reply.  I have no doubt the assessment would show that the balance lay on the advantage side but ought there not to be a specific running study, conducted in that Department&mdash;whatever its title from month to month&mdash;which will show the balance of advantage and disadvantage&mdash;money, on the one hand, the loss of exclusive fishery rights and so on, on the other&mdash;which membership of the Community, now seven years old, has entailed for us, because the balance might change one day and then we should like to know?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in relation to that is that I am sure the Deputy would be anxious that the House would have an opportunity of expressing its opinion thereon.  I am quite well aware that the regular biannual reports are now brought before the House simultaneously with publication.  Therefore the House now has an opportunity it did not have in former years, that of discussing our membership of the EEC on the latest reports.  That opportunity was not available to us at a certain time when I was spokesman for the Opposition.</P>

Any scheme of restoration would necessarily entail the retention of the facade which has some architectural significance in the context of the streets scale.

      <P>A circular letter was sent to each city and county manager on 19 November 1979 in connection with the problems of unfinished housing estates.  As consultations were necessary before this circular was prepared I could not accept that any delay occurred in issuing it.  The circular requested information on the extent of the problem in each area, the type of works outstanding and the likely cost of remedial action which would be necessary to enable the authorities to take the estates in charge.  The circular also reminded the authorities of their powers and duties in relation to planning control and urged that full use be made of the provisions of the Planning Acts to ensure that developers complete their estates to a satisfactory standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports on the extent of the problem have now been received from the majority of the authorities.  Replies are still outstanding in respect of eight areas.  The reports are being examined in my Department at present and when this examination is complete I hope to devise a scheme to enable planning authorities to deal with estates where all efforts have <Col N="1120" /> failed to achieve their completion.

      <P>Of course, and that is where the difficulty is.  When replies come in from all local authorities, would the Minister consider the matter of estates where there is no request to have them taken in charge?  There are not many but there are some such estates in County Dublin that have been built for 16 or 18 years.  No request to take them in charge has been made to the local authority and they are unable to act.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of all the difficulties and problems involved and I assure Deputies that I will do everything possible to resolve them.  We have asked local authorities to ensure that sufficient bonds are sought in the first instance to make sure that the estate can be properly completed and also to tie up the completion in the granting of planning permission. I have asked local authorities to tighten up these aspects of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine for future development but I am talking of past developments, 16 to 20 years back.  I understand that in the Dublin area the percentage is up to 25 or 30 per cent of estates not yet taken in charge and with no request to have them taken in charge.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the obstruction to environmental amenities by industrial construction such as oil and gas tanks, he will take the necessary administrative or legislative steps to ensure, where technically possible, that such constructions are placed underground; if his attention has been drawn to the impairment of the Dublin Bay prospect from Clontarf seafront, by the presence in the port of a large number of such constructions, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction of oil or gas tanks requires planning permission before it can proceed.  Planning authorities have powers available to them under the Planning Acts to ensure that such installations are located or landscaped so as to ensure that any adverse impact on the environment in minimised.  As regards the installations in Dublin port it is the policy of the planning authority to ensure that extensions to the port facing the residential suburbs of Clontarf and Sandymount are suitably landscaped in the interests of the residential character of these areas.</P>
      <P>It would not be feasible to insist, at this stage, that existing oil and gas tanks in Dublin port be relocated underground. However, with new techniques being developed, the location of similar structures underground may become feasible in the future.  This would be a matter for the planning authority to decide in the framework of the development plan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A preliminary examination of the finances of Waterford County Council has already taken place on the basis of information available in my Department in the matter.  That examination discloses that the local authority appear to be in a sound financial position and that there is no basis for any suggestion that the local authority are faced with a shortfall in <Col N="1126" /> finances which would prevent an adequate level of services and employment being provided in 1980.  It is, of course, a matter for the council in the consideration of their 1980 estimates of expenses to determine their priorities in relation to individual services and work programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no acceptable proposals before my Department for improvement of the existing road.  I have, however, made provision in the Road Development Plan for the 1980s for the construction of a new route from the National Primary Route N7, south of Naas, to Kilcullen.  The implementation of the project is dependent on the state of preparedness by Kildare County Council <Col N="1127" /> in regard to planning and land acquisition and on the Government's overall assessment of the priority ratings which should be given in any year to the competing demands for public funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30 September 1978 I approved of detailed proposals submitted by Kildare County Council for the Naas By-Pass, and on 29 May 1979 I approved of the Naas By-Pass Motorway Scheme 1978 made by the council.</P>
      <P>I understand that proceedings for the acquisition of the necessary lands are well advanced and that certain preliminary works have commenced. Grants totalling £455,000 have so far been allocated to the project and I expect to make further allocations to ensure its continuity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that 75 per cent of the landowners have agreed to the offer made by Kildare County Council?  Is it not a fact that there is a compulsory purchase order for the whole lot in one block?  Is it not also a fact that 1982 was given as the date for the opening of the by-pass?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that 75 per cent of the land required is in order but it is the 25 per cent that could prove difficult.  It is understandable that it is the late ones which can turn out to be the most difficult.  I would not like, therefore, to anticipate it.  It is in the Road Development Plan for the 1980s.  As the Deputy said 1982 was given.  It is then a matter for Kildare County Council. They might decide that they are ready much earlier than that and they might decide it requires a higher priority.  If Kildare County Council make such a case and put it forward to us we will certainly consider it.  It could come much earlier than anticipated.  This is why I would not like to tie myself to a date.  It might be an earlier date rather than a later one because there are so many things involved in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. Kildare County Council will first have to decide the priority in which they would like to have it taken.  If they want to give it a higher priority than it has at the present time and they come back to us on it with the land acquired, then the request will be given every consideration.</P>

    <P>(3)  The number of tests conducted in any period is generally lower than the number arranged.  The difference is accounted for mainly by the failure of many applicants to attend for test, despite adequate advance notice.  An unduly large number of applicants failed to attend for test in the quarter ended 31 December 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to every budget presented in this House since 1969.  But the build up to this budget was immense.  Never before have I seen more advice tendered to any Government and never have I seen so many inspired forecasts.  It was generally agreed that the difficulties facing us were great and a hair shirt budget was assured.  Political correspondents, who appear to be possessed of a greater insight into our economic situation than ordinary mortals, advised us that a belt-tightening operation comparable only to the cinching of a saddle of a Grand National favourite was in store for us all.  But the situation was also aggravated before the budget was presented by a decision of the Supreme Court to tax allowances for married women and the inevitable increases in oil imports which now cost the State more than we spend on all our health estimates.  We have debts that take more to service than the amount realised by PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That then was the climate in which <Col N="1206" /> our new Minister for Finance.  Deputy O'Kennedy, prepared and presented his first budget.  The Minister spent two hours here explaining his budget and I am confident that the people of Ireland believe that he did an excellent job.  The silence of the thinking members of the Opposition spoke volumes to me on that day.  The muted criticism of the media and the guarded praise of some others is a good barometer as to the effectiveness, popularity and realism of the budget.  It is a budget that faces up to the challenges of the day.  It attacks the problems and provides acceptable answers and lays the foundation for the future destinies of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael follow-up to the budget on that day was very interesting. The former shadow Minister, Deputy O'Higgins, whose reply was always very pat, referred to it as a phoney budget.  He had other favourite phrases that he would use on such an occasion. I remember, as a new Member of the House, his instant and eloquent response on budget day.  Perhaps as I became more discerning I did not feel the same but I would give him credit for a ready flow of criticism; perhaps it was not constructive but at least it was vehement and carried a degree of conviction. The present leader of Fine Gael always made a very learned and lengthy contribution on financial matters but this year the present shadow Minister for Finance, Mr. P. Barry, rose to say that he felt it was very unfair of the Dáil to expect him to reply to such a budget immediately. I understood him to say that he would like to sleep on it and that he would like to give us the benefit of his profound thinking on the following day. <Col N="1207" /> Perhaps the old-fashioned Fine Gaelers followed the hoary maxim that one should never allow the sun to go down on one's anger and gave vent to their feelings straight away.  But in Deputy Barry's case he felt he should listen to the budget with dismay and say his say the following day.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the big criticism of the budget was in relation to the imposition of 20p tax on a gallon of petrol and the tax on other oils.  Deputy Barry declared that tourism was endangered because of this measure.  But the 20p increase in the gallon of petrol does not add 1p a mile to the normal tourist costs here. I have done a little bit of research on this with car hire people and they tell me that 80 miles a day is the average mileage clocked up by a visitor to this country.  Can anybody seriously think that 80p a day extra will endanger our tourist industry?  When Deputy Barry had the responsibility for tourism I remember him advising us here in this House that we should not attract too many people to the country lest it dilute the quality of life here.  My thinking, expressed at that time, was that when numbers became a problem it would be time enough to worry about whether it would dilute the quality of life or not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright, speaking on the budget on budget evening, referred to the enormity of the increase in the price of petrol.  I feel it necessary to repeat some facts here that were given by the Taoiseach to the House regarding the increase and the comparison with the 15p per gallon imposed by Deputy Richie Ryan in 1974.  The 15p per gallon in 1974 would correspond to a 27p increase in 1980.  The 20p increase a gallon imposed recently now means that the tax element in the price of every gallon of petrol is 50 per cent whereas the increase of 15p in 1974 made the tax element 58 per cent.  So from a statistical point of view the honour of being the greatest arab of them all still remains with Deputy Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, before I finish dealing with tourism, let me refute the charges made <Col N="1208" /> by several speakers that 1979 was a disastrous year for tourism.  This is not so. In 1979 tourism brought in approximately £400 million from all sources.  In real terms this may have been a slight reduction on the previous year.  I can think of two matters that would have seriously affected the industry, the bad weather last year and the dastardly murder of Lord Mountbatten and others.  To have overcome these two setbacks and to break even cannot be termed a disaster. I believe that Board Fáilte and others involved in tourism deserve our highest commendation.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to mention that irresponsible statements in this House by Deputies who decry our country, our tourism, the cost of living, the transport system and our way of life are no help to Bord Fáilte in their efforts to attract visitors to our shores.  References were made here to Ireland as a &ldquo;banana republic&rdquo;.  I can understand that outsiders looking at a Government with 84 seats after the last election could be excused for thinking that voters had not much of a choice and they might not appreciate that we live in a Republic where a Government are democratically elected. We have enjoyed a system that has given us the most stable government in Europe in the past 50 years with possibly three exceptions.</P>
    <P>References were made by the Opposition in this debate to the plight of people travelling to work.  This must surely have been said with their tongue in their cheek.  During the term of office of the National Coalition&mdash;and the agony was prolonged to the bitter end for four-and-a-half years&mdash;the people wanted work but at the time of the final curtain on the National Coalition Government 116,000 people had no work.  Who worried about them and helped them on that occasion? Fianna Fáil did.  We gave that our first priority on resuming office.  It was our aim to get the country moving, to put people to work and to provide jobs for young people in order to give them a sense of purpose and restore their confidence. We succeeded in that priority.  In two years we reduced the number of unemployed <Col N="1209" /> by more than 30,000 and, at the same time, absorbed the young people coming onto the employment market. That was done at a time when more than six million people were unemployed throughout Europe.  We can be proud of what we did.</P>
    <P>Having coped with that problem and having dealt with their first priority. Fianna Fáil felt they had two major problems facing them in the 1980 budget.  The first was to spread the tax burden as equitably as possible and our second task was to ensure that the under-privileged in the community, the long-term social welfare recipients, widows, old age pensioners and others were adequately cushioned against inflation. Our aim was to help them to the limit of our resources.</P>
    <P>It can be said that the greatest changes were made with regard to taxation of married couples.  I commend the Minister on that brave, bold stroke which represents a new approach to income taxation.  The women of Ireland who stay at home full-time and look after their families will be forever grateful to the Minister.  Now every married couple, whether they depend on one income or have both parents working, have a double personal allowance.  This was the nicest news in all the budget &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; and it makes the heading in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 31 January look very foolish now.  The business editor is quoted in bold print as follows: &ldquo;Tax snub for stay-at-home wives.&rdquo;  If his forecasts in the business section are so far out I am sure punters like myself are very happy he is not the racing tipster. The new tax bands must bring relief to many hard-pressed PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister really excelled himself in his treatment of social welfare recipients. I have spoken to widows, old age pensioners, to mothers who look forward to children's allowance day and to handicapped people and I know they are very pleased with the increases granted in this area.  The hurlers on the ditch, happy in the knowledge that they do not have to deliver the goods, said a 20 per cent increase was necessary.  Pensioners <Col N="1210" /> old enough to remember a decrease from 11s. to 10s. wondered what the budget might bring for them.  It brought them an increase of 25 per cent although everyone thought such a figure was impossible. The old couple who will get an increase of £8.55p in their contributory pension are grateful to the Minister.  I know that some people will want to dam pen their spirits by telling them about the pending increases in the cost of living but the social welfare recipients know that the increases granted by the Minister has put them well ahead of the CPI.</P>
    <P>The short-term social welfare recipients with an increase of 20 per cent are doing very well also.  With regard to this category, although many people are inclined to criticise those who get unemployment or sickness benefit they should realise that the vast majority would work if they could.  They need our help and encouragement in their genuine need. However, there is a minority of parasites who draw social welfare benefit illegally while they have other sources of income. I hope they will be pursued relentlessly and brought to justice.  I am confident that the measures taken by the previous Minister and the present Minister will help in this regard.  Such people are a millstone around the neck of the social welfare system and they do not deserve any sympathy.  Abuses of the system will have to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I am sure that mothers who were gullible enough to believe the newspapers expected that children's allowances would get the chop.  What did Fianna Fáil do? We increased the allowance substantially. An extra £9 million has been allocated for 1980 and £18 million for 1981.  That is the result.  I am confident that the most needy will realise that the party who gave such social welfare benefits and allowances are the party with the true social conscience.  The people realise that talk is cheap when a party are in opposition.  They know that Fianna Fáil are the people who came up with the goods.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows better than Fianna Fáil what agriculture means to Ireland. We campaigned forcefully for our entry <Col N="1211" /> to the EEC in the knowledge that farming would benefit greatly and we have been proved correct.  Since the foundation of the State Fianna Fáil have proved to be the true champions of the agricultural sector and since our entry into the EEC the Fianna Fáil arm in the European Parliament&mdash;the European Progressive Democrats&mdash;have fought the case for the best farm deal for Ireland.  Our new Minister continues to fight that case in his work against the super levy and I am confident he will be successful.  It is nice to see the whole country united in their opposition to the levy, with all sectors putting the good of the country first.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has decided to pursue a system of tax on farm profits.  That is the only equitable system of taxation and I believe farmers are prepared to pay tax on their profits and on their accounts.  If a farmer does not make a profit he will not pay tax but if he makes a large profit he will pay a large amount of tax.  If this system is carried to its logical conclusion it should remove any cause for a rift between sections of the community and help all of us to work together for a better Ireland.</P>
    <P>The removal of the notional system, the leniency extended to farmers entering the tax system for the first time, the simplified system of determining tax, the promise of assistance to those in need of help in completing their forms and above all the fact that the thresholds for tax will not be reduced for three years must remove the fear of the unknown from the minds of the farmers and help them to plan ahead.  I know there will be growls about the resource tax which will apply to all farmers with a rateable valuation of £70&mdash;the charge will be £3.50 per acre&mdash;but most people realise that such a tax is necessary.  The £7 million it will bring into the coffers will not be an intolerable burden.  I am sure the Minister will be better able to review the situation when the whole tax package for farmers has been working for three years and when it can be seen to be equitable and effective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> At this time throughout the country county councils are dealing with their estimates and they are striking a rate.  I spent 12 years as a member of Kildare County Council and I saw the two sides of the coin.  I remember when we decided our rate and did the amount of work we were prepared to finance.  The percentage increase was never more than 8 or 9 per cent.  Great pruning was done on the estimates before they were accepted. That was to illustrate the interest of the members of the council on behalf of the ratepayers.  Then Fianna Fáil removed rates on private dwellings and, in the main, local authority expenditure is now financed from central funds.  Immediately the attitude of many local authority members changed.  A 10 per cent increase, a 13 per cent increase or even in actual terms possibly a 16 per cent increase was no longer acceptable. Demands were made in some cases for an increase of 30 per cent.  Those who settled for bacon and cabbage when they had to foot the bill themselves now want caviare, it would appear, when others pick up the tariff.  A little realism is called for.</P>
    <P>I read in the estimates for Kildare County Council for 1980 a statement by the county manager, which I quote:</P>
    <P>At the outset I must stress that it has been a very difficult task, an almost impossible one, for me to prepare these estimates in line with the guidelines issued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I read on to discover that the estimates showed an increase of 13 per cent on last year's money.  I can hardly be blamed for thinking that the name &ldquo;county manager&rdquo;, if it means anything, should mean that the primary duty of that official is to manage and that to admit an inability to perform that primary task is very sad indeed. I repeat what I have already stated at county council level, that the amount of money that you have to spend at county council level is very important.  More important still is the manner in which that money is spent. First, we should examine how we spend our allowance and ask ourselves if we <Col N="1213" /> get full value for every punt allowed to us and if the supervision is such that we make the very best possible use of the resources, financial and material, available to us.  If, when we have done that, at the end of the year we can say truly that we could not have done better with the resources available, then we might have a case for looking for more. At least we should first try the remedy that I suggest.</P>
    <P>Many people in Kildare have been critical of house repairs.  The following facts should be very revealing.  In 1970-71 the total budget for house repairs in the country was £5,500.  In 1975-76 the budget was £14,000.  Deputy Bermingham will remember that period because his colleague, Deputy Tully, was in charge of the purse strings on that occasion. In 1978-79 the budget was £68,000 and this year the allocation is £90,000.  These figures that I have quoted will cast doubts on the purity of the motives of those who will not agree to strike a rate but who, for the cosmetics of politics, like to muddy the waters a little by referring these rates back to the Minister.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the capital programme and the cutbacks of which we are accused.  We have allocated £1,154 million for our capital programme, which is an increase of 15 per cent on the 1979 figure.</P>
    <P>I would like now to make reference to my own Department and to some matters for which I have responsibility and let the House know the situation with regard to these matters.  First, let me deal with forestry.  The State afforestation programme is being continued in a planned, progressive way and adequate funds have been provided this year to achieve this.  The planting programme which we have continues and the current year's planting programme is very well advanced with a total area of 17,000 acres to be planted this year.  This acreage is conditioned by two factors.  One is the difficulty of acquiring land for forestry.  We have also the uneven distribution pattern of the existing reserves of plantable land. As far as the last matter is concerned, 60 <Col N="1214" /> per cent of the available reserve of land for planting now lies in five counties and prudent planning must limit the area to be planted in any one location to ensure stability of employment, an acceptable regime of management and ultimately a continuing supply of wood for the timber industry.</P>
    <P>Difficulties are still being encountered in land acquisition, first of all because of the great increase in land prices and secondly by a reluctance among landowners to sell.  This is causing a problem in relation to the reserve of land available for planting in future years.  Because of the carry-over from 1979 of the balance of the grant-in-aid for land acquisition, a sum of £1.7 million, the funds available for land acquisition this year amount to £2.6 million and are the highest ever.  By way of comparison, expenditure for the past three years was as follows: in 1977, £441,000 was spent: in 1978, £776,000; and in 1979, £.5 million provisional. Every effort will be made to use available funds to secure an increasing supply of land for our afforestation programme.  Recently I visited a forest and I asked a very experienced forester there what message he would like to give to a recruit like myself to take away with me.  He said: &ldquo;I would like that you would make people see that there should be no conflict between the agricultural and forestry sectors.  They should complement each other, and it is only a question of the proper usage of land.&rdquo;  It would be nice if that message could be conveyed to all and they would accept it.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with wildlife conservation.  I am glad to say that the funds provided for this year under the heading of land acquisition include funds for the acquisition of land for wildlife conservation purposes.  I stress the importance of co-operation between the public and private sectors in wildlife conservation.  Anything that Deputies can do to foster this co-operation would be very welcome. I must acknowledge the contribution made by the media, the press, radio and television, in treating this subject and <Col N="1215" /> creating greater public awareness of the need to conserve wildlife in natural habitats.  I would like to express appreciation for the co-operation and assistance which my Department have received from other State agencies such as the Office of Public Works, local authorities.  Bord na Móna and the Garda Síochána in connection with various aspects of wildlife conservation and the programme we have.  I am confident that the recent appointment of 20 wildlife rangers and the prospective appointment of a further 30 will help considerably in enforcing the Wildlife Act and also in public education in matters of conservation.  I assure the House of continued dedication by my Department to the conservation of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>With regard to forest development, it must be realised that as more forests reach maturity there is a greater need for better roads for harvesting purposes. This situation also gives rise to an improvement in our mechanical fleet, especially the road making plant and the harvesting equipment.  With this in mind the overall provision for roads and machinery this year amounts to £4.8 million compared to £3.5 million last year.  That represents an increase of 37 per cent.</P>
    <P>The EEC draft measures for the improvement of agricultural structures in the less favoured areas in the west include some proposals to assist forestry in these areas.  The package is still under consideration and it is too early to know the outcome of the forestry element of the proposals in terms of either private or state afforestation but we are hopeful.</P>
    <P>In relation to private planting, recently the grants were revised and substantially increased.  The new grant level fixed is £125 per acre and that compares with £90 per acre up to this.  The period over which such grants are paid has been reduced from 10 to 8 years.  The additional grants provided for planting broad leaf species and for poplar planting have also been increased.  As well as that, my Department will continue <Col N="1216" /> tinue to give expert advice free of charge. I hope that the revised scheme will prove attractive and will bring about a better response to private planting than has been the case in the past.  The full impact of these new proposals will not become apparent until the next planting season gets under way, and we have made financial provision in this year's estimates to cover any costs that may arise with regard to private planting.</P>
    <P>In relation to timber sales, changes in management techniques at our State forests particularly in relation to the rotation length will enable my Department to increase the supply of saw log timber over the next five years by 50 per cent.  This means that in the saw log field, the expansion of our existing mills and some new saw milling capacity can be brought forward by a number of years.  The IDA in consultation with my Department have developed a policy for the grant-aiding of such expansions and new industries.</P>
    <P>Our joint aim is to upgrade home grown timber so that it will take its legitimate place on the market and replace some of the imported construction timber at present used.  About 80 per cent of our construction needs are provided for by imported timber and we hope to correct that imbalance.  There has been no shortage of proposals for the utilisation of this additional saw log material and they far exceed the supply available.  Regrettably, we have problems in relation to how we would utilise our pulp wood, but the IDA in co-operation with the Department are making an allout effort to interest potential processors in setting up their mills here and there have been a number of inquiries.  It is planned to achieve an income from timber sales this year in excess of £6 million. I mentioned the position in relation to the marketing of wood from our State forests and the position in regard to saw log is of course the end product of the operation, and that is very satisfactory. The present problems in relation to the role of pulp wood will be overcome.</P>
    <P>We live in a world of dwindling natural resources but wood is fortunately <Col N="1217" /> a renewable and very versatile resource.  Its uses, apart for construction, furnishing and packaging include the provision of energy and chemicals.  All available forecasts indicate that there will be a world shortage of wood.  This is particularly true in the case of the EEC where wood represents an import bill second only to oil.  We need to be self-sufficient in wood and if we could ensure a surplus for export, the beneficial effects of it would be very obvious.</P>
    <P>There have always been cyclical upsets in the wood market and the present one dervies from the oil crisis.  There is no doubt that it will be rectified and there is no need for panic because of the temporary problems in the pulp wood sector.  I have no doubt as to the overall national benefits of the afforestation programme and the Government propose to keep faith with the industry and press forward with the full development of our resources.</P>
    <P>Investment in forestry is an act of faith in the future.  When one invests money in a project with a 35 to 50-year cycle one must be patient and must be prepared to wait.  Those who invested in our State forests were sturdy pioneers with long-term views.  They were never swayed by the obstacles which appeared and disappeared in their time and their foresight is of great benefit to us today. We have our short-term difficulties but they will be overcome.  We must work on our programme, acquiring and planting land, thinning, felling and start again and show our confidence in the future of our forests.  Níl deireadh na coillte ar lár agus ní bheidh coiche.</P>

    </P>
    <P>In relation to fisheries, since the Government took office in 1977 there has been a very steady progress in the development and expansion of our fishing industry, and the value of sea fish landings, excluding salmon, increased from £18.7 million in 1977 to £24.6 million in 1979.  During the same period the value of salmon landings increased from £4.6 million to £5.2 million and the value of exports of fish and fishery <Col N="1218" /> products increased from £27.4 million in 1977 to over £31 million in 1978.  The figures available for portion of 1979 indicate that the return for that year will be substantially in excess of the previous one.  Direct employment in the fishing industry expanded from 8,179 in 1977 to 8,620 in 1978, the latest year for which figures are available.</P>
    <P>Since 1977, State investment in the development of our fisheries has increased substantially.  In 1977 total expenditure amounted to £7.4 million; this increased to £9.7 million in 1978 and to £11.3 million in 1979.  The Exchequer allocation to fisheries in 1980 amounts to £16.7 million&mdash;this in a year when areas of State investment have to prove themselves more than ever before.  While the total allocation for the 1980 Public Capital Programme shows an increase of 15.3 per cent on the outturn for 1979, the capital allocation for fisheries has been increased by 84 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>This is a clear indication of the Government's confidence in the future of our fishing industry.  This confidence is reinforced by the fishermen, who in the final analysis constitute the most reliable barometer of the prospects ahead.  At the moment there are fishing vessels in course of construction, each costing more than £2 millions, for five of our most successful and enterprising skippers.</P>
    <P>In relation to grants for fishing boats and mariculture, the capital provision for 1980 to enable Bord Iascaigh Mhara to provide grants for fishing vessels and for suitable mariculture projects amounts to £5 million which represents an increase of 66? per cent on the 1979 outturn. Apart from the five large trawlers to which I have already referred, grants will also be provided for medium-size and small vessels joining the fleet.  These additions will, it is expected, expand our landings, thereby contributing to the growth of our fish processing factories, and should bring about increased employment in the fleet and ashore.</P>
    <P>These grants, up to 30 per cent of the capital cost, for mariculture projects should provide the necessary incentive <Col N="1219" /> for the development of this very expanding sector of our fishing industry. The development, must, however, be on a planned and co-ordinated basis covering capital grants, research, disease control, training and marketing.  The National Board for Science and Technology, in consultation with my Department, are finalising a mariculture development programme designed to ensure orderly development of fish farming. My Department's research programme and fish pathology unit is being expanded to cater for the needs of sea and inland fish farming.  Promoters of fish farming projects can be assured of the full co-operation of the Department and of BIM in formulating proposals.  I would advise promoters to avail themselves fully of the expertise that is available because of the many technical and marketing difficulties that can arise.</P>
    <P>I listened to a discussion today with regard to harbours and I should like to tell the House that an allocation of £3 million has been made in the capital budget for 1980 in respect of fishery harbour works.  This compares with an outturn of £1.6 million last year.  The provision of £3 million is earmarked mainly for the major works that are in progress at Howth since August 1979, the provision of an auction hall and other works at Killybegs, and works at Rossaveal, Castletownbere, Caherciveen, Greencastle and a number of less important landing places.  These works are designed to improve the efficiency and profitability of our fishery operations.</P>
    <P>I believe that the need for fishery research is now greater than ever.  We have increased considerably in recent years the strength of the scientific staff and a new fisheries research centre has been provided.  We have stepped up considerably our research into the Celtic Sea herring stocks and as a result of these investigations we will have much greater knowledge about the state of these stocks than heretofore.  While the results of the recent investigations are still being assessed, the signs are encouraging and I <Col N="1220" /> am hopeful that an early reopening of this fishery may be possible at least on a limited scale.  Our research programme has, however, been severely handicapped by the absence of a suitable research vessel.  Steps have now been taken to remedy this situation.  We are in the process of finalising negotiations for the construction of a new fisheries research vessel to be built in Ireland to a Norwegian design at a cost of approximately £3 million.  Here again the necessary finances have been provided because the Government recognise the importance of fisheries research.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the EEC has so far failed to reach agreement on a revised common fisheries policy. However, considerable progress has been made in recent months, including agreement on a total allowable catch system for 1980, and I am hopeful of a final package being agreed by the end of the year.  The Government's position in regard to a final agreement is well known: we will be seeking to get the best possible deal for Irish fishermen.  Despite the lack of agreement on overall policy we have in the past two years succeeded in getting confirmation of the acceptance by the Community of our special position as a developing country in the fishery context.  This was reflected in the FEOGA grant schemes in 1978 and 1979 for fishing boats and mariculture under which Ireland got special treatment. This was reflected also in the approval of a grant of £30 million for the expansion of our fishery protection service. This EEC assistance, coupled with national expenditure, has contributed considerably to the development of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written recently about the question of fish prices and I should like to state that the EEC withdrawal system has also helped the industry in Ireland by providing a floor price for all marketable fish landed. Financial compensation from the EEC for fish withdrawn from market in 1979 reached the not insignificant figure of £280,000.  In addition export subsidies, particularly on frozen mackerel, have <Col N="1221" /> enabled our exporters to compete on third country markets and pay an economic price for fish which would not otherwise have been disposed of for human consumption.  I am aware of the concern in the industry about the fall in the level of demand and prices for fish which are said to be due to increased imports from third countries.  This is a problem which must be solved at Community level and the matter has already been raised with the Community institutions involved.  I will continue to press for an early and satisfactory solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>In the marketing processing sector 30 projects incorporating either new fish processing plants or extensions to existing ones were completed or approved for grants since July 1977 up to December of last year.  This has involved an outlay of more than £5 million and included State grant assistance totalling almost £2 million and FEOGA grants totalling more than £300,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to our inland fisheries.  In this regard the most significant event for many years is the Fisheries Bill, 1979 which is now in its final stages of enactment and is expected to be enacted very soon.  This Bill, for which my predecessor deserves all the credit for its preparation and passage through this House&mdash;I publicly acknowledged his contribution when I had occasion to deal with the Bill shortly after my appointment&mdash;has as its objective the more effective development, protection and strengthening of the existing administrative structure to meet the demands of today.  This will be done by replacing the existing 17 boards of conservators who are responsible for the day-to-day work of conservation and protection of inland fisheries and the Inland Fisheries Trust, who conduct large scale development work on brown trout, coarse fish and sea angling, by a Central Fisheries Board and seven regional fisheries boards.  The functions of the new central board and regional boards are set out in detail in the Bill and emphasise the importance of developing and exploiting nationally our country's <Col N="1222" /> salmon, coarse fish, eel and sea angling resources.  I expect that this imaginative new legislation will release a fresh dynamism into every aspect of our inland fisheries and so meet the urgent need of our times to ensure that those fishery resources are developed and utilised fully for the economic and personal welfare our our people.</P>
    <P>For my part, as the Minister responsible for fisheries, I shall keep under close review the progress of the new arrangements and, in accordance with the new Act, I shall direct matters as I see fit. The moneys necessary to finance the new central board and regional boards will be derived from the usual revenue sources of salmon fishing licence duties and fishery rates&mdash;as well as from new registration fees to be paid by brown trout and coarse fish anglers and sea anglers and a levy on salmon sales.  In addition, I have provided in my Department's financial estimates for 1980 the sum of more than £1 million in the Salmon Conservancy Fund to meet initial costs of launching the new central board and regional boards&mdash;including for the first time the appointment of a full-time chief officer of each board&mdash;and to subvent as necessary the income of the boards in carrying out their statutory functions.  This compares with £1.043 million which was allocated to the Salmon Conservancy Fund in 1979 to cover a 15-month period as against the 12 months of 1980 now provided for.</P>
    <P>I have also provided more than £1 million by way of grant-in-aid to the Inland Fisheries Trust.  The trust will be dissolved as a separate entity in its own right when the new Fisheries Act comes into being and will be absorbed into the new inland fishery administrative structure. Hopefully, the good work will continue under the new regime.  The trust's grant-in-aid for 1980 will be utilised to supplement the grant to the Salmon Conservancy Fund.</P>
    <P>I must add also that the opportunity was taken in the Bill to tighten existing fisheries conservation legislation by suitable amendments in the light of the <Col N="1223" /> knowledge and experience gained during many years and, in particular, the penalties for fishery offences are increased significantly, including the forfeiture of a salmon fishing licence in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The serious decline in the salmon stocks in our coastal and inland waters in recent years continues to be a matter of major concern in my Department. With a view to improving matters additional stringent conservation measures were introduced in 1979 which reduced the length of the salmon fishing season, increased the weekly close time from two days to three days, limited the maximum size of boat which may engage in commercial salmon fishing and standardised the depth of drift net throughout the country.  The purpose of these measures is to ensure the escapement of increased numbers of salmon up river to the spawning beds.  Having reviewed the 1979 salmon fishing season, during which, I am glad to say, we had a much improved escapement of spawning salmon to the nursery streams, I intend to continue to operate those salmon conservation measures in 1980, subject only to altering the three-day weekly close time so as to allow fishing on Monday instead of on Friday.  This was requested by the fishermen because of the difficulty being experienced in respect of marketing fish caught on Fridays.</P>
    <P>As to the protection of our valuable salmon fisheries, I am arranging again this year, with the agreement of the Minister for Defence, for the Naval Service to assist the boards in protecting our salmon fisheries at sea.  In this connection also I am very pleased to say that my Department have provided three additional modern patrol boats for the Cork, Limerick and Galway boards of conservators and that the provision of a fourth new patrol boat for the Kerry board is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>While I am hopeful that these salmon fishery protection measures will help substantially to combat illegal salmon fishing, I would take this opportunity to urge in the strongest terms our salmon <Col N="1224" /> fishermen to co-operate fully with my Department and with the boards in protecting our precious stocks of salmon by complying with the fishery laws, which are designed to ensure the continuation of our great heritage of salmon fishing which has existed for thousands of years but which is now in real danger of extinction due to the greed of some fishermen.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that the construction of the extension to the salmon hatchery at Cong, County Mayo, is progressing satisfactorily.  The purpose of this extension is to permit the rearing of young salmon to the smolt stage&mdash;about two years old&mdash;before liberating them into suitable waters.  The release of such more mature young salmon for restocking purposes will enhance greatly their prospects of survival to adult stage.  This hatchery extension will cost about £125,000, which is provided for in the Salmon Conservancy Fund, and it is hoped that it will be in operation in time for the next salmon hatching season about October next.  As well, the salmon hatchery at Virginia, County Cavan, which was opened by my predecessor in 1978, is now in full operation.  A further worthwhile development in salmon fishery research is the acquisition by my Department at a cost of just £12,000 of a new type of magnetic fish tagging machine which enables the tagging of very small fish. The machine was first used to tag the entire 1979 produce of salmon in the Virginia hatchery prior to their release.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise, however, that artificial salmon propagation of this nature can only supplement to a very limited extent the natural propagation of the species.  That can only take place by our fishermen allowing sufficient numbers of salmon to escape and so reach the natural spawning beds which we are so fortunate to possess.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the Government approved the purchase of the famous Galway Fishery by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for a sum of £200,000.  We are very pleased with the results of the past two years and are confident <Col N="1225" /> of continued success.  The commercial operation of the fishery has resulted in a surplus of almost £100,000 during the two years.  In addition, the Department are carrying out valuable scientific studies at the fishery and conservation measures introduced have resulted in larger numbers of salmon appearing in the upper reaches of the Corrib for spawning purposes.  This should be of major benefit to the whole Corrib system.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for the transfer of the Burrishoole Fishery at Newport, County Mayo by Messrs. Guinness Limited to the Salmon Research Trust of Ireland Incorporated. My Department have agreed to make a substantial increased contribution to the trust by meeting half the cost of the more intensive research programme which will make a valuable contribution to the conservation and development of our salmon stocks.  The cost of the programme will be in the region of £80,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that these plans and activities indicate the Government's high priority for our sea and inland fisheries and I pledge myself to making every effort to ensure the wellbeing and prosperity of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo buíochas a ghabháil don Aire Airgeadais as ucht an méid a rinne sé chun cabhrú leis an Ghaeilge.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfar deaobair leis an £100,000 a thug sé chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When the Coalition left office in July 1977, the economy was sound and was growing.  The growth rate had reached 5 per cent, more than double what it is this year, a situation that put us at the top of the EEC league.  Investment in 1977 was described as dynamic.  In 1976 our exports had exceeded the £2 billion mark and they were growing.  In 1977 they increased by a further 35 per cent.  This brought them to an unprecedented high level.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter of 1977 employment in industry was 6,500 greater than was the case one year earlier.  Industry generally was doing very well.  In the first quarter of 1977 output was 8 per cent greater than had been the case in the previous year.  The economy was described then as being flourishing, as having the sort of foundation on which we could build assuming that we managed our affairs properly.</P>
      <P>That brief synopsis is not based on figures that I have produced.  It does not represent my view of the performance of the economy in 1976 and in the first half of 1977.  Rather, that description of the economy is taken from a speech made in this House by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, on 14 December 1977 and as reported at columns 1361-2 of the Official Report for that day.  I could put that column and a half on the record but as it is already on record it would suffice for me to refer to the then Taoiseach's speech and to describe it as an assertion that the economy was sound and presented a foundation on which we could build.</P>
      <P>Five months after the change of Government, after the then Taoiseach had an opportunity of examining the records of borrowing and so on the performance of the economy was an open book to him and to everybody else.  His summary was that this was the sort of foundation on which we could build if we managed our affairs properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a testimony to the manner in which the National Coalition brought the country through the 1974-75 recession, a recession brought about largely <Col N="1227" /> by an oil crisis.  The difference between that old crisis and the recent oil crisis is that the former was new, unexpected, had not occurred before, had come like a bolt from the blue and no notice of its coming had been served.  The National Coalition dealt with it and at the end of that recession the then Taoiseach, Deputy J. Lynch, said the economy was a sound foundation on which to build. The recent oil crisis should have been expected. Only two or three years had passed since the first crisis ended.  The international situation in the oil producing countries should have been apparent to the present Government, but they ignored it and gambled.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry told us this budget was heralded with unprecedented speculation as to the type of budget it would be.  It was predicted to be a hairshirt budget.  It was not the political or economic commentators in the media who described the economy as being in a critical condition. The Taoiseach went on the media and said that as a nation we were borrowing far too much; as a nation we were spending recklessly beyond our capacity; as a nation we were letting our balance of payments run amok.  He was perfectly correct when he said our balance of payments was at an intolerably unacceptable level, that our borrowing was massively too high and that our budget deficit could no longer be tolerated.</P>
    <P>For the year 1979 our adverse balance of trade was £800 million or thereabouts.  In other words, as a nation we were spending about £800 million more than we were earning.  We were borrowing massively beyond our means. We budgeted for a borrowing of 10.5 per cent of our GNP in 1979 and we borrowed almost 14 per cent.  In that year we budgeted for a current deficit of something like £250 million but we ran a deficit of £223 million more than we budgeted.</P>
    <P>Let me ask a question.  What happened to the economy between July 1977, when Deputy J. Lynch painted <Col N="1228" /> such a glowing and acceptable picture, and the shambles in which we found it at the end of 1979?  The answer is that the Fianna Fáil Government borrowed massively, and they are still borrowing massively, for the wrong purposes.  They borrowed to pay for the votes they purchased in the 1977 General Election. It is wise to borrow for productive purposes. One borrows money to buy land and, if good use is made of that land, it is a wise investment.  If a herd is stricken with disease and has to be replaced, a person must borrow for that purpose.  If an insured house is burned, a man borrows to get another house and works harder to repay it.  A wise man does not borrow money with which to go to Cheltenham races or to take a holiday at the other end of the earth or to purchase expensive clothes for his wife.  That is what Fianna Fáil have done.  The man who borrows money to take him to Cheltenham is not any more recklessly extravagant than Fianna Fáil who borrowed money to relieve taxes and to pay current expenses.  That is why we now find ourselves in the financial mess described by the former Taoiseach speaking in this House on the economic situation on 14 December 1977.  He said:</P>
    <P>This is the sort of foundation on which we can build if we manage our affairs properly.</P>
    <P>The then Taoiseach was aided and abetted by the present Taoiseach and by the Minister for Finance who were members of his Cabinet at that time.  He was aided and abetted by ten members of the present Cabinet, and they proceeded to run the country foolishly in an extravagant manner instead of properly as the former Taoiseach had advised.  The result is that our annual national borrowing stands at 14 per cent of GNP, that our balance of trade is £800 million in the red and that our budget deficit for 1979 was £233 million more than what was estimated in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>That is a sorry tale for the country. Now we have a budget which some people have described as inevitable, meaning that its taxation provisions were inevitable. <Col N="1229" /> If they were inevitable it is because of the foolish management of the economy between July 1977 and the end of last year, and the people are now asked to pay for that.</P>
    <P>What will this budget do for the country? It is common case that the first thing it will do will be to increase the cost of living by 5 per cent.  The leader of Fine Gael has said it will increase the cost of living by 6 per cent.  Last year Deputy Fitzgerald was correct in his analysis of the 1979 Budget when he said that inflation could not be kept at 9 per cent, that it would be 15 per cent.  He said that borrowing could not be kept at 10.5 per cent, and I imagine he will be right this year when he said this budget will increase the cost of living by 6 per cent.  It is common case that the budget will put up inflation to 20 per cent and the probability is that inflation will rise to 22 per cent.  If it does, we will be at the head of the European league, not as we were in 1976 and 1977 for economic growth but for our inflation growth.  The only doubt about our place in the league is whether we will be beaten by or be below our neighbours in the UK.  That is what this budget will do.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to get down our balance of payments and one way to do it is to curb imports.  We are not complete masters of our own house in this respect, because if we are to develop as an industrial nation and attain full employment we must import raw materials and other things.  Another way in which we can cut down our adverse balance of payments is by becoming competitive as an industrial manufacturing nation and to be able to export as keen competitors in the markets available to us.</P>
    <P>However, this budget will make us less competitive.  It will drive up wages.  In the taxation side of the budget there are taxes on petrol, alcohol and cigarettes, all designed to drive up wages.  If wages are driven up our production costs will increase and the result will be that we will be less competitive on world markets.</P>
    <P>One would have thought, at a time when oil prices are being increased <Col N="1230" /> anyway because of things beyond our control, that we would try to keep the prices stable, but here we add 20p on the gallon.  This will add to our production costs and it will percolate through the economy.  In this island our railway system is minimal.  Indeed there are entire areas without a railway system at all. We therefore must depend on oil to convey our imported raw materials from the ports to the places of manufacture and our manufactured goods to our own markets and to the ports for export.  We must depend on oil to drive the manufacturing machine.  Yet we are imposing a tax on that oil.  We have seen the direct result of that within days of the budget, with the cost of town gas being driven up nearly 9 per cent.  If that is an example of what is to come it is evident that the effects of the tax on petrol and oil will be nothing short of absolute disaster.</P>
    <P>The pretence that this tax on oil will in some way correct our balance of payments is absolute nonsense, what I might describe as double-barrel nonsense, when we see that the Minister estimates a revenue from the tax imposed on oil of £113 million.  When we were dealing here with the resolution imposing that tax I asked the Taoiseach what was the figure the Revenue Commissioners had estimated for the saving on the import of oil that this tax would bring about.  It took some little pressure to get a figure from the Taoiseach, although he had a figure in his hand, but eventually he said about 2 per cent.  My interpretation of that is that the figure the Taoiseach has been given is somewhere between 1 per cent and 2 per cent, rounded off by him to 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the tax on oil will do nothing to reduce the amount of oil imported.  It is equally certain and clear that the tax on petrol will put up wages.  Surely civil servants, local government officials, Members of this House or anybody else entitled to travelling expenses will not get by with the same rate of travelling expenses they enjoyed last week before the budget.  Of course, they will not.  Of course, there will be demands for increased travelling <Col N="1231" /> expenses, for increased wages to cover the additional costs involved travelling to and from places of employment.  It is now common knowledge in this country that many people are opting to live several miles from their place of work because sites for houses are cheaper some miles from built-up areas.  In this respect the differential in the price of a site for a house could be as much as £3,000.  Therefore, people are opting to live in rural Ireland, and that is a good thing.  But this budget will make it much more expensive on those people to get to work and they will have to be compensated accordingly by increased wages. That is nothing more or less than commonsense.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the transportation of raw materials and manufactured goods.  In my constituency, the large one of Monaghan-Cavan, there is not one mile of railway line.  Everything has to be hauled and conveyed by oil power.  Then we are told that this is a discretionary tax.  I shall deal with that in greater detail later.  On top of that there is the added cost of driving the machinery that manufactures the goods.  I wonder do our people realise that this budget proposes to drive up further the cost of electricity, because the tax of 5 per cent on oil will have to be paid by the ESB and they are obliged to pay their way by the statute under which they operate.  Of course, the massive increase from 20 per cent to 36 per cent sought by them, and sanctioned within the last few weeks, will now be augmented by a further increase. I can only describe the tax on petrol and on the oil that drives lorries and machinery as crazy.  I can forsee Deputies running in here to say to me that the former Minister for Finance imposed a tax on petrol.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> He did.  We will come to the car tax later.  He did tax petrol but at least that tax was imposed on petrol in the pre-Manifesto days&mdash;&mdash;a document <Col N="1232" /> Deputy Leyden described as &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and he is on the record of this House as so saying.  It was a cynical performance to tell our young people in 1977 that the cost of motoring would be reduced, that they would not have to pay tax on a motor car when, approximately two-and-a-half years later, to replace that tax of between £30 million and £40 million collected on petrol, there is imposed a tax of £113 million on petrol and oil and we have also the reintroduction of motor taxation.  That is what they have done. They commenced at £5 per car up to 16 h.p., which has now gone up to £10 per car up to 16 h.p.  It is difficult to break down the £113 million extra tax between motor cars, lorries and machinery, but there is no doubt that cars up to 16 h.p. are now paying much more in petrol tax than they were in motor taxation.  On top of that there is a tax of £10 a year, which constitutes a substantial portion of the former motor taxation.  This is absolutely crazy.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt in some measure with the tax on alcohol and cigarettes.  I want to place on record again that in my opinion these three taxes&mdash;the tax on private motorists, on alcohol and on cigarettes&mdash;will generate a demand for wages which cannot be resisted. It is foolish in the extreme to describe these taxes as discretionary.  It could be said that tax on alcohol and cigarettes is discretionary if as a nation we were people with iron wills but we are not.  Experience shows that and the Revenue Commissioners know that the falling off in the consumption of these items will not be substantial as it has not been in the past.  It is foolish to call in any shape or form a tax on motor cars in a country where the motor car is now as much an everyday necessity as the bicycle was 20 years ago a discretionary tax.  Virtually the only means of travel is the motor car. The railway in Dublin, from Harcourt Street to Bray, has been pulled up and in Monaghan and Cavan there is no railway left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a bus service run by CIE: buses which are obsolete, timetables <Col N="1233" /> which are entirely unacceptable and prices which are excessive.  Petrol to propel the motor car as a means of travel is an absolute necessity.  In relation to the tax on cars and to the manifesto we have a very young population and 50 per cent of them at the next election will be under 25 years of age.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We are dealing with a young population and we should not turn them into cynics or encourage them to regard all politicians as untrustworthy people whose word cannot be taken, or to regard the profession of politics as a doubtful business and to run down democracy.  That is what people who fight a general election campaign on the basis that they will make motoring cheaper and take the tax off motor cars are doing.  Before they had settled down in office they came along and increased enormously the cost of petrol and put up the cost of motoring over what it was. This is not something that they can get away with by saying that they did not know about it because that historical document, the manifesto, was introduced. It seemed an attractive proposal at first sight to remove tax from motor cars.  When it was announced everybody said, &ldquo;Ah, they will put a tax on petrol&rdquo;.  Of course, Fianna Fáil were not having any of that.  They were in the election business then.  They sent the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, into print to give a solemn assurance that petrol would not be taxed.  The print was hardly dry on the papers that carried the warning that petrol would be taxed when Deputy Lynch was sent out <Col N="1234" /> by the present Taoiseach, Deputy O'Donoghue and the rest of the Cabinet to give a solemn assurance to the people that it would not.  How can young people treat politicians seriously or with any respect if they act as Fianna Fáil have in regard to the promises they gave in regard to reducing the cost of motor tax and in regard to the promise Deputy Lynch was sent out to give that petrol would not be taxed?  That is the difference between Deputy Richie Ryan's performance and that of the present Minister for Finance.  If Deputy Leyden proposes to deal with it I invite him to do so in that context.</P>
      <P>This budget will destroy confidence in the economy and will frighten the industrial and agricultural sectors into not investing money.  This kind of stop-go economy which Fianna Fáil are so fond of is bad for the country.  The agricultural sector were given assurances publicly by Fianna Fáil that the notional system of taxation would be retained but privately and in the door to door canvass they were assured that all they had to do was elect a Fianna Fáil Government and farmers would disappear overnight just like the Garda Commissioner whom they promised to get rid of, too. That was the assurance they gave.  They are now back in power and have brought thousands more farmers into the income tax net.  The threshold is reduced from £75 valuation to £40 valuation.  The notional system has been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural grant has been reduced.  In 1978 the agricultural grant was reduced to £75 and in 1979 it was reduced to £60, the Government saving £7 million in 1978 and an additional £2 million in 1979.  This year, bang it goes down to £40.  A man who paid approximately £200 rates on a £40 valuation in 1979 will be paying approximately £500 in 1980.  He will be told by the Fianna Fáil Deputies that he can deduct that from his income tax.  He can, if he is liable for income tax; but there will be many people in that bracket who, because they have large families, or because their accounts so show, will not be liable for income tax.  That taxpayer will pay the additional <Col N="1235" /> rate and cannot avoid it.  We were told by the Fianna Fáil Party that rates were an inequitable form of taxation which did not have regard to the capacity of the individual to pay.  We were also told by the Fianna Fáil Ministers who now hold office in this House, when they abolished house rates that there was no question of those rates being shifted to any other section of the rate-paying public.  That promise was made several times during the election campaign: that there was no question of shifting the burden of rates it removed from private houses to any other section of the community.  We find that the farming community, in addition to income tax, are now being asked to pay the full burden of rates on valuation, right down to £40 valuation.  In that way the Government are recouping a considerable amount of the rates which they removed from private houses.</P>
    <P>How can any section of the community, or any electorate, have respect for politicians who behave like that?  It is bad for the country and very bad for the form of democracy which we operate here, which, unless it is destroyed by a despicable performance like this, is, as yet, by far the best form of government that can be found.  It is being asked to stand up to many assaults like this.  And that is not the end of it, as far as the form of taxation is concerned which does not have regard to the earning capacity of the individual.  As far as agriculture is concerned, a resource tax has been introduced and that is another type of rates.  It is a rate of £3.50p on every £1 valuation, if the total valuation is £70.  What, in the name of goodness, is that but another form of rates?  There is no way of preventing that £3.50p becoming £7 next year.  Perhaps there is a promise made that that will stand for three years.  What good is a promise from this Fianna Fáil Party?  We had their promises about a tax on petrol.  We had their promises about tax on motor cars; we had their promises about not transferring rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> This budget is delivering a serious blow to democracy, is dealing a serious blow to politicians.  I like to think that politics is an honourable profession in which honourable people engage.  So much have I thought that, that I gave up a profession in which I practised for 25 years, to become a fulltime politician.  It is a sorry thing to see politicians being branded in this way and a party behaving in such a way as to bring discredit and ridicule on professional politicians and to hold them up as people who cannot be trusted, as people who go back on their word, as people who make promises to get into Government and immediately they get in will renege on these promises.  That is why I advise Deputy Leyden to be wary and careful about the manifesto.  He will have to call it something else.</P>
    <P>This budget will seriously damage another very important arm of our industry, the tourist industry.  We are not blessed with assured good weather.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We shall not go into that. We shall leave that alone.  We are not blessed in this country with very good weather.  A good summer is the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have suffered in the last ten years from the troubles which erupted in Northern Ireland and which have spilled over into here.  We have to carry the top weight of people insulting our best customers in the tourist business by burning down their embassy and murdering their most respected citizens.  We have to carry the burden of graffiti on walls or dering out of this country the very people we are spending millions to encourage <Col N="1237" /> in&mdash;a crazy performance.  In addition, this budget is going to put us at a disadvantage by increasing substantially the price of petrol.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry said somebody told him the other day that tourists used only about 80 gallons of petrol when they are here on their holidays.  Does not everybody know the way one is affected by the price of petrol?  He or she is told that petrol is very dear in such a country. That registers.  It has a psychological effect.  That is another reason for not going to that country.</P>
    <P>We have also increased substantially the price of drink.  Already the price of drink here, compared with the UK, was very high.  I can speak from firsthand knowledge of that in so far as last year was concerned.  We are putting tax on the price of drink, the price of smokes and the price of petrol, to discourage our biggest market.  1969 was our best tourist year.  Numbers went gradually down until 1972.  Then, from 1973 on numbers gradually improved, year by year.  Last year, it suffered another blow. As the Director General of Bord Fáilte has told us, our biggest blow was the decision by the British travel agents to change the venue for their annual conference from here to Mexico, or somewhere else.  Yet, we, as a nation are discouraging these people from coming here and in that way kicking our economy.  That is being foolish in the extreme.</P>
    <P>This budget gives about 20 per cent increase for the social welfare classes, and thank God for that.  They badly need it.  From my experience as a politician speaking to social welfare recipients day in day out, I am satisfied that the increase in social welfare demonstrates the research done by the Department of Social Welfare and shows the extent to which social welfare classes in the last couple of years have fallen behind and the trouble they had in making ends meet.  It also indicates the effect that the budget will have on the cost of living. About next October a discussion on the social welfare provisions of this budget would be more appropriate than now, <Col N="1238" /> because I believe that the bitter complaints I heard from old people depending on social welfare in past months about how hard it was to live will be re-echoed before the end of 1980.</P>
    <P>The other selling points that the Fianna Fáil Party are using to sell this budget are the income tax provisions, particularly the provision made for women who are working and married couples where the wife is not working.  It is better to be realistic about this.  The Government are simply making a virtue of necessity in so far as these provisions are concerned.  Mr. and Mrs. Murphy are now entitled to be assessed as two single people and for that they may thank not the Government but the Constitution, because the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court says that they are entitled as of constitutional right to be assessed as two single people.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance went on to say: &ldquo;But we extended that to the case where the wife was not working&rdquo;.  I say, and repeat without fear of contradiction, that any law student would know that what follows in the case of the working wife would follow in the case of the wife who has an income and is not working.  There is no way in which a differentiation can be obtained.  That decision of the Supreme Court will have very far-reaching effects on the rights of husband and wife.  It is probably unconstitutional to take the income of a wife into account when deciding whether her husband is entitled to a loan from the county council. I believe that only the means of the man applying for the loan can be taken into account.  I believe that when that issue is tested in some other court a decision will be handed down accordingly. Reaction to the Murphy case is only in its infancy.  The Government were wise to extend the concession to all husbands and wives because it was obvious that if they did not they would be dragged into court and compelled to do it.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that the economy was handed over in 1977 in a sound, healthy and going condition and <Col N="1239" /> Deputy Jack Lynch, the former Taoiseach is on record as having said that.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If Deputy Leyden wants to verify that I refer him to columns 1361 and 1362 of the Official Report of 14 December 1977.  He can read what Deputy Lynch had to say, the man who, with the manifesto, got Fianna Fáil elected in 1977.  The performance of Fianna Fáil in Government for the past two-and-a-half years has reduced our economy to a shambles compelling the Government to bring in this budget.  The result of it will be to increase the cost of living, to increase inflation, make us less competitive and worsen our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on the budget.  There has been wide recognition by all reasonable people of the value and quality of its provisions.  It is obvious that it had been carefully studied and worked out by the Government under the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  It was formulated by the Cabinet over a very long period.  The input into it from all sections is obviously advantageous to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, a former Government Minister, criticised the budget but made no contribution regarding its provisions.  I agree with him to some extent when he says that the public could be cynical; they could be cynical about Deputies like Deputy Fitzpatrick who, when a Minister in the Coalition Government, was party to the introduction of a major petrol price increase in 1976.  In that year's budget, introduced by Deputy R. Ryan, the petrol price was increased by approximately 15 per cent. This Government, after nearly three years in office, have introduced a similar provision in the present budget.  From <Col N="1240" /> 1977 until 1980 we did not increase the tax on petrol.</P>
    <P>This year, because of a shortage of supplies and the need for conservation, it was decided to increase the tax because of all the factors, particularly the external ones, which call the future of our supplies into question.  The Government decided to apply this tax so as to ensure that people will cut back on their demands, which in many cases are unnecessarily heavy, for petrol, diesel and gas.  That is a reasonable proposal.  Indeed, all reasonable people have generally welcomed the budget provisions and have accepted the need for this tax.  They accept the need to raise funds of this magnitude to help pay for the major social benefits and to bring in PAYE improvements which are all necessary and for which funds must be obtained in a way that will also give a national benefit because the less oil used the more benefit to the country.  This will certainly discourage much unnecessary driving.</P>
    <P>The improvement in PAYE will certainly compensate most couples for the increase in the price of petrol and liquid gas.  The lack of contribution by the Opposition over the last few days was interesting. Their spokesman on Finance, Deputy P. Barry, who spoke on radio and television, could only pick out of the budget the question of some potholes which he came across in some part of the country.  He must be travelling on different roads from what I am at the moment.  It was a very small contribution from the Opposition spokesman.  I would call him the Opposition spokesman for potholes because he seems to have got a lot of mileage out of them in the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>It is becoming quite evident that supplies of fuel throughout the world are very limited.  The political situation in the Middle East will certainly affect the availability of oil in the next few years.  It is vital that we adjust to changing times, when we will have less fuel in the years ahead.  Our only hope is to discover oil. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Energy said at the Fianna Fáil ArdFheis <Col N="1241" /> that, if it is there, we will get it. Fianna Fáil will certainly ensure that, if there is oil off the west coast, nothing will stop us getting it.  That is a commitment the Government have given and will honour.  Fianna Fáil will spare nothing in money and in technology to ensure that oil is brought ashore as quickly as possible.  It will be a major boost to the nation if we can bring oil in at a reasonable price to supply our needs.  It will give untold wealth to every section of the community.</P>
    <P>The Government gave many things in this budget.  This could be multiplied many times over if we had the finance available from native oil.  Our whole pattern of life would be changed if we could provide our own oil.  The Government, in the national interest, must ensure that demands for this very scarce commodity are curbed at the moment.  People must get smaller cars.  If they cannot afford to pay the increased price in petrol they must cut down on their demands.  People must minimise the many unnecessary spins they take at times.  I believe the public are now conscious of the future shortage of fuel and are making the necessary adjustments in their living habits.</P>
    <P>It is important also to consider the question of nuclear energy.  I believe that the decision, which will have to be taken inevitably, of whether or not to go nuclear is the major question of the eighties.  I welcome the decision by the Government, announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in 1979 and reiterated at the same venue in 1980, that there will be a public inquiry into all aspects of going nuclear and that an open mind will be kept by the Minister for Energy and by the Government in relation to this very important issue.  I have an open mind in regard to this matter and I will be following the developments of this public inquiry. It will acquaint the public of the dangers involved and the opportunities of going nuclear.  We will all have to give very careful thought to this matter, whatever the decision eventually is.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have an open mind in regard to this matter.  We have <Col N="1242" /> not given a clear decision in relation to it. We are awaiting the outcome of the public inquiry and the views of all the experts in relation to it.  The Government will give every consideration to the matter because it is a very serious issue.  It could affect the lives of our people for many generations to come.  There is no going back once that decision is made.  If the decision is made to go nuclear we will have to live with it.</P>
    <P>Young people throughout the country should take an interest in this matter. They should educate themselves in relation to nuclear energy.  Our educational system would be doing a good service for young people if they educated them in regard to energy conservation and nuclear energy.  I hope the Minister for Energy will consider a scheme for educating our young people in this matter. They should be fully educated in relation to nuclear energy so that they are fully acquainted with all its aspects.</P>
    <P>There are many people who advocate a referendum in relation to going nuclear.  It is ultimately a decision for the Government whether or not such a course of action is taken.  If such action is taken it is vital that our young people are familiar with all the facets of this major issue.  Young people should be fully educated in regard to energy saving in their homes.  They should be able to bring to the attention of their parents the many ways in which energy can be saved.  Our young people should be able to participate in a national conservation scheme.  We certainly need to give this matter very grave consideration in the national interest.  We have been responsible for major losses of energy in the past. Many individuals have abused supplies and have not made proper provision for conservation in buildings.  It is important that proper insulation is provided in our homes.  We are very fortunate that our building stock is good.  When we were building we built good houses.  The local authorities are ahead of private builders in relation to the insulation in their new homes.  It will have to be a priority in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The increase in the price of oil was <Col N="1243" /> practically inevitable.  We have studied the international scene.  It is dangerous at the moment and could affect all our lives.  In this regard a very good scheme has been initiated by the ESB, with the help of the Bank of Ireland and An Foras Talúntais, in relation to the development of horticultural centres attached to the Lanesborough power station. The Minister, Deputy Hussey, who is present today is aware of this scheme. Ten acres of glass are being developed and the heat is supplied by Lanesborough power station at a very reasonable price.  These units are being let in one-acre plots to individual horticulturalists who are providing very good employment and saving energy. This project, which is in the initial stages at the moment with two acres fully developed and ready for the first crop of tomatoes this year, should be studied by all Departments concerned.  I would advocate the extension of this scheme to the other power stations here.  It would be a major saving.  It would reduce dependency on oil for growing fruit and tomatoes in our horticultural centres. The necessary heat for those horticultural centres creates a big draw on the oil supplies.</P>
    <P>This pilot scheme, which I have examined myself, is a most impressive undertaking. I would like to compliment the Minister, Deputy Hussey, who is involved on the side of the Department of Agriculture, and the Minister for Energy, who is involved on the other side and got the co-operation of the ESB and all the other State agencies involved.  I wish this project every success.  It is something that should be followed at all the other power stations, particularly those fuelled by native fuel, whether peat or, as in Arigna, coal.  The whole process consists of the draining off of heat at a certain point in the power station and providing very cheap heat for growing tomatoes and fruit in these areas.  This is a clear indication of the commitment of the Government to initiating energy saving projects and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>In relation to oil and the supply and <Col N="1244" /> distribution of oil, it is interesting to note the lack of debate on the part of the Opposition on the decision by one major oil company to limit the supply of petrol from 14 April.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, who has requested the Restrictive Practices Commission to re-open their public inquiry into the sale of petrol.</P>

      <P>I hope to give evidence in relation to the phasing out of supplies to the smaller rural stations.  It is a most retrograde decision by this company which will be followed by every other company unless the necessary action is taken.  It shows the concern and commitment of the Government that they have taken immediate action in relation to such restrictive practices.  It is encouraging to see this type of action.  I would like to encourage all small retailers to give evidence before this inquiry if necessary, because it is important to be fully acquainted with the disadvantages and results of this proposal by this major oil company which will affect the livelihood of many small retailers here.  This company threatens the withdrawal of supplies from people with a capacity smaller than 1,100 gallons or 5,000 litres, from the 14 April next unless the Department and the Restrictive Practices Commission can impose regulations to limit their powers.  It will affect many families in <Col N="1245" /> western areas.  The scarcity of fuel will also create hardship for many families who will have to travel long distances to obtain supplies.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with the Government and they took positive action. Both the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Energy took a very keen interest in this matter.  I feel confident that there will be a satisfactory outcome to the public inquiry and that these companies will be curbed in their attempt to withdraw supplies from rural areas.  As one who lives in a rural area many miles from a large town, I know the hardship this will impose on rural Ireland.  It is up to us in Government to raise these matters, because we would certainly be waiting a while before the Opposition would even concern themselves with such mundane details.  We should always be alert to the situation where the multi-nationals can impose such regulations and such conditions on the distribution of supplies.  This does not apply only to the small independent retailers of petrol; it also affects small grocers, because the multi-nationals are obtaining a strong hold on the retail grocery outlets here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a serious situation about which I know the Government are extremely concerned.  I feel confident that they will take the appropriate action to ensure that these companies are curbed in their unsocial behaviour.  It is unsocial because we need the small grocer, the small retailer, the small publican, to make life in rural Ireland more tolerable and more acceptable.  Without these very important facilities, plus the local post office and the local school and church, rural Ireland would be lost.  I stand and work for the smaller outlets and will support every move made by the Government to ensure that these outlets are retained.  Somebody has to shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;. Somebody has to curb the excesses of the multi-nationals, who have very little human feeling for the people who are affected by their decisions taken in London, New York, Bonn and so on.  We must ensure that these decisions are made in the best interests of our people.  I <Col N="1246" /> have no doubt that the Government will ensure that these decisions are made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal by an Irish company to set up a new company to distribute oil and petrol throughout the country.  I wish them every success because there is a need for competition in this field.  There is a cartel at the moment among the major oil companies and they are all working hand in hand to ensure profitability for themselves without any concern for the needs of the public.  When they put forward proposals for price increases one of the items they gave as justification was the cost of distribution. If there were fewer outlets I have no doubt that there would be no decrease in the price of oil and petrol to the consumer.  This is one important issue which I, as a Fianna Fáil backbencher, highlighted.  I got the full support of the Government who reacted quickly to such unacceptable practices. That is an example of the position of small outlets.  Supplies must be available throughout the country in the interests of our tourist trade and in the general interest.</P>
    <P>The Opposition in this House are ineffective. They are not concerned about the needs of the people.  They are more concerned with trying to score petty political points but they cannot do that either.  We can know them by their actions. We know what they did when in government.  We know what they did in the budget of 1976&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My colleague and I worked very hard for our constituency because no party worked for it other than Fianna Fáil.  That is why we work as a team for Roscommon-Leitrim. The constituency is fortunate to have two Government Deputies.  From 1973 to 1977 our constituency was neglected by the National Coalition.

      <P>That is a very good explanation of where they were at that stage.  Some people have talked about certain changes in relation to the grants system in the last few months.  Naturally, I have been in touch very closely with the situation as I was involved in the building business before I was elected to this Dáil.  I would like to make a point in relation to the termination of the house improvement grants scheme which arose recently.  In 1979 the Government invested £213 million of which £24.5 million was for house improvements and new house grants payable by the Department of the Environment.  Grants for essential repairs have not been terminated but it does not mean that the overall investment is being curtailed.  In place of discontinued grants the maximum local authority house improvents secured loan has been increased from £2,500 to £4,000 and the maximum unsecured loan from £600 to £1,000.  The qualifying limit has been increased from £4,000 to £5,000.  The £1,000 grant, which is a tremendous boost to our young people, will be continued and developed.  The Government's commitment to pay grants is being fully honoured.  In relation to the house improvement grant, people were given a fortnight's notice within which to submit applications and within that fortnight about 44,000 applications were received, equalling about nine months' applications in normal circumstances. People who had entered <Col N="1255" /> into a contract to extend their houses were given an opportunity to apply for the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the speech informing people of the situation in County Clare where he thought no one would see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The period of grace given compared favourably with the action of the Coalition Government who changed the grants scheme overnight in December 1976.  In 1977 approximately 52,500 applications for house improvement grants were received.  In the fortnight between 21 January and 1 February 1980 44,500 applications were received.  Any reasonable person will agree that the Government have handled this issue with understanding and compassion. People most in need of grants&mdash;the poor, the old and the handicapped&mdash;will still be eligible for them; people who have entered into commitments have not been disqualified; the people who are not well off will be eligible for better loans.  The only people affected by this are those who can afford to pay for the work to be done.  The situation here compares favourably with the situation which occurred in 1976, when Deputies Tully and R. Ryan decided to phase out the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I initiated a scheme in Roscommon County Council whereby loans will be paid in three instalments.  Under the Coalition Government a house had to be roofed before one would get the meagre loan of £4,500.  That loan has been increased substantially to £12,000.  I would appeal to all local authorities to follow Roscommon County Council by issuing loans in three stages.  This scheme has been approved by the Minister for the Environment.  On completion of the foundations £4,000, approximately, is handed over to the applicant. This saves him from having to avail of bridging finance and could mean a saving of about £800 on the building of a house.  The councillors in the Opposition benches would be doing a great <Col N="1256" /> day's work if they supported Fianna Fáil proposals in local authorities to bring in the phased payment of loans.</P>

This is a very sound philosophy, financed by central funds. The Government intend to continue this policy, which is bringing tremendous development in rural areas.  We are fully supporting the programme of building by local authorities, because it is our policy to provide homes at subsidised rates for people who cannot afford to build their own and to help people to build their homes where possible.  This <Col N="1257" /> policy of providing local authority houses is also assisting in the creation of jobs.  The building industry has always been a good employer and under our policy it is very hard to get skilled workers at the moment because of the amount of work being undertaken.</P>

The people saw through the ineffective policy of the politicians who were trying to save their seats, their cars and their ministerial offices.  During the Coalition period we had no effective leadership in the Custom House or in O'Connell Bridge House.  We now have three Ministers looking after that vitally important section.  We have the necessary backup service to ensure that grants will be paid efficiently and effectively.  I congratulate Deputy Fahey and very much appreciate the assistance he has given to <Col N="1258" /> rural areas in relation to the rural group schemes and water schemes.  These schemes are giving great assistance to rural areas.  A new impetus has been given to that section by the appointment of two Ministers of State whereas during the Coalition period there was no effective leadership in the Custom House.  I regret I have to say that.  They were more concerned about hypothetical figures and cosmetic exercises than realities; they were living in cloud-cuckoo land and not interested in facts. When in Opposition Fianna Fáil exposed the facts in this House and in doing so ensured that they would return to Government.</P>

It is a fact that when a Coalition Government are in office the building industry slumps and when Fianna Fáil are in power it thrives.  Many people in 1977 were praying that Fianna Fáil would be returned to office to revitalise that industry.  During the term of the National Coalition we went on deputations, almost daily, to various Ministers but after shaking our hands they told us that they did not have the funds to carry out the work we were interested in.  When Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1977 funds were provided for roads, sewerage, drainage and water schemes.  The Government revitalised the local improvements schemes.</P>

      <P>The PAYE provisions have been welcomed and people realise that they constitute major improvements. However, it is more important that a government cater for the elderly, the widows and social welfare recipients. Those people have benefited in real terms under the budget for the first time in the history of the State.  Those people got what they deserved and it is our intention to ensure that social welfare recipients are given priority treatment because they are the weakest section of our society.  They cannot call on the trade unions or the farming lobby to work for them, they rely on Fianna Fáil to give them improvements in their benefit.  Those people have not forgotten that some years ago a Coalition Government took one shilling from the old age pensioners.  I do not intend raking up embarrassing facts but Fine Gael were responsible for taking one shilling from old age pensioners.  The people from Roscommon and the west will never forget that betrayal by Fine Gael.  Those people rely on Fianna Fáil representatives. They are aware that they never had better representatives than the Fianna Fáil Members who work efficiently and effectively for them.  They know that we will not sit back and let things happen.

We are aware that those with a valuation less than £30 do not earn a taxable income.  We eliminated social welfare recipients and those in receipt of Old IRA pensions from the tax net.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to the budget and dismiss the latter part of the previous speaker's contribution as a reminder of what we used hear in the forties outside church gates. In considering the budget we must investigate its background which was one of inflation going mad, a 5p increase in the price of a loaf of bread, a 5 per cent increase in the price of milk and increases in the price of coal and gas.  It might be worth while outlining the increases that were imposed in the weeks preceding the budget and during which time inflation soared.  This kind of situation affects many areas.  In addition to people having to cut back on their standard of living, employment is affected, <Col N="1262" /> and it is in this context and having regard to this background that we should examine the budget.</P>
      <P>Another very serious matter that I have not heard referred to so far during this debate is the credit squeeze that has been in existence during the past six months and which has had a greater adverse effect than has had any measure announced in this House.  That credit squeeze has &ldquo;screwed&rdquo; people, poor people particularly, who were anxious to undertake certain work&mdash;for instance, young married couples trying to build their own houses&mdash;because, despite what has been said about bridging finance, this facility is absolutely necessary for people wishing to build their own homes.  The credit squeeze has been felt right through the community.</P>
      <P>This restriction on credit, in addition to affecting seriously our economy, has had a serious effect on the daily lives of our people.  Small businesses have had to close with the resulting unemployment and the stress caused by such closures. Those people who are managing to stay in business are in most cases only barely surviving in this atmosphere of credit restriction.  I have been talking with many people to whom council loans are available for the building of houses but who have not been able to go ahead with the work because of their failure to be accommodated with the bridging finance that is necessary.  It may be said without fear of contradiction that for the past three months there has been a budget every week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the background situation that I have outlined, the budget will have a serious effect on employment and will result in inflation becoming completely out of hand. A very serious aspect is the increased cost of fuel.  The increases in this area are reflected in transport costs and in the cost of everything we buy.  In other words, such increases have a serious effect on prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil seem very anxious to propagate the notion that we have a new <Col N="1263" /> Government, but that is not so.  We have 11 of the same Ministers as we had when Deputy Lynch was Taoiseach, though he had promised us a major reshuffle at about the end of last year when our term of office of the European Presidency would be ending.  What we have had is a minor reshuffle.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Department of Economic Planning and Development was a good exercise on the part of the previous Taoiseach.  That move was an indication of some concern in the area of planning and development; but the new Taoiseach, in his wisdom, saw fit to abolish the Department.  I regard that action on his part as a retrograde step, because failure to give priority to this aspect of our economy is to prevent the sort of progress that is necessary.  I had much criticism to offer regarding the manner in which that Department was administered by the relevant Minister, but that is another matter.  One would have expected at least some hint in the budget of an expansionist policy, but we were to be disappointed because there was not any such reference in the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>We are being told that the budgetary measures are designed to allow us to come to grips with the situation that had developed, but that situation developed under the leadership of Fianna Fáil. There is not anything in the budget that would seem to assist in the continuation even of those schemes of employment already in existence or of the planning that had been in progress.  In other words, the Government have reneged on the promises they made to the people in 1977.  This budget is a total reversal of the policies they put forward then.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Economic Planning and Development told us that the employment problem would be resolved in full within two or three years but what we are hearing now is that the Government are to produce 30,000 jobs. That is a big climb down from the original promise.  That Department was not run as it should have been run and did not produce the results expected.  The <Col N="1264" /> theory of planning and development, which was at least acknowledged at that time, has been scrubbed and we are back to square one.  This budget as an economic policy document does not give any idea of the direction the new Taoiseach intends to take.  He appears to have been very reluctant to give us any idea of the direction his Government intend taking.  The primary objective of this Government seems to be to distance themselves as far as they can from what they promised the people in 1977.  They have scrubbed the Department of Economic Planning and Development. They wiped out the whole concept of economic planning and development and downgraded it.  Fianna Fáil always believe in downgrading planning of any kind.</P>
    <P>I mentioned prices.  I have a document before me published by Fianna Fáil and circulated in my constituency during the last election campaign.  It says: &ldquo;Voters of Kildare Constituency, These are the Issues&rdquo;.  In it Fianna Fáil say that high investment in services and road maintenance is needed in Kildare to restart development.  At one time we had the reputation for having the best roads in the country but now Kildare is held up to ridicule on the Mike Murphy morning show because of all the potholes in our county.  This is a direct result of the lack of funds being provided by the Government for road maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, my constituency colleague, today criticised me and the Kildare county manager.  He said it was the manager's job to manage with a 10 per cent increase. He quoted from his report to the council at the estimates meeting which said he found it very difficult to bring in estimates within the limits imposed by the Minister.  The Minister said that was an indication the manager could not do his job.  I do not object to the Minister criticising me for supporting the postponement of the adoption of the estimates but it is wrong to criticise the manager because he found it very difficult to bring in an estimate within the limits imposed by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> Over the last few months, the work of the council has been slowing down because of the guildines set by the Minister last year.  There have been very large increases in the price of road making materials since last year&mdash;tar roughly 30 per cent; incomes, salaries and wages 23 per cent and machinery 25 per cent.  Against that background the council are told to do a better job on our roads with a 10 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>To set a 10 per cent limit right across the board is the lazy man's way of doing things.  We must ask ourselves, 10 per cent of what?  Three years ago income from rates in certain areas was very high but in areas where it was very low, a 10 per cent increase is not very much.  In one county a 10 per cent increase in rates would mean £2 in the £; in Kildare it would be around 75p or 80p.  By setting a limit of 10 per cent the Minister is not taking into account the actual effect that will have on the ground.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the great schemes started and put into effect by Fianna Fáil.  I am more interested in local authority housing than in any other type, because I believe local authorities are providing houses for people who cannot provide for themselves.  While I am concerned about all counties, I am more concerned about Kildare because I know the scene there better than anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The demand for housing in Kildare has increased enormously during the past ten years, and in the days of the National Coalition Government the county council there built an average of 250 houses annually&mdash;in one year the number reached 300.  Last year, under Fianna Fáil, they were able to complete only 142 houses&mdash;a big drop&mdash;because they did not have the money to build more.  No matter how figures are twisted, that is a fact.  Kildare County Council are building fewer than half the number of houses they were able to build three years ago.  At that time the Department asked the officials in Kildare for an estimate of their housing needs in a five-year period and the figure given was 250 per year, and it was said <Col N="1266" /> by medical and other officers of Kildare County Council that even that number would not meet demands.</P>
    <P>There have been insinuations by Fianna Fáil in my constituency and throughout the country that there has not been a fair return for the money allocated for roads.  We know in the county council that the engineering section have been doing a good job but the restriction to a 10 per cent increase in the allocation and the lack of grants have meant that road maintenance in County Kildare has had to suffer gravely.  Road deterioration has become worse in the past two years under Fianna Fáil.  I defy anybody to contradict that.  It is obvious to all who use our roads.  We have been told that we are getting increased grants, but Fianna Fáil introduced a Bill which for the first time made county councils liable for VAT of 10 per cent across the board on all materials purchased by councils.  That, and rising inflation, more than accounted for any increases in allocations.</P>
    <P>In County Kildare we had plans for a dual carriageway across the Curragh. Then a second Department told us we could not do it because the site was on military property and the work would interfere with military buildings.  Agreement was reached between Kildare County Council and the military authorities and the whole matter is now with the two Ministers concerned, but God knows when the work will be started.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry said that the county manager in Kildare did not show much management ability because he had said he found it hard to do with an increased allocation of 10 per cent.  The manager would have been more honest if he had said it was impossible for him to do it without running down the council services.  The manager said there would have to be cut-backs in council services but he added he hoped he would not have to lay off workers.  However, a rule was brought in to retire workers early and not to replace them.  Despite all the talk about grants, we know in County Kildare that we will <Col N="1267" /> be getting less money by way of grants this year, and of course this must affect employment.  The present Minister has tried to put it across to the people that councils are getting plenty of money but that they are not managing properly at a time when we are faced with the prospect of cutting out essential services. Some years ago in Kildare County Council we decided to do some of the Department's work by providing four or five telephone kiosks annually in remote rural areas where communication was very difficult and a genuine need existed. We had to cut that out.  We had hoped to provide a number of additional public lights every year.  That has had to go.</P>
    <P>All this stringency arises from the abolition of rates.  I admit that rates were an unjust form of taxation because they did not take into consideration ability to pay, but a Government cannot take away something and not replace it.  The abolition of rates was a vote-catching exercise, as was the abolition of motor taxation. The latter supplied most of the money in the Road Fund.  I drive home every night and it would pay me to pay £200 a year tax if it contributed to proper road maintenance.  I have to spend hundreds of pounds on car repairs because of the condition of the roads.  I do not advocate bringing back car tax.</P>

    <P>It is an honour and privilege for me to have the opportunity of introducing, on behalf of our party, a Bill which, if approved by the Government, would mark a significant step forward in recognition by all sides of this House of the need for a new status and indeed recognition of the rights of Irish women.  The Bill itself is a simple one.  I believe there is substantial sympathy on the part of the Government <Col N="1268" /> to its general tone.  In regard to its detailed content and actual expression we are open to suggestion or consideration of amendment.  I have no doubt that the Minister will have something to say about that later.  But there are certain things we are not open to and I hope to spell these out.</P>
    <P>The reason for the introduction of this Bill is simple: in the situation obtaining, statutorily speaking, affecting this issue of criminal conversation, we recognise what is now widely perceived to be an affront to equality of human rights for Irish women.  I do not think anybody seriously contests that any longer.  The time is now opportune to grant Irish women the dignity and status of full equality in law and in all the social and economic implications arising therefrom. There are many of these areas.  The growing concern expressed by organisations, or women's groups, by concerned citizens and individuals everywhere testifies to the fact that action is needed now and that the time for words is past.  I am struck also by the fact that there is not really any excuse for action being deferred any longer in an area such as this.  Often we are told that economic considerations, lack of resources and so on may defer or postpone indefinitely much needed and desirable innovation. This is not the case here.  This Bill does not involve any extra charge on public funds.  It is essentially a commitment to rid our Statute Book, our way of thinking and our way of life of an Act which deems a woman to be the property of her husband and which places her in a position of inferior status and restricted dignity relevant to her husband.  That situation is no longer tolerable.</P>
    <P>I feel there is substantial support throughout this House, and certainly throughout the country, for the ideal contained in this Bill.  If we are now of the view, almost unanimously, that action needs to be taken to ensure that there will no longer be these discriminatory elements in our legislation, then not merely the criminal conservation tort should be abolished but a systematic, urgent analysis should be <Col N="1269" /> made of all legislation in this area with a view to ridding our legislative framework and all that it contains once and for all, of any nuance or discrimination against people because of their sex.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider embarking on a new, dynamic drive to achieve that modest goal, a goal which is decreed to us, not merely by bodies such as the European Court of Human Rights but by our own innate sense of the Christian dignity of women.  Sadly, the record of Irish Governments in relation to progress in law for Irish women is not good.  Surely in 1980 there should be no need for this country, once again, to be dragged into the European forum to have extorted from it, usually from an apparently unwilling Government, a Government who ultimately grant, with some begrudging, new legislation, new attitudes or innovations which have to be forced on them by a more enlightened international process than we have managed to cobble together in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>We are told this is a time of tight resources.  If so, there is an obligation on the Government and on the Minister, particularly in this area, to embark urgently on the introduction of legislation which in many cases requires not financial resources, or major infrastructural rearrangement of the way in which we do things in society, but perhaps the most difficult of all commitments, the enactment of sometimes courageous, often difficult, but essentially just, equitable and necessary legislative innovations, now timely and essential if justice is to be seen to be done to Irish women.</P>
    <P>Our basic thesis&mdash;and I should like to know if the Minister is willing to concur with us&mdash;is that the present position relating to the entitlement of a husband to take an action, the action of criminal conversation, against another male is no longer acceptable to anybody.  Such an action has been discredited all over the world.  Our Law Reform Commission, in their extremely comprehensive and very helpful paper on this and related subjects, dated 1977, clearly said also that <Col N="1270" /> the present situation was not tolerable any longer.  I was pleased to hear the Taoiseach say, in his presidential address to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis on 16 February 1980:</P>
    <P>There are, however, still areas of discrimination and difficulty for women.  Full equality is the aim of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>He further said:</P>
    <P>...I would like to give this Ard-Fheis an assurance that we intend to proceed as rapidly as circumstances and resources permit and that we will not be satisfied until women enjoy a status in our society equal in every way to that of men.</P>
    <P>That is a enlightened, constructive and helpful sentiment.  If the Government propose to bear it out in reality surely it will mean that this universally accepted wrong, at present being perpetrated in Irish law in relation to criminal conversation must go.  Otherwise those words are shallow and have no meaning.  The Taoiseach said as soon as circumstances and resources permit.  Resources are not at issue in this.  I am not sure how flexible the definition of &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; may be but I should like to hear the Minister say what circumstances could possibly inhibit the Government in a commitment at this time to ridding our Statute Book of the anomaly which treats people, because of their sex, as being different in relation to their legal rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House may not be perfect.  Indeed, I consider it wrong that in the constructive working out of this type of proposal, the research facilities available to members of the Opposition are negligible beyond the minimum assistance available to anybody in the House, of the most routine and mundane, secretarial nature.  Therefore I do not put this Bill forward on behalf of our party as if it was the last word in this area, or as if it was the ultimate say in relation to criminal conversation.  It might very well be, in its technical detail, open to amendment, it may not be the ideal Bill with which the Minister, with <Col N="1271" /> his presumed legions of back-up and research assistance, would be able to come up&mdash;those good people in the Department of Justice and others who can help him draft into law the commitment, promise and, hopefully, vision of the kind of Ireland he wants, particularly one in which men and women are treated equally.</P>
    <P>The Bill may not be perfect.  I have no reason to consider it imperfect, but I enter the caveat that there might be technical aspects which need tidying up. Some interpretations of the Bill have lent themselves to unhelpful interpretations and extrapolations.  I suspect there may be Members who are not totally zealous to ridding our Statute Book of this tort. Behind it all there is a commitment by everyone to ensure equality of access to law and the ideal of treating everyone equally in law.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether or not the answer now before the House is the right one, the mere voting down of this proposal is not adequate because it is widely recognised and accepted that the implication in the present situation, which, loosely interpreted, denies to a wife a reciprocal right to take action open to her husband, is not acceptable in constitutional terms&mdash;this is under article 40, which guarantees equality of rights under the law&mdash;and would not be acceptable in the European Court of Human Rights to which, very sadly, a number of Irish women have had to go to gain justice from an often begrudging Government.  I hope this will not occur in this case.  If the Bill is unacceptable in its present form it should not be deemed so by its mere voting down.  I want a firm commitment this evening from the Government&mdash;whether or not they propose to introduce their own Bill and, if so, when and what kind of Bill it will be.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me, a mere male who is not as au fait as many people are with criminal conversation implications and with understanding the affront which it is clearly seen to constitute to Irish women, if I did not <Col N="1272" /> mention the debt which Irish society. I and my predecessor, Deputy O'Keeffe, who embarked initially on the work in this area, owe to the women's organisations. Our concern in this area commenced when my predecessor in this spokesmanship, Deputy O'Keeffe, drafted the outlines of the Bill before us, researched the background to it, consulted widely and took every reasonable step to ensure that this proposed legislation was appropriate, fitting and met the objections of women in our community. These women's groups are numerous and include many who have clearly spelled out their opposition to the present situation and others who have been less vocal but who have indicated, directly or indirectly, that they would support the kind of progressive, enlightened, reformist attitude to legislation in this area now demanded.</P>
    <P>They include Adapt, Aim, Ally, the Association of Widows of Civil Servants, the National Federation of Business and Professional Widows Clubs, Catholic Protection and Rescue Society of Ireland, Cherish, Cork Federation of Women's Organisations, Council for the Status of Women, Irish Countrywomen's Association, Irish Federation of Women's Clubs, National Association of Widows of Ireland, Irish Housewives Association, Irish Women's Aid Society, Joint Committee of Women's Society and Social Workers, the National Council for Single Women, Single Women's Association, Women Elect and Women's Political Association. I am sure there are others and I hope I do not cause offence by not referring to them.  All of these in their various ways have expressed the view, some more strongly than others, that reform in relation to legislation affecting women is long overdue.</P>
    <P>We are affording the Government this evening the opportunity of saying what their intentions are in this regard.  I was pleased by the effort of many of these organisations to try and encourage the more reticent of our politicians to take the first timorous steps along the road of enlightened reform in this area.  I am impressed <Col N="1273" /> that the Irish Country women's Association have time and again referred to the need for the abolition of criminal conversation.  It is an organisation which, I am sure we all agree, does marvellous work for women and can hardly be said to be in the forefont of legislative demand or other proposals which would be open to the accusation that they were not helpful, for example, to the stability of marriage or moral standards in the country.  This demand spread through women's organisations all of whom have shown a serious, studied, constructive socially conscious approach to this issue. I believe they represent the feelings of the overwhelming majority of Irish women. In a Parliament largely dominated by men it is important that this voice be represented.  There are others in all parties better able to represent that voice than I and I hope they will participate in the discussion.</P>
    <P>The situation we want to change is the capacity of a husband to take an action for damages against a person who has had sexual relations with his wife.  This is the action of criminal conversation.  The consent of a wife to the relation does not affect the entitlement to sue.  It is not necessary that the adulterous conduct should result in the separation of the spouses.  Conduct by the husband, however disgraceful it may be in itself, can only affect the question of damages and not the basic right to take the action. The view and experience to date has been that this right of action is unhelpful for a number of reasons and does not achieve the ideals which I presume those opposing change would seek to pretend it does.</P>
    <P>I am sure we are all concerned about the question of marriage breakdown and marriage stability, If we are, let us have the wisdom and courage to discuss the issues which are germane to that problem.  This legislation, rooted back in the mists of time somewhere in the middle of the 19th century, cannot be seriously argued to be in any way essential to any issue relating to the stability of marriage.  On the contrary, the few cases that have been taken have largely <Col N="1274" /> served only to assuage a sense of perceived outrage, perhaps vindictiveness in many cases, on behalf of the individual and, on the other hand, the casual interest of the readers of some Sunday newspapers.</P>
    <P>I have never yet seen a shred of evidence, and I would like those who seek to oppose this Bill to produce it if it exists, that the present legal situation has ever helped to heal one marriage, has ever helped to do justice to the children involved, has ever helped to do anything but hammer the final nail in an already dying or dead human relationship, and surely marriage is primarily a human relationship.  None of us would seek to bludgeon our way into having changes enacted in areas of intimate, stable relationships between man and wife.  It is no harm that the State should, particularly if there is evidence that legislation is, in fact, pointless and irrelevant and not achieving the ends, presumably, for which it was designed, withdraw gracefully, if possible, from that area. This is one such area.  A marriage is fundamentally about human relationships. If the State wants to help marriages, let it do so by giving all the professional, counselling, financial and other aids necessary to build and maintain stable and happy marriages in these times of difficult economic and other pressures. Negative, divisive legislation, such as this, does not help to do so.  This is not the view merely of this speaker, but of law reform commissions around the world.</P>
    <P>A number of arguments can be advanced against the present situation.  Most of them have been quite admirably dealt with in the Law Reform Commission's report to which I have already referred. These arguments are central to our opposition to the present situation and our request for enlightened change in that area.  The most fundamental objection, of course, must be one of two very central arguments: the implicit inequality in relation to equal human rights for women involved in an action which allows a man to take a court action and not to grant his wife a reciprocal advantage. <Col N="1275" /> It is fair to say that there are some who say that such an action is open to a women.  If it is, then women are not aware if it, nor have they ever undertaken such an action, presumably because they have been wisely advised that such an action is not, in fact, open to them.  There is, therefore, at the very least a very substantial burden of evidence and argument to indicate that this is an action for a man against another man and is not open to the first man's wife.</P>
    <P>The other essential argument, apart from the question of equality of human rights, is the notion of ownership, of subjugation, of proprietary interest to which women are subjected in the context of this action.  The implication is that the woman is, as the almost medieval expression has it, the chattel of her husband. I do not think that anybody in this House, and, I hope, very few outside it, would testify that that attitude is sustainable today, if it ever was sustainable.  If it is not sustainable and is not acceptable in this House, then we must do something about it.  The &ldquo;we&rdquo; this evening can be either side of the House.  The acceptance of this Bill would mark a major step forward in this area and would serve perhaps above all, to highlight the need for reform throughout this area of legislation affecting women. Failing that, the Government have an obligation to spell out clearly what precisely they are going to do, how they are going to do it and, most importantly of all, in view of these hazardous and difficult political times, when they are going to do it.  There is no guarantee that any of us will be around for too long and I want any commitment in this area to be one that is enacted very soon.</P>
    <P>The proprietary notion, the notion that a man somehow owns his wife more than she owns him&mdash;if ownership, indeed, is an acceptable expression in this context at all&mdash;is also repugnant.  Some describe it as being barbaric and we would agree with that.  Surely we cannot sustain the idea that two human beings, equal in the eyes of our Constitution, <Col N="1276" /> somehow differ when it comes to their rights in law in marriage.  The rather bar barous theoretical basis of the action, savouring a proprietary interest in one's spouse, offends against not just what the Law Reform Commission, slightly quaintly, puts it &ldquo;modern notions,&rdquo; but also offends against a deeply ingrained sense of justice in the equality of human rights for all people, regardless of their sex.  This argument has won wide judicial support throughout the world and I have no doubt would, if contested here.  Let us hope that an enlightened Government and an enlightened Minister will not wait for such time as we have to have the unseemly, unnecessary, prurient exhibition of a sordid case passing through the courts, before whoever is in Government at the time is dragged into the eighties, even if not kicking and screaming, even if objecting slightly.</P>
    <P>Would it not be nice for a change for this House not to react to groups outside, to the loudest lobby, but saying, in principle, because we believe it in our hearts that here is a wrong and we are going to introduce the reforms necessary to correct that wrong?  Would it not be wonderful for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to recognise that it does not cost a great deal of money for a change and that here is a way we can make progress, where the quality of life will improve for people.  Women, many of them never directly affected, but indirectly affected, nevertheless because of their fellow feeling for women who are in their position or who are in their neighbourhood or in their community, will appreciate that things are improving, that a parliamentary system works and that it does not have to depend on people beating down the doors outside.  To do that, all that is necessary is to accept a modest Bill which is already the law in many countries in the European context and also, indeed, in Northern Ireland, where, no doubt, we would be very keen to make a good impression in this area as, I hope, in every other area.  We have particular cause to be sensitive in relation to this or any other legislation.</P>
    <P>There are other arguments made <Col N="1277" /> against this Bill, some stronger than others.  One says that the action no longer transfers any ulterior legal benefit upon the plaintiff.  Formerly, the action would have been a prerequisite to his entitlement to a parliamentary divorce, but that does not arise here.  Therefore, this necessary prerequisite action, preliminary to divorce, because we do not have divorce, is not an argument or another reason for the dropping of this legislation, unless, of course, the Government propose to introduce divorce.  I am not aware that that is the case at present.</P>
    <P>Another argument says that perhaps, even in this context, the wrong person is being penalised.  The Law Reform Commission refers to this argument.  I am not sure that penalising anybody in this situation is the right answer.  At best, and at heart, the essential argument to retain this legislation is our concern surely with trying to heal a marriage in difficulty and knitting together the strands of the lives of two people, whose co-existence has been sundered or shattered.  If that is the case, public punishment and assessment and awarding of damages and all of the scandal that goes with them are hardly the cornerstone of a new day for the people involved.  A much more human, intimate, sensitive, compassionate approach is necessary.  There is no harm, in passing, to refer to something else.  These are the eighties and the response of society&mdash;which is at the kernel of any legislation and our attitude to it&mdash;must also bear in mind trends as they evolve, trends in values and in the norms of society.  What was perceived to be an outrage and a wrong in the nineteenth century may no longer be perceived to be the same kind of outrage or the same kind of wrong.  What could be deemed, on one hand, to be an irrevocable step towards damaging fundamentally a marriage in, say, the twenties may no longer be that today when men and women have a new understanding of sexuality, of human relations and, perhaps, in some cases new attitudes to the confines which traditionally have been accepted in these areas.  So, legislation of all kinds should be open to regular review particularly if it is legislation affecting <Col N="1278" /> an intimate human relationship such as we are talking about here.</P>
    <P>Another argument&mdash;and this is the experience of people in law&mdash;is that the primary use of this legislation as at present enacted&mdash;and it has not been carried out very often&mdash;is in relation to its usefulness as a weapon for blackmail. Clearly, there is not much point in taking an action unless the person against whom you take it has substantial funds so that you can get substantial damages. That does not seem to be very good law because the wives of the poor&mdash; because poverty and beauty and physical attraction or whatever motivates people in this area are not intrinsically related and the husbands involved should surely be treated the same way in law as anybody else.  But in fact there would not be much use in taking action here in this area.  Therefore, I presume the actions are not taken.  Accordingly, we have another anomaly because this is an action which is useful only if one happens to be able to sue a wealthy person.  I suppose it is not outside the bounds of human ingenuity to contrive a situation where the person against whom an action&mdash;in some cases deliberately constructed&mdash;might ultimately be taken would be a person of substantial means because the scandal, defamation of character involved and even the unproven allegation would be such as to encourage a person to settle very rapidly before any court case.  Accordingly, it appears to be the learned experience of eminent legal and other minds here and in other countries that there is a particular opportunity for blackmailing here.  If this is the case and if the advantages to be gained from retention of this action are no longer valid, clearly we have another argument for getting rid of it in its present form.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful to glance briefly at the situation in regard to this type of legislation in neighbouring and other countries, not because it is necessary for us to follow slavishly whatever happens in Britain or Northern Ireland&mdash; although we seem to do that commonly in any case&mdash;but because the basic body <Col N="1279" /> of legislation which we have here is similar in many respects and very much so in this case.</P>
    <P>I want to make a further point about the essential kernel of the action of criminal conversation.  The assessment of damages involved and the notion on which damages are assessed is unseemly, to use an inadequate word.  In awarding compensatory damages we are told that regard should be had to (a) the actual value of the wife to the husband and (b) the need properly to compensate the husband for the injury to his feelings, the blow to his marital honour and the hurt to his matrimonial and family life.  When I tried to grasp how one could assess the value of one's wife I found difficulty but the Law Reform Commission sought to advance my knowledge by saying that the value of the wife may be considered from two points of view, the pecuniary aspect in relation to which her future and her assistance in her husband's business and such allied matters are relevant and the consortium aspect, that is in relation to which the wife's general qualities as a wife and mother and her conduct and general character are relevant.</P>
    <P>The very assessment of the damages is done on a basis which degrades.  Without saying much more on that aspect, it is time that we were men enough to say, &ldquo;Let us have the courage to change things that clearly need changing&rdquo;.  I could develop that at some length but time and perhaps inclination do not allow it.  The idea that this action is not reciprocal while not being completely unanimous is very strongly in favour of the view that this action is only for men. This is founded on the argument that historically the action has been based on the servile position of the wife relative to her husband and, according to the Law Reform Commission, the tendency in English decisions relating to negligently caused loss of consortium and the harbouring of a spouse has been to deny a right of action to a wife on the basis that these actions are anomalous and that it is better to confine the anomaly as far as possible rather than extend it further. <Col N="1280" /> That is an extraordinary statement which says that actions on this basis are essentially anomalous and therefore rather than extend them to women they should be restricted to men instead of admitting the anomaly, doing the right thing and getting rid of it.</P>
    <P>It has been frequently brought to our attention that this is one area in the many areas where women are increasingly demanding equality of treatment in social, economic, cultural and educational matters and every other matter which can be changed literally almost by a nod of the head of the appropriate Minister.  Therefore, we deliberately brought before the House this evening a Bill which is not complex, not enormously expensive, not designed to create any political or financial embarrassment for the Government but simply to afford them an opportunity of saying with us and with the Labour Party &ldquo;This House is able to say, yes, there is a wrong here and we are going to change it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The situation in Britain and Northern Ireland is that the tort of criminal conversation has been abolished for over a century.  A replacement action there is now deemed to be no longer any use and the Law Reform Commission in Britain has, as recently as 1977, said that it, too, felt that the action involved in actions for adultry was no longer useful and that in the thousands of cases of divorce which come before it something like four cases had been raised in relation to pursuit of damages in this area.</P>
    <P>If we are really concerned about marriage, this legislation has nothing to do with it.  It is not worth the defence which may be made for it.  Perhaps at one stage when people were different, when there was less emphasis on human relationships, when it was not as open to people as it is now to change their attitudes to the social norms and values of society, when a more restricted attitude was the norm, perhaps then that legislation had some value.  I do not know, but I know that in 1980 in does not and we would like to change it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> A number of arguments have been put forward to retain the action and to these I want to refer briefly.  In doing so I must omit, because time does not allow, any survey of similar legislation in other countries but those interested will see that the essence of what I am saying is correct, that this particular legislation is not on the statute books of other countries and that where a replacement action was introduced, it is not effective if by effective we mean helping to create the harmony and quality of human relationships essential to a marriage if it is to be a good marriage.  The arguments against removing this legislation are something like these.  We are told that the former concept of the action in which a wife was supposedly akin to a chattel of a husband has been replaced by the view that the action protects the stability of the marriage relationship and that this view could clearly involve a right of action for each spouse.  I would find it anomalous if a statute, a Bill or a ministerial regulation enacted to do one thing by some mechanism in it or by the passage of time had come to be construed as something else.  It is a very dubious argument and, as far as I am concerned, it is not acceptable because that is not what the initial intention was. The passage of time surely does not erode the principle of an enactment set out a long time ago.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the legal position of married women has changed radically from the time when the action for criminal conversation originated. They now have certain advantages which they did not have then, like equal succession rights, equal rights to guardianship and so on, and therefore the action for criminal conversation should not be allowed to remain frozen in its historical condition.</P>
    <P>Advances have been made in those areas, small in some cases and large in others, and this is another area where we should be willing to have the courage to make similar advances.  Article 40 of the Constitution apparently tells us that the woman may have the reciprocal right here if she contests it.  Allowing <Col N="1282" /> for the fact that this is a possibility, I believe that the essential tort does not help marriage, that a vague reference to the rights of women under the Constitution does not help women who in many cases are economically disenfranchised and that failure to amend this law is cowardice on the part of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>There are other points as well but in my view they are spurious and have not at their core the concern or the commitment which I believe this House has in the eighties to enact legislation and to have attitudes and innovations fashioned in the belief that men and women in this country are equal in human rights and all that follows therefrom.  I appeal to the Minister to give a sympathetic hearing to the Bill to do everything possible to introduce the spirit of this Bill and to co-operate with the House in doing this at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that Deputy Keating has been using Working Paper No. 5 of the Law Reform Commission quite a lot.  He has quoted reasons from it for total abolition and then reasons for its retention and simply disagreed with the latter. It is fair to say that he was unintentionally picking and choosing.  He should point to their conclusions.  The particular working paper is a working paper.  The Law Reform Commission report makes recommendations which are totally at variance with the Bill which the Deputy is proposing to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating's Bill proposes to abolish the right of action known in law as an action for criminal conversation. Despite the description of the action it is not of course a criminal procedure but a civil and a non-legal action: it is a civil action for adultery.  Before the Deputy was reported in the newspapers to be planning to present this Bill I had answered a parliamentary question by Deputy Eileen Desmond as to whether I proposed to introduce legislation to abolish this right of action.  This was a written question and was answered by me on 22 November last.  It is reported <Col N="1283" /> at column 240 of the Official Report. The answer was in the following terms:</P>
    <P>I have already publicly stated that I am in no doubt that, in so far as the law in this matter applies differently to men and to women it should be changed.  Equality of treatment may, however, be provided for in a number of different ways.  The provisional recommendation of the law Reform Commission&mdash;I assume that the Deputy is aware that it was a provisional recommendation on which comment was invited&mdash;does of course involve the ending of the present legal action and the introduction of a new type of action which, apart from being non-discriminatory as between the spouses would also be available for the benefit of children of the marriage. The final recommendation of the Commission is not yet available and I am not in a position to indicate what the Government's intention may be.</P>
    <P>It will be clearly seen from the terms of that reply that as far as the action of criminal conversation involved discrimination against one of the spouses in marriage I had already indicated that it should be changed and that the only issue was whether it should simply be abolished or whether some other non-discriminatory right of action should be substituted.</P>
    <P>That was not the first time that I had publicly adverted to the matter.  I publicly indicated my view that the law must and would be changed to cater for the discriminatory aspect of the criminal conversation action in the course of a speech I made on 26 September 1978, when I think Deputy Desmond was present, to the AIM group.  That speech was widely publicised.  In it I adverted to another very relevant point, that there are certain other legal actions that obviously ought to be dealt with at the same time and on similar principles. However, I make clear that the necessary changes, as far as I am concerned, would be part of my plans during the life of the present Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> It can be seen, therefore, that the Deputy has presented this Bill with the purpose of securing my agreement and that of the Government for the removal of the discriminatory aspect of this kind of action.  My views on that are well and truly known.  As I have said, however, there are two further basic questions to be faced.  The first is that we should deal at the same time and on similar principles with certain other types of action, such as an action known as enticement of the spouse.  Secondly, we must ask if we should simply abolish all such legal actions, or do we substitute something for them?  In this connection it is important that we should bear in mind that although the right to take an action for criminal conversation appears to be vested in one spouse only, it is distinctly possible that the courts might nowadays decide otherwise if the matter were raised.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in Working Paper No. 5, at pages 6 to 10, set out a number of arguments in support of the proposition, that even under the law as it stands a wife has a right of action for criminal conversation.  Be that as it may, there seems to be no doubt that some other legal actions, including in particular that of enticement of a spouse, are equally open to both spouses.  The Law Reform Commission, incidentally, dealt with the legal action of enticement and harbouring of a spouse in the working paper which dealt with criminal conversation.  If, therefore, the Oireachtas were to opt for simple abolition of criminal conversation and in accordance with the same underlying principle were to do the same with the other actions, as in logic it ought to do, then we ought to be quite clear in our minds about one thing, that is, that we would not just be abolishing a right of action that may discriminate as between the two spouses&mdash;it is not certain that it does&mdash;but also abolishing another type of legal action to which the issue of nondiscrimination does not apply at all. There are of course several arguments in favour of simple abolition of the right of action called criminal conversation and indeed, of some other actions as well but <Col N="1285" /> at this point I shall concentrate on criminal conversation.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy wait a few seconds.  I think he has out-distanced himself on this.  There are several arguments in favour of the simple abolition of the right of action called criminal conversation and some other actions as well but I shall concentrate here on criminal conversation.  The Law Reform Commission lists six separate arguments for simple abolition in chapter 5 of the Working Paper No. 5 but they also list five arguments in favour of retaining the principle of the right of action by means of a new non-discriminatory right of action. On balance the commission came down provisionally on the side of providing such a new right of action for the benefit of the family.  I say provisionally because this was not the final recommendation but one made as a basis for comment.  It was, however, similar in its thinking to recommendations made in their subsequent Working Paper No. 6 relating to seduction and the enticement and harbouring of a child and their Working Paper No. 7 relating to loss of consortium and loss of services of a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For reasons I shall mention in a few moments I do not intend to repeat at this stage the various arguments either for or against complete abolition as set out by the commission as might occur to me, nor do I think it right at this stage to argue where the balance of argument lies.  I take this view for two reasons. First, the president of the commission, being appraised of the fact that I would be called on to contribute to this debate, has been good enough to let me know that the commission expect to be able in the immediate future to secure the services of a professional draftsman.  They have every hope of being about to present their recommendations on all these legal actions quite soon and on that basis I am satisfied that it would be possible to await the commission's final recommendations, to give them due consideration, <Col N="1287" /> and yet have legislation not only introduced, if both Houses are so disposed, but actually enacted before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Let me say in passing that I received this information about the commission's expectations because of the particular circumstances of my having to speak in this debate.  This does not imply any change in the statutory position relating to the presentation of reports by the commission, which is a matter in which I have no function.</P>
    <P>My second reason for not seeking to reach a decision at this stage is that there are valid arguments on both sides and they need to be carefully weighed.  On the one hand there are undoubtedly cogent arguments in favour of total abolition of such actions even on the assumption that they would be non-discriminatory, including an argument centering on the fact that they involve, unnecessarily it would be said, the parading of marital discord in public.</P>
    <P>But there are strong counter arguments that cannot be ignored of which the central one is the argument that the provision of a right of action provided that it is non-discriminatory is an expression, and perhaps a necessary expression, of the State's constitutional guarantee to protect the family and to guard with special care the institution of marriage.  There is little point in looking to what has been done elsewhere if only because of the availability of civil divorce in most countries and divorce on what is called a no fault basis.  In this State, however, we must assess the situation in the context of our own basic law on marriage.  Moreover it is more useful to bear in mind that such actions are heard before a jury and that juries nowadays represent a fair cross-section of the community and they represent women equally with men.  Accordingly, if the jury gives an award of substantial damages it does so not because it is obliged to but because, on all the facts of a particular case, this cross-section of citizens think it right to do so.  They are free to award contentious damages if they wish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and legal actions of the kind we are referring to are very few; there probably have not been half a dozen in the last ten years.  But it is important to recognise that in the small number of cases which have arisen juries have tended to award significant damages.  The advent of more women on juries does not seem to have altered this attitude.  This seems to reflect a conviction on the part of the ordinary members of a jury that there are cases where a serious injury has been done and where it is right that the law should provide for the award for damages.</P>
      <P>Against that background we must consider whether the abolition of all right of action in this area could be interpreted as a declaration by the Oireachtas that these matters are no longer of any significance.  I would emphasise again that I am not trying to weigh the arguments on one side as against the other but only asking the Dáil to keep an open mind for the time being on the basis that legislation, with the support of the Government, should not only be ready to be introduced but, I hope, will be enacted before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment Deputy Keating on bringing this measure before the House.  He has brought a concise but very significant Bill to our attention and in doing so he has done a great service to the cause of Irish women.  I pledge the support of the Labour Party for this Bill should Deputy Keating decide not to accept the Minister's case for doing absolutely nothing for some time yet and to go ahead to put this Bill to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existence of this action of criminal conversation more than any other, or perhaps taken together with those actions of harbouring and enticing, have served to infuriate those women who have had any consciousness of themselves as full human beings, with full intellectual capacity, with legal personalities in their own right.  Its <Col N="1289" /> existence has been extremely offensive to the dignity of women as persons.  It is very difficult for women who are the victims of an action such as this to maintain what the Minister asks for, an open mind on the subject.  It is an act so obnoxious and archaic in concept that one wonders how it has survived into the 1980s.  I am disappointed by the lack of urgency in the Minister's speech this evening.  His attitude seems to be that we must proceed very slowly and carefully in this area.  There seems to be no cognisance of the sensibilities of people who have been so offended by the presence of this action in our laws.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Keating pointed out, there is general acceptance in this House that change is warranted in this area. However, there are those among us, possibly even in this House, who consider that we should give priority to other measures that, in their view, merit immediate attention.  They accept that the subject matter of this debate may be offensive to the sensibilities of some people but they think it has little relevance in practice.  It is no harm to remind the House that since 1972 there have been some notable actions for criminal conversation. I can recall immediately four such cases.  There was the Braun and Roche case in 1972 where £12,000 damages were awarded; there was the Maher and Collins case in 1976; the McNally and Anderson case in 1976, and there was the Mulraney case as late as 1979 where £1,500 was awarded.  It is no harm to remind the House that these and other actions for criminal conversation have been taken in the recent past.</P>
    <P>The incredible rationale behind the action for criminal conversation is that a person having sexual relations with a married woman is violating a property right of her husband.  She is a mere chattel of her husband.  Whatever the Minister may say about a corresponding right being available to a woman, in practice this is the way it has worked in this State and elsewhere.  The woman is regarded as a property right and her standing in the matter of criminal conversation is akin to any other piece of <Col N="1290" /> property the husband may possess.  As Deputy Keating pointed out, in giving a man a right of action for damages against a person who has had sexual relations with his wife the consent of the wife is not a relevant issue.</P>
    <P>A matter that is very hurtful to the women's lobby and the thinking female population generally is that the conduct of the husband however disgraceful it may be does not constitute a bar to an action although it may have some relevance in the matter of assessing damages.  Whatever might be the conduct of the husband, he is quite entitled to go ahead with the action for criminal conversation.  This is a particularly offensive anomaly in an area where discrimination against women is so shamelessly blatant.  The husband can condone the adulterous conduct but yet he can have a right to action.  The wife may even have died but yet the husband can still go ahead with the action.  In law the wife is regarded as a mindless piece of property of which her husband has been deprived and for which deprivation he must be compensated adequately.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the House to a decision made by Chief Justice O'Higgins in the Maher and Collins case of 1975, to which Deputy Keating referred in his speech.  In considering what would be taken into account in awarding damages, the Chief Justice said it would be as follows: (a) the actual value of the wife to her husband and (b) the compensation necessary for the injury to the husband's feelings and the blow to his marital honour.</P>
    <P>There are two separate aspects of the value of a wife.  The first is the pecuniary aspect in relation to her assistance to her husband, to his business and so on and secondly, the consortium aspect in relation to which her qualities as a wife and mother, her conduct and general character, are relevant.  In a case in England in 1920&mdash;the Butterworth case&mdash;in relation to the assessment of damages, the Judge felt that the wealth of the person against whom the husband was taking the action could be a relevant factor in ascertaining the value of the wife.  In <Col N="1291" /> other words, if it takes a man of wealth to seduce her she can be taken to be worth more to her husband.  What an attitude towards women.</P>
    <P>It is horrifying to reflect on the existence of such a concept of human beings as chattels still existing in our laws in 1980.  Even the judges who are required to apply the law as they found it existing are on record as having found that law repugnant.  For instance, Lord Chief Justice Diplock in the English case of Pritchard in 1967 said: &ldquo;I confess I find it repugnant to modern and sensible ideas&rdquo;.  The Minister has said that there is a case perhaps for the wife to have a right to take an action in this area but that has never been exercised.  It is very doubtful if it would succeed but even if such an option existed the concept is still a shameful one.</P>
    <P>It is worth summarising the position obtaining in other countries, particularly those countries with whom we compare ourselves and with whom we have contact. In England the action for criminal conversation was abolished by the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857.  That Act substituted a power in the divorce courts to award damages for adultery to petitioning husbands.  Even that latter right was abolished in England in 1970. That country dealt effectively with the matter a considerable time ago.  In Northern Ireland the action for criminal conversation was abolished in 1939 and it was replaced by a measure more or less on the same lines as the later English law.  This was abolished in 1978 on the recommendation of the Office of Law Reform in Northern Ireland which stated that the action was based on an outmoded view of marriage in that it gave the husband a proprietary right over the wife.  It was abolished in Scotland in January 1971 following the report of the law commission that the human degradation of the wife which such action entailed was not acceptable.  In all of these cases and in the case that we fought the wife had a similar right in action. She was the victim, the inanimate object, the matter over which two contending <Col N="1292" /> males fought in all these cases and it was found to be unacceptable to human dignity and degrading for the women concerned.  No action such as I have mentioned applies in countries like France and Germany with which we have a lot of contact today.</P>
    <P>If we go across the Atlantic we find that a very interesting attitude obtains in the state of Ontario, Canada.  The Ontario Law Reform Commission recommended the abolition of criminal conversation in 1969.  The Ontario Supreme Court held that the action was abolished implicitly by their 1975 Law Reform Act which stated that parties to a marriage should have legal personalities that are independent, separate and distinct from each other.  That is a very good concept on which to work.  Several states of the USA abolished the action in the early thirties and since then it has ceased to be an action in the majority of the other states of the USA as a result of either judicial decision or statutory intervention. It has ceased even in places like the West Indies.</P>
    <P>One could continue to quote cases of other countries and the action they have taken to rid their laws of this shameful concept, but one does not need to reach for further examples to come to the conclusion that we are one of the last bastions of this outmoded, archaic, totally degrading action.  We cannot dally much longer about it.  People feel very strongly that a change is much overdue.  We are indebted to Deputy Keating for giving it great urgency and bringing it on to the floor of the House for consideration in a manner in which otherwise it possibly would not have been brought, and for giving us the opportunity to debate it tonight.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted the Law Reform Commission and I suppose we are all quoting them to some extent.  The case is made that the action as it stands might not be constitutional.  That is the general attitude.  Like other constitutional cases possibly it would take people of means to contest it in the courts.  There are several constitutional test cases which would be interesting if it were possible to <Col N="1293" /> try them but in this situation we are probably more advanced in our thinking, as everybody agrees, and there should be no need for such action.</P>
    <P>This matter should be dealt with on the floor of this House by amending legislation such as this Bill seeks to provide.  This can and should be done with very little delay.  The Law Reform Commission recommend that the action be replaced by a new action.  There will be a general feeling that we may consider replacing the action by a new section for adultery to be taken by either spouse. We are all entitled to our own views on this.  My view is that this recommendation would seem to be at variance with the provision which obtains in most of these enlightened countries to which I have referred.  It seems to be at variance also with the policy contained in some of our recent legislation, for instance, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 which provides that adultery is not an absolute bar to maintenance.  The courts have also adopted such an enlightened view by holding that it is the welfare of the children of the marriage which is paramount under the Guardianship of Infants Act and accordingly do not automatically bar an adultrous parent from being granted custody of children.</P>
    <P>The principal reason put forward for extending the action for adultery to both partners is that an action of this nature would protect the integrity of the family. Here I agree totally with Deputy Keating when he talks about the interest of the family and the much needed contribution that an action such as this has made to the interest of the family.  The Law Reform Commission have a special job to do but it would be spurious for the Members of this House to advance the interest of the family as the reason for not taking action in this matter while so many other matters of real concern to the interests of the family are left unattended. If we want to keep families united, prospering and happy and whatever else is desirable, there are things we can do.  You can ensure that each family has proper housing, proper recreation for the <Col N="1294" /> children and wages, social welfare or income from whatever source to enable them to have the basic necessities of life. We can have proper counselling and a basic education.  All these things combine to make for family happiness and give all families the opportunity of staying together and of enjoying the benefits of the more fortunate.  A number of reasons can be advanced for the disintegration of families but I agree with Deputy Keating that this is not one of them.  There is no point in trying to suggest to any thinking person that it has any effect whatsoever when there are so many obvious reasons to which we could address our minds.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the narrow concept we are debating at the moment.  In Scotland, where some consideration of this matter has taken place, it has been found that the existence of the right to damages has not in any way prevented an increase in the number of divorce decrees in Scotland arising from cases of adultery.  Therefore, it seems to be established that there is no connection whatsoever between this and the integrity or interest of the family, and our experience is that that is so.  Our experience as public representatives with the problems of families generally is that there are many aspects of family life to which we could be addressing ourselves if we were really concerned about keeping families together, and this is not one of them.  The approach in the case of Ontario in which each partner is seen as a separate, distinct, independent, legal personality, provides the very best foundation upon which to base human rights and to build reformative legislation.  If we treat individuals as equals, as independent, legal personalities with separate rights, we will be more enlightened in the reforming legislation that we hope to have.  We have had a glut of it before this House in recent times in the area of women's rights.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to say a few words about the women's rights movement.  That movement in this country has had generally very considerable success in focusing public attention on <Col N="1295" /> the injustices perpetrated against women in Irish society.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Deputy Keating for listing the organisations concerned.  Those of us who seek to reform society and to rid it of some if not all of the more blatant discriminations that exist are indebted to the women's movement for the manner in which they have guided us as to the priorities and the more keenly conceived injustices as far as they are concerned. We are grateful to them for the pressure of public opinion which they have whipped up and also for the implementation of the EEC Directives in the area of women's rights.  This has brought a measure of legislative reform in recent years although there has been a dearth of reform since 1977.  The past two years have been pretty barren so far as any reforming legislation is concerned but particularly in the area of women's rights, and I would appeal to the Minister to make up for those two years during the rest of his term of office.  I hope that all the ideas and views in relation to reforms in this area will shortly be incorporated in legislation introduced by the Minister, such as the Bill produced here tonight by Deputy Keating.</P>
    <P>We are still awaiting action in several areas of women's rights, in family law and so on.  The question of joint ownership of the family home, which was discussed thoroughly here recently, the question of community property and the question of legal aid, are all very complicated matters.  The scheme for free legal aid is very slow in getting off the ground and this is very important in the area of women's rights because here we are talking about women many of whom do not have independent incomes and whose only hopes lies in getting free legal aid to obtain redress.  There is a limited form of legal aid with which neither we nor women are satisfied.  While all these matters have complications, there is no doubt but that the abolition of this glaring inequity in the law is not a complicated matter.  We must take the Minister's word for it that he is near a <Col N="1296" /> conclusion in this matter but I am apprehensive about the conclusion the Minister would reach.  I prefer Deputy Keating's conclusion as set out in his Bill.</P>
    <P>The reform working paper was published in 1978 and observations were invited up to 1979.  The Minister now says that he will have a measure before us in a very short time.  Almost one year has elapsed since observations were invited and the measure should be on the floor of the House shortly.</P>
    <P>Whatever action the Minister takes, the debate this evening has served a useful purpose and I hope it has convinced the Minister that the sensibilities of women have been offended regardless of the Minister's plea that they should keep an open mind.  I do not blame the Minister for this offence; we all share a certain amount of the blame, as this is something that should have been attended to a long time ago.  However, this Government have been particularly tardy in bringing forward legislation in this area.  This Bill has certainly hastened some form of legislation.  The Minister said that he will not accept this Bill but that he intends to bring in a Bill in the near future, the contents of which he cannot tell us, but it appears that it will be along the lines of the suggestion put forward in the law reform report.  Should Deputy Keating proceed with this Bill he will certainly have the support of the Members on these benches, and should he decide to await the Minister's pleasure I sincerely hope the Minister will ensure that there is legislation on this subject before the House within a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that this Bill gives the House an opportunity to discuss a very important aspect of law reform.  In that context the Bill as a discussion document is to be welcomed. Whilst the Bill itself is new, what it ennunciates is not new.  During the term of the last Government between 1973 and 1977 whilst addressing a number of women's organisations, I condemned outright the civil wrong of criminal conversation. I based my views on the fact <Col N="1297" /> that the action itself discriminated against women and that that is completely wrong.  I have no hesitation in supporting the principle enshrined in the Bill, but I would ask the House to wait until the end of the year to see what the Government have in mind in this context and in relation to other matters which the Minister will bring to the attention of the House.  Having waited so long I am prepared to accept the Minister's request to wait until the end of the year to see what will come before us.  If the action of criminal conversation were tested under the Constitution by way of a constitutional action it would be found to be unconstitutional because it discriminates against women.  On the other hand, an <Col N="1298" /> anomaly arises where if a woman decided to proceed against another woman for her adulterous behaviour with her husband, she would succeed. On the one hand, we have a situation where if the action was tested constitutionally it would be found to be unconstitutional and, on the other hand, if the woman took the action against the other woman she would probably succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of discontinuing the provision by local authorities of loans for the purchase of sites by members of registered housing co-operatives or indeed by any other eligible applicants.  Section 39 of the Housing Act, 1966, enables local authorities to advance a loan to a person for the purpose of acquiring or constructing a private house and such loans may include site costs.</P>
      <P>The recent circular issued to local authorities by my Department, to which the Deputy refers, notified them of certain improvements in their housing loan schemes including, <i>inter alia</i>, the increase from £9,000 to £12,000 in the amount which they may advance as well as an increase from £4,000 to £5,000 in the annual income eligibility limit.  I emphasise, therefore, that purchasers of local authority sites are entitled to have the cost of the sites included in their housing loans provided the total amount advanced in this way does not exceed the maximum limit of £12,000 permitted by the statutory regulations.</P>

    <P>(i)  Application of the agricultural grant allowances to the above holdings in 1980 would mean an estimated increase of £6 million in the amount of the grant.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The saving to the Exchequer from the exclusion of the above holdings from relief would depend on the extent to which the £6 million would be offset by credits against income tax allowed in respect of rate payments on the holdings.  At this stage there is no reliable basis on which this can be estimated.</P>

The letting of dwellings is an executive function which is discharged by the manager who must let the dwellings in accordance with the local scheme of letting priorities adopted by the elected representatives and approved by the Minister.

      <P>The ESB have informed me that they have carried out a large number of surveys around the country, including the Skerries area.  The object of these surveys was to identify suitable locations for the construction of conventional power stations.  The survey was merely a contingency measure in case the Government should decide at a future date on the building of conventional generating stations at new sites in addition to those already approved.  No specific decision has been taken by the ESB or by the Government regarding the building of such stations, their capacity or location.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the ESB that the ash tonnage and volume figures referred to by the Deputy for a 1,000 MW coal-fired power station are approximately 50 per cent greater that those estimated by the ESB.</P>

      <P>My predecessor stated in the Dáil on 8 November 1979 that the Government deplore violations of human rights wherever they occur, and that the reported widespread violation of human rights in El Salvador was a source of serious concern to them.  This continues to be the case.  It appeared that the administration which took over following the departure of General Romero in October 1979 was committed to a policy of liberalisation and redress of injustices.  The country has experienced a period of political turbulence since the resignation of that Government in December last.  It is the view of the Government that progress towards respect for human rights can best be assured through the restoration of stability under a representative regime. In the meantime Ireland, along with the other member states of the EEC, is keeping the situation in El Salvador under review and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The special purchase scheme provided by Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, came into operation on 1 August, 1978.  From that date to 29 February 1980, inclusive, a total of 4,041 vesting certificates has been issued on foot of ground rents bought out under that scheme.  It is not possible to say how many additional ground rents may have been bought out under the purchase procedure provided by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, since that procedure involves the intervention of the county registrar as arbitrator only in disputed cases.</P>
      <P>The figure of 350,000 ground rents mentioned in the Question is presumably the Deputy's own estimate.

      <P>Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation with certain exceptions in the Dublin area, is vested by law in local authorities. It is accepted that there are some venues where the court accommodation is less than satisfactory.  I am at present having an inquiry carried out to establish the level of improvements, if any, required at the various court venues throughout the country.  When the results of the inquiry are available consideration will be given to the question of how best to effect any improvements in court accommodation which may be required.  It is only fair to point out here that in many cases, particularly in the more isolated areas, local authorities rent privately-owned accommodation in order to fulfil their obligations. The alternative of providing purpose-built court accommodation may have to be considered in some instances, but the cost, by reference to the volume of business and the number of sittings, would be high.</P>
      <P>Each local authority make their own arrangements to meet their commitments in regard to court accommodation by appropriate provisions in their annual estimates. These provisions cover such items as heat, light, rent, rates, wages of caretakers, repairs and maintenance, new building, professional fees, office furniture and fittings, repayment of loans and insurance.  The total amounts provided in local authority estimates in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979 for expenditure on these items were £553,121, £648,280, £782,334 and £1,012,112 respectively, according to information furnished by the Department of the Environment. The corresponding figure for 1975 is not available and could not be compiled without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision and maintenance of court accomodation in the Dublin city area, with the exception of the courthouse accommodation at Green Street which is provided by Dublin Corporation, is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, who made provision for the following amounts for improvement <Col N="1169" /> and maintenance of court accommodation over the past five years:</P>

    <P>In 1979 the Office of Public Works also made provision for a sum of £50,000 in respect of expenditure on the reconstruction of Waterford Courthouse, which, as a result of <i>mandamus</i> proceedings in the High Court, they are required to carry out.  Any sums expended by the Office of Public Works on this project are recoverable from the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>An extra courtroom has recently been provided in Cork courthouse.  Arrangements are in hands to provide in the Four Courts an additional jury court <Col N="1170" /> complex for use by both the Circuit Court and the High Court and an additional non-jury courtroom for the High Court and, in view of the increasing business generated by the expanding population of the greater Dublin area, the needs of the District Court in Dublin city and county are being kept under review.  I propose to consult with the President of the District Court as to whether it might be appropriate to provide additional court venues in the new suburbs.  If it is decided that any additional venues are necessary the question of making suitable premises available will be taken up with Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>A list of the locations in each county at which court accommodation is provided is appended.  There is no information available in my Department on the amount of money spent at each location in the past five years.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the normal procedure, the plans for the library portion of the proposed centre were sent for approval to an Chomhairle Leabharlanna by the county council in November 1979.  When the recommendation of an chomhairle is received, I will be in a position to consider the loan application for the library part of the Dunboyne scheme in the context of the capital available for library projects generally.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office is the official source of statistics relating to industrial disputes.  Statistics published by that office, which are expressed in terms of man-days lost, not in man-hours, show that the number of man-days lost through strikes in 1977 and 1978 were 442,145 and 624,266 respectively.</P>
      <P>Figures are not yet available from the CSO in respect of man-days lost during 1979, but my Department estimate that the figure was approximately 1,427,000. Of these 1,315,000 occurred during the six months up to 30 June 1979.</P>

      <P>(a) Expenditure figures for 1979 have not yet been finalised.  In general it may be stated that the savings, where they occurred, may be attributed to the fact that building did not progress as rapidly as anticipated owing to the inclement weather during the first half of 1979.</P>
      <P>(b) The capital provision for each financial year is calculated with reference to estimated expenditure on projects during that year and does not have savings of a previous year built into it.</P>

Prior to 1973 the yearly average was 24 paid or credited contributions but when pension age was reduced the average was lowered in order to avoid hardship to persons who might otherwise have qualified for a contributory pension but for this reduction.  It is not proposed at present to lower the yearly average of contributions paid or credited below the existing level.  The matter is, however, being examined in connection with the proposed introduction of a scheme of income-related pensions.</P>

    <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was employed in a temporary capacity by CIE up to 1960 when he was admitted to the company's pension scheme on his promotion to foreman.  As a result he ceased to be insurable under the Social Welfare Acts for old age contributory pensions purposes.  Subsequent to his retirement on pension in 1975 he applied <Col N="1196" /> for an old age contributory pension but he was not qualified as his yearly average reckonable contributions from 1953 was less than 20.  He appealed against the decision disallowing his claim for an old age contributory pension but the appeals officer to whom the matter was referred upheld the decision.</P>
    <P>On the claim form for contributory pension he intimated that he did not wish to be considered for a non-contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>The cabling scheme has not, I regret, been completed as had been envisaged; the delay in completing it has been due to the diversion of jointing staff to maintenance work following the heavy flood damage last winter.  It has been possible, however, to provide service to 55 applicants in the area, including 25 of those waiting for service in December 1978, from the work done so far.  It is expected that the cabling work will be completed and service provided for the remaining applicants during the second half of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the European Communities (Merchandise Road Transport) Regulations 1977, which give effect in this country to Council Directive No. 74/561/EEC on access to the haulage occupation, persons or firms carrying on <Col N="1203" /> merchandise road transport businesses must (subject to certain exemptions) hold a road freight certificate as from I January 1978.</P>
      <P>The road freight certificate is proof that the holder complies with the provisions of the regulations in relation to good repute, financial standing and professional competence or has been exempted from some or all of these requirements by reason of being in the business before specified dates.  The regulations apply to persons or undertakings operating merchandise road transport business (i.e. the owners of such business) and not to the drivers of the vehicles engaged therein.</P>
      <P>The road freight certificate does not confer any right on the holder to engage in the type of haulage for which a merchandise licence is required unless he is also the holder of a merchandise licence authorising such carriage.</P>
