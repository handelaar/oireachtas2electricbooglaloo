      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £291,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I would propose to discuss the Supplementary Estimates for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Foreign Affairs is required to meet additional expenditure on five subheads of the Vote &mdash; travel and incidental expenses, Post Office services, repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens <Col N="1128" /> abroad, cultural relations with other countries and contributions to bodies in Ireland for the furtherance of international relations.  The total of the additional sums required, £885,000 is partly offset by savings elsewhere in the Vote amounting to £320,000 and by an anticipated increase of £274,000 in appropriations-in-aid. The net additional sum required for the five subheads is, therefore, £291,000.</P>
    <P>The increase required for travel and incidental expenses arises for a number of reasons which could not be adequately foreseen when the original provision was agreed.  In addition to travelling costs this subhead also provides for communications expenses for our missions abroad. The cost of these services is constantly on the increase and this is a factor over which my Department can exercise no control. I am of course fully aware of the necessity to exercise maximum economies in the expenditure areas covered by this subhead but my Department must meet their unavoidable commitments in terms of mandatory attendance at meetings and of providing necessary facilities in missions abroad including new missions.  The additional sum now sought is the minimum required to enable these commitments to be adequately met for the remainder of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The additional £100,000 required for Post Office services is for the most part due to the delay in the receipt of accounts because of the postal strike last year.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate accurately the provision required for repatriation and maintenance of distressed Irish citizens abroad.  On the basis of the expenditure so far this year it is expected that an additional £9,000 will be required to meet the demands of this subhead.  Much of the moneys advanced from this subhead are recovered and this is reflected in increased receipts in appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The additional sum proposed for subhead E, cultural relations with other countries, is required for the winding-up of the affairs of &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo;, the Festival of the Arts of Ireland which took place in London in February and March this year.  Deputies will, I think, agree <Col N="1129" /> that this festival was very successful, comprising as it did over 90 exhibitions and performances of music, theatre, ballet, films, lectures and seminars by participants from all over Ireland at over 40 London venues.  Contributions towards the festival were forthcoming from bodies and individuals in both Ireland and Britain.  The festival was enthusiastically endorsed by the Government and can be said to have played a significant part in promoting Anglo-Irish relations.  It will be appreciated that it was difficult for the organisers to anticipate accurately exact costings of a festival of this magnitude and the further sum now sought is to cover such unforeseen costs.</P>
    <P>The £1,000 required for subhead G is to enable payment of the grant of £1,000 for 1980 to be paid to the Irish United Nations Association.  Because of accounting requirements it was not possible for my Department to pay the 1979 grant of £1,000 last year and it is therefore necessary to make two payments in the current year.  The contribution to the association continues to be at the level of £1,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The total of the sums required for the five subheads will, as I have said, be offset to some extent by a saving in subhead A &mdash; salaries.  This saving arises in the main because of vacancies which were unavoidably left unfilled for a large portion of the current year.  It was not possible to forecast at the beginning of the year with any degree of accuracy where or to what extent vacancies would arise in missions abroad.</P>
    <P>The expenditure excesses are also partly offset by an anticipated increase in appropriations-in-aid.  Receipts have been greater than provided for because of the increase in the rates of the passport and other consular fees which came into effect at the beginning of June this year and also because of a heavier demand on these services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Supplementary Estimate for the Vote for International Co-operation, Deputies will see that this is for a token sum of £10 to enable transfers to be made between subheads within the original provision for this Vote.  The <Col N="1130" /> approval of the Dáil is required before expenditure from grant-in-aid subheads can be made in excess of the amounts originally provided.</P>
    <P>Subhead G of the Vote for International Co-operation for 1980 concerns payments for the benefit of developing countries arising from our membership of the European Economic Community. In the 1980 Estimate, £3,733,500 was provided for the purpose of meeting Ireland's contribution to the Fourth and Fifth European Development Funds, established under the Lomé Convention, and to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), in addition to providing for any contingencies in the matter of exchange rate fluctuations which might arise in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>In the event, Ireland's contribution to the Fourth EDF in 1980, as revised by the European Commission in the course of the year, amounted to £2,172,337 which is £427,663 less than anticipated. The Second Convention of Lomé has not yet entered into force and consequently there will be no call-up of the Fifth EDF funds in 1980.  The allocation of £643,000 for the Fifth EDF will, therefore, not be called upon.  Negotiations on the replenishment of IFAD &mdash; the International Fund for Agricultural Development &mdash; established in 1977, have been taking place during the year, but progress has been slower than expected.  At this stage, it seems likely that the remaining issues will in fact be settled before the end of the year, but payments to IFAD II will not become due until 1981.  There is, therefore, an additional saving of £190,000 this year on subhead G, which, together with savings on the contingency provision, amount in all to an estimated unexpended balance of £1,511,000.</P>
    <P>I propose that £100,000 of this amount be transferred to subhead D, disaster relief, in order that I may be able to respond to appeals for emergency assistance between now and the end of the year.  I propose that a further £100,000 be transferred to subhead C for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO). APSO enables individuals who have skills and experience to offer to travel to <Col N="1131" /> countries of the Third World and to participate in the development of these countries.  The additional amount now being made available to the agency will enable them to meet all their commitments in relation to personnel overseas and to discharge their responsibilities.  I also propose that £159,000 be transferred to subhead B, contributions to UN voluntary agencies, to constitute an additional contribution to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which is the main UN Agency for Technical Co-operation, and as such, has a very high standing in both developed and developing countries.</P>
    <P>Finally I propose that the balance, amounting to £1,202,000, be transferred to subhead E.  This subhead covers payments to the grant-in-aid fund for bilateral and other aid contributions to developing countries, for which a sum of £2,275,000 has been provided in the original estimate.  The additional amount will be used to meet our existing commitments to the bilateral aid programme this year.</P>
    <P>In our bilateral aid programme we have sought to put into practice the principles and policies which guide our approach to development co-operation and, in addition, to complement our contribution to development through the various multilateral agencies.  The programme which was initiated in 1973 is still at a very early stage in its development. Nevertheless, in a few short years we have laid the foundation for a comprehensive programme of co-operation.  In formulating our bilateral aid programme we have been guided by the experience of other countries which have been active in this field longer than ourselves.  We have also sought to use the resources and expertise which we acquired in the course of our own development together with the tremendous enthusiasm and generosity which has always characterised the approach of Irish people to the Third World.</P>
    <P>We recognise that real and sustained development requires the building up of Third World countries from within.  In the long-term it is the people of the Third, <Col N="1132" /> World themselves who must assure their own development.  What we can do is to provide the technical assistance these countries require.  For this reason we have given an absolute priority in our bilateral aid programme to the provision of technical assistance.  We are conscious also of the overriding need to assist the least developed countries.  We realise too clearly that in terms of the vast needs that exist in the Third World the quantity of assistance which we can provide could never amount to more than a drop in the ocean.  We hope, however, that if we can in some way help to encourage and motivate these people to help themselves then our efforts will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned earlier in the year the establishment of the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation.  The council has already begun to pursue its task actively and I am confident that its advice to the Government will be of valuable help in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Initially I was delighted to learn of the proposal to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for Foreign Affairs and, in particular, of International Co-operation.  I felt that when the Government and the Minister had decided to introduce such Supplementary Estimates they were responding to the urgings of Fine Gael, Labour, the voluntary bodies involved in international assistance, Bishop Casey, indeed many other good people who have been devoting their time, effort and personal moneys towards promoting international aid to the Third World.  In fact I thought the Government had undergone a change of heart, having reneged on their earlier commitments to the Third World.  I looked forward with great anticipation to the figures we would be asked to approve in this House particularly in the area of international co-operation.  I am afraid my hopes and expectations have been dashed in that we are merely dealing with a Supplementary Estimate in the token or paltry sum of £10.  From that point of view it is clear that the Government have not had a change of heart, have not decided to revert to their original commitment to the Third World and have not decided to implement the targets <Col N="1133" /> announced by them before and after they came into power in 1977.</P>
      <P>At the same time I accept that there is some benefit in having this Supplementary Estimate before the House.  I must give the Minister credit for that because, without its introduction as it now stands, there would have been a leakage of approximately £1,500,000 in our development aid.  Quite frankly it is of some benefit, because to ensure that the figure originally estimated is not reduced further by this sum of £1,500,000, the Minister has taken steps to provide that the amounts unspent in multilateral aid are being transferred to bilateral aid.  From that point of view there is some benefit in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>At the same time I must strongly place on record my disappointment that the Minister has merely stopped short at preventing that leakage.  While we are dealing with this Supplementary Estimate in the area of international co-operation, and bearing in mind discussions both inside and outside this House over the past 12 months, it seems fairly clear that a totally new approach is needed.  In this regard I am somewhat concerned by the approach of the Minister in his speech in which he made no reference at all to the overall target at which the Government should be aiming nor did he make any reference at all to the steps by which such target should be achieved.  He virtually writes off the question of any such target by referring to the amount of aid which would come from Ireland as being merely a drop in the ocean.  I do not subscribe to that view at all.  Even though the problem is enormous I believe it is only by each country playing its part, doing its bit, by a combination of all the developed countries doing so, that the problem can be in any way tackled.  Therefore, taking the approach here that no matter what we give it will be merely a drop in the ocean is, I must suggest, totally wrong.  Mind you it is fairly consistent with the Minister's attitude as expressed in the debate on the main Estimate when he consistently referred to his approach as being one of cutting our cloth to measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary in this House and indeed <Col N="1134" /> outside it to remind ourselves constantly of the scope of the problem and to reaffirm our commitment to making a contribution towards its solution.  Sometimes when reading statistics it is very easy to forget that we are talking about human beings, about 800 million people in the Third World trapped in absolute poverty. There is the danger that we would be inclined to forget that we are talking about 800 million human beings.  The same applies in regard to the number of such people who die each year, 50 million, from hunger and malnutrition.  On the other hand the absolute enormity of the moneys involved in other areas of international expenditure so go beyond our conception of finance that we lose sight of the crazy situation obtaining in this world from the point of view of such expenditures.  We are talking about an expenditure of 500 billion dollars a year in the current year on armaments as opposed to a total figure throughout the world of approximately 20 billion dollars in public development aid.  To put this into perspective, we, as citizens of this world, are spending 25 times more in funds to kill people than to aid people.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely important that we at all times bear that situation in mind, that we recall and keep publicising these figures so that the international conscience is constantly pricked by this crazy, awful situation.  As the Minister pointed put, the Irish development programme was initiated by the Coalition Government when they came into power in 1973. Unfortunately, despite our acceptance of the United Nations target of 7 per cent of GNP in 1970, no programme at all existed prior to that.  However, that is history and, let me be fair, while there were considerable advances between 1973 and 1980, certainly &mdash; even on our side of the House &mdash; the effort was not as good as it should be.  The brave targets initially announced were not always achieved.  At the same time, it was important that an attempt was made to continue having targets.</P>
    <P>My present real worry is that there seems to be a total abandonment of targets and an acceptance that we merely make funds available as our resources <Col N="1135" /> permit.  This is probably the worst aspect of the present Government's approach to the problem in the current year.  I again take the opportunity to urge on the Minister the absolute necessity to revise his thinking in this regard.  We must get the whole programme of development aid back on track again and establish a long-term target, not, as the Minister announced at the United Nations, have a woolly, some time in the future hope to achieve the UN target but an actual commitment to the date by which it will be achieved and the stages through which it will be achieved.  It behoves all of us at this stage to stand back from the problem and see where we go from here.</P>
    <P>All the evidence is that, internationally, the problems of the Third World are increasing annually and the argument for increased aid and a planned approach to the whole problem was given an added impetus by the publication of the Brandt Commission Report.  Lip service was paid to this report, not just by the Minister for Foreign Affairs but by many other Government figures in the development world.  Everyone rhetorically shed a tear, committed themselves to the achieving of the aims set out in that report and then not all, but many, countries did not go any further than that.  The approach of the present Government was highlighted by the Minister's speech at the United Nations when he reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to progressing towards the .7 per cent target for ODA.  He did not, however, mention that we were further away from the target this year than last year.  How that could be regarded as progressing towards a target is beyond comprehension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Having regard to the Minister's particular skills, it is perfectly within his comprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Perhaps that is understandable, too.  We are dealing with such an absolutely serious subject that this glib approach cannot be countenanced or accepted as being properly representative of the views of the Irish people. Furthermore, when this matter was raised in the Dáil on a number of occasions, <Col N="1136" /> the Minister did not accept the reality of the situation and has attempted to confuse figures by giving percentages which are not at all related to the matter under discussion&mdash;as, indeed, he did last week in response to some questions put by Deputy Quinn and myself.</P>
      <P>At this stage, we in the Opposition, having properly castigated the Government for their approach, must now urge them to adopt a completely new one, if necessary on an all-party basis.  It would be most unfortunate if the question of international aid became a political football. Having strongly castigated the Minister and his Government in the debate on the original Estimate, we must urge him to have a change of thinking.  We are approaching the situation where the 1981 Estimate will be drafted and I hope, expect, indeed demand, that he have a totally different approach on presenting the 1981 Estimate in this area.  I invite him to examine the policy enunciated by me on behalf of my party in this regard. It not merely says that we have a commitment to the .7 per cent target, but is a staged, planned approach which we are capable of meeting over a term of years. This is the only type of approach in dealing with the problem and I ask the Minister to consider adopting that policy when presenting his 1981 Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other aspects which should be mentioned include the possibility of having an all-party committee to draw up a comprehensive policy programme in this area, with short-term and long-term objectives.  Very complex questions arise in the matter of international co-operation. The situation has developed a lot from the time when we thought that aid to the Third World meant putting a penny in the collection box.  We must ensure that the maximum benefit is derived by the recipient country and its people from the aid given.  We must make sure that our own people, who have been so generous on a voluntary basis, have a full understanding of the work which is going on and, more importantly, it is absolutely essential that our own people have an understanding of the benefit which we derive from giving aid to the Third World.  This aspect was highlighted in a <Col N="1137" /> speech by Robert McNamara, President of the World Bank, when he referred to the moral aspects of giving aid and went on to state the absolute necessity, from the point of view of developed countries, making sure in their own interests that the underdeveloped world was properly developed.</P>
    <P>The other aspect which the Minister should consider is the question of the development aid agency and whether it is in the best interests of all that our aid under the heading of international co-operation should be disbursed directly by the Department of Foreign Affairs or whether there should be a development aid agency for so doing.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able to have a broader discussion on this later but in regard to this Estimate I accept that it is of some benefit in the context that the leakage of £1½ million that might have occurred will not now occur and that the funds which would not have been spent in the current year can be transferred to bilateral projects at this stage.  At the same time it is vital that we realise that we are doing nothing more than keeping within the figure which was originally estimated. The announced committed target was £21 million rather than £16 million.  There is no effort even in this Supplementary Estimate to bridge that shortfall of £16 million.  The Minister announced an additional sum of £100,000 for the disaster relief fund, but it is essential that we bear in mind that the original Estimate was only £200,000 and that the 1979 figure was £500,000.  Even with the extra £100,000 the disaster relief fund is still £200,000 below the 1979 estimate.  In that context we must realise that we are not even making up the ground lost in the original Estimate.  The same arises in regard to the contribution to the UN voluntary agencies where even with the additional figure it is still less than the 1979 estimate of £1,100,000.  While there is an advantage in ensuring that funds that might be lost are not spent under other subheads this Estimate does nothing to restore the credibility of this nation in the field of official development <Col N="1138" /> assistance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Foreign Affairs Estimate some additions are involved.  While I accept that it might be difficult at the start of a year to be reasonably exact in the amount required under various headings, I do not understand how the first figure, for instance, can be out by 37 per cent.  The additional sum of £600,000 required is 37 per cent greater than the original estimate of £1,600,000.  Why was this amount not anticipated when the figures were being drawn up?  It is appropriate that we should be represented at the various international fora.  From my experience of meeting officials of the Department at various gatherings I fully realise the benefit to this country of their doing their job at such meetings wherever they happen to take place but I wonder how a figure would have to be increased by 37 per cent and why a more realistic figure had not been included in the original Estimate.  In other respects I accept that increases may be necessary in regard to repatriation and so on and indeed that the Department gives an excellent service.</P>
    <P>The savings aspect should be looked at and perhaps the Minister would give us more detail as to how they were affected. As far as I can see from the Estimate the savings arose either because a substantial extra number of people applied for passports or because of the substantial increase in the fee for passports.  I am anxious to know the percentage increases involved.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose this Supplementary Estimate but I am disappointed that it is limited particularly in relation to international co-operation, that it does not provide for any increase and that it is merely a technical measure to ensure that our funds are not lost by way of a leakage and remain unspent.  Will the Minister seriously think about what we on this side of the House and many people outside the House have been saying on this issue and will he ensure by using the weight which is attributed to him in the Cabinet that in 1981 an appropriate effort will be made to ensure that an adequate sum is proposed for international co-operation and more importantly that there is a new <Col N="1139" /> plan or if the Minister thinks it feasible, an all-party approach to ensure that we fulfil our commitments in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: In moving this Supplementary Estimate the Minister concentrated on three fundamental specific areas, international affairs as they have affected the internal policies of his Department in relation to increased costs and so on, the question of cultural affairs and of international co-operation.  In the flush of excitement of the new job in Iveagh House coming as it did when the estimates were up for grabs at least this time last year, it is now fair to say in considered terms that in relation to our bilateral and multilateral aid programme this Minister, amiable as he undoubtedly is, has made a complete managerial mess of our bilateral aid programme.  I formally put this charge on the record of the House.  Neither the Minister in Cabinet nor his officials in Iveagh House seriously fought or resisted the first raid on the Department of Foreign Affairs requirements specifically for the bilateral aid programme, by the mandarins in the Department of Finance.  In moving from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to the Department of Foreign Affairs the Minister was totally at sea in relation to this matter and the savage cut proposed in relation to our bilateral aid programme at that time by the Department of Finance and its officials was not in any way effectively resisted by their counterparts in Iveagh House or by the Minister at the Cabinet table.  There was a get-out when the resistance and objections were voiced strongly from Bishop Casey all the way down to such minor political personages as myself.  The Minister realised that a mistake had been made &mdash; let us be honest about it, a major mistake was made and the Minister will have an opportunity when replying of denying whether he did put up a defence for the bilateral programme &mdash; on 20 June following the appearance of advertisements in newspapers by Trócaire and a number of deputations to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was when all the resistance had been voiced, when a number of specific bilateral <Col N="1140" /> aid programmes were in jeopardy, suspended or put into some kind of cold storage limbo and when some other projects did not get off the ground &mdash; specifically some of the Tanzanian ones &mdash; that the Minister, in the course of his Estimate speech, said that due to the overall budgetary situation &mdash; a classical Lenihan phrase &mdash; the amount allocated to the bilateral aid programme had not followed the pattern of substantial increases of recent years.  That was a Lenihanese admission that his Department got screwed by the Department of Finance and were cut back.  The Minister recognised that there was criticism at that stage and said he was conscious of the fact that this had led to a certain amount of criticism &mdash; another understatement &mdash; but he said that it was his intention to make use of possible unexpended sums expected to be available later in the year under one of the multilateral aid subheads to increase the amount of bilateral aid funds.  The Minister said he intended to ensure that all our commitments to ongoing projects in the bilateral aid programme would be maintained.  That last sentence would be more reassuring than it is if the words &ldquo;ongoing projects&rdquo; were omitted, another classical Lenihanese phrase.  Is the word &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo; something that we promise, are committed to or something we cannot get our of?  Dial one's favourite definition and it will fit into that lovely word &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and myself suggested to the Minister that there was room on the multilateral aid side rather than endangering any projects for which we had given specific commitments or for which we were likely to have to make commitments whether in Tanzania or Lesotho &mdash; we indicated previously that we would in 1980 or 1981 take up or initiate certain projects in that country. The Minister responded to that and he has now transferred the shortfall intake up on the multilateral side to the bilateral aid side.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has maintained the tradition of his predecessor by transferring at the end of a financial year moneys from the multilateral side to the bilateral side.  About two years ago in this House I pointed out <Col N="1141" /> to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs that he should seriously look at the efficiency of delivery of the multilateral aid programme, whether it is UN or EEC based.  It is chronically inefficient in delivering money allocated in one year.  Officials of the Department can clearly indicate that from the outset of our accession to the EEC when the Third EDF was in operation there was a shortfall in the take-up of moneys allocated to that fund as there is in the Fourth and Fifth EDF and what is required of us by the Commission and Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Our credibility in terms of delivering a bilateral aid programme was damaged by the way in which the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister's management of it, handled the necessity to cut back on Government expenditure when the Taoiseach found that the cupboard was bare in terms of money.  Without getting personal or over-dramatic about this it is true to say that everybody in the NGOs here involved in the bilateral aid programme in one way or another is of one view on this matter.  It is their view that serious damage was done to our credibility in terms of our commitment to try to even out the inevitable swings and roundabouts and ups and downs of financing aid programmes.  In so far as we are now trying to repair the damage at this stage recent moves are welcome but since last February, when Finance and Foreign Affairs were signalling to people in the field and to agencies, a period of six months was lost in which nothing was done or said other than the vague promise that money would be transferred.  The Minister, earlier in the year, transferred some money to APSO and that was welcome. For whatever reason, coupled with the movement from one Department to another, coupled with, perhaps, a lack of commitment among some senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs to the bilateral aid programme and with an inordinate sense of inferiority complex of some senior civil servants and Ministers who feel that we cannot renege on our international obligations to international financing agencies such as the World Bank or the EEC, there were cutbacks. I recognise Government Departments <Col N="1142" /> can be forced to cut back and that the soft option is to cut our bilateral aid programme and not touch the multilateral programme.  The multilateral programme has demonstrated from our experience that the take-up on funds allocated to it is always less than the amount of money originally required.</P>
    <P>Last spring I suggested that we reverse the process and make the bilateral aid programme the one on which we stand firm and the multilateral aid programme the one on which we hold a certain degree of flexibility.  I suggested that if necessary we should respond with a Supplementary Estimate, as the Minister is doing, in the autumn of any year if there was a 100 per cent take-up of the funds required.  There are risks attached to that strategy but they are less damaging than the damage that has been done to the bilateral aid programme.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that he consider that criticism in the spirit in which it has been offered.  It does not give me any joy to be arguing with the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the fact that he has damaged our bilateral aid programme and, in the process, damaged the reputation of our country. Irrespective of which party are in office and of which individual holds the portfolio of Foreign Affairs, damage done internationally to the bilateral aid programme is damage which affects us all.</P>
    <P>We have seen it before&mdash;the previous administration ran into budgetary difficulties also in regard to getting funds for overseas development and there were sharp falls in the promised percentage of money actually made available in 1975 and 1976.  We know this as does everybody working in the NGO programme. It seems that while in theory all these estimates are open for debate and discussion, for increase or decrease, in reality some of them are absolutely sacrosanct and untouchable, for example things over which the Department have no control, external communication costs, but equally such things as salaries.  Nobody suggests we should debate anything about increased salaries in any of these civil service Estimates.  They do not even come up for discussion.  The only flexibility <Col N="1143" /> or variability is in the expenditure items after you have taken away costs including salaries.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we should go into salaries because that is part and parcel of the whole national understanding but I say to the Minister that it is time that the three parties in the Dáil took the question of the bilateral aid programme and the multilateral aid programme and its percentage of GNP out of the realm of party politics and on to the level of something for which there is consensus. We shall have plenty of scope to argue about the allocation of priorities and where it should be spent, whether it should go more into the bilateral side or the multilateral side, whether one priority country is in receipt of too much funds in comparison with another.  I do not suggest suspending debate or discussion on our international development co-operation programme but I say it is time to get away from arguing this numbers game because in the end nobody can win. Whoever sits in the Minister's seat will suffer the same kind of pressure that he has suffered and which the figures show he has suffered.  I think the Minister did the right thing in October in transferring it back.  So did his predecessor and unless we break this mould together on behalf of the foreign affairs spokespeople in the House it will always be up for renegotiation, for carving and cutting by the Department of Finance.  That is the reality of Government practice.  The Minister has infinitely more experience of this than I have.</P>
    <P>I should like formally to propose that we reach agreement on a timetable of whatever duration to hit the UN target on 0.7 per cent of GNP over a period of time for the overall international development co-operation programme &mdash; an agreement on the timetable for achieving that figure consolidated as such.  That I suggest would immeasurably strengthen the hands of any Minister for Foreign Affairs in dealing with the Department of Finance just as certain estimate items now are not even up for discussion in real terms although they are presented here.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that certain steps are being taken to initiate an all-party <Col N="1144" /> committee of both Houses on the question of international co-operation and specifically in relation to the Brandt report and the whole question of the North-South dialogue.  There is every reason to believe that this committee will get off to a good start.  There is positive encouragement for it.  There is much to be done and much has been done regarding its establishment.  Without wishing to prejudice the outcome I think the signs now indicate that the prospects for the successful establishment of such a committee are reasonably good.  In the real politics of both Houses we know the prospects for the success of an all-party committee are extremely limited if such a committee can be used as a lever against the Government of the day.  Despite the preferences of individual members of the committee if they are Government supporters and that committee appears to be attacking the Government in a fundamental way &mdash; there is nothing more fundamental than cash when it comes to an election or an economic crisis &mdash; the prospects for success and co-operation will be limited.  The committee should try in consultation with the Minister and with the relevant officials and organisations who participate in NGO fashion in the multilateral programme to arrive at a realistic figure and timetable for achieving this 0.7 of GNP.  If that were done this kind of debate which inevitably will be run and re-run every year could be put aside in the same way that we are not talking about salaries, rental costs or postal charges.  Nobody suggests, for example, that we should sell our Paris Embassy, which has obviously now appreciated to an enormous extent in value having regard to property values in central Paris, and move to a single floor in a modern office block.  This kind of thing does not come up for discussion and in that sense is taken out of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Having criticised what I consider as a piece of bad management I recognise that the Minister has responded and has attempted to correct it and is effectively transferring more than half what was originally forecast at the beginning of this year to the bilateral aid programme.  For 1980 the original sum was £2.275 million <Col N="1145" /> as compared with £2.813 million in 1979. But it is now proposed &mdash; and I welcome it &mdash; to transfer on top of the £2.275 million an additional sum of £1.202 million bringing it to a total of £3.4 million approximately.  I would hope that we could avoid these ups and downs that we have had in the past and which I would say irrespective of who will be in the Minister's seat are likely to continue in the future unless we clear the ground in regard to the overall matter.  That effort will be more formally made when the Joint Committee &mdash; hopefully &mdash; is set up but I sincerely ask the Minister to give it close examination himself and have it carefully considered in his Department.</P>
    <P>It does not pre-empt debate on the whole question of our international co-operation programme or on the split between multilateral and bilateral.  It does not pre-empt debate on what countries should have priority &mdash; all these issues remain open, as they should &mdash; but it does remove from the arena the critical, fundamental question of the amount of funds.  Let me suggest to a Minister whose political skill is well known that it provides a not inconsiderable degree of insurance to any incumbent in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against the kind of criticism to which the Minister referred in his speech of May 20 this year.</P>
    <P>There are two final points on the natter of international co-operation.  The first is in relation to the State or Republic of Zimbabwe.  It is only right and proper for me on an Estimate for International Co-operation on behalf of the Labour Party formally to record my disappointment about the way in which the Government and specifically the Minister for Agriculture, I think &mdash; correct me if I am wrong &mdash; played the card of the Zimbabwe cattle and the prospect of their being imported into the EEC in order to extract a concession on another front within the process of negotiation that goes on in the Commission and in the Council itself.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of how it was interpreted on the top two floors of those buildings, it was misinterpreted by a number of people in Zimbabwe as being the exact reverse on real terms of the offers of help <Col N="1146" /> that had been made by the West in general, and by this country in particular, last year when the Lancaster House talks were going on.  If the unaligned countries of the world, particularly those which had to struggle for their independence, want to test seriously the cynicism of the western power <i>bloc</i>, with which this country, regrettably, seems to have aligned itself in this matter, they could not find anything more nakedly cynical than the profusive offers of help made initially in 1975 by Henry Kissinger on behalf of the United States and throughout the Lancaster House negotiations to both Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, and if they would only stop fighting the offers of help got bigger and bigger still, if on top of committing themselves to do that they would promise never again to have anything to do with the Soviet Eastern <i>bloc</i>.</P>
    <P>The reality is that in that country, which had seven years of civil war, with horrendous effects on large tracts of its hinterland, once the Patriotic Front leaders met their side of the deal offered in Lancaster House, the West became unbelievably miserable in their response to the enormous problems now affecting Zimbabwe.  We, to our shame &mdash; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and this Government are part of that shame &mdash; have not been as generous as we could have been.  Specifically, other cards should have been played at that Council of Ministers' meeting other than those regarding the Zimbabwe cattle.  Everybody in that room in Brussels knew that there was not a hope in hell of Zimbabwe cattle being accepted in Europe for at least three years, until such time as their health standards had been brought up to the level&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: It has been all settled now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I know it has been settled, but the damage has not been repaired. Perhaps when I have had the Minister's experience I may be as sanguine about it as he, but to many people working in Zimbabwe, many Irish people working in the missions there, the response of the <Col N="1147" /> Irish Government in that instance was seen to be miserable and in line with the miserable response of the British.  American and German Governments.  In reparation for that I suggest that the Minister change his attitude.  We must remember that Zimbabwe is a potentially wealthy country with enormous resources, but she has suffered from a disastrous civil war and on top of that, because of the colonialist and racist nature of the regime much of the African population are without skilled resources in terms of personnel.  Combined with the consequences of civil war, there is a great absence of medical personnel in particular in many parts of the tribal trustlands.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I earnestly suggest to the Minister that in conjunction with Project Africa he would attempt to enlarge the existing programme of putting personnel in the field in these countries, on consultation with the relevant authorities in Zimbabwe, and that our Ambassador in Kenya would be instructed and required, if this has not already been done, formally to visit Salisbury to explain clearly to a new nation, some of whose personnel might not be aware of the procedures of international bargaining, that in opposing the Zimbabwe cattle deal Ireland was not indicating its future attitude to that country.  A detailed list could be drawn up of the personnel needs, short-term, of the Zimbabwe authorities so that we could try to help to alleviate the effects of the civil war there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo had decided that they would be leaning much more towards the East and had sought technical assistance from the Soviet Union, East Germany or from China, the West would be queuing up at this stage to buy their favours.  The fact that Zimbabwe and its leaders have remained totally unaligned is now being cynically interpreted by many sections as evidence of the basic bad faith of the western power <i>bloc</i>.  We are not formally a part of that <i>bloc</i>, though frequently our voting in the UN might indicate that we are, and this is an opportunity for the Minister to give the lie to that impression. <Col N="1148" /> He will have the support of the Irish Labour Party in that matter.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the question of cultural relations.  About this time last year, I spoke on a Supplementary Estimate to make funds available for the burgeoning and growing festival entitled &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; which was beginning to catch the imagination of the people of London and of this country.  Everybody associated with that venture realises that it was a success.  The idea originated in the IDA.  There were early problems.  There were criticisms of it, and some things would have been done differently if they were to be done again.  That has been conceded by the organiser and by all the participants, but there is unanimity that it was a success, a good idea.  We should look at that success and see how we can repeat it in such a way that we can learn to overcome problems associated with its organisation and administration.</P>
    <P>I assume that the bulk of the £175,000 in Subhead E is required for &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo;.  Many people can read figures better than I, so I will just evaluate the success of that undertaking.  There is a connection between our influence in the world, within the EEC, what is now described by Bord Failte as &ldquo;cultural tourism&rdquo;, the promotion and development of our own arts, and the possibility of earning revenue from them.  It was not simply because Harold Wilson liked the sound of the Liverpool music of the Beatles that they were given MBEs.  The Beatles were massive net contributors to Britain's revenue and in that sense there is a potential economic dimension to a vibrant cultural sector in our economy. Festivals such as &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; are an aspect of that.</P>
    <P>The organisers of &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; have shown that it could be successfully mounted in London, although there were problems.  Now is the time to look at the lessons of that success and to try to increase the cultural fund generally for this kind of activity in line with our farming and tourist policies.  Perhaps we should draw up a ten year programme and select a series of venues chosen because of their combined potential, whether political, tourist or economic. <Col N="1149" /> The United States is one obvious area, although it has probably been overexposed. France and Germany are two other venues for a repetition of the idea of &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland.&rdquo;  Perhaps the festival could be redesigned to facilitate holding it in a non-English speaking country.  If there are proposals to relocate &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; in another city within the EEC, would the Minister state what the split would be in terms of funds through the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Arts Council and funds that may be available from the recipient country, since we would have cultural agreements with some of these countries?</P>
    <P>Obviously we cannot have the kind of <i>ad hoc</i> growth that produced &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo;. In some ways that is regrettable because that growth contributed to the success of the festival.  The amount of money involved, relative to other things, is substantial.  I am not in a position to evaluate the benefit in accountancy terms, but I assume it has been properly accounted.  I am not disputing the extra money, as we now know the cost of a festival of this kind.  We can see some of the benefits, and it was particularly useful when it was held in Britain in terms of relationships between Britain and Ireland. It could usefully be repeated in France, Germany and other EEC countries. We should see whether we could run it two or three times in different cities.  I would not attribute the same priority to the US because there is enough Irish input there.</P>
    <P>As regards international affairs, the Minister in his opening speech spoke about increased costs brought about by international affairs generally.  I am concerned that some of the savings on the original Estimate are attributed to staff vacancies.  I wonder if we are leaving ourselves unnecessarily short staffed.  Is this part of the invisible Government cutbacks which we all know exist throughout the rest of Government Departments?  Is the Minister, with his usual skill, making a virtue out of necessity in this matter? Are these vacancies imposed on the Department by the Department of the <Col N="1150" /> Public Service?  If that is so, let it be said. The Minister should not protect the Minister for the Public Service in this regard. If damage is done to the foreign affairs role of this country, it is done to us all collectively and is more difficult to repair than if it were done domestically.  If that is the case it should be stated and we will go after the Minister for the Public Service. When we are talking about our reputation and international performance let us try to raise it out of the trough of domestic fighting about money.  If we have left some embassies with one or two people when they should have three or four, let us say so.  The Minister may not have that kind of information to hand, but a parliamentary question could elicit it.  We can get a profile on the situation. It is in nobody's interest that that should be the case.</P>
    <P>Our election to the United Nations Security Council, which we all welcome, will mean that, willy-nilly, we will have increased representations from other member states of the United Nations to pursue a particular line or to defend a particular position.  We need to have a clearer attitude about certain international policy issues.  I am disappointed with the lack of independence voiced by this Government in relation to foreign affairs generally.  I have a feeling, rightly or wrongly, that we are unnecessarily hiding under the umbrella of European political co-operation.  We do not have to do that.  The Germans, French and British make no bones about getting out from under that flag of convenience when it does not suit them.</P>
    <P>It is a tradition that affects this administration, as it did the previous one, that we are super-communitaire when it comes to matters relating to the Community. I am not happy that we would be adopting a sufficiently independent line at Madrid particularly in relation to the question of human rights in the Soviet Union and other countries.  A question I put to the Minister at Question Time last week in relation to Peter Ewell, a victim because of membership of the VONS Group and Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, was avoided in the reply from the Minister's Department as being part of the <Col N="1151" /> overall process.  My reading of that was that we were not going to adopt any kind of strong line within EPC let alone any kind of independent attitude on certain specific items.</P>
    <P>We are all subject to very inadequate information relating to these matters, and Opposition Deputies more so than Government Departments.  It seems to be an indication of the non-vigorous attitude adopted by the political section within the Department and endorsed by the Minister.  The Minister is totally politically responsible for the line taken by any official.  It was an indication that we would be soft in EPC on the question of monitoring Helsinki.  I say that in the full realisation that Madrid barely got off the ground.  The eastern <i>bloc</i> countries arrived with the smell of Afghanistan around them and proposed a very tight non-discussive programme.  I am aware of some of the difficulties particularly when one has strident right wing members, from the British Government across to some of the Belgians and Germans.</P>
    <P>The fact that we now have a seat on the UN Security Council requires us to have a stronger input than has currently been the case.  I am not a diplomat and do not profess to be.  There are specific skills attached to diplomacy.  Ireland's independent neutral position in terms of foreign policy around the world, which will have a higher profile because of our membership of the UN Security Council, is being endangered by our collective and non-individualistic attitude to EPC and the fact that we seem never to have an independent foreign policy line of our own unless and until such time as it is endorsed by the Community.  There may be very good arguments from the Minister's point of view as to why that should be the case.  Benefits may be accruing to the Irish foreign service and to Ireland's overall foreign policy objectives which are not apparent to me, and if that is the case I would be glad to be informed as to what they may be.</P>
    <P>This country consciously over two years sought a seat on the Security Council. It seems pointless if we take that seat and then adopt a strict EPC line on that <Col N="1152" /> seat.  We might as well send an official from the Foreign Affairs section of the Commission in Brussels.  He would do the job just as well and would cost us less money.  Therefore, what are we going to do with it and what line are we going to take as the Republic of Ireland in relation to certain breaches of the Helsinki Agreement?</P>
    <P>I hope that as a final measure in relation to Madrid and Helsinki generally we could at least identify three or four individuals who perhaps are suffering from a denial of human rights as a consequence of the failure of the Soviet Union to honour its agreements on Helsinki.  Let us be clear that it was the Russians who campaigned for about 15 years to get Helsinki together.  They went around every country in Europe looking for the Helsinki Agreement and they undertook voluntarily their commission in Helsinki.  If we have to tie into an EPC line, which is the lowest common denominator, at least let us reserve something for ourselves in terms of foreign policy so that the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs can say that we are on top of a difficult position which we adopted in EPC which ultimately we followed because it was the better foreign policy objective and that we as an independent State made direct representations to this Government or that and achieved this or that result.  Those representations, particularly with eastern <i>bloc</i> countries, must be discreet and must be done without any fanfare of publicity. I recognise the sensitivity of the Russian bear in these matters.  It is a card which must be recognised as being there and it should be played by professional diplomats. That is the major point I want to make on international affairs at the moment.  I do not want, and it would not be appropriate, to open up a general debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  We are moving just a little into the main Estimate.  I am giving a bit of latitude in view of the circumstances but to safeguard this area in future we can debate only what is in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: In recognition of that, I <Col N="1153" /> propose to conclude on that by saying that that is the major item coming up in relation to Madrid.  Finally, I want to reiterate the formal offer which the Labour Party are making in relation to taking the amount of money for international co-operation out of the realm of party debate and agreeing a figure and a timetable to reach that figure in order to see if we can come to an arrangement so that we will not be buffeted by the sort of things by which the Minister has been buffeted in the past as a result of which he is trying now to repair some of the damage.</P>
      <P>On the question of cultural affairs, let us look at the lessons to be learned from the success of &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo;.  How can we repeat it?  What are the thoughts of the Minister in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach, who take in the Arts Council, and also of the Arts Council themselves?  What countries could maximise the reception of this type of festival, having regard to their own cultural budgets, their own funding and the cultural relations which we are having now increasingly with a number of them?</P>
      <P>With regard to the whole question of making a reality out of our independent foreign policy, at the same time pushing and shoving within EPC to advance our line is hardly enough.  I say that in full recognition of the fact that the relative leverage of a State such as Ireland is limited.  I do not want to seem to fall into the trap, with respect to Deputy O'Keeffe's constituency, of imitating the editor of the Skibbereen newspaper solemnly warning the Tsar, nor do I want to repeat the performance of Deputy Kelly solemnly warning the world about the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Supplementary Estimate for Foreign Affairs.  On Vote 47 under subhead B there is an increase. The additional sum being voted now by this House is £600,000 to meet travelling and incidental expenses.  Deputy O'Keeffe worried about this amount and queried the amount of travelling that must be involved.  I would like to deal with the other aspect which is the amount <Col N="1154" /> for communications, especially telecommunications, involved in this.  Having had a certain amount of contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs in recent weeks on the matter of repatriation, I know that the contacts they went through were numerous and that more and more of our people tend to travel and, naturally, the amounts which must be sought in this House for communications will continue to increase.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on the record of the House my gratitude to the Minister, his office and the Department of Foreign Affairs for their help in the case which they know about only too well.</P>
      <P>I move on now to subhead E and the matter of cultural relations with other countries, grants-in-aid.  The Minister rightly has spoken here about the festival of the arts of Ireland in London, &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo;.  This cultural promotion has achieved an enormous amount of goodwill.  It is a timely promotion which has had a grassroots effect in London. It has projected a positive image of Ireland and our people and an expression of our culture and our civilisation and it would be impossible to estimate the benefits in kind.  Over the years I would like to see increases in grants-in-aid under this subhead which will allow similar festivals to be launched in other countries. If it were possible that &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; could be modelled appropriately and trimmed if necessary to go on tour, I would welcome that and I look forward to the observations of the Minister on this in due course.  I congratulate all who were involved in it.  It was received enthusiastically by the community and this House owes a great deal of gratitude to those who put a lot of time and expertise into its promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 48, International Co-operation and I congratulate the Minister that under subhead E he has been able to find an increase on the original Estimate from £2.275 million to £3.347 million.  It is a considerable and very welcome increase. Subhead D indicates an increase of £100,000 to be made available in the event of further disaster internationally. We all hope that this would require to be <Col N="1155" /> only a token within the overall Estimate but, unfortunately, disasters occur.  We have had a spate of them and it is only fitting that we play whatever part we can as a people to bring aid to alleviate the suffering which must follow these major disasters.  We would all wish to see a situation which would result in under-expenditure under subhead D but we have no control over acts of God, nature and so on.  Therefore, I am pleased that the Minister has been able to come up with this £100,000 extra for emergencies between now and the end of the year.  I should be glad if he would indicate precisely where this money will be spent. The increase to APSO is to be welcomed also as is the increase to UN voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has expanded on our bilateral aid programme, I would like to give some of my own views on bilateral aid.  That there is a genuine concern amongst people to see that economic and social conditions of people of poorer countries improve is extremely clear.  The reaction to various proposals was also clearly seen and the efforts of CONGOOD in lobbying very strongly for increases are also on the record.</P>
    <P>If we look over the years before we moved into any official programme, we see how CONGOOD developed.  Many of our missionaries went to help and to develop the poorer countries. They made a personal commitment but also kept a direct link with the people at home which brought about a direct Irish involvement in developing countries and stimulated public interest in world poverty and international issues.  They showed everyone the problems that existed on the ground and brought home to us a deep awareness of the social conditions that existed in those countries. They inspired many people to try to influence, where possible, the situation and see that unacceptable political and economic conditions were changed.</P>
    <P>Voluntary efforts in those days had a twofold approach, mainly raising and distributing funds to help Third World developing projects and they were very <Col N="1156" /> much involved in the area of education. This situation existed for a long time before the mid-seventies when the structure emerged which co-ordinated voluntary efforts.  I can recall in the sixties, while I was with a missionary order in Nigeria, the arrival of the American Peace Corps, the voluntary service overseas group and the graduate voluntary services overseas group.  I saw the wonderful work the missionaries and volunteers were doing in promoting aid and helping the people.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see in the seventies the establishment of CONGOOD because I felt a co-ordinated effort was required.  Because CONGOOD is nongovernmental, it clearly can be, and is, less restrained than an official governmental approach to the situation.  It continues the link with the people in Ireland from whom it draws support and is very much involved with the grassroots and smaller communities, the under-privileged in the Third World countries.  It has a direct link with the poor and oppressed minorities which would be out of the question for governmental programmes.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the concern felt among Irish and other people in developed countries to see that social conditions are improved in Third World countries but we should also take cognisance of the fact that there is a deep concern among the people in Third World countries to see that their conditions are improved.  If we look at the world we see the growing gap between rich and poor nations.  This gap is mirrored by a similar divergence between the well off and the impoverished and between many of the less developed countries.</P>
    <P>One of the tasks of development aid must be for new approaches and to get greater participation in development efforts by those who are supposed to benefit from them.  Our people abroad are deeply and personally involved with local people who are meant to benefit from developmental aid.  There have been many criticisms in the past of material aid due to arrive under certain circumstances but which arrived under different circumstances.  Many of these difficulties have been overcome but we <Col N="1157" /> must continue to get greater participation in development efforts from those people who are genuinely supposed to benefit from them.</P>
    <P>All donor agencies, development agencies, planning councils and so on make participation of the poor majority a central concern of their programmes. They try to involve everyone in their activities but they are not always successful in this area.  Nevertheless, the involvement of the poor in making decisions on development efforts which affect them and the contribution of their resources to development activities, are essential to overall development.  There must be an assurance that the poor will benefit from interventions intended to help them.</P>
    <P>We must look at who should participate in these programmes.  Clearly local leaders and residents, government and foreign personnel must participate not alone in decision-making but also in evaluating the programmes and benefits, and see how each affects the local community. We must ask these questions: have we, as a donor country, unconsciously promoted our values?  Have we imposed our educational innovations?  I say &ldquo;unconsciously&rdquo; because perhaps that has happened.  Our aid must be to help people develop by their own actions and to let them move gradually towards a structuring of communities so that they will become more aware of their own values, resources and needs and more capable of solving their own problems.</P>
    <P>There are natural leaders in various localities who exist independently of community development projects.  Such people express the culture of their community and exert influence by way of inter-personal relationships.  The importance of these people must be recognised in terms of development programmes and their support should be enlisted.  In many of the earlier development-aid programmes and projects such people were overlooked but happily that is no longer the situation.  These natural leaders are able to bridge the gap between administration and their local community.</P>
    <P>In general, education should focus on methods by which a local community can <Col N="1158" /> participate in the process of change and development.  Training must not be based on helping local people to adapt to existing society.  Instead, these people need to be taught to understand critically their own society.  Neither should training be limited to production techniques.  It should expand to increase the ability of local people to participate in the process of their own change.  Local communities must have a sense of importance and of control of their own destiny.  There is no point in trying to impose a situation on them.  Situations arise from spontaneous happenings and they are then continued by way of the resources of the people concerned.  People must be able to comprehend clearly that the decision-making in which they are involved is democratic and independent.  They must have direct access to the authorities who make the overall decisions.</P>
    <P>In this House we have been concerned about reaching UN monetary targets. That is a very important matter but sometimes during our deliberations we overlook the vital point that governmental groups and voluntary agencies should know the precise time at which to remove themselves from the scene.  There is no point in promoters trying to perpetuate themselves once a local community have been brought to a certain stage of maturity and have acquired a capacity for analysis. At that point donor countries and voluntary agencies should consider their mission complete.</P>
    <P>Having had direct contact with missionaries and with agencies involved in the field work, I am aware that they understand that their presence in these countries is solely for the purpose of helping other people to grow and that that growth is the unfolding of their potential. I know, too, that various agencies have to justify budgets and that in doing so they may seek fast results.  But fast results do not follow.  Growth rates are slow in the situations we are talking of.  Many of these peoples have not had the opportunity of self-expression and after a long period of silence, self-expression comes very slowly to them.  I am glad that in our development programmes, both official and voluntary, we aim at authentic society <Col N="1159" /> building.  I commend all those who are working in this field.  They sacrifice much but they are encouraged in the knowledge of the extent to which they are helping others.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to note that there is now a 53 per cent increase under subhead E of Vote 48 compared with the original Estimate for this year.  I congratulate the Minister in this regard.  In passing, I congratulate him, too, on having achieved for Ireland a seat on the Security Council. The work that went on behind the scenes in order to achieve this situation is clear witness to the advance of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Much benefit will accrue to us from our presence on the Security Council.</P>
    <P>I shall not detain the House further except to remark that much of what I have said is summed up in the Minister's speech where he said that we recognise that real and sustained development requires the building up of Third World countries from within and that in the long term the people of the Third World are the ones who must ensure their own development.  I have endeavoured to outline our role within that framework.</P>

      <P>: I shall be very brief in my contribution to this debate.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is all about communications between the peoples of the world, and the world, in the terms of communication, is becoming a rather small place.  It is a horrific situation that conditions should be so different in respect of what we might call the two parts of the world.  However, I am very happy to note that there is an increase in the estimate for the people of the Third World.  Our people generally would be disappointed in the Minister and in the Government if there were not such an increase.</P>

      <P>: Recently we saw on our television screens the awful pictures of men, women and children starving to death.  When one considers the prosperity of this country and the amount of money that is spent on food, one realises <Col N="1160" /> how sad would be the situation of our failing to make a substantial contribution &mdash; even if it represents only a drop in the ocean &mdash; to those who are dying of starvation. At school when learning about the famine in Ireland in the 1840s we were told that the people were dropping dead along the roads and that there was plenty of food in countries very close to us.  I could not understand why the people of Ireland were allowed to die during the famine years when there was so much which could have been given to them. That is the reason I say that now that we are in a position to help other countries where the same things are happening &mdash; in the last century people in other countries could not see what was happening here but we can see what is happening in other countries on our television screens &mdash; if we cannot respond to this we are monstrous.</P>
      <P>What is basically needed is to help those people to provide for themselves. They must be fed initially, because nobody in the condition which the majority of the people in the Third World are could work even if there was work for them.  When they have sufficient food, and when the money being sent to them enables them to be fed properly, it is time to try to build up internal organisations to educate them, to provide employment for them and to teach them how to grow their own food and establish industries.</P>
      <P>I am also very glad to see that money is being given to help the wonderful people who go out to help the Third World countries.  Most of those people spend two or three years there and receive no pay but only maintenance while they are in those countries.  They give up their time to look after those people.  It is very hard to realise that there are still countries where people have not sufficient food.  We talk of human rights.  Surely, next to the right to be allowed to live, we must place the basic human rights of having sufficient food to keep body and soul together, of sufficient living accommodation, and of education for people so that they can live a decent human life without being degraded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Supplementary Estimate, as well as dealing with the Third World and <Col N="1161" /> the need for money and food to help those people who have practically nothing, we are also talking about quite a large sum of money for the &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; Festival, which took place in London earlier this year.  We live in a civilised part of the world.  We have plenty to eat and are reasonably comfortable. We then think of our cultural needs, which is a very good thing.  This festival, following initial problems, was a success because it brought people from the British Isles and ourselves together. We brought across to London samples of our literature, arts, crafts, films and our theatre.  Forty different venues were used for this festival.  It showed the people of England a little bit about our culture.  It brought home to them that we have our own culture.  It is very important to us and we would like to display it.</P>
    <P>I consider what Deputy Quinn suggested a very good idea.  Now that this festival has been tried in the country nearest to us we should consider bringing it around Europe.  We should also invite other countries to bring their festivals here.  We have joined the EEC.  The Continent of Europe is becoming very small and we can get to any part of it in a very short time.  There should be more co-operation between Europe and Ireland in cultural matters.  We should be able to have a good idea of the cultures of Germany, France and other countries.  They should come to us and show us their cultures and we should go to them with ours.  We have been producing some plays in some of those countries, but a festival like &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; was a major effort and we should think about extending it to other countries.</P>
    <P>The work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is extremely important.  Our embassies in various countries are a link between the people in those countries and ourselves.  It helps our relationships. It helps to bridge gaps which would be there if we did not have fully-fledged embassies.  We have staff in those embassies to communicate with people in those countries and to communicate with our people who go abroad and perhaps get <Col N="1162" /> into difficulties in those countries.  When such people go to our embassies they are helped by the staff there.  Our embassies are becoming more important now that people are travelling so much.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies will support this Estimate.  There is no sense in saying to the Minister that he should not be given this extra money.  We all know that it is necessary.  I hope that in the coming years the money allocated to the Third World will never again be cut back, that instead it will be increased as our salaries are increased.  We are probably not nearly as much in need as the people in the Third World.  I hope that in future Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs a generous allocation will be set aside to help the people who have nothing and who are our responsibility.  We live in what is called the civilised part of the world.  We have sufficient, we are well educated and are becoming increasingly affluent.  We are spending vast sums of money on food and drink.  At least a fair proportion of the money allocated in the budget to the Department of Foreign Affairs should be sent to the people in the Third World who have so little.  I look forward to a budget in which a generous amount of money will be allocated to help these people who are our neighbours and fellow human beings.  It is our responsibility to do what we can for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree with the views that have been expressed by Deputy Lemass, Deputy Murphy, Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Quinn in regard to the importance of maintaining our level of aid under the overseas development assistance programme. I would like to emphasise one point which is relevant: this is a time of budgetary constraint, not just in Ireland, but in every country in the developed world and every single country is having difficulties at present in maintaining its level of aid under this heading.  Within the European Community there are 8.1 million people unemployed.  Side by side with that, a large percentage of the world, primarily the Third World, is living below subsistence level.  The tragedy is that the Brandt Commission report, <Col N="1163" /> which is a brilliant document and should be compulsory reading for everyone, emerged at a time and promulgated recommendations which, because of the economic blizzard that has hit the developed world, cannot be implemented as immediately or as urgently as Brandt and his colleagues rightly advised.  The conclusions reached in the Brandt Report are impeccable, that the developed world is spending too much on armaments, and that it is in the interests of the developed world from the point of view of its own economy that the growing third world population be sustained, if only for the reason of keeping the economic engine of the developed world going.  It is important that proper consumer markets and growing prosperity should be engineered through the transfer of resources in the underdeveloped world.  That logic is unanswerable on economic and financial grounds and in the self-interest of the developed world.  Apart altogether from the considerations that were rightly mentioned by the four Deputies, the basic considerations of morality and enlightenment, basic human dignity and decency, it is compulsory for us in the more prosperous part of the world to ensure that our brothers and sisters in the poor parts of the world are sustained and lifted out of what is, in many cases, degradation.</P>
      <P>One sees straight away a bald figure &mdash; there is nothing like a bald figure to emphasise a point &mdash; that 40 per cent of the Third World population is living below subsistence level, living in a constant state of hunger.  That emphasises the enormity of the task and, although a small country cannot help much financially, what we can do best, as was said by Deputy Murphy and others, is to concentrate on technical assistance.  We do not have enormous sums of money, we are not among the prosperous half of the developed world.</P>

      <P>: It is for wealthier countries to provide cash and make grants available but we have a large reservoir of expertise.  We have developed our nation <Col N="1164" /> over the past two generations, provided administrative ability and leadership and indicated to people how to go about things in a basic way, and applied the appropriate professional skills, whether in engineering, construction, agriculture, reclamation, reseeding and organisation of farming and co-operatives and teaching. We have built up a reputation and provided power stations and electricity distribution systems in which the ESB have played an excellent part in several Third World countries, providing expertise in the development of bogs in Ruanda and Burundi where they have peat land resources not unlike our own.</P>
      <P>This country had to fight its way, metaphorically speaking, to become a nation, through the adaptation of its own imagination and brains, building up its own administration, applying its own professional and technical skills and educational abilities to our own problems and transplanting those problems to the emerging countries and saying &ldquo;yes, within our own time we faced these problems, we can advise you how to make use of the funds that will come from wealthier donor countries&rdquo;.  These are the areas in which we can help best and on which we should concentrate.  I agree with Deputy Murphy this must be done in a spirit of participation with the local people.  We cannot impose solutions to problems, even though the solutions may seem, in our more sophisticated view, to be obvious.  They have to be patiently explained and local leadership fostered. Once it has grown sufficiently the adviser must go, hopefully having planted the seed of leadership so that it can take root in its own environment and reproduce its own leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have more money available to implement what I am saying.  It is in that spirit that I indicated to Deputy Quinn on 24 April that, during the year, I would transfer funds from the multilateral to the bilateral programme as happened in the past.  I said that as early as last April so that the various agencies involved in bilateral programmes would know that moneys would be made available at a later stage and that they could proceed with their planning on the basis <Col N="1165" /> that there would be a transfer of the kind that is now proposed.  The major part of the supplementary estimates is concerned with the transfer of £1.2 million from the unexpended areas to the bilateral area.</P>
    <P>I note what Deputy Quinn states regarding doing it the other way round. I can see one obvious difficulty, our primary credibility rests on fulfilling commitments that we make and ensuring that these commitments are accepted by us. That is basic and fundamental to our international reputation and it is valuable credit and credibility as far as a State is concerned, that it honours its international commitments.  It is not our fault that these commitments are not met when they should be met, that is a failing of international bureaucracy, be it the EEC, the United Nations or a multinational or international agency.  All of them seem to encounter the problem of inability to meet commitments or to utilise funds available to them.  At the same time, these large institutions look at what is on paper so far as an individual country is concerned.  We have to produce on paper in our budget a figure matching the commitments we have made.  Our credibility lies in the Book of Estimates in regard to an assessment of us by other countries and international agencies. From that point of view I would have a doubt in pursuing Deputy Quinn's idea, however logical it may seem.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe rightly emphasised the Brandt Commission Report.  In his speech he concentrated on the inadequacy of the development programme and the funds available.  I repeat that because of the enormity of the job involved there are not sufficient funds and there will never be sufficient funds. That is the reality of the situation.  The job is so enormous it would require a massive disengagement by the world of armaments commitments to ensure the proper transfer of moneys required.  It is in the armaments area &mdash; this was referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash; that there is the massive expenditure and if this were reduced and transferred to the Third World we could start making a dent in the problem and achieve some progress. <Col N="1166" /> Short of that, I am afraid the moneys are not available in the developed world to do anything other than a marginal or peripheral job, be it in the way of investment, technical assistance or development. The really big money that is being spent and wasted by the developed world is in the armaments area.  Until there is a reduction in world tension and in conflict, until positive and practical steps are taken towards disarmament, both in the conventional and in the nuclear area, the enormous funds required will not be available to do the massive job required to equalise the North and the South.</P>
    <P>Apart from the economic and financial blizzard that has hit the developed world since the Brandt Report was issued and which is circumscribing the developed countries in regard to the assistance they are giving and which is causing them to cut back on their development aid &mdash; this does not apply just to Ireland but to all countries in the developed world &mdash; unfortunately there has been an increase in world tension and potential conflicts. Thus, the disarmament process which we all see as the only approach to provide the funds we are talking about is running into heavy weather in the discussions that are taking place.  I attended such discussions in Geneva in recent months.  At present the conference in Madrid is engaged in a long procedural wrangle.  I hope to be there for the opening of the substantive part of the business in a few weeks' time.  I hope there will be progress but frankly I am not optimistic.  A climate of tension is building up in Europe itself &mdash; in Poland, in the increased visa restrictions on travel to East Germany &mdash; and there is also the conflict in the Middle East between Iraq and Iran.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult period on the political scene, one that does not engender optimism, but we must keep negotiating, we must keep talking and keep people around the table.  I feel that the CSCE conference in Madrid should be attended by as many Ministers of the Community and of the western European world as is possible to ensure that some steps are taken to bring people together in the spirit of Helsinki.  We must ensure there is enforcement of the Helsinki Agreement <Col N="1167" /> and that there are new provisions to develop <i>détente</i> further.  The French have a proposal for that agenda which is being supported by all members of the Community which proposes a European disarmament conference &mdash; excluding nuclear weapons at the start &mdash; that would be concerned with a phased reduction of conventional weapons to cover the entire area from the Atlantic to the Urals.  A number of other proposals dealing with confidence-building measures are also being proposed.</P>
    <P>There is also the aspect to which Deputy Quinn referred, namely, the implementation of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Agreement.  Frankly, there have been difficulties with some east European countries and with the Soviet Union with regard to this matter. As a country, we take up these cases and try to follow them on an individual basis. In the conference we will seek to ensure that progress is made in a harmonious way with regard to the three baskets as they are called, trying to knit in the three areas &mdash; the area of human rights and human relations, the area of economic co-operation and the area of military disarmament in general, with a view to obtaining a reduction in weapons and taking some confidence-building measures.</P>
    <P>The conference at Madrid has started and we hope it will get down to some substantive business in a few weeks' time and emerge with some progress made.  It is important to keep the concept of <i>détente</i> alive because with all its deficiencies in implementation and with all the polemics that have surrounded it, it still represents the most forward-looking concept in offering some hope of bringing east and west together in their mutual interest on the lines of the three areas I mentioned, namely, a reduction in weaponry, economic co-operation and human rights.  Unfortunately the Belgrade conference which followed Helsinki was a failure and if Madrid is a failure it will be very serious so far as <i>détente</i> is concerned. Therefore, it is important to make the Madrid conference a success, to show we are still talking and that some measures <Col N="1168" /> have been taken that will offer hope to a world that needs it.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat what I said in answer to a question last week.  The target of .7 per cent in regard to contributions from donor countries in respect of development assistance was reached by agreement between the donor and the recipient countries at the United Nations.  They recognised the facts of life as I spelled them out here.  They know that there is no Utopian situation in the developed world and that there are over eight million people unemployed within the EEC. They themselves agreed to this formulation at the recent meeting I attended at the UN and it will be formally adopted at the present session as being, in all the circumstances of the time, the best formulation to ensure in a spirit of realism that a percentage target of that kind will be achieved by the developed world throughout the eighties, I know it is not enough but it is the best that can be done at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised the matter of Zimbabwe.  In regard to the adherence of Zimbabwe to the Lomé Convention, the media took out of context a purely negotiating matter which caused delay of only 24 hours and implied that other countries were holding up this process.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Everything was agreed at a subsequent meeting of the Council of Ministers and Zimbabwe is now in the course of becoming a full member of Lomé with the right of access for 8,100 tons of beef.  Our main concern was to ensure that it would be kept under a ceiling which had already been agreed and to co-operate with other countries such as Botswana, Swaziland and Kenya who are not able to reach their quotas because of various disease factors.  The net result is that Zimbabwe, along with existing Lomé II countries exporting beef to the EEC, is now held under this ceiling.  Unfortunately the reality for Zimbabwe is that it will not be able to meet these targets for two years because of foot and mouth disease.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of explaining this matter because it gave rise to some misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised a very fundamental <Col N="1169" /> point concerning the question of balancing our role as an independent country with our role as a member of the Community participating in discussions and decisions on European political co-operation. I agree that it is a difficult role for any country but a very important one in which this country carries for greater weight through being a member of a Community of nine countries and contributing to the moulding of Community decisions than it would have as a voice crying in the wilderness.  The very fact of our involvement in decisions concerning European political co-operation within the Community adds far more to what we can achieve because we are accepted in the Community as a disinterested country in the sense that we do not have any major economic or political involvement.</P>
    <P>All Governments since we became an independent nation have adopted that stance and it is a stance which is particularly suited to a small country which never had major overseas involvement in terms of empire, wealth or military involvement of any kind.  That has been our major source of strength and we are regarded as being genuinely neutral and responsible.  The position we have always taken at the United Nations can now be adopted in the area of political co-operation within the Nine.  Inevitably this does involve a certain dilution of capacity to act completely independently.  If after discussion a consensus decision is reached, we go along with it unless it is against the fundamental interests of our country.  At the same time we have always managed to maintain an independent role at the UN.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in which we do not agree with the European view.  We would not, for instance, agree with some of the military or disarmament views of most of our colleagues within the Community. We have a far more pronounced and progressive attitude in the area of disarmament than any of our colleagues within the Community and will continue to hold our very strong views on that subject and speak on it in a reasonably independent and disinterested manner. I take Deputy Quinn's point that there <Col N="1170" /> are certain difficulties but the undoubted gain lies in pursuing an independent role in the area of European political co-operation and within the UN, seeking at the same time to go along with consensus decisions when there is no vital national interest involved or a matter about which we feel very strongly such as disarmament.  Overseas development aid took up the major part of the discussion and there does not appear to be any conflict in regard to other matters covered by the Supplementary Estimate. The &ldquo;A Sense of Ireland&rdquo; promotion was mentioned and I take the point about further developments of that idea.  However, it is sufficient to say that it was costly and this is always a factor in any promotion of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised the matter of certain posts which were not filled and the savings which accrued.  The posts to which he referred were incorporated in the Estimate at too early a stage and are now in the course of being filled.  There is no question of any running down of staff.  It was simply fortuitous that there was a delay in making the appointments.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for a very constructive debate and appreciate the interest shown in the matter of overseas development aid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Reports:</P>
    <P>Developments in the European Communities&mdash;Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Sixteenth Reports. </P>
    <P>When preparations were being made for Ireland to join the European Communities it was decided that it would be appropriate if reports on developments in the Communities were published every six months.  Accordingly, section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972, provides that the Government shall make such a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The reports which are the subject of the motion we are taking today cover the period from July 1978 to July 1980 and, since the Fifteenth Report deals with developments in the period of Ireland's Presidency of the Council and of European Political Co-operation, it is I think of special interest.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some regret to me that it has not been possible to find time for debates on these reports at an earlier stage.  Ideally these debates should, in my opinion, be held as soon as possible after the date of publication of each report. Deputies may have noted that recently arrangements have been made to have the reports published within approximately two months of the end of the period of review.  It is important that we should consider the developments outlined in the reports as soon as possible after they have occurred and therefore I would wish to see debates on motions such as we are considering today taken on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to some of the major developments in the various areas of Community activity during the period of the reports.</P>
    <P>However, since many of the events reported have now been superseded by more recent developments, I will concentrate on the current situation in the Community. Deputies may wish to advert to <Col N="1172" /> other matters not covered in my introduction to this debate and I will be happy to deal with these matters in my reply.</P>
    <P>The established format has been followed in these reports; reviews of meetings of the European Council held during the period are included, lists of ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, are given as annexes as are tables showing subsidies, grants and loans received by Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the outset I would like to mention the fact that during the period under review the negotiations for the accession of Greece to the European Communities were concluded.  Deputies will be aware that Ireland ratified the Treaty of Accession last December and now that all member states and Greece have completed their ratification procedures, Greece will become the tenth member state of the Community on 1 January 1981.  In regard to Portugal and Spain, accession negotiations are continuing.</P>
    <P>I would like to make clear our position in regard to the general question of enlargement and to the particular concerns which Ireland has expressed in the context of the accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain.  I wish to reiterate that Ireland has at all times expressed support for enlargement, but we have insisted that enlargement must not adversely affect present common policies or the future development of the Community. We have received the support of our partners for this view of enlargement.  I might in this regard mention in particular the position adopted by the Council at the time of the opening of accession negotiations in 1976, namely, that appropriate provision would be made for the needs of an enlarged Community; that the nature and future development of the Community would not be adversely affected by enlargement, and that institutional reform would be undertaken to enable the Community to act effectively after the accession of new member states.</P>
    <P>It was and remains our understanding that the Community is committed to ensuring that enlargement does not result in a weaker and less cohesive Community. In the course of the internal debate in the Community on enlargement we <Col N="1173" /> stressed the necessity of implementing measures aimed at reducing the regional disparities which exist within the Community as at present constituted.  Both in direct relation to the prospective enlargement and in the context of other developments, such as the establishment of the European Monetary System, we have achieved a certain degree of success.  I would mention in particular the measures for infrastructural aid for the West of Ireland which have recently been agreed and in the area of institutional reform Deputies will know that the Committee of Wise Men have submitted their report to the Council and it is at present under active consideration.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that our concerns are in no way aimed at the applicant states.  They are matters which must be resolved by the existing Community and indeed they would have to be tackled regardless of the enlargement context.  In particular the provision of adequate resources for the Community as at present constituted is a matter of pressing concern.  Deputies will be aware that agreement was reached last May on the concerns of the UK in regard to her net contribution to the Community budget. This enabled the Community to come to an agreement on agricultural prices and related measures which, while far from ideal, contrasted very favourably with what was originally proposed by the Commission.  The text on fisheries, too, which was agreed at the same time by the Council of Foreign Ministers, is a cause of satisfaction.  I will return to developments in the agricultural and fisheries sectors later.</P>
    <P>These agreements on the budgetary and related problems have shown that the European Community continues to have the ability to resolve serious and substantial differences of opinion among its member states.  At the same time it would be idle to pretend that the accommodation reached last May leaves us free from worry for the future.</P>
    <P>Part of the agreement reached by the Council at that time was that a general examination of Community policies and their financial implications would be undertaken by the Commission with a <Col N="1174" /> view to preventing the recurrence of unacceptable situations for any member state.  It was agreed that the examination would not call into question the common financial responsibility for those policies which are financed from the Community's own resources nor the basic principle of the common agricultural policy. The Commission's findings will be presented to the Council before 30 June next.  It is unfortunate, to say the least, that this examination of policies is taking place at a time when Community expenditure is on the point of reaching its present fixed limit of 1 per cent of value-added tax.  Given, on the one hand, the important share of agriculture in Community expenditure and, on the other hand, the importance to the Irish economy and to Irish society generally of a strong and prosperous farming community, it is clear that we shall have to be on our guard to ensure that no so-called &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to future budgetary problems creates for us that unacceptable situation for a member state which the Council is pledged to avoid.  We shall be on our guard.  Let there be no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>As far as we here in Ireland are concerned, what is wrong is not that we receive too much from the Community budget; no responsible body of opinion in Europe believes that.  What is wrong is that the regional and social funds are inadequately funded to make a significant contribution to one of the Treaties' fundamental objectives, namely, the convergence of member states' economies. The fact of the matter is that in 1979, for example, Ireland received over £400 million under the common agricultural policy. Important as our receipts from the regional and social funds are&mdash;amounts approved in 1979 were £38.7 million and £41.7 million respectively&mdash;it is clear that they are far from adequate to make a really significant contribution to closing the prosperity gap between Ireland and the better off members of the Community. We hear much nowadays about restructuring the Community budget. For too many people in Europe this has come to mean the spending of less money on agriculture.  We may be forgiven here for believing that it should mean <Col N="1175" /> increased expenditure in the weaker areas of the Community.  The debate on these questions for many people in our partner states is constrained by the 1 per cent VAT limit to Community revenues. It is totally unreasonable that this should be so, not merely because the EEC is facing enlargement from nine to 12 members&mdash;though that in itself is a powerful reason&mdash;but because within that limit the Community cannot adequately finance in the years to come the agricultural policy which is one of its main achievements, and for us its main attraction, and at the same time hope to bring the economies of its members closer together in mutual prosperity.</P>
    <P>The present limit to revenues is archaic.  It was fixed at a time when economic conditions were very different from what they are today and when the demands of financial solidarity were lower.  It is natural in an organic, developing Community that the requirements of the common purse should grow and develop with the Community itself.  It would be a denial of the Community's <i>raison d'être</i> to refuse to accept this and to insist on maintaining an increasingly unreal and artificial limit to the Community's possibilities.</P>
    <P>The period under review saw the European Council, at its meeting of 4-5 December 1978, adopt the formal resolution on the adoption of the European Monetary System.  This decision marked a significant step forward in the development of the Community.  That it was possible to successfully embark on such a progressive venture as the EMS, in an economic climate which was less than favourable to common action of such magnitude, must augur well for the future unity and development of the Community.</P>
    <P>The EMS continues to function satisfactorily and, although some limited realignments were necessary in September and November of last year, exchange rates have remained fairly stable overall. The performance of the punt within the system has been good&mdash;we have been in the upper part of the band of currencies for some time now&mdash;and the subsidised <Col N="1176" /> loans being provided within the EMS are being used to good effect to strengthen this country's economy.  Unfortunately, much public attention has been focussed on the performance of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pound sterling rather than the punt's performance within the EMS.  The change in the relationship with the pound sterling has been due, not to the weakness of the punt, but rather to the relative strength of the pound sterling against all the EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>The European Council, held here in Dublin last November, reaffirmed the objective of moving to the next stage by establishing the European Monetary Fund and requested the Economic and Finance Council to pursue agreement on the details of the fund.  Discussions are continuing on the complex technical details of the fund in the Monetary Committee and in the Committee of Central Bank Governors.</P>
    <P>In the context of its development co-operation policy the Community has continued to introduce greater coherence into its overall policies in trade, agriculture and other fields.</P>
    <P>The first ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé, which expired on 29 February 1980, was a unique model of relations between developed and developing countries and represented the most comprehensive expression of the Community's co-operation policy so far.  A successor to this convention was signed in October 1979 during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Communities, and is expected to enter into force later this year.</P>
    <P>The new convention consolidates and improves upon its predecessor.  The funds available for expenditure on ACP-EEC co-operation have been increased by 62 per cent and amount to nearly £3.8 billion of which Ireland's share will be £18.6 million, payable over a period of eight years.</P>
    <P>I might add that during the period under review the Community's relations with Turkey, Yugoslavia, the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and others have been developed significantly.</P>
    <P>The most significant development in <Col N="1177" /> the field of regional policy during the period under review was the establishment in the regional fund of a non-quota section, representing 5 per cent of the commitment appropriations from the fund, which will finance specific Community regional development measures. In October 1979 the Commission submitted proposals for use of the non-quota section to the Council for assistance to five areas in the Community including Irish border areas.  I am glad to state that, although adoption of the regulations was held up pending resolution of the British budgetary problem, they were adopted at Council on 7 October 1980.  The measures for the border regions concern five counties directly adjoining the Border on the southern side and eight district councils adjoining on the northern side and are aimed at economic activities in the fields of tourist accommodation, tourist-linked infrastructure, communications and artisan enterprises.  The financial allocation will be £10.7 million for the southern side and £5.3 million for northern areas over the period 1980-84.  With regard to approvals from the fund during the period under review, Ireland received a total of £23.62 million in approvals in 1978 and this increased to £41.73 million in 1979.  It is expected that approvals for 1980 will amount to approximately £48 million.</P>
    <P>As regards the social fund, approvals for Ireland amounted to £29 million in 1978 and £38.7 million in 1979.  It is expected that approvals for 1980 will amount to £56 million approximately.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector the major developments in the period covered by the reports concerned the changes necessary to take account of the European Monetary System and the agreement on agricultural prices for the 1979-80 and 1980-81 marketing years.  In December 1978 the Council had considered a proposal aimed at neutralising the impact of the European Monetary System on the common agricultural policy.  France linked their agreement to this proposal with progress on elimination of monetary compensatory amounts.  Following lengthy discussion on these issues during which the entry into force of the EMS <Col N="1178" /> was delayed, the member states, with the exception of the UK, finally agreed in March on the elimination of new MCAs arising during the first two years of the operation of the EMS.  At the same time the Council declared its determination to reduce progressively existing MCAs.</P>
    <P>The Commission submitted its proposals on agricultural prices for the 1979-80 marketing year to the Council in February 1979 and agreement on an overall increase of 1.5 per cent for all products other than milk&mdash;for which there was a price freeze&mdash;was eventually reached in June 1979.  While the price increase was relatively modest the agreement also included a number of measures of benefit to Ireland which added up to a satisfactory package for us.</P>
    <P>During the period of the Irish Presidency of the EEC&mdash;the second half of 1979&mdash;progress was made in a number of areas in agriculture.  Most notable was the agreement on important changes in the wine sector designed to bring about a better balance between production and consumption of wine in the Community.</P>
    <P>The major development in agriculture during the first half of 1980 from the Community viewpoint was, of course, the prices agreement for 1980-81.  Considering the tight budgetary situation and the pressures which are being exerted against the common agricultural policy, this price package was quite favourable to Ireland and represented a substantial advance on what was first proposed.  The overall price increase of 5 per cent was twice the original proposed and, as I mentioned earlier, of major significance for us was the agreement on a set of structural measures for the west of Ireland which will mean investment of £300 million over a ten year period; 50 per cent of the money for these measures will come from Community funds.  Other positive elements in the package of importance to Ireland were the agreement on a common sheepmeat policy which came into operation on 20 October and Community subsidies for beef suckler herds.</P>
    <P>Of major significance to Ireland also was the fact that none of the main antisurplus measures proposed by the Commission will apply this year.  This means <Col N="1179" /> no super levy, no cuts in sugar quotas and no suspension of beef intervention.</P>
    <P>The reports outline the difficulties in reaching agreement on a common fisheries policy which would govern fishing in the 200-mile zone which the member states established as from 1 January 1977. It has proved very difficult to reconcile the positions of the member states on the basic question of quotas, conservation policy and access.  However, during the periods covered by the reports several important measures designed to help the development of the Irish fishing industry were adopted.  A sum of 46 million units of account&mdash;approximately IR£30 million&mdash;was allocated to Ireland for the five-year period, 1977 to 1982 to build up our fishery protection and surveillance capability.  The Council also adopted a regulation providing for investment aid amounting to five million EUA's in the period under review for restructuring the inshore fishing industry.  This measure especially assists Ireland by a grant of up to 50 per cent of the cost of new fishing vessels of specified length and aid also for mariculture projects.</P>
    <P>At the Council in December 1979 a significant breakthrough was achieved when Ministers undertook to decide early in the New Year on Community measures for conservation and management of fishery resources for 1980.  Agreement in principle on total allowable catches and a common system of recording and notification of catches was reached on 29 January and progress was also made in regard to agreements with third countries.</P>
    <P>A major impetus towards settlement of the fisheries question was given by the declaration of the Council of Foreign Ministers on 29 May 1980 which laid down guidelines for the establishment of a common fisheries policy before 1 January 1981.  Since then significant progress has been achieved with agreement on a Community conservation policy.  Discussions are taking place at present on the allocation of national quotas and other elements such as structural policy, marketing proposals, and control measures, which will form part of a revised common <Col N="1180" /> fisheries policy with the aim of meeting the 1 January deadline set by Ministers.</P>
    <P>In the period under review the most significant development in relation to the institutions of the Communities was the holding of direct elections to the European Parliament in June 1979.</P>
    <P>There was a general feeling that this democratisation of the Community was a major step and that it would alter the relations between the institutions to some extent and, in particular, relations between the Parliament and the Council. Direct elections were invested with differing degrees of significance by various observers.  It is probably premature to make a judgment but perhaps it is fair to say that the results have not fulfilled either the most optimistic or pessimistic forecasts.  Finding a role for itself within the competences conferred on it by the Treaties is bound to be a gradual process as far as the Parliament is concerned and one which must emerge through a highly political process.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that a directly elected Parliament to be meaningful must have enhanced influence in the Community decision-making process.  There is probably a need to adapt existing procedures to ensure such an enhanced influence in particular in relations between the Parliament and the Council.  We are open to suggestions on how this could best be done.  In the coming months there will be discussions on this matter at all levels in the Community and the new Commission will no doubt look at the matter also.</P>
    <P>Institutions which function efficiently are essential to progress towards European Union particularly in the period just ahead when the Community faces serious economic problems.</P>
    <P>While recognising that political will and cohesion in the face of immediate difficulties are the most vital elements in progress towards European Union we have always advocated that strong institutions maintaining the competences and balances laid down in the Treaties can make a major contribution to decision-making. Within these parameters we can look at the performance of the institutions <Col N="1181" /> and support reform or adaptation where necessary.</P>
    <P>The system of European political co-operation, whereby member states consult together on world political issues and where possible and desirable work out common positions and policies, is a significant aspect of our Community membership.</P>
    <P>Through the activities of political co-operation and also through the Community's external relations activities, the Europe of the nine is increasingly regarded by the external world as a coherent entity in world affairs.</P>
    <P>At the United Nations the nine's practice of seeking to concert their views on matters before the Assembly and of adopting common voting positions whenever possible is now well established.  As the country holding the Presidency during this period, Ireland had the task of ensuring co-ordination among the nine, both in New York and among the capitals of the nine, on issues before the General Assembly and of presenting agreed nine views to the Assembly, whether in plenary session or in one of the seven main committees.  I might add that following our recent election to the Security Council, Ireland will be involved in a special way in the work of the United Nations over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The second review meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is scheduled to begin in Madrid on 11 November.  A preparatory meeting is currently taking place.  The nine are continuing their detailed preparations for the Madrid meeting and are consulting closely on all developments in the CSCE process.</P>
    <P>The Nine have on many occasions, most recently in the Venice Declaration of 13 June 1980, stated the principles which in their view are fundamental to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. These are, in particular, the right to existence and security of all states in the region, including Israel, and justice for all its peoples, which implies recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people who must be allowed to exercise fully their right to self-determination. The Nine have made clear that the <Col N="1182" /> achievement of these objectives requires the involvement and support of all the parties concerned and that the principles set down apply to all and thus to the Palestinian people and to the PLO, who must be associated with the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The situation in Lebanon is of continuing concern to the Nine.  Following the tragic death of three Irish soldiers serving with the UNIFIL force in Southern Lebanon last April, both the Nine Foreign Ministers and the European Council denounced the acts of violence committed against UNIFIL and demanded that the force be permitted to carry out its mandate in full.</P>
    <P>Since the taking hostage of the American Embassy personnel in Tehran on 4 November 1979, the Nine have condemned this flagrant breach of international law and have made repeated calls for the immediate release of the hostages.</P>
    <P>As regards the outbreak of hostilities between Iran and Iraq, the Nine have expressed their support for the efforts of the Islamic Conference and of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to secure a peaceful settlement.</P>
    <P>In Africa the Nine have reiterated their condemnation of apartheid in South Africa and indicated their determination to exert every pressure which would bring the South African Government to abandon that system.</P>
    <P>The Nine supported the new plan for the independence of Namibia and reject unreservedly efforts to impose a so-called internal settlement.  The lack of progress in implementing the United Nations plan is of concern and the Nine have requested the South African Government to accept fully its implementation without any furthere delay.</P>
    <P>As regards Afghanistan, the Nine believe that an acceptable solution must be found which will provide for a withdrawal of foreign troops and an opportunity for the people of Afghanistan to determine their own future.</P>
    <P>Also in Asia, the Nine have over the past year intensified their consultations on the problems of Indo China particularly in relation to the Vietnamese refugees and the famine in Cambodia.  While in recent months the situation in Cambodia <Col N="1183" /> has improved, the Nine are continuing to monitor the situation closely and the Community is continuing to contribute to the relief effort.  However, we believe that a permanent solution to Cambodia's crisis can only be achieved in the context of an overall political settlement in the country.</P>
    <P>In this introduction to the debate I have done no more than draw attention to some of the important developments in Community affairs in recent years.  I will be happy to respond to all points made by Deputies when I come to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: The first very disturbing feature of our discussion here this morning is that we are dealing with reports on developments in the European Community dating back to July 1978.  In many ways, on re-reading these earlier reports&mdash;the 13th and 14th reports in particular&mdash;one gets the feeling that one is reading history and the relevance of a discussion on matters in these reports at this stage is very much open to doubt.</P>
      <P>Not having had an opportunity of contributing to such a debate in the past since my changing over to Foreign Affairs from another portfolio, it struck me that I should look at the background, which I did.  I checked the European Communities Act of 1972, section 5 of which provides that the Government shall make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Communities.  It is important for us to decide what is meant by this section. Are we, in fact, complying with the statutory functions at all, in lumping together four of these reports and having, in effect, a bienniel discussion on developments within the European Communities, when the Act specifically states that the Government should report to the Houses twice yearly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment to this portfolio in mid 1979, I certainly have not had any such discussion.  It appears, indeed, that the last such debate took place some time early in 1978, or perhaps even earlier.  I do not wish to split legal hairs but it is relevant to question what is meant by the obligation placed on the Government by <Col N="1184" /> section 5 of the 1972 Act to report twice yearly to each House.  Perhaps the letter of the law is being followed by merely producing a booklet and distributing it to Members of the Oireachtas twice a year. Certainly, in my opinion the spirit of the law is not being implemented by not having a debate on those reports, except every couple of years.  I strongly urge the Government, if only to comply with their statutory duties, to ensure that in future we have biannual discussions in this House on developments in the European Communities.</P>
    <P>It is not just the lawyer in me which causes me to urge this course of action on the part of the Government.  Naturally, I feel that the Government must be the first to comply with both the letter and the spirit of the law, though it may be that the Minister, in his reply, may be able to suggest that he and his Government are discharging their obligation under section 5 of the Act merely by circulating reports.  Quite frankly, that does not appear to me to be reporting twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Leaving the legalities aside, our involvement in the European Community is now so important and so relevant to our entire development for many years that surely it must be in our interests to have regular discussion on developments within the European Communities.  From that point of view alone, from the point of view of the huge funds which accrue to this country through our involvement, and more so from the point of view of the difficulties and the complexities now appearing or which have been on the horizon for some time past in regard to future development of the Community, I strongly urge that in future we have debates in this House twice yearly.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rather frankly indicated in his speech, the present situation is that it is hardly worth while considering these reports, these pieces of history, in detail, that instead we should have a general look at the situation in the EEC.  I would go further by suggesting that we should be looking to the problems which are there, and I hope that the Minister in his reply will be more specific in his suggestions <Col N="1185" /> as to how to cope with these problems.</P>
    <P>In looking at the efforts of the Government and their performance in EEC matters over the last couple of years one of the most important developments was the question of the UK budget contribution. It was important in the context that a chance was missed by this country to inject into the negotiations the issue which is the most important issue to us, that is the limit on Community resources. It is pretty well known and has been known for a considerable time that the Community will run out of funds in the not too distant future unless a change is made in the own resources limit.  Earlier this year discussions took place on the UK demand.  I am convinced that the UK and a number of other major countries will not be in favour of increasing Community resources, but at the same time, the UK and particularly the two big powers, France and Germany, were keen to achieve a settlement of Britain's budget contribution problem.  This problem arose despite the fact that they had earlier had their first renegotiation about five years ago.  It does not say much for their negotiating ability or their vision as to what problems might arise in the future to have had to come back again with the serious situation they had.</P>
    <P>However, in the context of the British budget problem we should have put on the table and insisted that the question of the Community's own resources limit should be resolved at the same time. Without an increase in the 1 per cent VAT limit the financing of the EEC will be strangled.  This has been obvious for at least 12 months, and Ireland, as a substantial net beneficiary will suffer enormously unless a change is made.  I know that the problems of making a change are enormous in that not alone must we get an agreement through the EEC institutions but it will have to be ratified by the separate national parliaments and that will be the crunch issue. It is in that context, knowing the anti-EEC feeling amongst many of the British, that I say that, when they were getting a substantial refund of their budget contribution, that was the opportunity to <Col N="1186" /> tie in the question of getting agreement from them on lifting the VAT limit.  I am afraid that that opportunity having been let pass, it may be virtually impossible to get the House of Commons to agree on such a move in the future apart altogether from the difficulties in some other EEC countries.  When replying will the Minister deal with why that opportunity was let pass?  This is the most important issue in the Community today.</P>
    <P>I should also raise with the Minister the difficulties he and his Party may or may not have in securing allies for such a move.  We in Fine Gael are associated in Europe with the Christian Democrats and we have been able to obtain an absolute commitment from our colleagues, one of the major parties in the European Parliament, that there must be an increase in the Community's own resources.  I would ask the Minister to let me know the situation and the outlook of the Fianna Fáil allies in Europe, what is the outlook of the De Gaullists, because certainly the French have not shown any great inclination to increase the powers of the European Communities.  An increase in their financial limits and in their opportunity to spend more money is something that would get a very mixed reception in France.  I am concerned that the Fianna Fáil colleagues in Europe have not put themselves on record as being in favour of an increase in the Community resources.</P>
    <P>The second major issue which concerns me is that the Community budget now proposed for 1981 does not make adequate provision particularly in the regional and social funds for the accession of Greece.  This country becomes a full member next January and will be sharing in these funds.  When the question of the accession of Greece was first discussed in the middle seventies our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, with the vision that is typical of the man, solved the problem that could arise on their accession and secured a commitment from the Council of Ministers that the necessary further resources to meet the cost of Greek accession would be provided.  This is referred to in the Seventh Report of Developments in <Col N="1187" /> the European Communities at paragraph 1.18 where it says:</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supported the Greek application for accession but urged that the Community must resolve to make available the necessary further resources to meet the financial requirements which the application of existing common policies to Greece would entail.</P>
    <P>What is important is that a statement to that effect was agreed by the Council at their meeting in July 1976.  My concern is heightened by the fact that the budget proposed by the Commission for 1981, the first year of Greek membership, and the amendments made to it to date by the Council do not appear to be in conformity with the solemn agreement in the Council upon which the Irish decision to support Greek membership was made.  Thus the budget proposed by the Commission for the social fund in 1981, £670 million, is only 10 per cent greater than the 1980 figure which clearly allows no additional provision for Greek requirements from the fund if even minimal provision were to be made for inflation.  The actual sum proposed by the Council for the social fund namely, £600 million, makes complete nonsense of the solemn agreement of July 1976.  A similar situation arises in regard to the regional fund and again the Irish share proposed for 1981 is £52 million, only £4 million higher than the 1980 figure.  That will mean a reduction in real terms, taking inflation into account, as a result of the inadequacy of the total sum proposed and the size of the share required by Greece.</P>
    <P>I am gravely concerned that the Government did not make a stand on the decision of the Council of July 1976 when those figures were discussed but I am more gravely concerned about another matter.  When I raised this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Question Time last week Deputy Lenihan told me that proposals for a revision of the regional fund had not yet been discussed by the Council.  The Minister was not even aware that the figures had been discussed by the budget Council.  That is one of the most serious worries I have in <Col N="1188" /> discussing our situation in Europe.  The Government have, apparently, accepted in the budget Council figures of that order and yet the Minister for Foreign Affairs tells the House that they have not been discussed.  It is not my policy in politics to attack any Member on either side personally but I must record my grave concern that such a situation should arise. For the Minister's information that matter was discussed at a crucial session of the budget Council in September and, in fact, the Government thought so little of the problem that they did not dispatch a Minister to that meeting.  A junior Minister, Deputy Calleary, attended that meeting on the occasion of his first visit to Brussels.  I am not blaming Deputy Calleary but I must level the blame at the Government who permitted such a crucial meeting of the Council to proceed without heavyweight representation.  Of course, that is apart from the fact that the Minister with main responsibility for EEC affairs did not appear to know that the meeting had taken place at all.</P>
    <P>The situation now is that the budget figures proposed by the Commission, having gone through the budget Council, will be referred to the European Parliament next week.  It is the view of Fine Gael members of the European Parliament &mdash; I expect this view will be fully supported by other Christian Democrat colleagues &mdash; that the cuts should be restored and adequate figures produced. I should like to stress the importance of the Government, when the matter returns to the Council, ensuring that the 1976 decision at a minimum be adhered to.  The Government should ensure that we do not suffer in our allocation from those funds because of the accession of Greece.  I made that statement without an anti-Greek outlook.  I welcomed the accession of that country when we discussed a motion to approve Greek accession but I feel that the small and weak nations in the EEC must protect their own situation.  We are reinforced in doing so by the decision in July 1976 when the matter was first considered.</P>
    <P>The other major issue that has surfaced in recent times in the EEC is the rise in the tide of hostility in Europe against the <Col N="1189" /> CAP.  To a large degree that hostility has been met by a helpless response from the Government.  The CAP represents our biggest single national interest in the Community and is worth aproximately £400 million per year to us.  In the context of our budget and our economy that is an enormous sum and it is apart altogether from the benefits that accrue to our farmers who have had such a long history of the tie to the cheap food policy of Britain. Only in this decade have our farmers been able to develop their land and get reasonably adequate incomes.  As a result of the many circumstances in the last 12 months the take-off in development has been halted in its tracks and there has been a fall in farm income but, at the same time, the CAP over the last decade has been of enormous benefit to our farmers and our economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the lack of success on the part of our Administration in coping with this tide of hostility against the CAP.  I recall that when we joined the EEC the existence of the CAP was regarded economically as one of the major reasons why we should join.  We knew there were difficulties in other areas but on balance we decided that in economic terms we were better off to join the Community.  We have suffered as a result of the difficulties of which we were aware at the time and we lost over a period roughly 75,000 industrial jobs.  We paid the price of entry and it is altogether unreasonable that countries who gained as a result of Ireland paying the price should now decide that the continued funding of the CAP at a proper level is not appropriate for the future development of the Community.  That issue has to be fought all day, every day.  It is the major economic reason why we joined the Community.  We paid the penalty in other areas and we must insist at all times that the CAP is properly expanded and developed in the future.  That has not happened.  Dairy farmers are aware that the price for a gallon of milk in 1980 is approximately the same as it was in 1977 when Fianna Fáil returned to power, about 50p per gallon.  That situation exists in spite of increases in inputs of almost 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> I am concerned that our negotiators in this instance do not appear to be up to the tactics of those in the Commission who would like to restrict the CAP. There was huge publicity about the proposed super levy last year and our negotiators appeared to fall for that in a big way.  They concentrated on developing a huge campaign against the super levy but forgot that it seemed to be a blind so that the increases which should have been granted were not even fully discussed. The major success of our Ministers in dealing with this aspect of EEC affairs was that they were able to ensure that the super levy was not imposed in the current year.  Apart from that they came back with a couple of percentage points which would not even be a fraction of the inflationary cost added to farmers' incomes. I greatly fear that we shall face the same situation next year because the super levy, having served the anti-CAP people so well last year will be hauled out of retirement and produced again for the current year's budget.  As far as they are concerned it will again serve its purpose if the whole fight is concentrated on the super levy as a result of which they can slip through either a nominal or low increase in prices otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not say that the super levy, if hauled out of retirement this season, must not be fought tooth and nail: my point is that while such a fight is going on the real issue must not be forgotten this year as it was last year and that is the entitlement of farmers to an increase which will at least offset their extra costs.  It is probably not even realistic at this stage that we should be looking for increases for farmers of the order achieved during the term when Deputy Clinton was negotiating in Brussels when there were circumstances involving transitional provisions and so on which applied then.  I recollect that apart from such transitional provisions he was still getting the normal increases for them and there was certainly never any question that the increases were not adequate considering the inflation level at that time.  Over the past couple of years this has not been so and I must put the situation fairly and squarely to our negotiators, <Col N="1191" /> while fully realising the problems in Europe.</P>
    <P>One must also bear in mind that the surpluses that are spoken about in Europe in the context of the overall amounts produced are quite small.  Even more important is the fact that the contribution made by this country to such surpluses is in many cases non-existent or at most very minimal.  We produce only 4 per cent of the dairy produce coming into the Community.  In those circumstances we must certainly resist the attempts being made to penalise our farmers and prevent them at least getting a fair deal under CAP.</P>
    <P>The Minister earlier in his speech referred to the reports covering a certain period and said that since the 15th report dealt with developments in the period of Ireland's Presidency it was of special interest.  I was particularly taken by the efforts made by Ireland in the agricultural area at that time and wondering to what extent they would be of special interest. I thought it rather amusing that the most notable achievement in the area of agriculture during Ireland's Presidency was important changes in the wine sector.  It made me wonder whether Irish negotiators or Ministers dealing with European matters had their priorities right.</P>
    <P>The other major matter referred to in the Minister's speech and in the reports is the question of fisheries.  It is scarcely fair to refer to that infamous document of 1977 regarding fisheries but it is no harm to remind ourselves of the past in considering results and achievements in the present.  Even prior to 1977 I recall a special Bill being introduced in this House, of which I was not a Member at the time, but I had a great interest in fisheries.  I think it was introduced by the present Taoiseach as a Private Members' Bill on behalf of the then Fianna Fáil Opposition.  If my recollection is correct it was entitled the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Bill and it insisted on the 50-mile limit.  The 50-mile limit question was again included in that infamous 1977 document but in the Minister's report to date we are not talking about the exclusive limit which, let me record, would <Col N="1192" /> have been obtained if the Government then had stayed in power.  I accept that the exclusive limit would not have been the full demand but it would have been virtually the full amount of the claim and the mess that our fishing industry is in at present would not have developed if the former Government had remained in office to enable it to conclude its negotiations.</P>
    <P>However, that is history and it is unfortunate for our fishermen that a change of Government took place.  We are now talking about quotas and TACs.  As regards fisheries there appears to be no comprehension on the Government's part of the problems and difficulties suffered by the fishermen from the closure of the Celtic Sea.  In recent times I spoke to many of them and it is quite clear that many of them having invested huge sums in modern trawlers are on the verge of bankruptcy because of the restrictions placed on them.  I wish our present Minister every success in concluding the best deal possible in the present negotiations. Although a Member of the Government Party at the time when the exclusive limit was jettisoned within weeks of Fianna Fáil resuming office, he was not directly responsible for it.  I must say, however, that unless a reasonable deal emerges from the present negotiations many of our fishermen will be fishermen no longer because they will be unable to continue making the huge repayments on their boats and meeting large fuel costs and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to European political co-operation which raises a number of issues which were mentioned in the previous debate and which I thought would be more appropriate in the debate on developments in the European Communities. This raises the question how far we can travel in the context of European political co-operation bearing in mind the huge size of the heavyweights in the EEC, and poses the question of our neutrality considering that the other EEC members are also members of a military alliance.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which I can see Ireland treading on thin ice from time to time.  Recalling the debate we had on the <Col N="1193" /> Middle East and the Minister's wild Bahrein statement, one advantage of European co-operation as far as we are concerned is that it imposes a certain amount of restraint on our Minister.  The Community's declaration in regard to that troubled and tangled area seemed to have been more sensibly based than the wild Bahrein speech of the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is a matter we will have to look at so that we can realise where there are problems and decide what type of perspective we should have so that we will be aware of the difficulties we might get into in the future from the point of view of our military neutrality.  It is only by having an adequate debate on these matters that we will be able to identify problems and come up with solutions.  At the moment there is a danger that willy-nilly we may wander into problems because we cannot see the signposts on the road before us.</P>
    <P>I could go on for a long time dealing with the performance of the Government in the EEC but the period being covered in this debate is too long to allow for anything more than merely to touch on the main issue. However, we should try to establish a vision as to what Ireland's role in the EEC should be in the future.  The first question should be how serious are we in our approach to the Community? In economic terms I have no doubt we take the Community seriously, naturally because we are a large net beneficiary from Community expenditure.  In political terms, how seriously is the Community being taken in Ireland?  Our role in that sense will be more important in the future.  In the past there was no vivid pattern in regard to Community expenditure. Neither was there a challenge to the institutional pattern of the Community.</P>
    <P>Now, however, we are facing an enlarged Community and one questions if in political terms we are prepared for that.  There were many reasons why we joined the Community in the first place. Economically we were under the domination of our larger neighbour and I suppose we wanted to escape from that and <Col N="1194" /> participate in a wider political and economic grouping, but have we made use of the political aspects of this grouping? Have we examined them and do we consequently see where we are going in that context?</P>
    <P>What I am trying to point to is the question of alliances within the Community. I am satisfied that in the hard bargaining leading to Community decisions one needs to have allies.  At the moment there is a Franco-German hegemony in the Community and it appears to me it would be very difficult to resist decisions taken jointly by the two.  I was disturbed by an article in <i>The Economist</i> last month in which there was acceptance of that and a suggestion that it is in Britain's interest that it should be extended to a three-way grouping.  Now that Britain's re-negotiation problem is out of the way and bearing in mind that certain aspects of the conflict between the French and the British have been resolved, it is not inconceivable that we will be facing in Europe a three-way line up, not formalised, which could impose on us, if we are to have any support at all for the type of policies that are in our interests, the need to see where we can get support.</P>
    <P>In the past, particularly in regard to harmonisation of legislation and that sort of thing, our approach has coincided with that of the British, perhaps because we share a common legislative base.  I said earlier that I thought our part in the British EEC budget secondary negotiations was much too soft and I do not think we will gain in the future from that approach.  In the first place it will cost us £16 million.  We tend to have a common approach with the French on agricultural matters and we could look for support from them on certain issues.  However, as far as they are concerned we are very small fry and I cannot imagine them being very concerned about an Irish link.  They demonstrated that when the Taoiseach attempted to raise the question of Northern Ireland at a meeting with the French President.  It was obvious that he was not going to become involved in that area. While I see advantages in having a common approach to certain problems where we have a mutuality of interests I do not <Col N="1195" /> think the French will be greatly concerned about our position in the Community. In expressing that view we must bear in mind that the French outlook has been in favour of the restriction of Community competence and the maintenance and expansion of national control.  They have not a communitaire approach and their approach would not be in our interests.</P>
    <P>What can we do in that situation?  We can look to the efforts made by the Coalition Minister for Foreign Affairs. There is no doubt that in 1975-76 an attempt was made to ensure that we had allies in regard to matters of special interest in the Community.  I am sure it was not by coincidence that there appeared to be a co-ordinated approach between Ireland, Denmark and the Benelux countries on matters of common vital interest. It seems to have been discontinued since 1977.  It is not in Ireland's interest that discussions on matters of common interest should be dropped.</P>
    <P>As regards Italy there are matters which would be of common interest and we could be allies on certain matters. However, with the rapid succession of Italian Governments it might be difficult to co-ordinate anything with them.  There are certain issues on which an Italian Irish contact could be fruitful.</P>
    <P>There is no single or uniquely valid alliance in Community affairs for Ireland. In the nature of things even the most carefully defined and balanced approach would require a shifting and changing attitude and shifting and changing alliances. I do not believe all the possible combinations have been tried by us.  It will be important in the years and battles ahead not to attempt to make our case in Europe on our own depending on what we see as the rightness and justice of it, without getting support for it.  That will involve establishing alliances.</P>
    <P>We must be clear on what our approach should be in the Community. Are we in favour of the French approach of reducing Community confidence and extending the area of national authority? To me that does not appear to be the correct approach.  We must defend the <Col N="1196" /> Community approach and seek an expansion of it if such can be obtained.  What should our approach be in regard to Community policies which do not directly affect us?  We should have a standard policy and in the context of forming alliances which might be useful to us we must take an interest in these policies and ensure that we make an input to them because any question of alliances or common approach cannot be on the basis of all take and no give.</P>
    <P>In many ways it is much easier for us to give in areas which are not of great importance to us.  We are seeking a Community which conforms more closely to the Treaty objectives and allows Ireland to realise the aims with which it joined the Community.  It is important that because the economic return from membership has been on the scale we have witnessed since 1973 we should not blind ourselves to the fact that the political returns have been considerably below our expectations.  This aspect will be more important in the future.  We will be faced with major decisions on how big the Community budget should be.  Apart from the limit on our own resources, even at its present level it is not of sufficient size to have a proper redistributive function.</P>
    <P>There was at all times argument that there would be a convergence of economies and those in weaker areas would be brought up to the level of richer areas. On the basis of the present budget, apart from the problem of the ceilings, there is no hope whatever of that happening even with the continuation of present policies. It has been argued by many commentators that the budget should be multiplied by two and a half or three times to have any kind of major effect on the level of economic activities in the Community.  In the present situation it would be difficult to achieve anything like that.</P>
    <P>When one approaches the problems in the EEC it is important to know not so much where one is going but where one would like to go.  We must not forget that.  When one goes to meetings in Europe there is a danger that the view one has of the problems will, because one sees the difficulties of other countries, <Col N="1197" /> affect the basic commitment to one's own case.  That highlights the importance of being clear as to what our policies and aims are.  If we have plotted out the road we want to travel we will know if we are being pushed too much into a by-road as a result of negotiations trying to reach a settlement on different issues.</P>
    <P>Having missed an opportunity last year we must mobilise what support can be obtained for an increase in the 1 per cent VAT limit.  This year it may be more difficult to achieve than last year but, unless it is, the Community's finances will be strangled.  We have no carrot to offer to the British so they will be reluctant and the Germans will be reluctant, but somehow or other we will have to make a stand on this before either the Community budget comes to a complete standstill or certain policy areas of the Community have to be shelved altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that one can cover all the issues in regard to the EEC in one debate.  In my contribution I have made remarks which the Minister may feel are somewhat critical but I believe it is in the interest of everybody on this island that future developments in the European Communities are such that the allocation to this country will not be reduced.  There are difficulties and problems.  It is important that these be realised and that a clear plan of campaign be established to ensure that, in so far as those problems can be surmounted, they will be.</P>
    <P>Finally, I end as I began by saying that it is important that we have more discussions on developments in the European Communities and I urge the Minister to ensure that in future both the letter and the spirit of section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972, will be observed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>: I also am glad that the House has an opportunity to discuss in detail the developments as listed in the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th reports.  I agree with the Minister that ideally these debates should be held as soon as possible and I am glad that arrangements have been made that they be published <Col N="1198" /> approximately two months from the end of the period reviewed.</P>
      <P>In the period 1978-80 we had difficulties at the latter end, but I find satisfaction in the Minister's speech where he referred to the regional policy, the social fund and the structural measures for the west of Ireland.  I would like to pay tribute to the people who negotiated that deal in a very difficult year under difficult circumstances.  Referring to EEC Regulation 1820 of 80, not even the most optimistic in this House or outside could forsee that we would get approval of that full package, which was secured.  When we are examining the regional policy and the social fund it is important to take into account those various developments. The structural measures for the west of Ireland include Ulster, Connaught and part of Munster, while the non-quota section of the regional fund deals in some cases with agricultural development, forestry and so on.  At a time of stringency and tight budgets the funding allocation for this regional policy has increased by more than double during the period under review, or from £23.62 million to £48 million.  Admittedly it still is not enough for this area which needs funding very badly.  In any border area within a country&mdash;and there are other such border regions in Europe&mdash;there is need for development.  A genuine practical effort has been made in regard to the provision of this money.  Between now and 1984 this £16 million from the non-quota section will have to be spent in the field of tourism development and craft industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the Derry-Donegal cross-Border communications study, which was carried out by consultants appointed by the British and Irish Governments. This study investigated all forms of communication in the light of the existing situation in order to make recommendations for future development.  The study covered areas such as road development, freight transport, public passenger transport and airports for the region of Derry-Donegal, the Erne catchment area.  This study has been referred to the EEC for a decision.  There was a proposal to spend £68 million on development of agriculture, <Col N="1199" /> tourism and arterial drainage.  The study was commenced in early 1979 and launched publicly in June of this year. The mandate of the consultants was to assess and report on the development potential of the Erne catchment area with reference to tourism amenities and requirements and to the development of land resources through arterial drainage. The report put forward a wide range of recommendations in relation to such matters as improvement of the quality of tourist accommodation, improvement of accessibility and of transport services and the provision of the necessary infrastructure to sustain an increased flow of tourists, and it recommends extensive arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>A number of Departments will be involved here.  Certain problems exist in that region which embraces the hydroelectric scheme at Ballyshannon where there are statutory levels and limitations on water level at, for instance, Enniskillen. I hope that the various Departments can come together to try to work out a policy in which there would be no holdup in the implementation of this programme. Finally on the Border is the Louth-Monaghan-Armagh-Down region where again a study is being carried out and a river is involved here also.  There is urgency in this region also involving not alone arterial drainage but also the supply of water to group water schemes. The river here is low down on the list for minor schemes and it should be taken out of that list and attended to as a cross-Border economic development project. With the funding available and the multiplicity of projects suggested some type of development board should be set up.</P>

      <P>: Paragraph 14 of the First Schedule to the Adoption Act, 1952, requires An Bord Uchtála to publish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the making of every adoption order.  I am not aware of any undertaking to introduce legislation to do away with the requirement and on the information at present available to me I am not convinced that the case for doing so has been made out.  There is no reason that I am aware of why the making of an adoption order should be secretive, provided, of course, confidentiality as to the child's background is maintained.  Third party rights are affected by an adoption order and it is at least arguable that there should be some public record of the making of an order. I would, however, be prepared to consider the matter further if legislation in regard to adoption were in contemplation.</P>
      <P>An Bord Uchtála, having consulted the adoption societies, recently prepared a note indicating aspects of adoption they would welcome research into.  My Department are now seeking proposals from some research bodies on the basis of that note.</P>

      <P>: I do not understand the answer.  Does the Minister see a case for considering the degree of confidentiality or public attention which is at present given to the whole process of the publication of the adoption order?  My question does not suggest that we want legislation to stop at the adoption order nor does it suggest that we stop the adoption order from being published.  Would the Minister consider changing the present system to give greater protection to the child and the adoptive parents without depriving the natural parents of the right of having at least a source reference at some stage, but without having to publish this matter?</P>

All I am asking is if he will consider the possibility of dropping the need to publish the names of adoptive parents and the first names of adopted children as widely as is now published, for obvious reasons?  This is an aspiration which is generally accepted as being worthy.  Will the Minister consider that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: At the outset I should make it clear that I believe that, while the Garda have a substantial role to play in controlling drug abuse, the misuse of drugs is primarily a social problem.</P>
      <P>As regards Garda activity in this matter in the midland areas.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, whereas there was one prosecution for a drugs offence in the Longford-Westmeath and Leix-Offaly Garda Divisions last year, there have been 15 such prosecutions to date this year and the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions are awaited in another case.  The majority of the offenders have been in the 19 to 21 age group.  All of the cases have involved the drug cannabis.  The use of `hard' drugs such as heroin, cocaine and so on has not come to the notice of the Garda in those areas.</P>
      <P>The question of drug offences will continue to receive special attention from the Garda who are conscious of the fact that there is concern generally, and especially among parents, about an apparent increase in drug abuse.  The Garda for their part are keeping the problem under constant review and in that context are giving special attention to training and deployment of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>: This increase in prosecutions is proof that the abuse of drugs is fairly constant in the midlands.  Is the Minister aware that many young people who indulge in drug taking seem to have as much expertise as medical people in the area of seeking out chemicals and combining them with otherwise harmless substances for the purpose of going on trips?  If this is the case, the Garda must be helped by way of an educational programme that keeps up with the bizarre and changing trends in the compounding of illegal and harmful drugs ....

      <P>: The publication of reports commissioned by the bodies under the aegis of my Department is a matter to be decided by the bodies concerned.  The normal practice is to publish reports which they consider to be of general public interest.

As a principle, of course, one must accept that one should publish as much as would be of public interest and I have said that in my reply.  As the Deputy has acknowledged in his supplementary question, there are matters arising in relation to these reports in my Department, and presumably in others, which may not be immediately of public interest and may have a confidential element in them.  To the extent that public interest would be served by continuing the level of publication, I agree with the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>A small number of cases involving difficulties in exchanging Irish currency abroad has been brought to the attention of my Department and the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The efforts of the Central Bank and my Department have been directed towards making Irish currency better known and hence more widely accepted by banks in general and in particular those operating branches at international airports in the EEC.  This is aimed at ensuring that Irish currency notes and other instruments will be readily exchangeable at banks.  Duty free shops and other commercial outlets are more likely to accept Irish currency in payment if their banks are prepared to convert it into national currency.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank have circulated specimens of Irish notes to central banks in other countries and have approached directly those banks operating branches at international airports in the EEC.</P>
      <P>My Department, in addition, have been in contact with the EEC Commission which, in turn, raised the matter with the Committee of Credit Associations of the European Communities.  The committee has indicated that it encourages its members to provide facilities for the exchange of Irish currency at major locations such as city centre and airport branches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the annoyance to travellers which a refusal to accept our currency abroad can cause but there are limits to what can be achieved by official action. As I indicated previously to the House &mdash; for example, in a reply to a question on 20 March 1980 &mdash; the strict legal position is that banks and commercial institutions in general cannot be legally compelled to exchange or accept as payment currencies other than their own.  In practice the most important factor in determining whether a currency will be accepted is that of cost.  Banks which do not have a matching turnover in Irish currency notes may not be willing to incur the costs involved in returning them to this country.  This is probably the major <Col N="1218" /> reason behind the cases of non-acceptance of Irish notes which have been reported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister accept that there might be a difference in this area in relation to private banks and State banks?  In countries abroad where banks are effectively under public control there should be no difficulty in buying Irish pounds if the Government and the Minister's Department make public representations on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The only two countries in the EEC which could be said to have a degree of State involvement in the banking sector would be France and Italy.  Even their institutions work to a very considerable extent according to the normal guidelines operating in the banking world.  It should certainly be feasible, to the extent that there is a degree of liaison between them and the Government, to take note of our particular concern, which, as I have said, we have indicated both on a bilateral and multilateral basis and we will continue to do that.</P>

      <P>My Department received a copy of the allegations made against the firm at the time the original complaint was made to the Stock Exchange and were informed by representatives of the exchange on 1 May 1980 that they had decided to carry out an investigation.  A proposal from the Stock Exchange that the Government defer any action on the allegations pending the outcome of their investigation was accepted on condition that a copy of the full report of the investigation would be made available to me.  Following the receipt of the report, including the evidence given to the investigating committee and the findings of the Council of the Stock Exchange, my Department sought and were furnished, by the senior partners of the firm, with detailed explanations of matters disclosed in the evidence to the committee.</P>
      <P>It is the practice to have regular discussions with the senior partners of the firm on developments in the market for Government securities and their function as the Government stockbrokers.  The present appointment of the firm is for a period of three years expiring on 31 December 1981, and, in accordance with the normal practice for Government appointments, there will be prior review of future arrangements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not the practice to publish revised tax revenue estimates during the course of the year.  However it is expected that receipts under PAYE will exceed the post-budget estimate of £794 million due to the emerging level of wages and salaries; ordinary wages and salaries account for most but not all such receipts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

As I indicated in my reply, the level of revenue will be in some way related to the level of pay increases.  It would be engaging in speculation to give any figure.  As I have said, it is expected that receipts will exceed the estimate of £794 million.  I said in my budget statement when I put in provisions for special pay increases in round terms that if there was an excess it would be matched to some extent, but not of course totally, by revenue.</P>

      <P>The bound volumes of the Acts of the Oireachtas for all of the years 1922 to 1973 are out of print.  The volumes for the years 1974 to 1976 are available from the Government Publications Sales Office, but volumes for the years subsequent to 1976 have not yet been printed. However, copies of all Acts of the Oireachtas are available in individual form from the Sales Office.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the out of print volumes is at present under examination by my Department in conjunction with the Stationery Office and I am confident that an improvement in the present position will be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the reprinting of revised statutes from the foundation of the State in, presumably, volume form, this proposal is not considered warranted by the Attorney General's office in view of the existence of the Index to the Statutes which lists all statutes from 1922 and indicates if they have been affected by subsequent legislation and, if so, gives the affecting Act and section.  However, work on a Statute Law Revision Bill &mdash; which will repeal all pre-1922 legislation which is no longer of any effect &mdash; and a comprehensive index of all the statutes <Col N="1224" /> which at any time applied in the State is in progress.  This work would enable revised statutes, showing not only post-1922 legislation but all the statute law in force in the State, to be produced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: As in the case of all other taxpayers it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to satisfy themselves as to the true taxable profits of oil distributing companies in this country and tax them on those profits.</P>
      <P>The commissioners have advised me that the question of the true taxable profits arising in this country, and in other tax jurisdictions, in the case of multinational companies is a matter which they keep under continuous review.  They are, however, satisfied that the profits arising in this country to oil distributing companies are adequately taxed in accordance with the existing law relating to corporation tax on company profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

They can do this by way of the amounts they pay their parent companies for products.  Does the Minister think there might be some truth in this suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The pricing policies of these multinational companies and the trensfer arrangements are obviously matters which can affect the tax yield of any country in which they operate a base or <Col N="1228" /> on an agency basis.  This matter has been examined by the OECD from time to time and there are certain recommendations to ensure that there is a balanced and equitable yield to the countries in which they operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The OECD have a continuing level of consultation in relation to revenue matters of that sort and they take account of this matter, amongst others.  I do not wish to overstate the significance of this.  Revenue arrangements generally are obviously a matter of concern where there are multinational companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is important that I should state categorically that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied there is no question of evasion involved in this instance in this country.  However, pricing policy has an impact which countries must arrange between themselves.  There is no cause for concern but where there are multinational operations it is important that the international tax regime should be able to keep abreast of developments within these companies and this is, in fact, the case.</P>

      <P>: This is an issue which has been of interest for some time, not least, as indicated in the course of the economic debate here, during the period in which our predecessors held office.  Of course it is important to ensure that moneys are applied to maintain the development of the economy.  A relatively small proportion of the national debt is made up of foreign borrowing.</P>

      <P>: We recognised what the Opposition today do not recognise, that statements, even from Opposition leaders, of the kind which Deputy FitzGerald made here are looked on rather seriously abroad where other Opposition leaders have a sense of responsibility.  Whatever attention is paid to the statements of Deputy L'Estrange is, of course, entirely a different matter. I reject that there is any question of putting the country in pawn or, as Deputy FitzGerald said, going on our knees to a certain institution.  Such a statement may have served his political purpose at home.</P>

      <P>: Before moving the adjournment I was suggesting that in order that border regions could avail fully of the funds in the non-quota section and of the regional fund generally a development board should be established to co-ordinate the efforts of the various groups at present handling this matter&mdash;there are the regional development organisations, county development teams and local authorities all involved in the formulation of proposals and suggestions. During the month of September Bord Fáilte placed an advertisement in provincial papers seeking suggestions from groups and individuals regarding the development of tourism in border regions.  While they are to be commended for seeking such suggestions and endeavouring to get a consensus in that area they should have been doing so about five years ago.  Public representatives and the other groups I have mentioned have been deeply involved over the last four or five years and Bord Fáilte should have been active during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made in the Minister's speech and by the previous speaker of the accession of Greece.  Its inclusion in the EEC, bringing the number of member states to ten, should not be in conflict in any way with our membership.  Probably it will be an ally as far as the common agricultural policy is concerned. I agree with the previous speaker on the <Col N="1256" /> importance of the common agricultural policy.  It is generally agreed that to date it has been the most successful of all the common policies of the EEC.  Indeed it has come under increasing attack recently.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on his successful efforts during the year against the imposition of the milk super levy and also in his opposition to the suspension of intervention beef in the summer months.  The suspension of intervention beef during the summer months &mdash; coming at a time when many beef producers would not have been prepared for it and were dependent on grass in the early months of the summer to finish their cattle &mdash; would have been very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier Regulation 1820 of 80, approved on 24 June, in regard to agriculture in the western counties under which some £150 million in FEOGA aid will be matched £ for £ by our Government over the next ten years.  Certainly it will provide a unique opportunity to set up a proper agricultural structure in the 12 western counties with regard to the development of our resources, processing and marketing.  Under this heading it was maintained that there would be some £8 million in FEOGA aid available, with a 50 per cent subsidy from the EEC for calf to beef systems to improve our method of production.  This form of interest subsidy on loans of £100 for two years for each calf reared to the fattened state would be available provided that an applicant followed the planned scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of marketing and production there is an allocation of £32 million, a special FEOGA project scheme, with again a 50 per cent subsidy, which would increase the grant aid for processing and marketing from 25 to 50 per cent.  The various Departments involved should take a very close look at those two proposals to ascertain how best those funds can be utilised because the present method of marketing of our beef products leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>In the October edition of <i>Farm and Food Research</i> there was an article entitled &ldquo;Do beef prices make sense&rdquo;. That article outlines very clearly fluctuations in beef prices, showing that in the <Col N="1257" /> 12 months since July 1979 prices varied from 76p to 64p, then back up to 76p and back down to 68p, this at a time when the retail price of meat had steadily increased and was 6 per cent higher in both England and Wales.  Admittedly during that period also slaughter by-products and hides fell drastically but in no way accounted for this type of price variation. We must face the fact that over one-third of our beef sales takes place in the last quarter of the year.  These continuing variations of prices in Britain account for 60 per cent of our meat.  Within the EEC an effort will have to be made to increase marketing outlets throughout Europe because, when one realises that one penny in the £ amounts to approximately £5.60 per hundredweight, or £56 for a 10 hundredweight animal, one realises that that type of situation is not desirable.</P>
    <P>Those two measures must be carefully examined in an endeavour to implement the calf to beef system which would mean also a steadier flow of animals into the factories.  It is important in the meat trade that we have some type of selling agency. Apparently at present when slaughterhouses and factories find it difficult to sell or are beyond their cut on the British market they endeavour to offset that variation by charging steep prices to the producer.  This is a very serious situation and one that must be closely examined.</P>
    <P>Also included in those measures are rural water supplies with 40 per cent FEOGA aid.  I would ask the Minister to have this measure implemented as quickly as possible because there is a large number of group water schemes throughout the country awaiting this aid. We are delighted that the Minister was successful in his efforts in this respect, which was a great achievement.</P>
    <P>There is £16 million devoted to the rural electrification scheme.  I hope in this case that not alone would this money be spent on improvements to existing supplies to farmers who are putting in larger motors and heavier equipment but that they would also subsidise farmers by way of subvention to first time house builders who at present are faced with high quotations from the ESB.  In many rural areas there are small industries where a three-phase <Col N="1258" /> supply is essential, where they can no longer operate machines on the single phase and I hope that money will be provided for that.  We have also the proposal for £51 million for farm investment with 50 per cent FEOGA aid.  This would go by way of capital investment to increase livestock numbers, where grants for development would be paid to farmers. There would also be special exemption for western farmers in regard to the restriction of investment aid on dairying, 40 per cent of grant aid rather than the present 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The final measure which was outlined was £8 million for farm training and for agricultural colleges.  In an area where only 25 per cent of farmers avail of the advisory service, farm training centres would be ideal.  Not alone should money be spent in that way, but the new agricultural body, ACOT, should consider withdrawing almost completely the advisory service from top bracket farmers, farmers who over the years have accumulated sufficient knowledge, and should consider concentrating instead on the lower income farmers by trying to improve their production methods and management systems.</P>
    <P>There is also £18 million in respect of forestry development.  It is welcome at a time when so much emphasis is placed on alternative sources of energy.  I mentioned earlier that those two &mdash; cross-Border regional aid plus the aid for western development &mdash; should be looked at as one.  This money was to be provided for both State and private planting. Therefore, it would be an opportune time to concentrate on providing aid and assistance to both individuals and groups, either for timber or for short rotation forestry, for this biomass production which is on trial in various areas.  It is accepted that we should now be in a position to save about £45 million per year by using the produce of our forests rather than importing timber.  Those are the measures which were introduced from 1978 to 1980.  In that field there has been a great measure of success and with proper planning of those two schemes, the face of the whole western region &mdash; those less developed counties in the west, <Col N="1259" /> plus the three Ulster counties &mdash; could be transformed by these measures.  It would ensure continuation of our rural communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister is to be congratulated on obtaining a seat for Ireland on the Security Council of the United Nations.  It is worthy of him and of the country that we will have a full seat there for the next two years.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the present fixed limit of 1 per cent has almost been reached.  As I understand it, we are at over 95p for this year of that 1 per cent and that does not account for any extra spending.  It is very important for the Minister to press ahead to get this 1 per cent increase because we depend on it for the common agricultural policy, for the regional fund and the other funds there. If the European Commission have to increase the 1 per cent it would have to be approved by all the Parliaments of the member states and, in view of the row that Britain kicked up last year over their contribution to the European Fund, it will be very hard for any Prime Minister to get it through their Parliament.  We should try to have the 1 per cent increased to ensure that the Community has money for the different funds from which we benefit.  Parliament could use that 1 per cent as a basis for controlling the amount of funds coming to this country under CAP, the regional fund, and the social fund.  They could very well say that they cannot give us any more than 1 per cent. We all know the battle that has to be fought by the agricultural community when prices are fixed every Spring.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for Agriculture for getting roughly double what was originally proposed.  In addition quite a number of restrictive practices were abolished in the case of milk and intervention beef.  In achieving that the Minister did a good job, but unfortunately quite a lot of it did not go to the farmer, particularly in regard to milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The returns which our farmers are getting this year for butter fat seem lower than those of last year or two years ago. We had this year as good a grass year as <Col N="1260" /> one could ask for, but using the milk produced by the same number of cows, the butter fat is lower.  The creameries must be tightening up on this question of butter fat.  I have seen cheques for the same amount per gallon of milk as two years ago, although there were two increases in the price, one last year and one this year.  One farmer who had done his sums very accurately, projected his figures for his bank, and by the month of June, on re-examination of his financial position, had his account showing a reduction on what he thought should be there.  When a check was made on all his milk cheques it was discovered that his butter fat had dropped for no reason whatsoever as compared with last year or the year before.  He had produced more milk, but his cheques were lower.  When an agreement is reached, the benefits should come down along the line and not be held up by bodies engaged in the buying of farm produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to keep a vigilant guard on the quantity of imports into the Community from the Third World countries, some of which are excessive and are having a detrimental effect.  It appears odd that milk imports are coming into the Community while there is in existence a butter mountain. These imports affect other industries as well as agriculture and are clearly visible in our shops.  Imports into the Community should only be allowed where there is a shortage of the produce in the Community itself, thereby creating a barrier against industrial and agricultural imports from Third World countries. Hong Kong, Taiwan and other areas are sending in an amount of material, and New Zealand are still importing into the Community despite their agreement with Britain being obsolete by now.</P>
    <P>Certain areas in north Meath and north-west Meath have been put forward by the Department of Agriculture for inclusion in the European Community's underdeveloped areas.  There will possibly be a decision on this within the next few months and the Minister should ensure that as much of the country as possible is included in this category of <Col N="1261" /> underdeveloped areas, thus bringing in extra grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a very comprehensive report on these particular aspects of the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>: I refer very briefly to the possible complications of enlargement within the European Community.  No doubt, the Minister is aware of this important development and its consequences for us.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Secondary Legislation issued a report on 21 February 1979.  In that report, they highlighted the concern of the Joint Committee, composed of members from all sides of the House, regarding enlargement of the Community. They referred specifically to likely imbalances and their significance for this country and to regional, internal imbalances in the African countries which are already considerable and which could be aggravated following the liberalisation of trade after accession.  In the Commission's view, corrective measures in the form of large-scale regional policy will be required.  The then Minister for Foreign Affairs, addressing the House on 15 February 1978, confirmed that with the imminent membership of Greece and the possibility of speedy negotiations with Spain and Portugal, it was imperative, in the view of the Joint Committee, that the time to implement the review of the financial structures of the Community was then well at hand.</P>
      <P>With the advent of the EMS and the economic difficulties of the western world in general, enough progress has not been made on rectifying the imbalances within the existing Nine.  We must be particularly concerned over the accession of Greece on 1 January 1981 which will create a greater drain on Community resources.  As Greece has a major agricultural section, this will further aggravate the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make every possible effort to get our partners within the EEC to recognise the need for changes, particularly in the economic and financial aspects of EEC policy.  The political considerations of expansion are quite realisable <Col N="1262" /> and easy to implement but the disparities which may arise as a result of the accession of Greece at this time may create problems of which we must be very well aware and must make our partners also well aware.  In EEC policy, we have a special situation which needs attention.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee went on to refer to the budgetary consequences of the Greek entry.  It referred in detail to the units of account which the Greek Government and the other two applicants would be entitled to.  That highlights the tremendous drain that could come on the already limited EEC funds.  The Minister in his address this morning recognised the need for changes and referred to the present limit as archaic and said that we are making every effort to emphasise to our partners the need for change in the funding of the Community.  It has been a particularly difficult time because of the British situation in getting their contribution rectified. Difficulties arose as a result of what the British felt was a major contribution on their part.  Because of the enlargement of the Community the financing of the social and regional funds will have to be brought into line.  This is of significance to us and time is running out.  Will the Minister pay attention to urging our European partners to rectify some of the anomalies in relation to raising the finance within the Community prior to the accession of Greece?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank the House for a constructive debate on the reports of developments within the European Communities. I will do everything I can, I hope with the co-operation of the Whips, to ensure that these debates are held as a matter of course after the publication of the six monthly report.  The report emerges every six months but there has been difficulty in regard to making arrangements between the Whips about having debates.  It is not good enough to have this type of delay between the publication of the report and the debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the question <Col N="1263" /> of the UK budgetary contribution and suggested that at that time we should have raised the question of increasing our own resources.  It was not on at that time as our main objective was to secure our settlement of the package involving price increases, the capital moneys for western development and the other aids to agriculture, as far as Irish agriculture was concerned.  That had been held up by reason of the British recalcitrance over their contribution.</P>
    <P>The major problem that has faced the EEC since our entry is now looming up in the shape of the ceiling of the one per cent VAT which is the major financial source of the own resources finances available to the Community.  This ceiling will be almost reached in the 1981 budget which is now being prepared.  It is only by very careful pruning that the Community will be able to stay within that one per cent even in the current year.  It is quite certain that the Community cannot finance itself for 1982 unless the ceiling of one per cent is breached, and unless there is some radical pruning of basic policies, which would be intolerable to a number of countries including ourselves. If the ceiling of one per cent is not breached for the 1982 budget the Community will cease to have any meaning where convergence is concerned and that is a major policy to secure the transfer of resources from the prosperous to the less prosperous areas.  The funds will not be there to provide for an adequate social or regional fund to effect such transfers.  In addition, the CAP cannot continue in any meaningful way unless there is a breach of the one per cent ceiling.  This is not a radical suggestion put forward in Ireland's interests.  The very important McDougall report commissioned by the Community on the role of public finance in European integration published in 1977, argued strongly that a budget representing two to two and a half per cent of Community GNP would be required to make any significant impact in reducing any inequalities in living standards between the member states.</P>
    <P>The suggested budget in their report in <Col N="1264" /> 1977 would be roughly three times the size of the Community budget in 1980. That is the sort of unreality we are living in &mdash; a limitation to about .9 per cent of Community GNP next year with an overall ceiling of one per cent &mdash; when what is required to have a minimum policy is a budget requiring two to two and a half per cent of GNP.  The argument is quite clear but we will have to fight to have our partners realise that this is a matter of fundamental national importance to us. It is a matter in which we can plead the highest national interest.  At present we are not getting anything like the transfer of resources that would merit any approach nearly resembling the degree of convergence that was envisaged by the various summit meetings where convergence was laid down as a major policy aspiration within the Community.  Ireland at present stands at around 50 per cent in the most prosperous regions in the Community.  That highlights the degree of transfer of resources involved and the degree of investment required to make some impact on lifting our level of prosperity up to somewhere near the general European level.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect is that the Germans particularly say that in purely accountancy terms they are the main contributors to the Community budget. Looked at in narrow accountancy terms it is true that they are substantial contributors, far more than anybody else in the Community.  They make that case in accountancy terms, and also that most of us are in one way or another recipients. This case does not take into account the central fact that the customs union involving the market as such has put Germany in a tremendously advantageous position as regards providing a market for her highly skilled production and providing a basis on which she can export abroad.  Germany is the biggest single gainer in the market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;by reason of the customs union within which she with her highly skilled technology, expertise production and marketing can sell.  On the <Col N="1265" /> basis of that Community performance, Germany is enabled to make third country arrangements all over the world with countries with whom the Community also does business under various agreements and so on.  I will give one figure which bears out the importance of the customs union as far as a country like Germany is concerned, and the same applies to a greater or lesser degree to other vast industrialised countries within the Community like The Netherlands and Belgium. Some indication of the relative importance of the customs union can be deduced from the fact that while the budget represents less than one per cent of Community GNP the intra Community trade of member states represents about 25 per cent of Community GNP. The main beneficiary from that 25 per cent from Community GNP which is quite enormous is Germany.  While Germany is also the main contributor to the budget it is still a budget that is less than 1 per cent of Community GNP.  The argument is very firm in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect of the CAP as far as Ireland is concerned is that firstly 20 per cent of our population work on the land. No other member state has a figure remotely like that.  A further point is that our agriculture production is largely based on inputs derived from our own country.  We do not have an agriculture industry that utilises imported feeding stuffs from third countries.  Our grass and grain, the main inputs into our cattle, sheep and pig industries are produced at home.  We do not contribute in any way to surplus situation that has bedevilled the CAP.  That surplus situation has arisen by reason of industrialised farming utilising imported imports such as soya beans and tapioca.  In some countries oils and fats are imported from third countries and force fed to animals to fatten them quickly in broiler fashion in shed conditions.  They are fed in an industrialised turnover manner in certain Community countries.  That type of farming was not envisaged for protection by those who initiated the CAP.  It is that type of farming that is contributing to the surpluses. It is an artificial type of farming and is largely prevalent in countries like <Col N="1266" /> Germany, Holland and Denmark.</P>
    <P>We will have to prepare strategy immediately in regard to our position on those vital issues of breaching the ceiling of the one per cent VAT in regard to the own resources financial provision and also in maintaining the CAP.  With that in view the Government set up an inter-departmental committee to look in depth into the whole question of the Community budget and its proposed restructuring. It investigated it in relation to Community policies as they affect Ireland, such as the CAP and the social and regional funds.  We hope to receive that report from the committee in the near future.  I have been given a preliminary copy of the report and it is hoped that the full definitive one will be presented shortly.  That will form the basis of the case which the Taoiseach will present at the European Summit.  At that meeting the Taoiseach will lay down the correct lines as far as we see them and he will indicate the appropriate marker as far as our fundamental national interests are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I hope to publish a summary of it in due course.  The preliminary report has just come to hand.  We must, at every level within the Community, embark on a strong and balanced campaign to promote and project our case in a responsible and constructive manner. We have a strong case and we must put it across firmly at every level.  We must put our case at home so that our people understand our approach and we must put it across within the various institutions of the Community.  The Commission are engaged in a similar exercise at present on how the budget should be restructured.  They may not necessarily coincide with our views but it is important that our views are made know to the members of the Commission at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the importance to Ireland of the CAP it is also important from the strategic point of view as far as Europe is concerned.  That is what was envisaged <Col N="1267" /> by the founders of the Community.  They saw what happened in the past when food shortages occurred over the centuries and they wanted to see a balance of agricultural production to ensure a continuation of food supplies.  It is only by ensuring a stable floor price in regard to food production that one can avoid cyclical excesses or recessions in regard to farm production.  While acknowledging the importance of avoiding surpluses and acknowledging that the CAP needs to be reformed so as to avoid surpluses, the fundamental principle of having a basic floor price mechanism for farm products is all important to ensure a guaranteed and continuing food supply for the 300 million citizens of the Community. Experts are now predicting that we will have to face a crisis in a few years' time that will not be related to oil or energy. They are predicting a food crisis.  Any region that has its agricultural policies so organised that it can ensure a steady flow and guarantee of basic food products, without surpluses, will always survive in any difficult situation in regard to food supplies.</P>
    <P>Very serious challenges are now posed on the inter-related areas of the budget resources, and the one per cent ceiling being reached, on the financial side and the need to preserve the CAP while avoiding excesses in regard to surpluses. They will provide the great challenging debate of 1980 in the Community and they are matters which must be resolved before 1981 because in that year the Community just cannot plan because it will not have the financial resources available to plan on a proper basis for 1982 and thereafter.  These issues I am talking about will be the fundamental issues for major debates within the Community in 1981.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is no harm to point out the other side of the coin which is that basically the Community has been beneficial to this country.  The dangers are looming up now but heretofore the benefits have been quite clear.  I refer here to the 16th report where one sees that in 1979 in terms of transfers of money under all headings to Ireland there was <Col N="1268" /> the highest transfer within the Community of £536 million.  The importance of the guarantee section within the common agricultural policy is shown within that figure when one finds that under the FEOGA guarantee scheme £401 million was the amount secured by Ireland.  So, of the total transfer of moneys under all headings of £536 million within the Community in 1979 £401 million related precisely to the guarantee section of FEOGA.  The remainder relates to the guidance section of FEOGA, grants for restructuring and so on, the social fund &mdash; £38.7 million &mdash; the regional fund, £44 million and various research and pilot schemes.  One sees then immediately in that stark figure of £400 million out of £536 million the enormous interest that we have in a continuation of the guarantee section of CAP.</P>
    <P>Also in 1979 we secured £243 million in loans, subsidised loan facilities under the European Investment Bank, the Ortoli Facility and through the European Coal and Steel Communities.  That is a substantial benefit to the country.  There is no question about the benefit heretofore as far as Ireland is concerned but these substantial benefits which we secured heretofore will be undermined and eroded unless we maintain the CAP and retain a funding system that will enable substantially more transfers of resources under the social, regional and other headings.</P>
    <P>That is the reality facing us in the coming year.  The Community itself, apart from Ireland, faces a very serious problem in this way also.  If this is not done and if the Community budget is not made a meaningful implement then we shall slip back into the old ways of national aid for agriculture and industry.  In that way the real slippage will start.  We shall no longer have a Community then but just an association of nations each doing its own thing for its own special sectors.  In that scenario we would fare very badly because the wealthier countries would obviously be able to afford far higher national aid to their smaller farming communities in terms of numbers than ours and from their greater prosperity would be able to hand out greater aid to their own <Col N="1269" /> farming communities or any other sectors they wished to help.  It would then become a situation of the more powerful nations going ahead on their own and the whole <i>raison d'être</i> of having a Community would have ceased.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that particularly because from the point of view of overall political strategy and co-operation the smaller nations within Europe are a very decided benefit to the larger nations.  It is in the interest of the larger nations from the political and strategic points of view to have a number of other nations with them.  However they may regard these smaller nations as recipient nations of largesse from them, the fact is that without these smaller nations some of the larger nations would be in a very naked position strategically and politically.</P>
    <P>All in all it will mean that the coming 12 months will be a test of the political will of the Community to ensure that there is a real convergence in regard to economies, to prosperity, whether there is a real feeling and meaning in saying that we are in a Community together and not just a collection of powers in which the richer powers grow richer and the poorer ones weaker.  The amount of money available at present within the Community budget is just not enough money to redress the imbalance that <Col N="1270" /> exists between the larger and more powerful countries and the smaller countries. If the wealthier areas of the Community want to continue along that path.  I say very advisedly that means the end of the Community.  If they want to proceed instead on the more constructive and responsible path of seeking to redress the imbalance by having a reasonable transfer of resources by pursuing their declared policy of convergence, they will raise the limit and permit a reasonable transfer of funds to take place by allowing financial resources to be freed and available to them under the one per cent system. They will also acknowledge the fact that as regards the rural areas of the Community which guarantee its essential food supplies there must be a basic guaranteed prices policy in regard to these areas.  On our part, we must freely acknowledge that there must be the necessary reforms of CAP to ensure that surpluses are eliminated.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for a very constructive debate.</P>

    <P>(d)  Details of the various special allowances, etc. payable to other ranks personnel in the Naval Service are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  <i>Naval pay</i> at the weekly rate of £4.27 is payable to all NCOs and Seamen.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Military service allowance</i> at the following weekly rates is payable to all NCOs and Seamen (except Seamen, Third Class i.e. recruits): Seamen with 3 or more years' service and all NCOs, £7.29; Seamen with less than 3 years' service, £2.62.</P>
    <P>(iii)  <i>Technician pay</i> at the following weekly rates is payable to members of the Technician Class: Group 1 (e.g. Engine Room Artificer, Electrical Artificer, Radio/Radar Mechanic), £7.96; Group 2 (e.g. Cook, Mechanic, Shipwright, Telegraphist), £4.23; Group 3 (e.g. Writer, Driver MT), £1.11.</P>
    <P>(iv)  <i>Patrol duty allowance</i> at the following rates is payable in respect of each day on which an NCO or Seaman is on patrol duty aboard ship away from the Naval Base, Haulbowline: Chief Petty Officer, £5.25; Senior Petty Officer and Petty Officer, £4.67; Leading Seaman, £4.09; Seaman, £3.50.</P>
    <P>(v)  <i>In-charge allowance</i> at the rate of £2.33 is payable to the Chief Engine Room Artificer on board a Coastal Minesweeper in respect of each day for which patrol duty allowance is payable.</P>
    <P>(vi)  <i>Security duty allowance</i> at the rate of £5 is payable for each day on which <Col N="1248" /> security duties (e.g. guard or stand-to duty in the Naval Base, Haulbowline) are undertaken.</P>
    <P>(e)  The Naval Service has for some time been undergoing a process of development aimed at enabling the Service to meet its vastly increased commitments. A major part of this process was the recent expansion of the numerical establishment which has been increased to 1,105 all ranks.  Many of the new appointments provided are in the technician class and the object is to attain full establishment strength as quickly as possible.  All measures regarded as necessary to build up the strength of the Naval Service, and especially the technician strength, to an acceptable level are being taken.</P>

      <P>: The Manpower Consultative Committee, which is representative of employers, trade unions and appropriate government agencies, recommended a number of measures to alleviate identified skill shortages in Irish industry, which I subsequently approved.</P>
      <P>These measures included certain short-term conversion courses designed to enable students to augment an existing qualification and so equip themselves for employment in occupations where critical shortages were being experienced.</P>
      <P>Maintenance allowances were provided for all eligible students taking part in approved conversion courses in the 1979-80 academic year.  These courses were of one year duration with the sole exception of a two year M.Sc course in electronic science at UCC.  Towards the end of that year the position regarding occupational shortages and the conversion course programme was reviewed.  It was found that the increased output from computer courses had relieved the supply situation in the computer industry.  It also emerged that skill shortages in engineering disciplines were still acute.  I decided therefore that the most effective use of the maintenance allowance scheme in the current academic year would be to apply its provisions to assisting students following engineering courses.  Conversion course maintenance allowances are not payable therefore to students in short-term conversion courses in computer disciplines. The colleges concerned were advised of the position in early August of this year.  It is possible, however, that some of these students are eligible for assistance under the Higher Education Grant Scheme administered by the local authorities under the aegis of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> The Manpower Consultative Committee continuously monitors changes in the manpower supply and demand situation. A further review will be undertaken towards the end of the current academic year and the necessary decisions taken.</P>

      <P>: Details of all these schemes have been extensively publicised and advertised in the press and on RTE.</P>
      <P>Farmers in the disadvantaged areas are eligible for either the EEC cattle headage scheme or the beef cow scheme depending on the location of their farms. They are also eligible for the EEC sheep headage scheme for hogget ewes and mountain lambs.  Farmers outside the disadvantaged areas are eligible for the national hogget ewe subsidy.</P>
      <P>In addition, farmers in all parts of the country are eligible for premiums under the two recently announced EEC schemes for suckler cows and ewes.</P>
      <P>Following are details of the various schemes:</P>
      <P>1.  <i>EEC Cattle Headage Payments Scheme</i></P>
      <P>This scheme applies only in areas designated as severely handicapped under EEC Directive 75/268.  Subject to clearance by the EEC Commission, payment for 1980 will be at the rate of £32 per live stock unit for the first 8 units and £28 for the next 22 units.  The maximum payable is £872 but this may be affected by the forage area of the farm.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>EEC Beef Cow Scheme</i></P>
      <P>This scheme applies only in areas designated under EEC Directive 75/268 as disadvantaged but not in areas designated as severely handicapped.  Subject to clearance by the EEC Commission payment for 1980 will be at the rate of £32 per cow for the first 10 cows and £28 for the next 18 cows.  The maximum payable is £824 but this may be affected by the forage area of the farm.</P>
      <P>3.  <i>EEC Scheme of Headage Payments on Hogget Ewes and Mountain Lambs</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme applies only in areas designated as disadvantaged under EEC Directive 75/268.  Subject to clearance by the EEC Commission, grants of £5, £4 and £4.50 respectively will be payable for 1980 on each mountain hogget, mountain lamb and lowland hogget.  There is no <Col N="1253" /> specified maximum number of grants, but the total amount payable may be affected by the forage area of the farm.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Scheme of Headage Payments on Hogget Ewes</i></P>
    <P>This scheme applies only in those areas not designated as disadvantaged.  The grant for 1980 is £3 per hogget.  There is no specified maximum number of grants but the total amount payable may be affected by the forage area of the farm.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Scheme of Premiums for maintaining Suckler Cows</i></P>
    <P>Under Council Regulation (EEC) 1357/80 an EEC premium of £13.18 will be paid for 1980 on each suckler cow of a specified meat producing breed.  The scheme is open to all owners of suckler herds and there is no limitation on the number of eligible cows.  Subject to clearance by the EEC Commission, an additional national premium of £12 will be paid on each cow over and above the number present in the herd at the 1979/80 round test for tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>6.  <i>Scheme of Premiums for Good Quality Ewes</i></P>
    <P>Under Council Regulation (EEC) 1837/80 compensatory premiums will be payable with effect from 20 October 1980 on good quality breeding ewes.  It has been estimated that a premium of about £3.50 per ewe will apply during the period 20 October 1980 to 5 April 1981 but this rate may have to be altered up or down depending on actual market prices.  Full particulars of the scheme will be given in press advertisements next week.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned claimed disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme on 23 January 1980 <Col N="1254" /> in respect of an accident which occurred on 24 April 1979.</P>
      <P>The claimant is an established civil servant employed by another Government Department.  As such he was not eligible for injury benefit but was eligible for payment of disablement benefit in respect of the period which commenced twenty-six weeks after the date of the accident.</P>
      <P>The claim to disablement benefit has been allowed and benefit awarded at the rate appropriate to the degree of disablement which has been assessed.  Payment of benefit in respect of the period from 26 October 1979 to 20 November 1980 was made on 28 October 1980 and payments will continue pending further review of the claimant's medical condition.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment arose because of difficulty in associating the claim for disablement benefit with an earlier claim for injury benefit.</P>
