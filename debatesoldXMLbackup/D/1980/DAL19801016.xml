    <Col N="117" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1976 which stands referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills be withdrawn from the Committee so that the Bill may be withdrawn in the Dáil; and</P>
      <P>That a Message be sent to the Seanad requesting its concurrence in the resolution to withdraw the Bill from the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1976 was introduced in Dáil Éireann on 16 November 1976.  It was given a Second Reading on 23 February 1977. Subsequently, a motion was agreed in both Houses to have the Bill referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills which is established under Standing Order 113.  The Bill, which had not been considered by this Standing Committee, lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil on 25 May 1977.</P>
      <P>On the setting up of the present Dáil the Bill was revived and restored to the Order Paper on 2 November 1977 and was again available for examination by the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.  Arrangements to have the Bill examined by the Committee were well advanced in 1978 when they were overtaken by the enactment of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978 which introduced pay-related social insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its introduction in November 1976 five further Social Welfare Acts have become law.  To incorporate the provisions of these Acts into this Bill would necessitate several hundred amendments which would have to be considered by the Standing Joint Committee. Rather than present the Committee with this difficult task the Government considered it a more practical approach to remove the present Bill from the Order Paper and to introduce an up-to-date Consolidation Bill.  The motion commences the procedures necessary to enable the Social Welfare (Consolidation) <Col N="118" /> Bill, 1976 to be withdrawn from the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.  The motion will have to be agreed by the Seanad before the Dáil can order the discharge of the 1976 Bill. These procedures must be completed before the revised Consolidation Bill can be referred to the Committee.</P>
    <P>I will, however, be seeking leave today to introduce in this House the revised Bill&mdash;the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1980&mdash;before the processes of discharge of the 1976 Bill are completed.  In addition, with the agreement of the Whips, I will be proposing that Second Stage of this new Bill be taken early to ensure that the Bill can be referred to the standing joint committee as soon as possible. It is very desirable that they should have adequate time to consider the Bill before there is any amending social welfare legislation which would complicate what will, in any event, be a very onerous task.  I know that Deputies are as anxious as I am to have the Bill enacted and I am sure that I can depend on their co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate that at the best of times a Consolidation Bill is not one that is given the same glare of publicity as certain measures may receive and from that point of view it is not always as attractive to the Minister charged with responsibility for seeing its enactment. However, I cannot help wondering at the expression of urgency which we hear this afternoon in view of the fact that the existing Bill is on the Order Paper for three years despite repeated requests on at least six occasions in this House.  The Minister who was responsible for seeing that Consolidation Bill through its non-publicised committee hearings refused adamantly to have anything to do with the advancement of that Bill.  The excuse that is advanced now, that the events of 1978 and the introduction of additional social welfare legislation meant that the Bill became rather obsolete, is not fair or accurate, in view of the fact that in every year there has to be at least one Social Welfare Bill to give effect to the budgetary provisions and in most years there are several Social Welfare Bills.  Before <Col N="119" /> this 1980 Bill becomes consolidated, almost certainly at least one more Social Welfare Bill will be published.  Therefore, it is absolutely unacceptable to suggest that the reason the committee never met or the Consolidation Bill was not advanced was that further legislation came on to the Statute Book.  I am afraid that the reason was that the Consolidation Bill did not merit as high a profile in the media as some of the other measures occupying the mind of the Minister responsible at the time.</P>
      <P>I am informed now that this new Bill which was published last week is required to be enacted by Christmas, after three years of no movement whatsoever in the case of its predecessor.  I am quite happy to co-operate in the consolidation of this legislation as I requested over the last three years.  I am not prepared to see it being done in a hurried way over four weeks and I am not prepared to see it being done now at the cost of a considerable burden of work on the members of the standing committee because of the tardiness and failure of the man who was responsible for its predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: I take it that we definitely agree that unless it is taken as a matter of urgency and pursued before Christmas we will get into difficulties again subsequently with further legislation.  I ask the Deputies to bear with me.  I will give every assistance to them in getting through this Bill and I will supply them with a very detailed brief which I trust will be very valuable in considering the Bill and I trust that they will co-operate in this.  If we do not approach it in this way I believe that we will never get Consolidation Bills through the House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> I move:</P>
    <P>That Deputy Pádraig Faulkner be elected and do now take the Chair of the Dáil as Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner has been a member of this House now for 23 years.  During that time he has served his country as a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, and as Minister for the Gaeltacht, Minister for Education, Minister for Transport and Power, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Defence.  He has served in each of these posts with distinction.  To each he brought a dedication, a capacity for hard work and a sense of duty and responsibility tempered with humanity which, I think, it is fair to say, are widely recognised in all parts of this House, Certainly those with whom he worked and those in his constituency for whom he worked will find no problem in acknowledging his fine qualities as a man, a representative, a colleague, and a Minister.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil don Uasal Ó Fachtna, go sollúnta agus go poiblí, mar gheall ar an pháirt suntasach a ghlac sé i n-obair an Rialtais i gcomhluadar ár gcomhaltaí. Thaispeáin sé díogras, ionracas, tuiscint agus gach tréith a bhaineann le manadh na Féinne sna postanna a ghlac sé.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis sa todhchaí in a phost nua mar a d'éirigh leis le blianta beaga anuas mar Aire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I think that it could be desirable in general principle were it the practice of this House that the appointment of the Ceann Comhairle had been the subject of prior consultation, but this has not been.  There is not a precedent for this and therefore I make no criticism of the Taoiseach for not having such.  I make that remark merely at the outset and I think that for the future such a precedent might be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I have to say that the choice that has been proposed to us by the Taoiseach for this office is one which <Col N="122" /> I and my party regard as extremely suitable. It is fair to say that in our view it would be difficult amongst the ranks of the party opposite to find someone better suited to this post, The calmness, coolness and judgments which Deputy Faulkner has applied in office, applied sometimes to the necessary Ministerial task of stonewalling but applied always with dignity and courtesy, have commanded the respect of this House over the years, I have no difficulty in concurring with the choice and thanking the Taoiseach for putting forward the name of somebody so well suited to the task to be undertaken. I am sure that we will have our differences, as all of us do from time to time, with the Ceann Comhairle, but I am sure also that the Ceann Comhairle proposed to us will be well able to handle us if we are too difficult on this or the other side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Labour Party are not opposing the appointment of Deputy Faulkner to the position of Ceann Comhairle.  We take this course in anticipation of impartial dealings with the Members of the House and because we feel that he has the necessary qualifications to carry out the at times very difficult task of Ceann Comhairle.  I think everyone in the House, on all sides, recognises that Deputy Faulkner is a man with some very fine qualities indeed which he has in various capacities placed at the disposal of this country.  For my own part I had very few dealings with Deputy Faulkner in any of his Ministerial posts and I came to know him best when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare and he was dealing on behalf of Fianna Fáil with that portfolio.  At that time I was greatly impressed not only by his ability but by his sense of compassion and fair-mindedness and I have no reason to believe that these qualities will not be carried on while he holds the position of Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It had been the normal practice in this House for the position of Ceann Comhairle to be held by a Member of the Opposition and that practice, which was fairly long established, was broken because there was some political advantage <Col N="123" /> at a particular time.  However, of more import is the question of Dáil reform.  It is very disturbing for any Member of this House to witness or, in particular, to be engaged in conflict with the Chair, and I feel that the Chair is considerably restricted by the way in which we carry on our business here.  It is antiquated and does not serve democracy. We urgently need reform of the Dáil. Young people particularly are finding it more and more difficult to relate proceedings here to the things which are affecting them in their everyday lives.  We have had to endure the refusal of permission to bring up relevant matters of grave concern to the people because they could not be discussed in this Parliament under existing rules.  I urge the Taoiseach to treat as a matter of extreme urgency the question of Dáil reform.  We have enough people outside this House who are trying to undermine our democratic institutions. Do not let us by our own foolishness or stubbornness unwittingly assist them in any way.  Let us make a serious attempt at radical reform of the Dáil in order to make it much more relevant to the needs of the country in 1980.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I assure the Ceann Comhairle of our help and support at all times and we look forward with confidence to his presiding over the affairs of this House with the fairness and impartiality which he has shown in other offices.  We wish him well.</P>

      <P>: The Government have endeavoured during the past two sessions to facilitate the Opposition in raising in the House current topical issues of importance. It will be agreed on all sides that the Government have given time for special debates on issues which the Opposition wished to raise, More recently I have taken initiatives through the Whips to see if we can improve that process and endeavour to ensure that matters of current topical interest and importance are dealt with here as early and as contemporaneously as possible.  For our part on this side of the House we are anxious to see what improvements can be made and we <Col N="124" /> will follow up this initiative with the Whips.  In particular discussions are under way to try to make more expeditious the procedure for Special Notice Questions.  Perhaps with the new Ceann Comhairle we can see what can be done to have current relevant issues dealt with more expeditiously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: When the debate on this Bill adjourned last night I was speaking for about 15 minutes on the suspicions which the Minister's speech generated in me, <Col N="126" /> and I am sure in other people, yesterday when he presented this Bill and the Bill in regard to the film studio.  I pointed in particular to the items mentioned in the early part of his speech.  I do not want to re-hash everything I said last night but in order to bring myself back into gear let me remind the House that the Minister particularly mentioned as objects of the Bill, which is to set up an Irish film industry, the following:</P>
      <P>Development of artistic and technological skills, promotion of tourism, promotion of cultural values and public relations and providing a potent means of presenting this country, its heritage and its people to the world and of keeping Irish people in touch with their distinctive environment.</P>
      <P>I said last night, and I want to say briefly again, that the Irish film industry has no function at all in the promotion of tourism. We have a statutory body for that purpose.  If it wants to make films to promote tourism it has ample statutory powers to do so.  That function ought not to be confused with the function which is the object of the Bill in front of us today.</P>
      <P>The very same goes for public relations. If the country is short on public relations we have a Government Information Service which shares in an Estimate and which has ample statutory powers or can be given by the Government without any extra legislation ample legal powers to make whatever cinematic material it considers necessary for spreading whatever message it thinks important to the outside world about this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a potent means of presenting this country, its heritage and its people to the world and of keeping Irish people in touch with their distinctive environment is again a function which may be praiseworthy, depending on what facet of the Irish people or of their priceless heritage it is intended to present to the world.  I have grave doubts of what would be in the mind not of the Minister but of his seven likely nominees to this board in this regard.  I say again that this has nothing whatever to do with an Irish <Col N="127" /> film industry.  I have the gravest suspicions of what will come out of this Bill if what is in the minds of the Minister's advisers is passed on in the form of nominations to this board and if what comes out is a board of seven people who will promote those objects, among which the development of artistic skills is in my view the only legitimate one among a lot of others.</P>
    <P>I warned the Minister last night, and I say it to him again, that the Irish film industry to be born will be strangled by its own umbilical cord if the Minister does not strike not only from his speech but from his mind and from the minds of his advisers everything to do with tourism, public relations and presenting the country in any shape or form to the neighbours and everything to do with keeping Irish people in touch with their distinctive environment.  I am afraid the environment here is not distinctive enough.  I often hear foreigners say that the place looks very like England.  I am sorry to say that with every passing day there is more and more evidence for that, at least in the towns.  I do not think there is any value in keeping people in touch with their environment.  If they are not able to see their environment they are not sensitive to it.  It will not make them any more sensitive about it if one puts millions of pounds into making films about it.</P>
    <P>I have no interest whatever in an Irish film industry if it will merely produce boring documentaries of a kind associated with a couple of countries I could mention, but which I know I would give offence to if I mentioned, that one can see thrust in as fillers in cinema programmes or television programmes.  They are got on the cheap because nobody will pay real money for them, boring travelogues and boring recitals of other people's cultural values.  I am sorry to say that they do not suppose for a second that an audience in Canada, Australia, Bulgaria or Mesopotamia will pay one shilling to see a film which consists of Irish scenery or Irish culture, however priceless or unique it may be, however much it may mean to us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> The suspicions which I have just mentioned are reinforced in the Minister's speech where he mentions that certain international features will continue to be made in Ireland either because of our natural advantages or because of a particular Irish theme.  What are the natural advantages?  They are not a natural inventiveness, any special budding Irish genius which only requires £4 million to bring it to fruition.  The natural advantages are an unspoilt countryside, splendid scenery and so forth.  We are a leprechaun country with this Bill and with this film industry unless the Minister takes to heart what I am saying and what I am certain other people will say to him as soon as the reality behind this Bill surfaces. I would not give a thraneen for an Irish film industry which was responsible for &ldquo;Darby O'Gill and the Little People&rdquo;. I do not want a Darby O'Gill Bill.  I want the little people kept far away from the Irish film industry and everything to do with the Irish predicament which I spoke about last night, this agonising predicament which marks us out like the cross on an ass's back as being somehow different from other people, as having a ready made apology for inflicting our own conflicts and anguish on the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I do not see the Irish people like that. I believe they have the very same passions of a supernatural kind which everybody else has and ought to have the same adulthood to be able to express them through any artistic medium in such a way that they do not have to be dragging in by the scruff of the neck the green flag and all the anguish that lies behind it.  I am very much afraid that the Minister is not clear in his mind about this.  I know he is busy and I know he has a basket full of serious problems.  I wish him nothing but the best in dealing with them, but I feel he has not given enough attention to this.  I am very apprehensive about the seven figures.  I can nearly see them already like stone men on the top of a moor.  I can nearly name those seven figures which will be on this board if those are the objectives the Minister really believes in.</P>
    <P>I said last night I was not too clear in <Col N="129" /> my mind about what promoting cultural values is.  Is it meant by that that the Irish film industry will become a cow which can be milked by Irish cultural organisations of any kind?  I am not simply speaking about Irish language organisations, for which I have a great deal more time than many of the people in this House who go through the motions of supporting them.  I am not speaking merely about them.  I consider that the Irish film industry should not spend a penny on a cinematic item merely to promote what it conceives of as a cultural value.  If it is to be any good to us, if it is to raise our self-esteem, if it is to give the country something which it did not have before, if it is to justify itself in terms of something unique being present in the world which was not there before, it will eschew that completely and it will try to find, develop, bring on and train Irish talent, not talent painted green like a letter box but talent which is native to the country, whatever shape it may take when it comes out on the celluloid.</P>
    <P>That is what the Swedes do, that is what the Italians do, that is what the Poles do.  The Swedish cinema is a household word.  We all have an impression of it.  It is an impression of a slightly bleak, dry carapace bursting with primeval passions underneath.  The mixture is not essentially Swedish.  I have no doubt that Irish feelings could be translated into the same idiom if anybody here had ever thought of doing that.  The Swedish cinema, in particular as represented by their most famous director, has got that character, if I have described it properly.  We are not invited in the Swedish cinema to get a load of their pine forests, their metallurgic industry or to get a load of the natural flora and fauna of the arctic north.  That is not what it is about.  The reason why Sweden is justly famous for its cinema industry is because, through conditions which I do not know enough about to lecture the House about, it made it possible for a couple of geniuses, particularly directors, to come to the top and to build up around them a small corps of actors and actresses.  They presumably have a national history too.</P>
    <P>Sweden was a very poor, sad country <Col N="130" /> 150 years ago.  It sent as many emigrants to the New World as we did but we are not always having our noses rubbed in their sad history.  They have a glorious history too.  They have a military, I might almost say an imperial, history which would well stand cinematic treatment but we are not obliged to look at that and the Swedish cinema does not sell itself as that.  If there is a Swedish film board it does not suppose that the rest of the world is impatient to hear about Gustavus Adolphus.  The Italian cinema has more famous directors than there are in Sweden.  It might be said that the Italian cinema is an expression which calls to mind a fairly uniform conception as well. It is not because they dose us with spaghetti or scenery.  They do not do that.  They present, via the cinematic medium, ordinary human stories but they lend to them not a self-conscious but a natural flavour of their own outlook on the world.</P>
    <P>That is what I would be anxious to see an Irish cinema doing.  If it does not do that we might as well not have it and in this regard I am glad to see that the Bill actually does contain a reference to the permissive function of the board in spending money on training.  I do not want to be niggling with the text of the Bill at this early stage but I hope I may understand the words &ldquo;techniques and processes&rdquo; in section 8 as including the art or capacity to direct a film and conceive a film as an artistic whole.  I have no doubt the Minister would be glad if these words had the broadest possible meaning but I am anxious to make sure that when this board is set up it will not regard techniques and processes in too narrow a light and restrict it merely to, say, acting techniques or to cinematic processes in the mechanical or stage setting sense.  I would be anxious to be assured by the Minister&mdash;and I hope he will not have any difficulty in assuring the House about this&mdash;that training here could include training directors, that it could include providing scholarships for young directors to work with established continental directors or foreign directors and learn some trade from them which will put them out beyond the necessity of <Col N="131" /> scooping up great chunks if Irish history and wrapping some kind of an old rag of a story around it and sending it out to the world and then coming back to this House looking for more money to cover the inevitable loss because people are not interested in that and the Irish will not pay money to look at it either.</P>
    <P>There is one more thing I want to say which is mildly critical.  I am not quite sure why this board is going to be called the Irish Film Board.  Why can we not just call it the Film Board?  It is a very small point.  After all, we have the Industrial Development Authority and we have not found it necessary to call it the Irish Industrial Development Authority.  We know what it is.  When I find the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; used in the names of the Irish institutions which have been created by ourselves I have to ask myself are we still thinking in terms of the real metropolis of this country being across the Irish sea.  I am sorry if I have misunderstood this title but I must say that, for the life of me, I cannot understand why this Bill is not simply called An Bille um an Bord Scannáin or the Film Board Bill. I cannot see the necessity for &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; or &ldquo;na hÉireann&rdquo;.  The same objection does not apply in the case of the Irish Film Studios Bill because I realise the company which the Bill is intended to help already has this title.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say bears on the EEC problem which the Minister very fairly and rightly brought out yesterday in connection with the representations which he has had and which, I may say, we on this side of the House have also had from interests which are closely associated with film making already.  They assert that the Irish dimension should not be lost and they do not mean by that the thing I have been criticising. What I understand them to be anxious about is that this money, insignificant though it is, will not be handed out indiscriminately to foreigners who merely want to come here, make a film about anything at all&mdash;&ldquo;The Blue Max&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lawrence of Arabia&rdquo; or something of that kind&mdash;for which an Irish set might <Col N="132" /> be possibly visualised or strung together merely on the grounds that it is going to give employment.  I completely support the point of view of those groups and I certainly hope that the Irish film industry is not going to fizzle out into a kind of hidden subsidy with nothing but employment in mind for foreign film makers.  I am sure the Minister does not intend that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that the EEC Commission had cleared a draft of the Bill but had asked to be informed about the board's detailed modes of procedure once it had been set up.  My own advice to the Minister is not to pay too much attention to what the Commission may tell him in this regard.  A film industry, once one gets beyond the humblest documentary and cartoons, is something which must bear a certain national characteristic, it must bear a national stamp. To the extent that it fails to carry a certain character which that nationality imparts to it not self-consciously, not in the way I have been condemning, but naturally and automatically, it is a less valid industry, certainly a less valid area of art.  That, at any rate, is how the film world has worked out up to this.  Surely the Commission cannot be so philistine as to suppose that an Irish film industry can be got on its feet with absolute non-discrimination in regard to who makes what film where, who gets the money, what the nationality of directors and actors is and so on.  It is not going to be of any benefit to the European Community either unless it bears a certain national stamp, and I say once again for the fourth or fifth time, not a self-conscious one but a natural and automatic one.</P>
    <P>Unless it is something that one can point to as being the Irish cinema with its not forceful but naturally grown characteristics, it is not going to be of any real value to the European Community either.  There is the Italian cinema, the French cinema, the German cinema not so much, the English cinema which, though I do not follow it up, appears to have fallen on hard times.  These are three national cinematic industries, to use an ugly phrase, which are within the EEC and the EEC is the richer for them <Col N="133" /> being there and if they were ironed out into a pan-European cinematic industry they would be less valuable to the EEC, leave alone the countries from which they respectively originate.  The Minister should put this point very strongly to the Commission and not allow the board to be pushed around by the Commission. This whole enterprise is going to be not worth a damn to us, worse than that, it will be embarrassing and shaming if it falls into the traps which I can see lurking on page two of the Minister's script.  It is not going to be worth anything to the EEC either and the Minister should make absolutely certain that the Commission understands that it would be natural for a certain measure of discrimination to exist here, natural for the Bill to be so interpreted as to favour the training and financing and the bringing on of Irish directors and, since directors control everything downstream from that, actors and technicians as well and the location, if it is possible of Irish talent, if not Irish genius, in that direction.  I would not be at all downfaced by the Commission.  I share the strong feelings of the bodies that have made representations to the Minister and he should make sure that the board do not allow themselves to be downfaced by the Commission either. The problem is a unique one.  It is a very special case and the general purposes of the EEC here must take second peace to the necessity for cinematic industry to have a strongly marked national character and it will not do that if the strict rules of non-discrimination are applied in this case.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say except to wish the Minister and the board he sets up every success.  We on this side of the House will follow their operations with interest and with sympathy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am very happy indeed to see this Film Bill come before the <Col N="134" /> House.  It is long overdue.  Indeed I had the impression that it would never get off the ground.</P>
      <P>The film industry is unique in its own right.  It is an industry and an art form and, as such, is of a special category. Because of that it warrants special treatment. That is why I am so pleased to note at least this small amount of money being given this film board to help the film industry here.</P>
      <P>The film industry fulfils two functions. First of all we have here the Ardmore Studios, or the national film industry, and then there are the independent film makers. Both are very different from one another.  Yet both need more or less money for the same reasons.  They need finance for the making of feature films, for investment and for experimental and short films.  The establishment of a training school would be helpful to both these branches of the film industry and a distribution office is of the essence.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware the Ardmore Studios were bought by the State in 1973. Unfortunately at that time the Government assumed they were buying a film industry which of course they were not. They were buying what might be described as a factory, a workshop, a place where films would be made.  Unfortunately again several years elapsed before there was even a management in that large factory.  One might well ask what other factory site or premises could have survived for four years without capital, production or an end product.  That was very short-sighted on the part of the Government and the Minister concerned. Immediately it had been taken over by the State investment should have been put into that national studio.  Had that been done then I am quite certain we would have now a thriving film industry at Ardmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have visited the Ardmore Studios on several occasions and was very impressed by the whole of the site there.  There are to be found vast stage sets, sound proofed, control rooms, prop rooms, facilities for making and repairing props. There are all types of facilities for the making of films there.  It is really unfortunate <Col N="135" /> that we have not made an awful lot more of those studios.  At present they can be described only as a place to be rented to foreign companies coming here to make films.  That is all very good and is of great help to the industry here.  But foreign companies coming to Ardmore Studios bring in their own crews with them.  They bring along their own producers, directors, camera men and technicians. That leaves only the lower grade of worker in the film industry who can be employed locally.  However, that is not to say that such foreign companies are not welcome at Ardmore because indeed they are.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the House some figures in relation to the amount of money brought into Ardmore for the John Boorman production of &ldquo;Knights&rdquo;. I believe that approximately £65,000 was paid for studio rental.  Then the hotel, living allowance and location catering amounted to approximately £477,000.  I think this spin-off from the film industry, so very important, was mentioned by the Minister in his introductory remarks yesterday. For example, when a film crew come here with their personnel naturally they stay in hotels locally.  They must pay for their food.  They are spending money here constantly, which is of great help to the country.  Again in regard to the production I have just mentioned, construction materials and properties amounted to approximately £724,000.  Crowd artist fees amounted to approximately £247,000.  Obviously these were all people employed locally, Irish crowd workers, members of Equity, who earned money on the sets of the film in the crowd scenes.  Therefore all of this is of great help to Ardmore and the country.  But that is not sufficient.  Ardmore Studios&mdash;or I suppose I should call it the National Film Studio&mdash;should be in the position of making their own feature films.  They cannot do so without capital, something they have not had to date. Also they should be in the position of being able to purchase a percentage of an incoming film, and if that film makes a profit they would then be in the market <Col N="136" /> for reaping some profit on their capital. To date they have been unable to do so because they had available to them an amount of money that only kept them ticking over in respect of salaries and the like.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this Film Bill would be of two-fold advantage to the National Film Studio.  Firstly I would hope they would be able to purchase a percentage of a film coming in here and, secondly, that they would be able to make their own feature films, employing Irish people, technicians, directors, producers and actors.</P>
    <P>I am extremely interested also in the independent film makers who have been struggling here for a long time.  They are very talented people.  I take issue with Deputy John Kelly when he presumes that these people will make Leprechaun-type films.  These people have been struggling for years without any money and have made excellent films.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but might I just say that I did not say that.  I quite agree with the Deputy in her praise of them.  All I am saying is that I am afraid that the remit which this board may get may tend to lean them towards the kind of film I am talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>: No matter what the board might do I do not think it would make the independent Irish film maker resort to making that type of film.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>: These people are of very high integrity and have great talent. Their aim is merely to be able to seek an amount of money which would help them make feature films.  The film industry really is not like any other.  To make a feature film an independent film maker must first write a script.  Then he must get his crew together.  He must organise the whole production, all of which probably takes one year.  During all of that year the project is costing money, money is going out and yet he has not got the capital to put into that film for production. <Col N="137" /> If such a film maker had an initial amount of money&mdash;to be able to seed money, which is what I think they call it in the film industry&mdash;to help him get a particular film off the ground, to use their talents to the best advantage and employ Irish people who would understand exactly what they were about it would be of tremendous help to them.  This is what they need and are hoping to get.  It is my earnest hope that the film board, when established by the Minister, will give an undertaking to help the independent film maker.</P>
      <P>There are a number of ways in which money can be brought into the film industry. Various methods are used to do this in other countries.  For example, in some countries they use cinema box office receipts.  The film makers get back a percentage of the profit on their films, which is ploughed back into the industry.</P>
      <P>There has been some criticism of a levy or tax of, say, 10p on every cinema seat which would bring approximately £1 million a year into the film industry.  No-one would object to 10p extra on the price of a cinema seat and this would be an ideal way of gathering revenue to plough back into the industry.  The independent film makers do not want to be a burden on the Exchequer indefinitely but they need an initial sum to get them off the ground. They want the money to be re-cycled and they would hope that when they make a profit this would go back into the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One important matter which the Minister did not appear to think that the film board could be involved in at present is the distribution of films.  When a producer, director, or independent film maker, or the national film studio complete a feature film a third of what has been spent on production is needed to sell the film.  It is no use making films unless they make a profit, so the distribution of films is extremely important.  A small company which has engaged in perhaps a year's pre-production work cannot be expected to have the money, the time or the expertise to sell that film.  A distribution office could employ someone <Col N="138" /> with expertise in this matter.  It is a sales job and the distribution office could try to distribute a film all over the Continent or in America where, hopefully, it would pay for itself and make a profit.  I hope that the Minister will reconsider the setting up of a distribution office under the guidance of the film board, or perhaps Córas Tráchtála or some other State-sponsored body could be involved in distributing Irish made films.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned previously, different countries have different ways of bringing money into the film industry.  In France the receipts from an admission tax are used to support the film industry.  This fund and money from other sources amount to substantially more than £20 million per annum.  The bulk of this sum is devoted to refunding producers of French films in proportion to the success of their films.  This is a particularly good idea.  After all, if a producer is not making good films there is no use in giving him money.  The refund should be in proportion to his talent in producing the feature, commercial or other film.  In Germany, the Film Promotion Institute is responsible for distributing all aid to German films.  This institution obtains its funds from a seat tax and from the sale of television screening.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom, about £5 million annually is raised from a levy on cinema exhibitors.  The Danish film institute makes loans or arranges guarantees which are repayable from box office receipts.  The Swedish film institute supports independent producers by money raised from a 10 per cent levy on box office receipts.  The major portion of this fund goes to film clubs, archives, libraries and schools.  Italy has a system by which money is available from government sources to directors and script writers and finance is provided by the Minister for Tourism and Entertainment for the production of Italian films and their distribution and export.</P>
    <P>The most frequently used of these different systems is the tax on cinema seats or on box office receipts.  This does not hurt the Exchequer.  If people wish to avail of a cinema seat, they pay the little <Col N="139" /> extra to see the film and the money is used for the making of further films.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Kelly that we must try to get around EEC requirements of having to give some money from our small funds to companies from abroad who might take what otherwise would be available for our own film makers.  I have been told that there are at present in Ireland about 20 foreign companies who are not now operating but are waiting to avail of finance and will try to obtain some.  This would be most unfair to our Irish film makers who have waited long and patiently for support. It would be a great pity, if at this stage, foreign firms were to take even a small percentage of the available money.</P>
    <P>There could be some type of tax concession to business people who might want to invest in the film industry.  If there were such concessions many firms would be inclined to put capital into the making of films by our better known directors and producers who are already in the business of making good films. Naturally, businessmen are not going to give away money for nothing and some type of tax concession would have to be made.  I ask the Minister to consider this aspect at a later stage and it might be mentioned in some future budget.</P>
    <P>We are a nation which has sent people all over the world down through the centuries. Our people are famous for literature, for plays and acting.  The Abbey Theatre Company have toured America and the Continent.  We are famous in all the arts but, as of yet, we have not come to the fore in the sphere of the cinema. I see no reason why we should not.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a very cultured country and we are a very sensitive people.  I believe that our people will put something of themselves into whatever films they make and it will come through to the nations of the world that they are particularly Irish films.  The Swedish director, Bergman, makes Swedish films in Sweden for Swedish people but they are internationally renowned.  Italian directors make films in Italian for Italian people and they are internationally renowned.  Why cannot <Col N="140" /> Irish people make films in Ireland for Irish people, and make them in such a way that they will be accepted and seen for what they are in America, on the Continent and all over the world?</P>
    <P>I hope the people in Ardmore will be lucky enough some time to make a film like &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo;.  That started out as a rather mediocre type of film, but it captured the imagination of young people all over the world and it has made, as far as I am aware, something in the region of £200 million.  Can you imagine what it would do for this country if the National Film Studios or, indeed, one of our independent film makers were fortunate enough to make a film that made that kind of money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; would not qualify under any one of the criteria under which the film board will operate according to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>: Who knows?  It might.  I am not saying &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; in particular. It could be any type of film.  I just mentioned &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; because it comes to my mind.  It made a phenomenal amount of money, out of all proportion to what it cost.  The money is still coming in, and it is being shown and shown again.  There is no reason why the film industry in Ireland should not be fortunate enough in the years to come to hit upon some type of film which would capture the imagination of the whole world and make a large amount of money for the industry here.  People in Ireland have the talent and the capacity to think up something which would capture the imagination of the film industry and the general public and make vast amounts of money.  Then, hopefully, they would not be looking for £4 million because it would be a drop in the ocean to them if somebody made a really profitable film.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other points I want to make.  First, I hope there will be a school to train our young people in the industry. It is rather sad to see young people in Ireland trying to break into the film industry.  It is very difficult to do so because the money is not available in the small production companies.  They are <Col N="141" /> limited in the number of people they can take and the amount of money they can spend.  We should set up some type of school to train our people in the various art forms of this industry.  We should be training our producers and directors, giving them some basic training so that when they join a production company they will have some knowledge of the trade.</P>
    <P>There should be lectures in film making, cinema management, copyright problems, film distribution, script writing, visual arts, and so on.  All this would help the industry, and it would help young people to have confidence in themselves. They would feel they were capable of taking part in it and making a contribution to it.  The provision of film archives is long overdue.  We have lost many very good films because we have no archives.  They are disappearing rapidly because there is no way of collecting them or preserving them, and there is nowhere to store them.  There is absolutely nowhere to preserve these films. Many have already been lost and I hope when the film board are set up one of the first things they will do will be to establish an office to save some of these films and preserve the snippets of news and information on film and to keep them for the future.</P>
    <P>I have a tremendous interest in the film industry.  I hope that they will sort out any little differences there might be between the National Film Studios in Bray and the independent film makers. The film makers are of the opinion that the work they are doing is extremely important, and so it is.  We have the national film studios at Ardmore and that is important.  That is the workshop, that is the factory, and I hope all the film producers will use Ardmore to the fullest extent, that they will use the facilities, the studios and the equipment available there.  I hope this Irish Film Board Bill will bring all aspects of the film industry together, that it will be an incentive to everybody involved to do their very best to ensure that this industry will help the people involved in it, the artists and the creative people, and also the country.  It will be a boost to us in Europe and in the <Col N="142" /> States.  It will be a boost to the other aspects of it which will bring in money to the country, as I have mentioned, through the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>In Dingle in Kerry the film &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo; was made.  It took two years to make and it brought more money to that little town in those two years than they had for the previous century.  It enabled them to start little industries in the town.  It brought in a great deal of money and the town has been prosperous ever since.  If one film could do what that film did for Dingle I hope, that in the future other feature films will do the same for other towns in Ireland and include an artistic element.  I hope our people will be conscious of the great art form film making is, which we have not appreciated up to now.  We appreciate literature, painting and the theatre, but we do not appreciate the art form of film making.  I hope this Bill will do something in that regard and this small amount of money will give the incentive to the industry to make something of itself in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will be very brief. I do not expect to speak for more than a few minutes.  I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on this Bill, which is a very important and long overdue development. It has been under discussion for as long as I have been involved with television.  The Minister's speech is reasonable and welcome.  It will be read with great interest and I am sure it will be welcomed by all those involved in our national film studios in Ardmore and Bray and by the independent film producers. It is a very important document and I hope it will be widely circulated in the film industry, because the people concerned have an interest in film making and in the entertainment world.  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on making such a comprehensive speech to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting that in his speech the Minister noted that only some of those involved or interested in the film industry had made submissions.  He stated that perhaps he should interpret this as indicating general satisfaction with the proposals. <Col N="143" /> To some extent I must admit that the lack of response has surprised me in view of the 24 hour non-stop film show presented by the Association of Independent Producers of Ireland and which was held at Liberty Hall.  During those 24 hours there were times when dozens of people were waiting for seats in the crowded auditorium to watch the films made by independent producers during the past 40 years.  I spent many hours there and I was enthralled and fascinated by the skill and ability of Irish producers, directors, writers and actors in those early days.  It was an extraordinary show and it was one of the best presentations of the history of Irish films I have ever seen.  I hope that in due course the Irish Film Board will give careful consideration to this aspect of films.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the lack of archives.  As technology has improved it is now much more simple and less expensive to stock films in a library so that they do not become musty, worn or lost.  This can be done now by a relatively simple process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Did RTE not scrap much of their old film material that featured Jimmy O'Dea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: That was on videotape, not on celluloid.  It is a different process.  I think it was done in error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sure it was not done maliciously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy should ask RTE about the matter; I cannot answer for them.  I know it was a quite different type of operation.  The Minister dealt in detail with the background to the Bill.  He gave us a comprehensive presentation of facts relating to the Irish film industry.  There are a number of questions I should like to put to him.  I know how the Department of Industry and Commerce got involved with Ardmore and this is the reason they are dealing with this matter now.  My question to the Minister is whether it would not be wiser <Col N="144" /> to have these two Bills dealt with by Deputy Reynolds, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who deals with RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Deputy not leave bad enough alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: I hope the Deputy is not suggesting that RTE are not doing a good job?  Perhaps the Minister present will comment on what the Deputy has said in due course.  Throughout the world major film studios have switched to location shooting.  They have adapted and modified their studios to cater for television soap operas, documentaries, dramas and so on.  I am concerned that the emphasis on 35mm feature film making on the scale and with the capacity we have is the wrong direction to go.  We should develop the studios in Bray on the lines of the American studios, who have switched to making television films and documentaries, retaining only a small portion of the studios for interior film making.  I wish to emphasise that this is not a criticism of John Boorman: quite rightly the Minister gave great credit to him and to Seamus Smith for their contribution to the development of the Irish film studios.  It is merely a suggestion that, instead of concentrating on 35mm film, we should be looking at the other more modern and more commercial outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to make Ardmore Studios a viable concern that will show a profit and that will give training to the young people, as Deputy Lemass pointed out; but I am concerned that the opportunities are not there.  We are living in a two-channel, one-station television area which deals very well in 16mm videotape documentaries and films.  We have some of the most talented film makers, documentary makers and artists in RTE who have not an opportunity of extending their talents and outlets.  In many ways I am reluctant to refer to RTE because I was employed there for many years.  The work they have done in encouraging film makers and their own staff, giving them the flexibility to get involved in film making and direction, has been wonderful.  They have done a very good job in this area.  Many <Col N="145" /> of the actors, writers, directors and producers are among the best not only in Europe but in the world, but they need the opportunity to develop their talents outside the television medium.  The National Film Studios should have a look at that area.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the studios provide work for those engaged in the theatre but it is on a piecemeal basis.  I do not want to question what the Minister said about keeping people employed on a full-time basis in Ardmore, but I wonder what 60 people are doing in Ardmore working on 35mm imported facilities.  There is an opportunity for the people concerned to extend their work in other directions. They have not used the opportunity but I hope they will do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill dealing with the Irish Film Board is a great advance.  It is welcomed by those directly and indirectly associated with film making.  It is important for the cultural and social development of our nation.  It has been on the cards for a long time.  I am privileged to be in a position to stand here and speak to it.  We must be one of the few countries which has not got a board of this kind.  I recognise that the amount being provided may not seem generous but it is, given the economic circumstances and the flexibility the board will have.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about it and have made a number of representations to the Minister.  I am glad to say he listened to my views and took them into consideration when framing the Bill.  The Minister met the three bodies involved&mdash;the Association of Independent Film Producers of Ireland, who represent most of those people who originate, produce and direct films in Ireland, the Irish Film and Television Guild and the film industry section of my own trade union, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union&mdash;who made representations to him.  The primary function of these bodies is to foster the development of a truly Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>Collectively they have congratulated the Minister on the introduction of this Bill and proposed some relatively minor but important amendments which they <Col N="146" /> state are not intended as a criticism but a genuine effort to make the provisions of the Bill better suited to its objectives. In their submissions they made it clear that the objectives of the Irish Film Board should be to assist and encourage the development of the Irish film industry which can ensure continuity of employment for all those involved in the making of films in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention here specifically the amount of work done by people like Tony Delaney, Tiernan McBride and their various associations.  They are truly the leaders in their field.  They have presented proposals to the Minister who gave them a sympathetic hearing.  I know from listening to the Minister's speech, that, at this stage, their amendments are unlikely to be implemented.  Perhaps the Minister has other views on that but, in my view, those who criticise the structure and the contents of the Bill ought to examine in detail the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>He said the indigenous film industry would produce films which would become part of our heritage and of our culture.  I fully support that view which meets the requirements of one specific amendment mentioned in the submission of the independent film producers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to sponsorship by private enterprise and private companies. The Government, and in particular the Minister, have given a lead in this.  It may appear that not a great deal of money is being made available, but it is a lead.  It is what was needed and it is now up to the Irish Film Board, when established, to look to sponsorship.  They should look at the idea proposed by Deputy Lemass because 10p on a cinema ticket is not an exorbitant tax to pay for an indigenous all-Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>Once again I congratulate the Minister on his pragmatic approach to these two bills and hope he will take some of my views into account when he is developing a truly prosperous Irish film industry.  I believe we have the talent and the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: These two Bills show the earnestness and desire of the Minister <Col N="147" /> and the Government to provide the basis of support and encouragement for the establishment of an Irish film industry and for its growth.  The Minister is to be congratulated for introducing these Bills. I support the goals mentioned by him and note that all involved in the various aspects of film making and distribution welcome this legislation.</P>
      <P>Resulting from the shooting of various feature films and short feature educational and documentary type films, we already have considerable expertise at all levels.  It is a great advantage to have producers, directors, scriptwriters, technicians, artists, editors and craftsmen, equivalent to the resources of a basic house building team, on which to establish a film industry.  It is vital that new employment opportunities are made available and that further encouragement is offered for the development of artistic and technological talents and skills.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Board can assist and encourage the development of a film industry and are empowered to provide a system of grants, loans and loan guarantees for the making of films in this State.  This country is endowed with superb vistas and contrasts to meet the location requirements of film makers. Over the years our tourist development offered the necessary support systems. As I said, we have the skilled personnel necessary to man and service film making but a vital cog was missing&mdash;an appropriate financial aid scheme.  Most countries operate such schemes.  This Bill confers on the board the authority to launch financial inducements.  Their main preoccupation should be to boost film making in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inducements must be determined judiciously.  There is no great advantage so far as employment is concerned by simply having a situation in which film crews that consist of from 90 to 95 per cent overseas personnel make films here. Such a situation involves a certain amount of spin-off to hoteliers and so on but that is not enough.  I am aware that the Minister is very conscious of the importance of the development and utilisation <Col N="148" /> of available talents locally.  He has stressed that the board will not be in the business of gratuitous hand-outs but will be examining each venture judiciously.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that in terms of the spending of the £4 million, such ventures as the production of international feature films and television films which offer good potential and training for Irish actors and technicians as well as the projects of our own film makers will be uppermost so far as the board are concerned.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the amount of money in the fund.  Naturally, all concerned would like the fund to be greater but the amount available could be so organised as to attract a few major foreign productions to the national film studio.  This would result in a big spin-off in jobs since the film industry is labour intensive.  On the other hand, it would enable moneys to become available to finance even more low budget, indigenously made films.  There should be a domestic film industry so that other people could be given a realistic view of our society.  An image of Ireland, hallmarked by the creativity of Irish expertise, could emanate only by way of such an industry but such an achievement cannot be reached instantly.  However, the utilisation of the film fund by native film making talent should lead to that goal being realised.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me to fail to comment on the success of Irish film makers who, down through the years, have produced many excellent and varied films.  Many of these people operated by way of sponsorship and encouragement both from private enterprise and from State bodies.  These film makers have shown much initiative and creative talent. Their sponsors, too, are to be complimented and should be encouraged to continue with such help.  It would be regrettable if these various companies should decide on a cut-off point because of the establishment of a film board.</P>
    <P>The business of distributing films is a difficult one.  Clearly, this task is a key factor in any productive enterprise. Obviously, the ideal situation would be <Col N="149" /> the existence of a marketing arrangement prior to the making of a film.  I do not think that anybody would underestimate the difficulties involved in the successful launching of a film.  As is the case in any market place, there is no soft going in this respect.  It is vital that full use be made of existing contacts and experience within the distributive network.  Some expertise has been acquired in this field by the national film studio and also by RTE.  Section 16 of the Film Board Bill provides for the establishment of committees who would perform functions which, in the opinion of the board, could be carried on effectively by such committees but in the final analysis those who must secure and develop the necessary distributive channels are the film maker and his associates.</P>
    <P>Representing the area in which the national film studio is located, I am very much aware of the importance economically of such a venture in terms of the area as a whole.  The studio has been a tremendous asset.  It has been the training ground for many people working in the film business and in allied industries.  A busy studio generates wealth not only for the participants in the various productions but also for various sections of the local community.  It is as difficult to assess the results of the making of a film as it is to assess the success or otherwise of tourism. There is a great similarity in both cases.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism in so far as the national film studios are concerned but the importance of this industry should not be belittled in any way.  Usage of the studio varies considerably but, then, the history of film making has been varied.  In the early years of the 19th century there was much research, invention and experimentation in this area into the various aspects of vision and motion.  In 1894 Edison introduced the Kinetoscope&mdash;the coin-in-the-slot peep show.  The Minister referred to the films of Sidney Alcott and to the Film Company of Ireland.  It is only right that their work be remembered.  Sometime later there were developments in Paris and in Venice and there followed <Col N="150" /> the introduction of the mobile camera. At about this time, too, the Brighton school in the UK was active.  The accent then was on actuality: if it moved, it was suitable for filming.</P>
    <P>When I visited Rosc lately the thought crossed my mind that this was &ldquo;happening art&rdquo;, when we saw horses arrive so that comparisons could be drawn between the motor car and horse power. In 1903 the narrative film arrived with the eight minute venture of Edwin Porter, namely, &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo;. This heralded the art and industry of motion filming.  Subtitles were introduced soon afterwards to explain further the illusion of reality from the black and white shadows that appeared.  Edison wanted to see the linking of his camera with the phonograph and he produced several talking pictures.  The interest of the public was not great, the industry waned for a while, and then we saw the development of synchronisation between sound and film.  Other people developing in different areas shifted the emphasis towards recording sound directly on films.  De Forest's phonofilms led on to other sound and film systems like movietone, but the Bell Telephone Laboratories still pursued their efforts to combine the phonograph and the motion picture.  In the 1920's, when Warner Brothers were almost bankrupt, they grasped the idea of synchronising and putting the De Forest idea into practice. Public apathy was overcome by the appearance of Al Jolson in the famous &ldquo;Jazz Singer&rdquo; and the era of the silent film had disappeared.  We were into a new technology and for the next number of years we simply sought to improve the technology although the techniques remained the same.</P>
    <P>In 1952 Cinerama arrived.  It necessitated sound localisation and Mr. Reaves, a sound engineer, developed his seven track sound system.  Colour was being developed during that period and Technicolor arrived in 1952.  This gave a major boost to the industry.  A challenge that the industry had to face was the arrival of television.  Television did one thing for film making in that it presented films <Col N="151" /> importantly.  It broke the continuous performance syndrome that existed.  Many studios got into difficulties because producers reacted to the economic impact of television by cutting back on the number of films they made and going for the high budget elaborate spectaculars which became very big attractions, films such as &ldquo;The Robe&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Ten Commandments&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: The Deputy is getting a little bit away from the Bills before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is possible to link up effectively television and film making. Many films are made for television and these are of a low budget type.  It guarantees the distributive factor also.</P>
      <P>A film studio is open to criticism by virtue of its nature.  When it is busy it has a vital role to play in job spin-offs.  As the Minister said, when it is ticking over it normally gives employment to about 50 or 60 people.  I hope that the establishment of the Irish Film Board and the implementation of the National Film Studios of Ireland Limited Bill will give a boost to the industry.  I welcome the Bills. I am pleased with the content of the Bills and with the fact that the Minister entered quite a round of talks with interested parties.  I met quite a few of these people and I am indebted to them for the information and advice they gave me for consideration of the Bill.  I wish the Irish Film Board well and compliment the Minister on introducing it at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank Deputies who have spoken, most of whom supported these two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole suggested that the number of members of the film board should be increased from seven to nine and suggested that this would allow representation to be given to every interest involved.  With all due respect to the Deputy, my experience is that boards that go out of their way to represent every individual interest within an industry are boards that are usually heading for disaster <Col N="152" /> because the board spends most of its time haggling as between the various interests concerned rather than taking the kind of overall positive view that ideally a board involved in commercial activities should.  It is my experience that seven is about the maximum optimum number of people who should sit on a board particularly where they are involved in the making of commercial decisions and judgments on behalf of the State or the taxpayer, as is the case here. I do not imply that the board will be unrepresentative.  Obviously it must include, and will include, people who are knowledgeable about the various aspects of this rather diverse industry.  It would not be in the public interest to have a board in which every possible interest was represented and enabled to engage in perhaps internal conflicts with other conflicting interests.  This is an industry in which there appears to be conflicting interests.  They show in the reactions to the Bill and in some of the suggestions that have been made to me.  I feel that seven will be enought.  It should be remembered that the board will essentially be a financing body and it is important to have people capable of analysing and assessing potential film projects in a professional and objective manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole, with other Deputies, mentioned the fact that perhaps the fund of £4.1 million was relatively modest.  I do not deny that.  I covered that aspect fairly well in my opening speech.  I repeat that the state of the Exchequer currently is not such that one could disburse large sums to activities that many people feel would not be of top priority where State spending is concerned.</P>
    <P>The other point that is perhaps not fully appreciated by the Deputies who spoke is that this will be an evolving fund. One would hope that not long after its fourth injection, assuming an approximate injection of £1 million per year, it would be a self-sustaining, evolving fund and that the profits of some of its investments and activities would be sufficient to equal or outweigh the losses it will obviously incur in some of its other activities. One would hope that the fund could <Col N="153" /> be maintained at at least this level and, hopefully, at a higher level.</P>
    <P>In the course of my speech I mentioned that a similar type of fund started in Britain as far back as 1948 with a modest amount of money has remained in existence since then.  I hope that the board, once they are established, will look at other means of raising finance for film making as well as the use of this evolving fund.  One envisages, perhaps, sponsorship of shorter films by industry and other commercial interests, as happens at present. One would like to encourage actual equity risk investment in film making by private institutions.  It is worth remembering that in the past year substantial risks were taken by a group of Irish businessmen in the making of the television feature film &ldquo;The Cry of the Innocent&rdquo; which, happily, has been a commercial success.  It has been shown twice this year on a nationwide network in the United States.  The risks they took were considerable and they might have lost a great deal of money.  One would like to acknowledge their entrepreneurship in making that film and to express the hope that they, and perhaps others like them, will in the interests of the Irish film industry be prepared to take those risks again in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of distribution.  I dealt with that matter fairly fully in my opening speech and I do not wish to go into it in detail again.  There is a great danger that if the board were to set themselves up as a distributing board also and take over responsibility for distribution they would have landed on their doorstep many films which may not be easy to distribute in the difficult world of film distribution.  In such a case if a film was not distributed successfully the board would be blamed. Film distribution is not like selling an ordinary commodity; it is a very specialised and narrow area which is controlled worldwide by a small number of companies.  It is not the kind of area in which an Irish semi-State body would necessarily be successful for quite a while.  Some good advice was given by Deputy Murphy and others to film makers <Col N="154" /> about the necessity for distribution and trying to ensure that, as far as possible, such arrangements are made in advance.  A fine film could lie unseen and unscreened for years, perhaps for ever, if distribution arrangements are not made.  I believe that over the years the NFSI and RTE developed some limited expertise in this area.  I have no doubt that that will be at the disposal of the board in their efforts to help film makers who need such assistance.  Even though it is a difficult and important area, it would be wrong to think that the board could take over sole responsibility in such a tricky commercial field.  While undoubtedly the board will have to devote time, effort and, perhaps, money to it.  I doubt if they will want to see themselves as a major distributor and have that responsibility thrust upon them.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed the anxiety, as I did, that independant Irish film makers would be assisted by the board.  I have no doubt that they will.  In so far as I have had any problem it is that I found myself unable to agree with the suggestion put to me rather forcefully that the board should be given a direction by statute that at least 80 per cent of the funds available to it should be expended on assisting the work of independent Irish film makers.  I could not accept that.  I do not think the board, or any other concern about to operate in the commercial field, should be tied down by statute in a very specific way.  I have tried in the Bill&mdash;as is demonstrated in sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8&mdash;to give the board as broad and as flexible a set of objective powers as possible and not to tie them down with detailed statutory instructions as to how they should carry out their function.</P>
    <P>Many of the things urged on me here, and in submissions from outside the House, could more properly, and profitably, be urged on the board when they are established.  To a great extent they are matters of day-to-day commercial judgment which I will have to entrust to the board.  It would be foolish of me or any Minister to seek to make an advance for them without knowing the circumstances <Col N="155" /> on any occasion particularly in a matter that is as volatile and personal as a film.  It is usually a work of art in one form or another.  It would be extremely foolhardy in my view to lay down prior conditions as to what way specific films should be made.  The board must be in a position to assess each script individually and decide what is wisest in all the circumstances. What I have said in regard to flexibility and not being specific in regard to the powers, judgements and decisions of the board applies not just to the question of whom they should support; it applies to many other aspects of their activities.  I am anxious in this respect to give them the maximum freedom possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole made the point that key positions were not held by Irish personnel on the sets of feature films produced at the studio.  I do not think that statement is true.  Certainly it is not true to the extent it was made.  It should be remembered that finance for these films, by and large, comes from abroad and there is no obligation on the companies concerned to fill key positions with Irish personnel.  However, in two recent films which were made partly at the studios in Bray, &ldquo;Hard Way&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Cry of the Innocent&rdquo;, a big number of the key positions were filled by Irish personnel.  In the case of the film I mentioned last night, John Boorman's &ldquo;Knights&rdquo;, which was completed recently and was by far the biggest budget film ever made here, Irish personnel were used in all departments during its production.  A great deal of credit for that happy situation is due to Mr. Boorman and to the very positive and helpful attitude he takes towards this country and our film industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn was critical of the delay in progressing with legislation.  It is almost 11 months since the Bills were published, but there were many years in which nothing was done in legislative terms at all.  A previous Bill was introduced by Deputy Lalor when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1970 but that went out of date with our accession <Col N="156" /> to the Community and in any case it lapsed on the dissolution of the Nineteenth Dail in 1973.  Between 1973 and 1977 no steps whatever were taken in legislative terms.  When I assumed office in 1977 I decided we had better get on with the job and that I should try to adapt the 1970 Bill, the latest effort at legislation, but I found it was really unsuitable and had gone out of date.  I asked Messrs. Little to advise me on what might be done.  Having considered their advice I made some fairly fundamental changes including the making of the film board a totally independent body.  Although there were great pressures at the time that it should be a subsidary of the existing company which was in the business, I thought it best to have them quite independent. If I had not done that, today one would be subject to the suggestion that the interests of the studio would be paramount and the interests of the independent producers not properly taken into account.</P>
    <P>I tried to hold a balance between them in this respect and to give each a fair crack of the whip.  Each of them is entitled to a fair crack of the whip but neither is entitled to dominate the other.  For that reason I must resist efforts of either to dominate the other.  Therefore, I would not propose to write in statutory percentages that must be devoted to one or to the other.  The board in its independent commercial and artistic judgment&mdash;that is obviously very relevant also&mdash;will have to make those decisions.  It is much better that such a board should make them rather than a Minister or the Oireachtas who decide arbitrarily on certain percentages in advance in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn also made the point that the NFSI is not the Irish film industry. That is the very point I have been making and by separating the board from the NFSI I think I have demonstrated that I am conscious of the existence and rights of those who are not attached to the studio.</P>
    <P>On the question of amendment, as I indicated in my opening speech, I am certainly prepared to make some amendments <Col N="157" /> to this Bill&mdash;for example, an amendment to section 8 which I mentioned last night and which I think would meet the point that Deputy Kelly, among others, made about training.  I would consider any other reasonable amendment. That has always been my position.  I think it was Deputy O'Toole on another Bill who complimented me on my readiness to accept amendments.  I shall not be any different in this case but I shall not accept them if they are not worth while or if I consider they would actually be harmful. I think some amendments that have been suggested would not be helpful.</P>
    <P>As regards film archives, I dealt with that matter in some detail last night and I need not go into it again.  I regard it as a matter of some importance, and no doubt so will the board, but I also regard it as a relatively ancillary matter.  I do not think, for example, that the Bill should be amended to impose on the board a statutory obligation straight away to establish and maintain film archives.  It is something that should happen.  But I think the way in which the Bill is drafted is preferable, giving them very broad powers enabling them to do these sorts of things but not compelling them to do them all at once.  If they are to be compelled to do all these relatively ancillary things at once they will lose track of their main purpose which I suggest&mdash;and I am sure the House will agree&mdash;is to get films made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly may think that some of the motives for getting films made are a little unworthy but nonetheless I think that is what these Bills are all about. Therefore that is the principle function of the board.  I thank Deputy Kelly for his contribution although I do not agree with much of the philosophy which he espouses in regard to why we should make films, what sort of things an Irish film industry should portray.  For me, it was worth while listening to him because of the beautiful phrase in which he warned me that he thought I had a wrong impression of what certain foreign images of Ireland were when he said that perhaps I might have listened to &ldquo;some half-lettered innkeeper in the Peloponnese&rdquo;. Deputy Kelly's speeches are always <Col N="158" /> worth listening to it they incidentally drop jewels of that kind.</P>
    <P>Although he complained very bitterly about the use of certain tragic aspects of Irish history as the <i>locus in quo</i> for some of our finest dramatic works, I made the point that I thought O'Casey's three best plays were set against the background of the War of Independence and the Civil War and that the emotions which they portrayed were surely universal.  I think he conceded that point but then he went back to develop his own point all over again.  I fully accept that we as a country, I suppose, try to broaden the boundaries within which we convey certain aspects of dramatic art whether in the cinema, on the stage or elsewhere; nonetheless, I do not think it fair to criticise the methods which O'Casey used to express what he did express so extraordinarily well.  It should be remembered that nowadays one does not even have to play O'Casey in a Dublin accent or even in English; he is widely played in Russian, Japanese and Chinese with considerable success and great benefit to the audiences who have the privilege of seeing his plays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews suggested that television films should be regarded as more significant here now than in the past, and that brings me back to the commercially and artistically successful film I mentioned earlier, &ldquo;The Cry of the Innocent&rdquo;. That type of film is made in a different fashion from the typical cinema feature film.  It is made much more quickly, it has much less studio content. It tends to be made on location without an enormous number of retakes and with relatively few staff, using very modern cameras, films and other equipment.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which one can see a great future and I hope film makers in Ireland will consider the possibilities here, particularly because of the world market for such film material.  The appetite of the American networks for anything new or unusual is particularly voracious. Anybody who goes to America from time to time, as I do, will have noticed that from early morning until late at night every time you switch on a television programme you will see some kind <Col N="159" /> of John Wayne 1935 classic being shown for the 111th time on CBS.  Anything new or fresh for that enormous market would be welcome.  We have great opportunities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Adelaide Hospital Charter (Amendment) Order, 1980,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann on 16th June, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As explained in the memorandum which accompained the draft order the application to amend the Charter of the Adelaide Hospital was made by the board of management of the hospital.  Section 76 <Col N="160" /> of the Health Act, 1970, gives power to the Minister for Health to make an order, on the application of the governing body of a hospital, to amend a charter or private Act relating to that hospital, subject to consultation with the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, who have been consulted in this case and who have approved of the proposed amendments to the hospital's charter and also subject to a draft of an order which it is proposed to make being laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The section stipulates that the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>I considered the amendments in the charter put forward by the hospital's board of management and have agreed to make an order incorporating them in their existing charter.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the amendments is to remove certain restrictive clauses in the existing charter, which dates from the year 1920, and also to bring up to date certain other clauses that are regarded as outmoded.  The memorandum circulated with the draft order explains the various amendments.  I believe that the House will welcome the removal of the restrictive clauses indicated, but it is only fair to the board of the Adelaide Hospital to say that, generally speaking, the restrictive clauses have not been applied in practice for many years past.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to thank the board of the hospital, and also the medical, nursing and other staff of the hospital, for the good work they have performed over the years in treating the many thousands of persons who attended the hospital both as in-patients and outpatients. I feel sure that this good work will continue in the future and we can all look forward to the day when the services at present provided in the Adelaide Hospital will be transferred to more modern hospital facilities in the new hospital that is to be built at Tallaght.  Representatives of the Adelaide Hospital will be included on the board that will be set up soon to plan the development of the new Tallaght hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> I ask the Dáil to approve of the draft Adelaide Hospital Charter (Amendment) Order, 1980, which has been laid before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are fully in agreement that this order should be approved.  As the Minister has said, it updates the charter and removes certain restrictions which were entirely outmoded and not in keeping with modern thinking.  The hospital authorities are to be commended on taking the move to have the charter amended, particularly the clauses referred to by the Minister in relation to restrictions in so far as staff appointments are concerned which provide that only members of a particular religion be appointed.  It is interesting to reflect that there were restrictions whereby, except in cases of emergency, only patients of a certain religion were to be treated in the hospital.</P>
      <P>It is also interesting to reflect on the evolution of medical and hospital services and to realise that many of the hospitals dating from the establishment of the Adelaide, from one side or the other, had a large religious input rate.  They laid down certain conditions governing the manner in which the hospital would be operated.  Such conditions were restrictive and not in keeping with modern thinking.  I do not think they are acceptable to the vast majority of the people of any religion.  As the Minister has said, this hospital has not operated those restrictive clauses for a considerable time.  It is only fair that the charter would be updated, and for our part I welcome this modification.</P>

    <Title>Health (Mental Services) Bill, 1980: Second Stage .</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Mental Services) Bill, 1980 is the most important legislation specifically concerned with the psychiatric <Col N="162" /> services which has been introduced since the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, was passed by the Oireachtas.  I should say, however, that the impact of the various Health Acts upon the administration of the psychiatric services has been significant in the process of integrating psychiatric and general medicine, as indeed, was acknowledged in the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness in 1966.</P>
    <P>The provisions made in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, in regard to the reception and treatment of patients remain basically the same as when they were introduced.  I should, however, make it clear that the provisions of this Act were enlightened for their time&mdash;in particular the provision made for the reception of persons for treatment on medical certification, without the intervention of a judicial authority, was a most advanced change which has subsequently become the accepted procedure in many other countries.</P>
    <P>In the course of the 35 years since the introduction of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, there have been many changes in the theory and practice of psychiatric medicine.  Such changes have come about in part by new therapies which have been made possible by the various chemo-therapeutical discoveries made and also by a deeper understanding of the aetiology of psychiatric illness and the needs of the mentally ill.  The emphasis in treatment has shifted significantly, one might almost say dramatically, from segregation and long term detention towards a modern concept of treatment and speedy rehabilitation in informal settings which are as free and unrestricted as individual circumstances permit.  Many patients are now being treated successfully while living at home.  Community services such as out-patient clinics, day hospitals, hostels, family care and domiciliary consultation have been provided and developed.  In addition, the psychiatric services have the capacity to provide intensive in-patient treatment, in many cases in short-term acute units in, or in association with general hospitals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> There is a fear of mental illness in the community which is deep rooted.  The spread of tolerance, understanding and involvement can only be a gradual process. There has nevertheless been a steady increase in appreciating that mental illnesses are illnesses, that people recover from them and that the process of recovery is influenced by the help and understanding shown to the psychiatrically ill by those with whom they come into contact in the course of their normal living.  The health boards, various voluntary agencies, particularly the Mental Health Association of Ireland, have contributed much to this growth in popular understanding of the problems of the mentally ill.  The Health (Mental Services) Bill, 1980 will advance the development of the community's care and concern for mental patients by bringing the legislation which governs the services which are provided for them into conformity with modern thinking particularly in the area of admission, discharge and safeguards against improper detention.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of considering the Bill it divides readily into three areas of concern: firstly, provisions which are concerned with the registration and supervision of psychiatric institutions. Secondly, provisions which are concerned with admission and discharge procedures in psychiatric institutions. Finally, provisions which protect patients against unnecessary detention and which relate to issues such as consent to certain treatments.</P>
    <P>So far as institutions are concerned, the Bill provides that existing health board psychiatric institutions will be regarded as district psychiatric centres, that the Minister for Health may, at the request of a health board, designate such centres and areas to be served by them. The Minister will have the power, after consultation with a health board, to cancel the designation of a district psychiatric centre.  The Bill makes it an offence for any person other than a health board to operate any premises for the detention of persons suffering from mental illness <Col N="164" /> unless it is approved and registered by the Minister in accordance with regulations which he is empowered by the Bill to make.  It also provides the Minister with power to refuse or cancel the registration of psychiatric institutions and for appeals against his decision.</P>
    <P>The provisions are simpler than those in existing legislation and are designed to bring the approach to these institutions into line with that obtaining for other categories of health institutions.</P>
    <P>So far as admission and discharge procedures are concerned, the Bill essentially simplifies the situation by providing for only one category of detained patient. The criteria for the detention of such patients are that the person is suffering from severe mental disorder, that detention and treatment are necessary in the interests of the person's health and safety and that he is not prepared to accept treatment or is not suitable for treatment otherwise than as a detained patient.  The Bill provides that an application for the reception of any person in a psychiatric centre shall require the written recommendation of two registered medical practitioners.  This provision brings the procedure for detaining a person in a public psychiatric institution into line with that which obtains for private institutions at present.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill specifically indicates that nothing in the provisions of that part of the Bill dealing with the admission and discharge of patients should be read as preventing or discouraging any person from presenting him self voluntarily for treatment.  This emphasis has been specially laid in the Bill to encourage the development of the trend which has, at the last count, resulted in around 90 per cent of admissions to mental hospitals being undertaken voluntarily.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes a radical departure from the existing situation in the area of the provision of safeguards against the unnecessary detention of persons.  It proposes to establish a national system of review boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> In present legislation, most of the safeguards in this area are vested in the inspector of mental hospitals, reporting to and directed by the Minister.  It can be argued, however, that a system based on one person is neither satisfactory nor acceptable to contemporary opinion. Given the nature of the judgements which the inspector must make, the onus of responsibility on him is very great.  The review boards will function as a broadly based, independent appeals system subsuming those duties of the inspector which concern the investigation of appeals made against detention.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this new system that either a patient or a relative will be entitled to require a review board to investigate the propriety of the detention of that patient.  The same right will be accorded to the Minister, the President of the High Court and the Registrar of Wards of Court.  Any other person can also seek the intervention of a review board but in this case investigation may take place at the discretion of the board.  The review board will have the power to direct the discharge conditionally or unconditionally of a patient on foot of their investigation. If the review board consider that the person is properly detained there is a right of appeal to the Minister given to the applicant by subsection (5) of section 39.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the function of dealing with individual appeals, the review board will also be responsible for an automatic review of those persons in long term detention.  Every such patient will have his case investigated biennially.</P>
    <P>The creation of the review boards will mean that much of the work of the holder of the office of inspector of mental hospitals will be transferred to them and therefore the need for that office will largely cease.  The Bill provides that the task of visiting and inspecting mental hospitals will be assigned to a medical officer of the Department specially designated by the Minister for Health for that purpose. Incidentally, I should at this point say that it is my intention to publish the report of the inspector of mental hospitals for the years 1977-1979 in the next month or so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> When I circulated this Bill I made it clear that I would be glad to have any comments upon it, which I undertook to consider most carefully.  I am glad to say that I have received a great deal of constructive and enlightened comment and as a result I will be circulating a number of amendments before Committee Stage is taken.  I will, for example, be amending the provisions of section 32 of the Bill to permit the discharge of a person by an authorised medical practitioner&mdash;in other words by a consultant psychiatrist. Such a provision would be consistent with the general philosophy of the Bill in that the decision to receive a patient is made by the consultant psychiatrist and not solely by the medical officer in charge.</P>
    <P>The Bill has, however, raised a number of major issues upon which I would like to indicate my position and, at the same time, invite Deputies' comments on them.  I am aware that a number of people are somewhat disappointed that the Bill does not contain a specific reference to levels and standards of service provided in psychiatric hospitals.  In the drafting of this legislation it was felt that to attempt to give a statutory form to the quality of the care and treatment which patients should receive would be a meaningless exercise since it is so dependent on the quality, training and professional dedication of the medical and nursing staff.  I would argue that it is not possible to legislate in an effective way as to the detailed day-to-day care which any patient should receive.  Essentially, legislation can never be expected to serve as a substitute for the proper and conscientious discharge of the duties and obligations which fall on the caring professions.</P>
    <P>It was decided for these reasons that no useful purpose would be served by the attempted provision in the Bill of specific standards of care.  The Health Acts with which this Bill must be read impose on health boards the obligation of providing satisfactory levels of services.  There are throughout the country many examples of where the interplay of administrative skills and medical and nursing leadership has served to overcome in an extraordinarily effective way the limitations <Col N="167" /> imposed by very old and outdated buildings.</P>
    <P>A number of interests have questioned the wisdom of not requiring that voluntary patients be obliged to give, say, 72 hours' notice of their intention to leave hospital as is the case at present.  It is argued that such patients are potentially harmful to themselves or others.  I find it difficult to accept that this problem is of such magnitude that it cannot be taken care of by the application of psycho-therapy until the particular tension has subsided in the relatively few cases which I would expect to arise.  In any event, I am extremely reluctant to impose statutory limitations which might serve to discourage persons from availing themselves of treatment voluntarily.  If a person who would otherwise go freely for treatment fears that he can be kept in, then he simply will not go.</P>
    <P>The general procedures relating to applications to registered medical practitioners for a recommendation for the reception of a person as a detained person have not been the subject of criticism. Many bodies and individuals have, however, objected to the provision which requires a recommendation to be supported by two doctors.  They claim that it could prove difficult in practice to obtain the services of two doctors for this purpose without undue delays arising, particularly in some of the more sparsely populated rural areas.  This point has been examined closely but the situation on the ground does not support these claims.  Analysis has shown that access to two doctors is not a real problem even in the more remote areas.  Further, it should be noted that this requirement is not new as the recommendation of two doctors is already required under present legislation where a patient is being admitted to a private institution.  There is no evidence that this provision has caused difficulty in the past.</P>
    <P>In my view the requirement that two medical practitioners should sign the recommendation for detention is necessary to underline how serious such a step is <Col N="168" /> and to protect the essential rights of the individual to careful and balanced assessment.</P>
    <P>The statutory composition of the review boards as proposed has given rise to an amount of criticism.  The boards will consist of three persons appointed by the Minister, namely a psychiatrist, a lawyer and a third person who is not a member of the medical or legal professions. Criticism has been advanced on the grounds that medical opinion might be overruled where the lawyer and lay person both favour the discharge of a patient while the consultant in charge of the case and the psychiatrist on the review board recommend continued detention.  This seems to me to postulate a very abstract and unreal situation.  I cannot seriously believe that highly qualified psychiatrists would not be able to articulate their opposition to the discharge of a patient in a manner which would convince their non-medical colleagues.  In practice, of course, the non-medical members of the board will have the fullest regard for the professional opinion of their medical colleague and also to the opinion of the medical consultant in the psychiatric centre where the patient is detained.  The composition of the review board as proposed guarantees an independent and balanced appeals system.  I feel that to alter this system would be a regressive step and in the long term would not prove to be in the interests of the patients. There is, I should point out, provision for appeal to the Minister where a review board rules that continued detention is justified.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council and a number of other medical interests have been critical of section 44 of the Bill.  The section proposes that the Medical Council, with the Minister for Health's consent, may prescribe rules relating to certain forms of therapeutic treatment.  It is important to note that the powers given to the Medical Council in this regard are of a discretionary nature and do not impose an obligation on them to make such rules. This provision is in keeping with the philosophy that any profession should in the first instance be responsible for the discipline <Col N="169" /> of its own members.  The criticism of the provisions of section 44 has rested mainly on the grounds that psychiatric medicine was being subjected to a unique form of supervision and intervention not extended to other medical practice.  It was also argued that the Medical Council would not be in a position to enforce rules specifying conditions to be complied with, given the vast range of different individual cases with which the consultant psychiatrist must deal on a day-to-day basis.  I find the opposition to the provision puzzling.  The majority of patients with whom a psychiatrist deals must inevitably by the nature of their illness have a diminished capacity to assent fully to the forms of treatment proposed.  This puts the psychiatrist in a difficult situation and I would have thought it proper that in the event of public controversy arising in relation to a specific form of treatment it would have been valuable for the Medical Council to have the powers envisaged in section 44. Given the universal acknowledgment of the high standards of professional ethics prevailing in the medical profession in this country, it is not envisaged that recourse to this provision will be frequent.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to a Second Reading by the House let me say that I will, as I have previously said, welcome constructive criticism of it and consider suggestions for its improvement very carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: As the Minister said at the outset of his remarks, the Health (Mental Services) Bill, 1980 is the most important legislation concerned specifically with the psychiatric services which has been introduced since the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 was passed by the Oireachtas.  That, of course, is a truism because, beyond minor amendments of the 1945 Act and possibly with the fairly major exception of amendments brought by the 1961 Act, virtually no legislation of any consequence dealing with the psychiatric services has been brought before the Oireachtas since the main substantive Act of 1945 which this Bill seeks to repeal in its entirety.  In that context it is fair that the <Col N="170" /> House should be reminded also that the Minister's party in the summer of 1977, three years ago, promised in their election manifesto at that time under the section dealing with health:</P>
      <P>12.  To undertake a complete re-organisation of the mental health service.</P>
      <P>13.  To undertake a comprehensive national programme for the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>Now, three years later, the instrument that apparently it is suggested&mdash;if one is to take the undertaking given by the Minister's predecessor over the past 18 months&mdash;will give effect to those two ambitious undertakings is the Health (Mental Services) Bill, 1980, which updates the legislation of 1945 in relation to the involuntary patient, in other words in relation to the patient who is detained compulsorily.  It sets out a different procedure in relation to appeals against detention and replaces in some way in a much poorer form the present legislative system which requires the inspectors of mental hospitals to carry out certain functions. I will return to the question of the replacement of mental hospitals later.</P>
      <P>In no way can this Bill be regarded as being a complete reorganisation of the mental health services, because they are not, as so often happens, even referred to in any way in this legislation.  This Bill does not in any way purport to do anything to improve the lot, regularise the position or recognise the rights in law of the mentally handicapped who are in institutions.  In that way the manifesto undertakings are very far from being fulfilled and once again the mentally handicapped are ignored in legislation and in the departmental approach to the twin problems of those who are psychiatrically ill and those who are mentally handicapped. These are twin problems but they are separate and the latter problem of the mentally handicapped is not dealt with in this Bill or referred to in the Minister's speech.  Later in my contribution I will deal at some length with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the situation in perspective it is no harm to quote some of the more recent <Col N="171" /> published figures.  In the statistical information published by the Department of Health in 1978 relevant to the health services the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals at the end of 1977 was given as 13,288 in public hospitals and 1,064 in private hospitals, giving a grand total of 14,352 patients in psychiatric hospitals. The same document gives the figure of 4,751 mentally handicapped people in special residential homes in 1976. In a document published earlier this year entitled &ldquo;Services for the Mentally Handicapped&rdquo; the number of places needed for the mentally handicapped at 1977 levels is estimated at 6,330, representing a shortfall of places specifically designed for the mentally handicapped of almost 2,000.  In the same working party report the number of mentally handicapped people who are in psychiatric institutions was given as 2,620.  I will speak again later on the position of those mentally handicapped people who should never have been admitted in the first place and who should not now be retained in psychiatric hospitals which are intended to provide for those who are psychiatrically ill rather than mentally handicapped.  I will invite the House to consider the position of those 2,620 people and the situation in which they will find themselves if this Bill is enacted.  Most of them could certainly not be described as voluntary patients and yet if the Bill is read in its strictest form they cannot be termed psychiatrically ill and have detention orders made against them.</P>
    <P>It has been decided that the Bill should deal almost exclusively with the committal and detention of psychiatrically ill patients in hospitals and institutions.  I accept that it is a definite decision on the part of the Minister, although it is not one with which I agree.  The Minister endeavoured to some extent in his speech to defend that decision.  The Bill does not try to deal with the standards of care, the level of treatment or the right to treatment which patients should have and which should be clearly enunciated in any legislation purporting to bring about a complete reorganisation of the mental <Col N="172" /> health service.  The Minister admits the conscious decision that the Bill should not deal with the provision of physical facilities, the improvement of existing facilities and the standard of physical facilities, buildings and other essentials to which patients in psychiatric hospitals should be entitled.  If the Minister decides that the situation in psychiatric hospitals and in areas where the mentally handicapped are held is satisfactory, it is his prerogative to decide that it should not be dealt with in legislation.  I cannot accept that this is the case, and I feel it would not be accepted by the majority of people operating in either of the fields that the situation is satisfactory.  It has been quite obvious since the Bill was mooted and especially since its publication that there is a great unhappiness on the part of many people, specialists in the field and others with a particular knowledge because of their association with the institutions or with patients there.  There is no attempt in the Bill to set out clearly in legislative form the right to care, the right to treatment, the level of treatment and the standard of facilities, yet this Bill is supposed to bring about a reorganisation of the mental health service.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we can consider the contents of the Bill in isolation from some of the other factors to which I have referred.  Above all else there must be enshrined in any modern Bill which purports to provide in a realistic, forward-looking way for mental services the patient's right to treatment if he is psychiatrically ill and the right to treatment and care if he is mentally handicapped. These are sacred rights.  It is not good enough that the Minister should suggest that because of the high level of nursing and medical skills difficulties in certain areas have been surmounted.  The onus is on the legislature to provide for the rights of the individual, especially in relation to the mentally handicapped, who are least able to ensure their right to treatment and care.  This Minister has decided not to face up to that problem.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago I described this Bill as being like a small curate's egg in a poor parish, bad in most spots and bad mainly <Col N="173" /> by the sins of omission.  It is bad because of the deliberate exclusion of some of the forward-looking provisions of the 1945 Act and because the emphasis is entirely on detention and custody of patients.  I am not just expressing my own views or the views of my party.  In relation to the restrictive nature of the Bill it should be pointed out that the psychiatric group of the Irish Medical Association have stated that the foreign observer might well gain an impression of totalitarianism and that the Bill is essentially negative and restrictive. These are people who should know what they are talking about and they also criticise the fact that there is no recognition of the citizen's right to treatment or an indication that the State will cherish all citizens equally, including the psychiatrically ill.</P>
    <P>They go on to deal with detailed points in relation to certain sections of the Bill and deal specifically with the question of the requirement that two GPs are necessary before a patient can be referred to a centre for a reception order.  They make the point, which must be valid, that in emergency cases in rural areas it may on occasion be well-nigh impossible for two GPs to attend a patient for whom an application has been made for referral to a reception centre.  If one GP has been asked to examine and assess whether or not a person should be recommended for reception and does not make that assessment and a second GP is within seven days or, in the case of section 16, 24 hours, invited to make an assessment, the Bill then places the onus on the first GP to make his recommendation.  Nowhere in the Bill is an onus placed on the second GP to give his opinion.  Although the Bill apparently sets out to make it mandatory that a patient may only be recommended for reception on the advice of two GPs, it places, in section 19 (3) (v), a mandatory provision on the first GP who may have been invited to make an assessment but places none at all on the second GP. A situation could occur where it could be quite impossible to have the opinion of two GPs and the entire aspirations of the Bill in that regard could be defeated.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this will be the <Col N="174" /> norm but I have no doubt that in certain emergency cases in rural Ireland and now, regrettably, in parts of urban Ireland where it is felt that a patient may urgently need to be referred to a centre for a reception order, examination and assessment it will be impossible to get two GPs quickly to examine that person and to give their assessment.  All of us know how difficult it can be at certain times, and especially at weekends, to obtain the services of one general practitioner. I invite the House to consider how difficult it may be to obtain the services of two general practitioners in an emergency situation in rural Ireland when we bear in mind the constant complaints we hear in the House and other quarters concerning the difficulty of obtaining medical services in parts of the suburbs of Dublin especially late at night and at weekends.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the concept of having two general practitioners give their views before a patient is referred for reception, but I agree with the psychiatric group of the IMA when they say that there should be specific provision that in an emergency situation the view of the second GP can be obtained after the patient has been referred for reception and is in the care of the district centre.  There should have been a provision in the Bill that within a certain specified length of time after this emergency procedure a second GP would be brought in and asked to give his endorsement of his colleague's findings.  As the situation is at the moment I fear that in certain urgent cases the Bill will produce a regressive effect.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the psychiatrically ill we are talking about an increasingly complex and difficult medical problem. An example of the dimension of the problem which I heard recently is that in England approximately one in three of the hospital beds are occupied by mentally ill and four million tablets a day are prescribed and consumed by those with some nervous disorder or those psychiatrically ill.  Those are frightening figures.  I do not know if there are any comparative figures <Col N="175" /> for this country but I fear that the trend is proportionally as high.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the powers of detention and the right to appeal against custody.  When we bear in mind that it does not attempt to deal with the situation of the mentally handicapped, the Bill really deals with fewer than 10 per cent of those in psychiatric hospitals.  The Minister suggested that about 90 per cent&mdash;my information is that it is over 90 per cent&mdash;of all patients in psychiatric hospitals enter voluntarily.  The Bill, which purports to reorganise completely the mental health service, in fact deals with one in ten of those who are at present in psychiatric hospitals or those likely to seek admission to such hospitals.  It must therefore, be regarded as falling far short of a complete reorganisation of the service or a recognition of the extent of the problem in the community.</P>
    <P>I am very unhappy that the rights of the voluntary patient are not enunciated or dealt with at any length.  The Minister's remarks that the emphasis should continue to be on patients entering voluntarily for treatment, with which I agree entirely, are at odds with the Bill, which deals in two lines with voluntary patients. There is no other reference to the voluntary patient, which is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>In relation to more than 90 per cent of the voluntary patients occupying beds, there is a provision in the 1945 Mental Treatment Act that if a voluntary patient opts to discharge himself from hospital he may only do so after 72 hours.  I thought that that provision was being repealed without the full knowledge of the implications.  I was taken aback when the Minister in his opening contribution said that he was proud to abolish that restriction.  When we talk about recognising patients' rights we should also talk about recognising the right to ensure their safety.</P>
    <P>Many of the voluntary patients we are now talking about can decide to discharge themselves at a time when they are receiving very heavy medical treatment and may be under the influence of drugs. <Col N="176" /> They may decide to discharge themselves at a time when the effect of those drugs is to make them have an obsessive distrust of the surroundings of the hospital. Those are recognised effects of the treatment those people are receiving.  I understand that the profession assumed that that was the reason for the 72 hour delay enshrined in the 1945 Act.  If a voluntary patient under heavy medication says &ldquo;I am a voluntary patient and I wish to leave&rdquo; he is not allowed to leave for 72 hours so that the effect of the drug he is receiving or the sedation he is under will have worn off.  In addition, there is an opportunity to notify his relatives and they can come to ensure his safety if he discharges himself.  This also ensures that when the effect of the drug has worn off the patient may more rationally discuss with his medical advisers if he should discharge himself from the hospital.</P>
    <P>I believe that that provision was a sensible one and I cannot accept, under any circumstances, that 35 years later we should be seeking to scrap that and to suggest that somebody who, to put it in crude layman's language, is drugged up to the eyeballs can up and out of a hospital and the medical people who are charged with his care can do nothing about it.  The only effect that this provision can have is that certain people, who under normal circumstances would realise that they were not well enough, will opt to discharge themselves and, under the influence of those drugs or sedatives, they may either consciously or unconsciously do themselves damage when they discharge themselves without notice and without warning from the hospital. I can only say that the omission of the waiting period in relation to voluntary patients, a reasonable waiting period of 72 hours, is entirely to be regretted and cannot at all be represented as an improvement on the existing situation.  I do not accept the Minister's statement when he says that it is argued that such persons are potentially harmful to them selves or others but that he finds it difficult to accept that this problem is of such magnitude that it cannot be taken care of by the application of psychotherapy until the particular tension has subsided in the <Col N="177" /> relatively few cases which he would expect to arise.  The man does not understand the problem at all.  If the patient opts to leave, the doctor has no right under this new legislation to apply the principles of psychotherapy.  He must allow the patient, forthwith, drugged to the eyeballs, to walk out into a busy city centre street full of traffic and hazards. The omission of the 72-hour limitation will see very serious and perhaps fatal consequences to the health of the voluntary patients.  I cannot understand the Minister's suggestion that he is extremely reluctant to impose statutory limitations which might serve to discourage patients from availing themselves of treatment voluntarily.  Over 90 per cent of psychiatric patients at present are voluntary patients and at present the statutory limitation of 72 hours before they can be discharged applies.  No one is suggesting that the Minister should impose a statutory limitation of 72 hours.  All anybody is suggesting, including the people in the profession, is that the Minister should have enough good sense to retain it.  To suggest that because of its being imposed people might be less prepared to undergo voluntary treatment is absolutely ludicrous when we realise that more than nine in ten of those who are in psychiatric hospitals and receiving care are voluntary patients at present and that that limitation applies in relation to them.  I certainly will be tabling an amendment to reintroduce the provisions of the 1945 Act on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another of the very contentious areas that have been referred to quite extensively since the publication of the Bill is that there has been no attempt made to define the term &ldquo;mentally ill&rdquo; or the term &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;.  I accept that any such definitions are extremely difficult but nonetheless if these two terms had been defined this might have had the effect of helping to bring the mentally handicapped, to whom I referred earlier, within the scope and the provisions of this legislation.  It is not impossible.  I accept that it certainly may be difficult but it should not be impossible to make some attempt at defining those terms.  In the United Kingdom Mental Health Act <Col N="178" /> of 1959 mental disorder is defined in section 4 (1) as mental illness, arrested or incomplete development of mind, psychopathic disorder or any other disorder or disability of mind.  It says that mental disorder shall be construed accordingly. Subsection (2) went on to say that severe sub-normality means a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes sub-normality of intelligence and is of such a nature and degree that the patient is incapable of living an independent life or of guarding himself against serious exploitation or would be so incapable when of an age to do so.  So the British Act of 1959 quite neatly, in two subsections, made an attempt to define what mental disorder was and it did quite clearly distinguish between psychiatric illness and mental handicap.  This Bill, through its failure or inability to make any attempt at defining either of the problems, compounds the difficulty in relation both to the psychiatrically ill and those who are mentally handicapped and compounds the difficulty for those practising in the field or those who might have to adjudicate in a court of law because it uses the term &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; without making any attempt whatsoever to define it.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of omission in the Bill that have caused upset and disappointment to many of the people who had in some cases rather eagerly looked forward to the introduction of this measure. There has been for some time past an expression of feeling that the rights of either the psychiatrically ill or the mentally handicapped should be represented on visiting committees or on management boards of institutions either by the election or appointment of patients or, in the main where that might not be practicable, the appointment of parent or guardian representatives or the appointment of people such as social workers or health board representatives elected or appointed by the parents or guardians of people who are in institutions to represent them on management boards and on visiting committees.  It is again regressive that there has been no attempt made in this legislation to involve on a statutory basis the parents, the guardians, the representatives <Col N="179" /> of patients, especially those patients who are mentally handicapped and who are long-stay or permanent residents of institutions.  It is very regret table that that situation of the closer involvement of the families of long-stay patients has not been tackled in a statutory form in this legislation and once again it is an indication that the Bill itself is a very long way away from being a complete reorganisation of the mental health services.</P>
    <P>I agree with one aspect of the Bill and that is the manner in which the regulations in relation to both the public and private hospitals have now been made uniform so that the standards of admission, the manner of admission and the conditions governing detention, right of appeal and review are equal for those in private institutions and those in public institutions.  That certainly is to be welcomed. In so far as the Bill achieves that objective I am in agreement with it.</P>
    <P>In relation to voluntary patients&mdash;I referred to their pending right to discharge themselves on the spot&mdash;I want to ask what would be the situation in relation to a voluntary patient whose condition changes to such an extent that it is felt in the hospital it is now necessary that he or she be detained or restrained in the institution.  As far as I understand from the provisions of this Bill, a person cannot become hospitalised in an involuntary capacity unless he or she has first been referred by two registered medical practitioners, in other words, by two GPs.  But if a voluntary patient is already in an institution and his or her condition changes to such an extent that he or she is possibly a danger to himself or herself, or to the health or safety of others, under the provisions of this Bill can that voluntary patient be changed into an involuntary one without their first discharging themselves and undergoing the risk to their own health and safety and that of others?  I cannot see that the Bill deals with that consequence at all.</P>
    <P>I accept that the 1945 Act dealt separately with the situation of minors from <Col N="180" /> that of adults.  All of those provisions of the 1945 Act are now to be repealed. There is no reference whatsoever in this Bill to the specific situation of children and children at risk.  From the way this Bill is worded I assume that the provisions in relation to referral by GPs, reception orders and extension orders relate equally to children as to adults.  It is important that the Minister clarify first of all that the provisions of this Bill will relate to children without the restrictions and the rights of parents which were enunciated in the 1945 Act, not referred to in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not deal with that important point in his opening remarks.  Even if that be the situation I should have thought that the rights of children should be specifically included, that the right of a child to receive appropriate psychiatric treatment should be clearly enunciated in legislation.  I do not see how the law will change simply by the removal of the provisions in relation to parents in the 1945 Act.  As the law stands at present parents can withdraw a disturbed child from a treatment situation or refuse professional treatment for a child under 16 years of age.  By the removal of those clauses from the 1945 Act I take it that the Minister is assuming that the provisions of this Bill will allow for a disturbed child who is in need of treatment and whose parents are not agreeable to be referred to a reception area by some other authorised person. The Minister should have made clear whether or not that procedure can be followed through without possible legal consequences in the courts in relation to the rights of parents or a parent in connection with his or her child, as opposed to the needs, safety and health of the child as viewed by the State.  For that reason I am disappointed that there was neither reference to the rights of the child specifically in the Bill nor in the Minister's opening remarks.</P>
    <P>There is another situation which should have been dealt with in this Bill. In certain cases if a disturbed or psychiatrically ill child has received attention in an institution and is now regarded as <Col N="181" /> being in a condition in which he or she can be returned to a home environment there can be certain circumstances in which the parents refuse to accept that child back into its home environment.  I should have thought there was need to make specific provision for that eventuality. If for any reason&mdash;and there could be a multiplicity of reasons&mdash;a parent will not take back a child who has received treatment, a child whom the medical advisers wish to discharge into the community, then there should have been specific provision in the Bill for the fostering and care of that child in some place other than the psychiatric centre involved.</P>
    <P>Perhaps separately from the procedures that have been enunciated here whereby a patient now can be referred by an applicant approaching two general practitioners who then refer the patient to a reception area where a retention order is made for 48 hours after which that patient can either be discharged or a retention order extended, in the first case for a period of three months or, in other cases, 12 months, there ought to have been specific reference to the situation of addicts and alcoholics.  In very many of such cases they need merely to be brought into a detoxification unit where, after that process has been completed, the medical advice is that the work with them normally is much better carried out with their voluntary co-operation. This Bill appears to have incorporated the particular problems of addicts and alcoholics into the general question of the psychiatrically ill, which is not the most welcome of moves.</P>
    <P>Had we been attempting to provide comprehensive legislation for those who are psychiatrically ill, emotionally disturbed or handicapped, then there should have been specific sections of this Bill devoted to the problems of people who quite frankly take overdoses of drugs or alcohol and who are in need of short-term treatment.  These people in many ways are different and in a different category from people who are perhaps psychiatrically ill and in need of longer periods of detention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> I should like to speak now about the setting up of the review body which will examine at regular intervals the continued detention or otherwise of involuntary patients, which I welcome and in respect of which I will voice my views in a few moments.  I am not satisfied that the transfer to the review body of certain of the obligations now placed on the inspector of mental hospitals warrants the removal of some of the existing powers vested in that inspector.  At present the inspector of mental hospitals has an obligation to visit institutions on a minimum number of occasions.  He may visit any institution at any time and examine any patient in that institution.  He has an obligation to visit all the institutions at stated intervals and an obligation also to visit the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum twice a year.  Those provisions are now to be changed.  Section 36 of the new Bill suggests that a designated medical officer of the Minister shall visit and inspect once in every year special district and registered psychiatric centre and shall report to the Minister on his visit. In other words, the existing provisions whereby Dundrum must be visited twice a year are to be replaced by a provision whereby it is to be visited now only once annually.</P>
    <P>However, there is a much more fundamental omission from section 36 which I shall not accept and which I do not believe that the House will accept, or that the public will want to see accepted.  The obligation at the moment is on the inspector of mental hospitals to provide an annual report to the Minister on the state of those hospitals and on his performance of his duties during the year.  The fact that this has not been done in a very up to date fashion need not be gone into. The Minister mentioned that he intends publishing the inspector's reports for, I think, the last three years in the relatively near future.  There is one other obligation imposed by the legislation, apart from the report being provided to the Minister, and it is that the inspector of mental hospitals' report must be laid before this House and the Seanad, to be available for inspection by Members of this House and, consequently, made available to the <Col N="183" /> public.  If we let section 36 as presently drafted go through the only person to get a report on the state of the mental hospitals will be the Minister.  I am not prepared to see some of the restricted and limited powers of this House removed and have that described by any Minister as a progressive move and I shall be entering an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage also.</P>
    <P>I am being fairer with the Minister than he was with the House.  He merely said that, following submissions made to him since publication of the Bill, he intended now to introduce a number of amendments before Committee Stage.  He outlined, as an example, what one such amendment would be.  I should have thought when a Minister published a Bill which received such widespread criticism that before it came for debate in the House he must accept that amendments are necessary, the least he might have done, out of courtesy to the House, so that the Members could have a full picture of his proposal and so that we might have shortened the debate on Second Stage and helped those of us who had to draft amendments for Committee Stage without the assistance of the public service, would be to outline specifically the areas in which he intends entering Government amendments in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister's first main piece of legislation and he probably did not conceive it entirely himself.  There had been references made to it by his predecessor over a protracted period.  I suggest to the Minister that in future if he has any legislative proposals and if he realises at the beginning that the proposals are faulty in part, he amend his hand by withdrawing the Bill and re-entering it with the amendments so that the House knows where it stands at the outset.  If he decides to table Government amendments before Second Stage debate starts, he should have the courtesy to tell the House what they are about.  As already said, I intend entering an amendment to see to it that this designated medical officer who is to replace the inspector of <Col N="184" /> mental hospitals is required to table his report before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned that under the provisions of the 1945 Act the inspector's report is required not only to be laid before each House but a copy of it to be sent to the President of the High Court. The Minister has apparently decided that the President of the High Court is not worthy to receive that document in the future since he has been omitted from the new legislation.  Is that progress?  The present provision is that the officer gives a report to the Minister and includes in it a general account relating to such year of the administration of the asylum and of the care, welfare and treatment of the inmates thereof&mdash;this refers to Dundrum. That obligation has not been placed on the designated medical officer except in so far as he must pay a visit to all the centres, including the special centre which Dundrum will be.  I would not call that progress.  I should not have thought that that obligation in relation to the Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum should not be removed, especially in view of the report issued earlier this year by Justice Henchy's committee in relation to the detention, care and treatment of persons who had criminal charges laid against them and who were found to be mentally ill, without something to replace it.</P>
    <P>The designation of the medical officer is, I assumed, being made by the Minister. The section does not qualify this, but I suggest that if this designate medical officer is to operate to the best and highest level of efficiency he should have some degree, or qualifications in psychiatry and, preferably should have some working, practical, day-to-day experience in psychiatry to keep abreast of the developments and keep in touch with his colleagues in the profession and make a balanced, day-to-day and modern assessment of the facilities being provided in centres and, where necessary, report on the lack of such facilities.  Section 36 also needs amendment in such a way as to specify certain minimum qualifications in relation to that designated medical officer. The mere description of the officer <Col N="185" /> as a medical officer is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I mentioned briefly at the outset that the mentally handicapped have not been referred to in any way in this legislation, which is absolutely unsatisfactory.  The Minister did not refer to the mentally handicapped, neither does the Bill.  If specific residential centres for the mentally handicapped were to be designated under the terms of this Bill that would be to some extent an improvement, but would be, on the other hand, an indictment of the Department of Health that they are not prepared to recognise and distinguish the definite division between the psychiatrically ill and the mentally handicapped.  A separate part should have been included in this Bill dealing with the rights of the mentally handicapped to treatment, therapy and care, and setting out certain provisions and safeguards in the law for the mentally handicapped.  That is not in the Bill and, to the best of my knowledge, it is not in any legislation old or new.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to quote the declaration on the rights of mentally retarded persons adopted by the United Nations which says that whenever mentally retarded persons are unable, because of the severity of their handicap, to exercise all their rights in a meaningful way, or it should become necessary to restrict or deny some or all of these rights, the procedure used for that restriction or denial of rights must contain proper legal safeguards against every form of abuse; this procedure must be based on an evaluation of the social capability of the mentally retarded person by qualified experts and must be subject to periodic review and to the right of appeal to a higher authority.</P>
    <P>This Bill purports to modernise completely the mental health service.  It purports apparently to revolutionise the service for the mentally handicapped, and they are not referred to in it.  Their rights are not referred to.  Their position under the legislation is less than clear.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, on the latest figures 2,620 people who are mentally handicapped, on the Department's own estimate, are in psychiatric hospitals.  Virtually none of them is a voluntary patient <Col N="186" /> because most of them have not got the capacity to pronounce themselves as desiring voluntary treatment.  Yet they do not fall within whatever definition has been excluded as being mentally ill.  They come under subsection (2) of section 4 of the United Kingdom 1959 Act as having a mental disorder through their capacity not being developed.</P>
    <P>Consequently those who care for the mentally handicapped on a professional basis are in a quandary as to whether they are acting inside or outside the law when they detain mentally handicapped people in institutions, for benevolent reasons of course.  Apparently within the law specific authority is not given to those who care for mentally handicapped patients to detain them.  Those patients cannot opt for voluntary treatment, and the law does not appear to specify how they can become involuntary patients.  This is supposed to be a modern Bill and it does not refer to the mentally handicapped in any way.</P>
    <P>Worse again, what is the situation in relation to the 2,500 mentally handicapped patients who are in existing psychiatric institutions?  Under the provisions of this Bill clearly the existing psychiatric institutions are to be designated as registered psychiatric centres. Almost all of those 2,500 mentally handicapped patients are not voluntary patients, and almost certainly they are not psychiatrically ill.  They are mentally handicapped.  It is very questionable whether the consultants, psychiatrists and their staffs in the psychiatric centres have the right to make retention or detention orders in respect of those mentally handicapped people.</P>
    <P>It is to the shame of the Government and this House and&mdash;let us be clear about it&mdash;the general public that the need to update the law and to set out the entitlement of the mentally handicapped were not perceived as being of sufficient importance to be included in the Bill.  It is to the shame of the public because they do not want to know about the mentally handicapped.  It is not an issue in the forefront of the public's consciousness. They do not really want to hear if there <Col N="187" /> is a problem in relation to the mentally handicapped.  It is specifically a shame in relation to the Government because there is an obligation on them to know, to provide and to enshrine in legislation the entitlement and the right of those who are unable to negotiate for themselves. Almost all developed countries have laws designed to protect the mentally handicapped individual from the consequences of his failure to achieve full intellectual development.</P>
    <P>Most people who are mentally handicapped can be treated informally and a number of them can be treated in the community, but there will always be a small proportion of mentally handicapped individuals whose handicap makes them a potential danger to themselves but, because of their handicap, they do not realise that they are in need of treatment, care and protection.  Those are the groups that should be catered for specifically in legislation so that they can be admitted, detained, educated and cared for in the appropriate way until they can again take their place in the community or, in certain cases, if necessary, on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that probably 3 per cent of the population are mentally handicapped. Something like 75 per cent of that 3 per cent are in the category of being mildly mentally handicapped.  In other words, three out of four of those who are mentally handicapped are in the official designation of being mildly mentally handicapped.  The other one out of four is divided among the categories moderately handicapped, severely handicapped, or profoundly handicapped.</P>
    <P>I want to talk specifically about those who are mildly handicapped, because they are the people who are most likely to be in the community and who because of their handicap are most likely to fall foul of the restrictions and the norms set down for ordinary individuals.  They are individuals who because of their lack of judgment or self-control cannot deal with the challenge of modern everyday life, and they can become involved in juvenile <Col N="188" /> delinquency, petty thieving and vandalism.</P>
    <P>I have already said they are the sort of people who do not appreciate they are in need of treatment.  The difficulty about them is that, if they go or are referred to the existing psychiatric hospitals or units, the psychiatrists running those units will announce that these people are not really their responsibility, or their charge, or their care, because the psychiatrists in the existing institutions, probably quite correctly, argue that their job is to care for the psychiatrically ill and that because this patient has a mental handicap, albeit of a mild degree, he should be treated by the brothers in the same profession who are specialising in the treatment of the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Those who are specialising in the treatment of the mentally handicapped will then argue that they do not have the power to compulsorily detain that patient to give him the treatment which is necessary. Here we have a Bill that does virtually nothing but set out the compulsory powers, the right to detain patients who are psychiatrically ill.  Those powers, in one form or another, are there already in legislation.  I do not disagree that they need to be updated but, when we have a specific effort being made in relation to the mentally handicapped, no attempt is made by the Minister to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>At present if a midly mentally handicapped person enters a centre for treatment and opts to leave, the people operating the centre have no legal rights to detain him for his own safety and health and in order to complete his treatment. It could be argued in those circumstances that not only is that person deprived of his freedom&mdash;he only has freedom when he has the ability to exercise it properly in the community and because his doctors are not allowed to complete the treatment they cannot see him delivered back to the community with the ability to live his life to the full&mdash;but he is also deprived of the protection that this Bill is enshrining for the person who is psychiatrically ill.  When this Bill is passed it will ensure that a person who is so psychiatrically ill <Col N="189" /> that he is reluctant or refuses to admit himself voluntarily for care, through the intervention of concerned relatives, health board officers, gardaí or other people, can be involuntarily referred for treatment and receive that treatment. That protection is being sought for the psychiatrically ill person who is not prepared to admit himself voluntarily but the Bill does not provide that same right and protection for the mildly mentally handicapped patient who has not the perception to admit himself voluntarily for treatment.  Surely the person suffering from mild mental handicap is entitled to the same rights in legislation as the person who is psychiatrically ill?</P>
    <P>In relation to the other one in four in the mental handicapped category&mdash;those who are moderately, severely or profoundly handicapped&mdash;the vast majority are institutionalised.  I want the Minister to explain to the House in what capacity and under what legislation they are institutionalised. I do not think they can be described as voluntary admissions.  Certainly the profoundly mentally handicapped person from the time of handicap&mdash;whether from birth or as a result of an accident&mdash;was never in a position to have enough perception voluntarily to admit himself for treatment.  As far as I understand the situation the legislation does not provide that he can be detained involuntarily.  Many other developed countries have specific provision in legislation to cater for that kind of person and in most of those countries it has been done by conferring on some other person or authority the status of guardian.  The guardian is then obliged to look after the rights of that handicapped person who cannot defend himself.  The obligations of the guardian and his right to request doctors to examine the patient and to decide to detain him compulsorily are enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not know why I have to explain all of this to the Minister considering how much of this Bill is copied from the UK Mental Health Act, 1959.  I cannot understand why all the sections relating to the guardianship of the individual that were enshrined in that legislation 20 years ago <Col N="190" /> have not been included in this Bill.  The UK Act provides in great detail for the appointment either of relatives&mdash;in the normal case that would be the parents, brothers and sisters of the person&mdash;and they have certain rights and obligations. It also provides that where there are no relatives or where the relatives are not capable of carrying out the duties of guardians adequately the obligation devolves, under the British Act, on the local authority.  The equivalent here would be that the guardianship responsibilities would be assigned to a health board or some other statutory authority.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that a Bill that purported to update the law in relation to services for the mentally ill would have considered compassionately the situation in relation to the mentally handicapped adults who cannot make decisions for themselves and that now there might have been an attempt to set out the situation in relation to them and to ensure that responsible people would have a legal responsibility to act as their guardians. I should have thought that provisions in relation to property and finance that might fall through succession to be in the ownership of the mentally handicapped might have been specifically catered for in legislation, as has been done in Britain and in other countries.</P>
    <P>It must always be the underlying worry of any parents who have a mentally handicapped child that when they pass on and when the child reaches adulthood&mdash; and with modern medicines more and more mentally handicapped people are living virtually the full lifespan&mdash;the situation for their child will be grave and unclear.  Nobody appears to have a specific responsibility for that child who almost certainly will be in an institution.  The Minister may argue&mdash;and I will not disagree with him&mdash;that the people running an institution that provides a long-term care for mentally handicapped people are performing a magnificent task and have assigned voluntarily to themselves the role of guardians.  In the main that service has been operated by the voluntary agencies and religious institutions <Col N="191" /> but nevertheless the prime obligation is on the State to set out the entitlements of those people and ensure that they are met.  The British did it in the Mental Health Act, 1959. Section 33 (2) dealt with the procedure for reception into guardianship.  It stated:</P>
    <P>A guardianship application may be made in respect of a patient on the grounds</P>
    <P>(a)  that he is suffering from mental disorder, being&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in the case of a patient of any age, mental illness or severe subnormality;</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the case of a patient under the age of twenty-one years, psychopathic disorder or subnormality; and that his disorder is of a nature or degree which warrants the reception of the patient into guardianship under this section; and</P>
    <P>(b)  that it is necessary in the interests of the patient or for the protection of other persons that the patient should be so received.</P>
    <P>The section further states:</P>
    <P>The person named as guardian in a guardianship application may be either a local health authority or any other person (including the applicant himself); ...</P>
    <P>The section also sets out the obligations of the guardian, the length of time for which the guardianship will apply and it states that it will come up for renewal at certain periods.  Section 35 relates to regulations as to guardianship and to the care and treatment of patients.  It makes provision for patients to be visited and it lays down the obligations of the guardian.</P>
    <P>The British enacted that legislation in 1959.  We went a small way towards it in 1965.  The Minister may have heard of the report of the Commission on Mental Handicap published in 1965.  At page 159, chapter 13, under the heading &ldquo;Legislation&rdquo;, it says:</P>
    <P>There is no special legislation in Ireland dealing with mentally handicapped persons; they are dealt with under the general legislation relating <Col N="192" /> to health and education (see paragraph 32).  We are of opinion that the mentally handicapped should, as far as possible, continue to be dealt with under the legal provisions which apply to other persons.</P>
    <P>I agree.</P>
    <P>Most of our recommendations can be implemented under existing legal provisions, but there are certain aspects of care for which special provisions are necessary.</P>
    <P>Again I agree.  In paragraph 199 they set out the obligations which they believe should be on the health authorities for diagnostic assessment centres and advice. Paragraph 200, pages 159 and 160, deals in detail with the question of guardianship and says:</P>
    <P>Some of the mentally handicapped living in the community will, in their own interests or in the interests of others, require guidance, supervision and control to a greater extent, or for a longer period, than will normal persons. We consider that, to cater for such persons, there should be established a system of guardianship, equivalent to an extension of parental rights, under which guardians would exercise control over mentally handicapped adolescents and adults, as if they were still children under the age of 16 years. Guardianship should not, however, include the power to have a mentally handicapped adult compulsorily admitted to or detained in an institution.</P>
    <P>In the following paragraph they refer to specific powers which they suggest in relation to that.</P>
    <P>We suggest that health authorities should be empowered to issue guardianship orders, in appropriate cases, to parents, relatives or other persons who, after investigation, are accepted as suitable by the health authority.  The guardianship order should impose on the guardian the responsibility of arranging for the training, occupation and employment of the mentally handicapped person concerned and for his recreation <Col N="193" /> and general welfare, as well as for the promotion and safeguarding of his physical and mental health.  In cases where no suitable parent or relative or other suitable person is available the health authorities should be empowered to appoint as guardian one of its officers who has been approved by the Minister for Health as appropriate for that purpose. A request for the appointment of a guardian should be accompanied by medical certificates from two qualified medical practitioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this was back in 1965&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>at least one of whom should be recognised by the Minister for Health as having experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental handicap.  The medical certificate should set out clearly the reasons why guardianship is considered desirable.  Guardianship Orders should be granted for limited periods not exceeding five years in any one period.</P>
    <P>The commission had obviously read the British 1959 Act as well.</P>
    <P>An Appeals Tribunal (representative of medical, legal and socio-administrative interests) should be established to consider appeals against Guardianship Orders granted by health authorities. The Appeals Tribunal should be nominated by the Minister for Health.  A person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Tribunal should be at liberty to have the transcript of evidence on which the decision of the Appeals Tribunal was based, submitted to the High Court which could quash or confirm the decision of the Appeals Tribunal as it thought fit.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but I do not know of any such guardianship procedure in relation to the moderately or severely mentally handicapped which has been enshrined in legislation since that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will explain that when the Deputy finishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: I might not have had to mention this if the Minister had referred <Col N="194" /> to the mentally handicapped when he started.  The 1965 report refers to compulsory admission and detention and sets out the manner in which the commission visualise the vast majority of mentally handicapped who require residential care being admitted informally, as they do at present.  The commission say:</P>
      <P>There will be a small number of adults, however, for whom powers of compulsory admission and detention will be necessary, either in their own interests or in the interests of other persons.  We consider it essential that provision, similar to that in the Mental Treatment Acts, should be made for such compulsory admission and detention.  The power of detention should be limited in the first instance to one year, but it should be renewable, thereafter for periods not exceeding five years.</P>
      <P>They referred to sheltered employment in paragraph 202, registration of residential centres in paragraph 203, powers of inspection by health authorities in paragraph 204, remands for special centres in paragraph 205 and wards of court in paragraph 206.  They define &ldquo;mental handicap&rdquo; in paragraph 207:</P>
      <P>There is at present no legal or statutory definition of mental handicap.  We would regard such a definition as desirable in any event, but we believe that the proposals made in the preceding paragraphs will necessitate such a definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are in 1980 and in the Health (Mental Services) Bill, 1980 there is not even an attempt made to define &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; or even the term used in the Bill &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;.  If the Minister dares to suggest he assumes that at the appropriate time somebody else will decide that the term &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; ranges from those who are temporarily psychiatrically ill to those who are seriously disturbed, or from those who are mildly mentally handicapped to those who are profoundly mentally handicapped, I want to tell him that this is a very faulty Bill. I do not think a non-defined term such as &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; would ever stand the test in the courts in relation to mild psychiatric <Col N="195" /> disorder or illness through the whole gamut to profoundly mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection on this House and on the public that it took 15 years for some of the suggestions in the 1965 report to reach legislative form, and even yet the mentally handicapped are not mentioned in the 1980 Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: Purposely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: Purposely indeed.  The difficulty in trying to explain the flaws in this Bill is that the Minister appears to be so blissfully unaware of the problem, of the views of the profession, of parents and those working in the psychiatric and mentally handicapped areas, that he does not realise there are flaws.  Every time one is pointed out to him he looks up with a beatific smile and says &ldquo;Purposely, deliberately.  Of course I left them out. They are improving things&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: Which they are, but I will come to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister's capacity for dealing with things later which should have been dealt with at the outset is tremendous. I do not understand the situation where everybody in the health field&mdash;some more successfully than others&mdash;has been aspiring to divide the institutional services for the psychiatrically ill as opposed to the services for the mentally handicapped.  I do not understand that there can be a situation like that, where all those interested in the provision of services for both of these groups can have been working towards that end, and then the Minister says that he excluded purposely any reference to the mentally handicapped and, apparently, he has lumped together the psychiatrically ill and the mentally handicapped, from mildly to profoundly handicapped.  This happened on the day when the RMS of Saint Ita's at Portrane complained in public that his psychiatric hospital still contained far too many mentally handicapped, that his hospital was becoming a dumping ground for mentally handicapped patients on their transfer <Col N="196" /> from Saint Brendan's Hospital.  I might not have used the same words had I been in his position but the fact that this gentleman has complained in this way must surely be proof that the mentally handicapped need to be dealt with separately in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Therefore, when the Minister tells the House that, purposely, he omitted the mentally handicapped, he is saying that he does not comprehend the problem and that he does not perceive a solution.  As I have pointed out already, mildly mentally handicapped patients who are referred to psychiatric hospitals are being approached by the staff on the basis that they are not the problem of psychiatrists employed in the strict psychiatric service and that, instead, they should be referred to the specific centres for mentally handicapped, though there is not any provision for them to be detained in those centres.  In these circumstances a Minister who smiles beatifically and says that, purposely, he omitted this category of persons, cannot comprehend the problem and cannot realise that there are two separate questions involved.</P>
      <P>My advice is that the rights of the mentally handicapped may not be enshrined in the law so far as this Bill in concerned. I am talking of their rights in relation to their being detained compulsorily for treatment in the absence of their ability to perceive the necessity for such detention and treatment.  I am saying, deliberately and specifically, that that is the widespread belief of many of the medical people who are responsible for the operation of centres for the mentally handicapped and who have genuine ground for concern as to what their situation in law is in relation to the detention of patients under their control.  This doubt must be clarified.  They must be told whether they are entitled legally to detain those patients and whether this Bill gives them any further power in that regard.  Apart from the situation not being spelled out in the Bill, the Minister did not deem it worth his while to refer to the matter in his opening remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least the British legislation in this area specified the four separate categories of mental illness as mental disorder, <Col N="197" /> severe subnormality, subnormality and psychopathic disorder.  Surely, 21 years later we could have made some attempt to distinguish those who are ill psychiatrically and those who are mentally handicapped permanently?  There is a distinction and after the Minister has been in the Department long enough he will realise that there is such distinction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is a distinction but this is something that must be dealt with separately.  As the Deputy has said, the question of mentally handicapped persons should not be lumped together in the same legislation with the question of those suffering from severe psychiatric illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept the Minister's attempt to clarify his thinking in this regard but it is wrong for him to include the mentally handicapped with those who are psychiatrically ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are about 150 sections in the UK Mental Health Act of 1959 but if the Minister wishes to persist in saying that what I am putting forward is not accurate, I shall be obliged to read through all of these 150 sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is referring to the UK Act of 1959 but I can assure him that the British have welcomed the step <Col N="198" /> we are taking in separating entirely the mentally handicapped from those suffering from severe psychiatric illness.  In our view the question of the rights of the mentally handicapped should be treated totally separately as is the case in respect of any other group of patients and without the stigma of psychiatric illness being attached to the mentally handicapped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister's intervention indicates the extent to which he perceives the problem.  Fifteen years after the report of the commission that were set up to deal with the question of the mentally handicapped and three years after the Minister's party gave a specific election guarantee to reorganise completely the mental health service and the service for the mentally handicapped, all we have is a limited Bill dealing with the detention of the psychiatrically ill involuntary patients.  There is not any reference in the Bill to the mentally handicapped. The reason for this omission, we are told, is that their situation needs to be dealt with separately.  May we expect the legislation in that regard in about 15 years from now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: Those people who have been dealing with legislation are well aware that major and comprehensive legislation can deal with many facets simply by setting out separate parts to an Act and the main Act under which the Department have manacled the health boards is the Health Act of 1970 which deals with everything from the question of the superannuation of kitchen staff to the setting up of the administration.  It deals with such services as the child care service and the general medical service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Minister's argument what should be done is to have a separate Bill for the general medical services, a separate Bill for the child care services, for the dental orthodontic and ophthalmic services, one in relation to superannuation of employees of existing health <Col N="199" /> authorities, in relation to the taking over of existing institutions, the powers to purchase land and so on.  These are all separate things but they are integrated into the health service and together they endeavour to provide some sort of reasonable health board activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: Part 4 of the 1970 Health Act refers to the eligibility of patients for treatment.  Chapter 3 refers to the general medical services, medical and social.  Section 59 deals with the drugs, medicines and appliances, section 60 deals with home nursing and section 61 with home health services.  Chapter 3 merely deals with the provision of general medical and social services.  Chapter 4 now deals specifically with services for mothers and children.  Consequently neither Deputy Moore nor myself would qualify for these services.  Indeed many mothers and children do not receive them anyway because of the meanness of the operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am referring to a Health Act that deals with the provision of many <Col N="200" /> different services for different ailments and different necessities but they all relate to the health of the general public. We are now talking about the mental health of the general public and in this legislation there is an attempt to modernise the situation in relation to the admission, retention, discharge and review of patients who are psychiatrically ill.  There is no reason why there should not have been a separate part in this Bill which would have dealt with the rights of the mentally handicapped, which would have recognised clearly and set out in legislative form that the mentally handicapped are separate and distinct from those who are psychiatrically ill and which could then have gone on, for instance in the case of the review body, to have provided, in the same way as the involuntary aspect of psychiatrically ill patients will be reviewed by a review body, at certain stated intervals, that that operation would be put into effect in relation to patients who are mentally handicapped, as was suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are not going to operate the same kind of controls on mentally handicapped.  Mental handicap is part of the handicapped, totally.  If the Deputy read the recent NESC report he would see that mental handicap is dealt with as part of the general handicap not as part of psychiatric illness.  That is the way we are taking it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: This Bill is setting out a procedure whereby people can appeal to a review body every so often when they are detained compulsorily and deemed to be psychiatrically ill.  In 1965 the Robins Report on mental handicap set out a procedure whereby people could be detained compulsorarily if they were mentally handicapped and it sets out a procedure whereby they or their representatives can appeal against that compulsory detention virtually in the same way that the review body that is now setting out in relation to those who are mentally ill.  I do not follow the logic nor the argument that we cannot for instance in the same legislation endeavour to deal <Col N="201" /> with ophthalmic problems and aural problems.  If that is to be the argument there will be a profusion of separate Bills. If one argues that we cannot deal with the provision of aural services and ophthalmic services in the same Bill I will accept that we cannot deal with the question of the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped in the same Bill.  If that is to be the case there will be no room for Deputy Moore to introduce any other legislation except scrappy pieces of health legislation.  There is widespread unhappiness and has been for a long time amongst those who operate the mental handicap services because they have not a clear legal definition of their powers of detention and of the rights of the handicapped person and they feel that that needs to be defined.  A number of these people felt that this Bill was the vehicle whereby that ought to have been done.  It was not unfair or unreasonable for them to have felt that way, especially in view of the fact that three years ago they were promised a complete reorganisation.  In their innocence these people thought that this Bill was the attempt at reorganisation. I gather from the Minister's interruptions that he has not yet commenced that reorganisation and that possibly there will be a separate Bill in relation to mental handicap some time in the future. I do not think that simply because the psychiatrically ill are being dealt with in relation to powers of detention in one part of the Bill a separate part cannot be introduced to specifically deal with the mentally handicapped.  I criticise the Bill <Col N="202" /> for that fact and I intend tabling amendments in that regard.</P>

As the Minister has undertaken to make some reference to the mentally handicapped in his reply, it would be well if he clarifies the situation. Are the mentally handicapped residential centres operating in some regards outside the existing legal framework?  Have they the powers to detain mentally handicapped people in their institutions?  Have they the power to physically restrain a moderately or severely handicapped person if he decides to walk out on the street?  Have the administration of the mentally handicapped institutions the power to bring a person back?  It is very important that that should be clarified.  It has not been clarified despite many requests by the people operating these centres.  The law in relation to the mentally handicapped and to their civil rights needs to be clearly defined.  This was an ideal vehicle to define the law and the rights in relation to the psychiatrically ill separately within the same legislation.  If it is to be comprehensive it must define the rights and the entitlements under law in relation to the mentally handicapped.</P>
