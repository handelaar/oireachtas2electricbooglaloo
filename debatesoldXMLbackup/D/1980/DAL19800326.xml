    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This section says that the Minister shall apply the moneys standing to the credit of the fund for the purpose of defraying expenditure on projects or schemes that in his opinion will result in the creation of additional employment or the maintenance of existing employment.  I would think that under this section the Minister could apply the moneys contributed by the employers to what was the employment maintenance scheme for the retention of jobs in the textile trade.  I would suggest that there is another problem for Irish industry that is rearing its head at the moment and to which he should immediately apply his mind by spending some of the funds under section 3 of this Bill.  I refer to the rumours of an increase in the bank rate, as it will affect industries here over the coming year.  The Minister should apply further moneys from the fund under this section to subsidise the firms affected by the increased bank rates if this happens.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that with the rate of inflation running at perhaps a minimum of 20 per cent this year, without any extension of the 100 per cent stock relief in previous years which had been cut back to 75 per cent in the 1979 budget and was not increased to 100 per cent in the 1980 budget, many medium-sized businesses giving good employment could be in very serious trouble within a short time, thus adding to the already increasing number of unemployed.  My hands are somewhat tied with regard to the following but there appears to have been an authentic leak yesterday regarding an application by the commercial banks to the Central Bank for an increase in interest rates.  The Minister should step in immediately and see that the increase is not granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be hypothetical by the end of the week and I suggest that the Minister should apply funds for this purpose.  It is ludicrous to suggest that a business could be capitalised for the sum of £25,000; that amount would hardly buy a three-bedroomed semi-detached house at present. An increase in overdraft rates of 2.5 per cent or 3 per cent will certainly mean the bankruptcy of small and medium businesses.  I do not wish to incur the wrath of the Chair but I hold that I am entitled to raise this point under this section.  The Minister must stop this application or agree to subsidise interest rates either from this fund or with money from some other source.  These businesses must be enabled to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has very wide powers under this section to apply the money, half of which will be contributed by the employers and ultimately by employees because whatever the employers pay them will be lessened by the amount they must contribute to this fund, to purposes which in his sole opinion will create employment.  There seems to be no check on whether or not this is the wisest application of the moneys.  All that is necessary for the purposes of the Act to be served is that the Minister believes he is spending money on projects that will create employment. It is not necessary for the purposes of the Act to be served that employment be created as long as the Minister had at the outset the subjective opinion that employment creation would result.  We have had experience of the application of moneys for vaguely defined purposes, which moneys were used in a manner quite different from that intended. I do not have to go back beyond 1970 to recall that to mind.  It behoves us in voting moneys to define the purpose rather more closely and I wonder whether the words &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo; should be deleted.  Should it not be necessary for the purposes of the Act to be served that the expenditure of the money will actually create employment? Should the Minister's subjective opinion be sufficient to satisfy the terms of the <Col N="644" /> Act?  There may be some reason for this provision and if so, the Minister should justify it.  He should explain this mitigation of the severity of the section in regard to the requirement that the money expended should actually create jobs.</P>
      <P>The Minister should remember the prospects for employment creation in agriculture.  I understand that the way the money is to be spent is being agreed at a conference of employers and trade unions, together with the Minister. Agriculture is not represented in this forum, except in so far as some people in agri-business are represented by the unions. Primary production is not represented at all, yet there are considerable opportunities for employment creation in agriculture.  There are many openings for well-paid, skilled jobs, particularly in the dairy industry.  We need to train people for such jobs and the agencies concerned, such as the Farm Apprenticeship Board, are grievously under-funded. Some of this money should be used in the area of agricultural training.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that contributions to the fund will be made by farmers who are employing people and it is only fair that some of the money should go back into agriculture to create other jobs.  There are serious skill shortages in agriculture and I hope the money will be used to relieve the situation.  Perhaps this matter would come under the section, although I have not a formula in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fund should be more strictly related to the creation of productive employment. I understand that the fund is to be used for many purposes which are creative of employment, but are not strictly productive in that they will not lead to other jobs apart from those directly created and therefore do not qualify for the description &ldquo;productive&rdquo; employment. The fund should be oriented much more towards creating jobs which will lead to the autonomous creation of other jobs.  For instance, the creation of a job in a factory leads immediately to the creation of other jobs in downstream processing in servicing the factory and, perhaps, in building.  The creation of a <Col N="645" /> job in some project of a purely amenity nature which is not related to tourism does not lead to the creation of further autonomous jobs.  Since this money will be collected from people who are already in viable jobs and is, in a sense, a tax on existing productive employment, it should be used to create more productive employment.</P>
    <P>I have already argued that in an open economy like ours the creation with public funds of jobs which are not productive does not have the same justification as it might have had in, for instance, the United States in the thirties which had a largely self-sufficient economy where money spent on job creation generated more demand in the economy and contributed to getting out of a recession.  A substantial proportion of money spent on imports and, therefore, in the creation of further jobs outside Ireland.  Therefore, there is a much greater onus on a person engaging in this type of State-supported job creation to ensure that in an open economy such as ours the moneys are used for productive employment and employment of a character which generates other outside employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>During my contribution to the Second Stage debate I asked the Minister to give us a breakdown of the £20 million being provided by way of this Bill but he omitted to give us this information in his reply.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that in addition to the creation of employment the Bill is designed for the maintenance of existing employment, for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities, for the employment of an additional 1,000 people in the public sector, for environmental improvement schemes and for tourist amenities, but I should like the Minister to give us a breakdown in respect of each activity so that we might know how much money is being provided in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear also whether the money being allocated towards the maintenance of existing employment <Col N="646" /> represents more or less than what has been provided in the past for the employment maintenance scheme.  This scheme is of immense importance for the textile, clothing, footwear and tannery industries. In the past the scheme has been responsible for a number of such industries being able to continue, but there are problems in many of these industries as a result of imports from third countries. The tannery industry is in a precarious position.  Because of this situation I should like the Minister to tell us what is the level of support that the industries concerned may expect from this fund.</P>
    <P>In his statement introducing the Second Stage the Minister was explicit regarding a number of projects that would be financed by way of this scheme.  He mentioned in particular the airport at Waterford and also the provision of a dredger to be built by the Ross Company for Waterford Harbour Commissioners. I am a member of that harbour authority and we were led to believe that the provision of a pilot launch was to be included in that project. I should like to assure the Minister that the wish expressed by him that the harbour commissioners put up a satisfactory sum of money to complement the amount coming from this fund is being met.  But I should like to hear whether the pilot launch project is included in the dredger project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Barry's query, the criteria for the allocation of moneys from this fund are fixed by the tripartite committee whose job it is to recommend the projects or schemes that should be aided from the fund.  The criteria have been fixed already.  To that extent, even if I were to agree with what Deputy Barry was proposing in relation to bank interest the Deputy should see immediately that there would be limitations on the freedom of action I would have in respect of this fund in regard to taking such action.  As I indicated on the last occasion, of the total of £20 million available under this fund there has been <Col N="647" /> committed already more than £18 million.  Deputies will be aware that the fund is for a sum not exceeding £20 million.  Therefore on the second leg the remaining resources of the fund would not be suitable for planning in the manner suggested by Deputy Barry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton, perhaps understandably, seems to interpret the insertion of the words &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo; as being intended to give to the Minister sole discretion, discretion which he might or might not use or abuse.  The Deputy seemed to suggest that he was concerned about the possibility of Ministers not being readily accountable.  That is not the purpose of the words referred to.  Indeed, the opposite is the reason.  To leave out the words &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo; would leave the section reading: &ldquo;projects or schemes which will result in the creation of additional employment or the maintenance of existing employment&rdquo;.  That would mean that before any funds could be committed it would be necessary to establish beyond doubt that the moneys concerned would guarantee either the maintenance of existing jobs or the creation of jobs.  In other words, jobs would have to be created before the money could be paid out.  This would mean that whether what was involved was the New Ross dredger or anything else moneys that could be made available immediately would not be made available until work had been realised.  I do not think that is what either Deputy Bruton or anybody else would wish for.</P>
      <P>Almost all of the projects we are talking about are dependent totally on fund support for their implementation and in many cases will not get off the ground unless moneys from the fund are applied as soon as possible.  I trust that this clarification satisfies Deputy Bruton and that he will realise that the application of the formula suggested by him would result in work being delayed, being carried out very cautiously or being abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that if the words &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo; were to be deleted, it would mean that, for instance, where the number <Col N="648" /> of jobs that had been included in the application of that firm, project or whatever&mdash;and there is a wide variety of projects from, say, airport construction, to dredgers, to new jobs in extensions in factories&mdash;had fallen short, they would be obliged to pay back to the fund what they have not achieved.  That possibility might seem to be desirable in any event but to have it there as a rigid obligation I should think is something this House would not want.  It is important to recognise that, in this area, we are dealing with projects that are for the purpose of creating extra jobs, or maintaining jobs, in areas where otherwise they would not be so created or maintained; by definition that almost means where there was a shortage of capital for that purpose and, therefore, assistance is needed.  In other words, where there is either a problem obtaining or its potential we must recognise that the application of rigid criteria which would be the consequence of Deputy Bruton's amendment is not what the fund was set up for and not what the House would wish.</P>
    <P>I hope that explanation will indicate that it is not a matter of conferring authority on the Minister.  Let me stress that it is the Minister who regulates the application of the fund but he is chairman of the committee; the decisions are recommended to him by the tripartite committee, and are acted on by him, as requested by the committee.  It would be a rather strange exercise in understanding, of which this is part, if a Minister were to take unto himself the prerogative to decide how he thinks moneys should be spent out of the fund and to apply them, or to ignore what the partners to the tripartite committee were to decide.  I can assure the House that that is not my intention nor do I think it would be the intention of any Minister. So these words are there for that reason alone, not so that the Minister would enjoy any undue discretion which he might reasonably or unreasonably exercise.</P>
    <P>The question was raised by Deputy Bruton of productive employment. Ideally&mdash;and I have mentioned this not merely in this context but elsewhere&mdash;the <Col N="649" /> jobs to be created would not be just productive in themselves but would generate others by way of spin-off from what is being done in those jobs. On that we are on common ground.  Let that be said without any doubt.  In fact that has been recognised to be the essential theme of my approach as Minister for Finance in relation even to public expenditure allocations, through the IDA, CTT, and so on.  I remain firmly convinced that this is the best guarantee of continuing employment, by investing in infrastructures of one form or another, or productive employment of the kind mentioned by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>But there are other possibilities which were mentioned by Deputy P. Barry the last day.  There are other cases of jobs that are not necessarily productive in the sense that Deputy Bruton has been suggesting.  Obviously, from what he said this morning, he would not regard jobs in the public sector as being productive in that sense.  They are not excluded from the scope of this fund.  For instance, he would not regard environmental improvement works as being productive in that sense, and they are not excluded. He would not regard perhaps the provision of tourist and recreational amenities as productive, and they are not excluded.  In that narrow interpretation I doubt that he would regard sports and recreational facilities of the kind passed by the committee, in principle at least, as productive, and they are not excluded.  It is important to maintain a balance here and that is what the committee have decided to do.  But the determining criteria will be used to support the creation of new jobs which would not be created in the normal course, the maintenance of existing jobs which would otherwise be discontinued or the bringing forward of permanent jobs which otherwise would not be commenced until later.  These are the criteria decided by the standing committee themselves. While paying due regard to the desirability of productive jobs in that sense they have not excluded&mdash;as events will indicate&mdash;jobs in other areas as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked me to give an indication <Col N="650" /> of the areas in which jobs have been provided.  Some of these have not been finally decided and it is important to recognise that discussions go on between the committee and the promoting concerns.  So, subject to that&mdash;and I do not suppose the House wants to take on itself the role of being, shall we say, the analysing committee or go into details in respect of each project&mdash;I can say, for instance, that there are 1,000 jobs in the public sector.  These do not pose problems as far as disclosure of details are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is, for instance, provision of tourist and recreational amenities, 110 man-years, at a cost of £804,000; provision of amenities, modifications and maintenance of Sugar Company buildings and yards, 65 man-years, at a cost of £300,000; project to continue 150 seasonal machine drivers in the employment of Bord na Móna for six months at a cost of £350,000.  Then there are county development team projects for bog development&mdash;touching on something Deputy Bruton was talking about&mdash;150 jobs at a cost of £600,000. Then there is the provision of clusters of small workshops for non-grant-aided industry in the west, 50 jobs at £75,000; environment improvement projects, 250 man-years, at a cost of £1,700,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional environmental improvement projects of a wide variety which involve 250 man-years, the cost of which is £1,700,000.</P>
      <P>The total involved in that package&mdash;and there is also the Department of Education's temporary grant scheme for youth employment, of which the House will be aware, involving 225 man-years at a cost of £1 million &mdash;something of the order of £4,800,000. Not all of those, as yet, are under way. But they had been sanctioned in principle for some time by the committee before I became a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best I can do about the remainder is to give an indication of their nature. For instance, there is the scheme to pay <Col N="651" /> temporary supplementary premiums under the employment incentive scheme; an apprentice training scheme in the engineering industry involving 200 jobs; the airport scheme at Waterford, involving 82 man-years; a training scheme for industrial relations personnel; recruitment of extra staff by Aer Lingus; some archaeological surveys that have been recommended by the committee; recruitment of extra staff by RTE.  Then there is the temporary scheme of assistance in place of the employment maintenance scheme for textiles, clothing and footwear.  Most of those to which I have referred do not involve very considerable expenditure.  For instance, the RTE one represents 35 man-years at a cost of approximately £135,000.  The total under that heading comes to £5 million.  I announced in the House the last day that the scheme for sport and recreational facilities, which has been adopted by the committee but in respect of which each project must now be presented by the Minister of State at the Department of Education, after consultation with Cuspoir, will then be considered and sanctioned by the committee.  The amount involved is £3.5 million.</P>
    <P>The rest of the total is in relation to particular companies and I do not think it would be appropriate for me to give the names of the applications submitted by the FUE, as partners in the committee, who have submitted proposals from their members.  About six of those are under consideration.  I can make one exception, the project for an airport at Sligo which has been suggested by the FUE and a local development team. That is at an advanced stage of consideration and in the near future I hope the tripartite committee will be able to give it a boost.</P>
    <P>If all the applications in respect of the FUE are included the aggregate amount would be £18.3 million, leaving a balance of £1.7 million.  I will give the House as much information as I can but I am sure Deputies would appreciate that, as I have indicated, there are instances in respect of which it would not be appropriate for me to give details <Col N="652" /> because they are still under consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton showed concern about an agricultural training programme.  All State-sponsored bodies were notified of the existence of this fund and were invited to send in applications, but as far as I can ascertain there have not been any applications for grants for the type of scheme suggested by Deputy Bruton. Deputy Deasy referred to the employers' temporary subvention scheme.  It will be simply a substitute for the employment maintenance scheme, at the same rate, £5 per week, for the first six months and £4 per week for the remaining three months.  Under this scheme plans would be prepared by applicant industries indicating the programmes envisaged.  On this occasion it may be possible that some industries might not submit applications and that some participating in the existing scheme might decide not to continue in the new one.  However, as far as possible the new scheme will substitute exactly for the existing scheme.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  I can understand his reluctance to give names and I agree he should not do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet, but perhaps at some future time.  I sympathise with both Deputy Bruton and the Minister on this question of accountability.  We all know of Deputy Bruton's campaign for greater accountability for the expenditure of public funds.  He is concerned that there should not be a repeat, for instance, of the situation involving the £100,000 for Northern aid ten years ago.  Here we are dealing with risk money.  This scheme replaces the employment maintenance scheme and it is involved in the most risky side of industry.  Therefore, it is nearly certain that some investment by <Col N="653" /> the fund will be lost, some possibly for very good reasons.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a figure of £18.3 million investment in terms of man-years. I suppose a man-year means employment for 52 men for a week or one man for 52 weeks.  Employment in such work as the building of the airport will be temporary&mdash;it will involve job experience rather than a job which a person can go into at 18 years of age and retire from at 65 years.  That type of job will not be common in the future anyway because, as the Minister has said, it is likely that the type of livelihood will be changed two or three times during a normal working life.  I can understand the argument about the difficulties of people who cannot get jobs because they have not got experience and who cannot get experience because they have not got jobs.</P>
      <P>I suppose some of the money will be spent in giving experience to people who have not got jobs, and in this respect I strongly urge that an interest be taken in tourist development.  Last year particularly in the outlying areas, tourism was not as good as had been hoped for and many small hotels and guesthouses had to carry themselves through the winter on high interest overdrafts.  I approve of any money spent in trying to attract tourists to remote places but I am not sure if employing 100 students working together four man-years represents the type of experience that will fit them for jobs in other walks of life.</P>
      <P>On the subject of education, I do not understand the form of educational activities on which it is proposed to invest £1 million for 225 man-years.  This roughly would give employment at £4,500 a year, or £80 a week.  If we are speaking about teachers the amount seems very low.</P>

      <P>That is an instance where they build pavilions for sporting <Col N="654" /> clubs and so on.  There does not seem to be any material involved in the £1 million because approximately £80 would be the wages paid to each individual. The labour element in building is 20 per cent to 25 per cent.  The sum does not seem to tot up.  Perhaps the materials are being supplied out of a different fund?  I should like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
      <P>I should not have thought that RTE or Aer Lingus were the kind of people employers should be subsidising.  That should be a matter for the Government.  I think the answer in this case is that this was one area where jobs were being created.  The Minister referred to about half a dozen companies on whose behalf applications were submitted by the FUE.  I presume they are in some difficulty at the moment.</P>

I am disappointed the Minister did not take this opportunity to say something about interest rates and about the damage to industry if they increase. When Deputy O'Donoghue was Minister for Economic Planning and Development he said in the summer or autumn of last year that they had to increase interest rates.  He used that phrase as if he were responsible although I would have thought it was a matter for the Government.  It was not denied afterwards that he used the phrase.  I think the Minister has some kind of influence at least&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know what the Minister said from the able report which my colleague, Deputy Deasy gave to me.  I endorse what Deputy D'Arcy said. There is a point of principle here. Agriculture represents 25 per cent of the work force who are directly involved and another 15 per cent who are indirectly involved.  Agriculture is not represented as a party to what is described as a &ldquo;national&rdquo;&mdash;I put that word in inverted commas&mdash;understanding.  How one can have anything that can truly be described as national which excludes agriculture defeats my understanding.  It is no wonder applications have not come from any of the agricultural agencies in areas in which there is undoubtedly a great demand for increased training and job creation when agriculture is not represented on the body that is concerned. Obviously the people in the committee had a better way of communicating back to their various units the opportunities that existed for applying for money.  When agriculture was excluded they were not privy to the various moneys available in the same way as <Col N="658" /> people outside agriculture.  It is not surprising that they did not apply for the money.</P>
      <P>In the event of any similar fund being created or this fund being prolonged beyond the limit of the projects already committed the Minister should make it his business as the contributor of half of the fund, which is being raised from people who are not necessarily represented in the tripartite discussions, to ensure that other people are aware of the opportunities besides those represented in the tripartite discussions and applications are sought from such people.  The Minister is responsible to the House for the money which is raised in the House and he cannot shrug off his responsibilities to some outside body and say that he has no responsibility.</P>

    <P>In relation to the setting up of this fund the proceeds shall consist of the employers' surcharge and the amount contributed by the Minister.  Section 7 refers to the winding up of the fund and states that the fund shall be wound up when the aggregate expenditure from the fund reaches £20 million.  That ends the Minister's responsibility.  The employer is not paying his 0.35 per cent into the fund directly.  Section 5 states he is paying it under section 6 (1) (b) (ii) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, commencing on 6 April 1980 and this shall be increased by an amount which shall be known and referred to in the Act as the &ldquo;employer's employment surcharge&rdquo;. There is no machinery in the Bill to prevent the Social Welfare Act benefiting by the 0.35 per cent after the employers have contributed their £10 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman advises that the way to confine it to one year is as indicated in subsection (1) where it states:</P>
      <P>The employment contribution payable by an employer under section 6 (1) (b) (ii) ... shall, for the contribution year commencing on the 6th day of April, 1980, be increased ....</P>
      <P>That apparently limits it to that year at 0.35 per cent.  We are in agreement on this matter.  I am going on the advice of the draftsman in this case.  Should the surcharge yield more than £10 million the Government, in consequence of such increase benefiting the Exchequer, the Social Insurance Fund or on the disposal of any credit balance in the Employment Guarantee Fund, would be prepared to take this into consideration in fixing the rate of the employers' social security contribution on a future occasion. The expectation is that the 0.35 per cent will not reach the figure of £10 million rather than exceed it.</P>
      <P>It is important that I should mention here that the commitment from the Exchequer is made as soon as this Bill is passed and that money will be earning interest until such time as the funds are discharged.  Of course, that is available to make up whatever shortfall might arise from the employers' contribution. From the information available to us at this stage the 0.35 per cent is as accurate an estimate as one could make to make up the figure of £10 million.  The Deputy will be aware that the initial suggestion was that it would be 0.5 per cent but it is now estimated that 0.35 per cent will be closer to the estimate.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance is here because I want to back-track on what I said about farmer taxation.  There were specially designed measures in this budget aimed at extracting money from the agricultural community, irrespective of income. These are rates, £46 million, the resource tax £7 million, and levies, not considered as a tax by the Minister but which are considered as tax by the agricultural community, which will yield something in the region of £10 million.  Taking these and other measures into consideration we are speaking of a yield of approximately £100 million.  The Minister cannot say the Government do not have in mind a predetermined yield from the agricultural sector because as I have shown they have.  Approximately £60 million of that money will be extracted from the farming community, irrespective of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never has there been such a lack of <Col N="662" /> confidence in a government shown by those engaged in agriculture.  The measures in this budget did nothing to improve the position; in fact they further aggravated it.  The Minister for Finance will be able to get full information from the Minister for Agriculture about the farmers' refusal to buy the necessary winter feeding for their stock and, more important, about the slow movement of fertilisers and lime.  If there is a serious reduction in the application of fertiliser, that will seriously affect agricultural production.</P>
    <P>When Deputy MacSharry became Minister for Agriculture one of the first things he said was that he hoped to regain the confidence of the agricultural industry.  To date we have seen no sign of any action taken by him, nor have we heard anything from him, to remedy the present situation.  His remarks in this House on the budget were regrettable. He said everybody was selfish and one-sided. Of course, everybody is selfish and one-sided, but it is his duty as Minister for Agriculture to encourage the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Your pious platitudes in your budget speech are also regretted because they appear to be trying to con the farmers. You said a strong and developing agricultural sector was basic to the economic well-being of the nation. Everybody accepts that.  You said that but you did not follow it up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears from the Government's attitude, particularly since 1979, that the agricultural industry no longer play an important role in the economic development of the nation.  The Minister for Finance will quickly find that the contrary is true.  The agricultural community have always played a very important role and it is essential that the tax system should encourage the expansion of <Col N="663" /> agricultural output in the interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of the notional basis of assessment.  Your predecessor, Deputy Colley, in the 1978 budget said that the notional basis of assessment would be in operation for a further three years and that any farmer who declared himself for that assessment would have to stay on it for a three-year period.  You are withdrawing that.</P>

      <P>I must again remind the Deputy to address his remarks to the Chair.  The Deputy might say &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; because when he says &ldquo;you&rdquo; he means the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I do not want to take responsibility for the actions of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Minister for Finance told the farmers they must stay on the notional basis for a three-year period.  The 1980 budget said there would be no notional basis of assessment. These farmers have not kept accounts and the Revenue Commissioners will be asking them for their accounts for 1980.  What accounts are they expected to use?</P>
      <P>In my own county in 1979 the reduction in the application of lime was 30 per cent and the reduction in in-calf heifers 7 per cent.  This is the result of the uncertainty which prevails at present.  Do the Government not realise that agricultural exports amount to £1,100 million per annum? This is a very big help to our balance of payments.  Any reduction in agricultural output will drastically affect exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about what the commercial banks intend to do.  During the latter half of 1978 and the first half of 1979 they played a very poor role in developing the economy.  They shoved out money during that period but now we have a different situation.  They are charging penal interest rates, 18 per cent, and, according to the newspapers, are looking for a further 2½ per cent.  I want the Minister to resist this at all stages because it is their fault that there is such a scarcity of money.  They did not put <Col N="664" /> their money to productive purposes in the last half of 1978 and the first half of 1979.  They should live off the exorbitant profits they made during that period.</P>
    <P>I welcome the foreign borrowing of £25 million made available to the ACC who play a very important role in agriculture.  There are many organisations looking for deposits, such as building societies and commercial banks, and this shortage of money must be affecting the ACC.  I am glad there are a few questions down to the Minister about this issue.  If the ACC need money there is only one place they can borrow it, and that is the foreign market.  If there is any sign of a shortfall the Minister should give the necessary authority and he must carry the Exchange rate.  These people must be in a position to guarantee that the money for agricultural development is available and that money is available in a great number of cases just to carry on.  Agriculture is in great difficulty and it may get worse.  I am not satisfied that the Central Bank in their directions to commercial banks carried out their function in 1979.  They knew the trends in the world money market and I was disappointed that they allowed commercial banks to give out money for whatever purpose in the first half of 1979 and as a result of this there is now a lot of pressure in relation to drawing in money from people who cannot afford to pay.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing has gone out of all proportion.  The Government claim that they built 26,000 houses last year. As far as Wexford County Council are concerned we had a reduction in the number of houses built although we had an increase in money.  This is because since 1976 the cost of houses has doubled.  The position in relation to private building is very serious because people just cannot afford to pay the money that contractors are asking for houses.  The cost of a house in a small scheme in Gorey, which is a small rural town, is £19,000.  A loan of £12,000 from the council plus a loan of £6,000 from the banks would cost a prospective buyer about £60 a week and what salary <Col N="665" /> can afford that type of thing?  Because the cost of houses has escalated rapidly in the past two and a half years the county council list for local authority houses is getting longer and longer because people just cannot afford to build their own houses.  From 1977 the Wexford County Council list has increased by 30 per cent and we certainly do not want any more applicants on it because the number of houses being built is reducing all the time.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent restriction in relation to local authorities is not a good system. County councils have always consisted of a very reasonable body of men who carried out their functions down through the years as far as the ratepaying public were concerned.  We have had this restriction since the 1978 budget.  I cannot understand why we need restrictions and I appeal to the Minister to have a rethink on this.  Wexford County Council take care of a coastline which is 130 miles long and practically 75 miles of that coast is affected by coast erosion. We cannot raise the money even to give protection to people with houses on the coast, and we cannot levy the money. The Board of Works have not given us any support in relation to coast erosion. There is one scheme in Rosslare and the county council are now providing £35,000 per annum for this.  We have no say over it, the Board of Works are completely in charge and it puts us in a very difficult position.</P>

      <P>It is a very important issue and I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Colley, is more reasonable than his predecessor.  The previous Minister only inflamed the situation in Wexford. In any decisions that are taken the Wexford people expect the Wexford County Council to be involved at all levels.</P>
      <P>The outlook for 1980 is that the Government and the Minister for Finance have set themselves a very difficult target.  They have created a situation that they will have to live with.  By the end of next year we can expect a deficit of about £400 million and borrowings will probably be £1,000 million at least.  Worst of all, the inflation rate will be somewhere in the region of 20 per cent.  Any budget that creates further inflation in our present inflationary situation of from 4 to 6 per cent, presents an awful outlook for the future.  There is nothing in the present budget to improve the situation.  The outlook is very poor.  People in small industries will have crippling interest rates, we will have further unemployment and people will not invest in business in the present circumstances.  The Government created the situation by their great manifesto of 1977 which is now defunct and is only fit for a museum.  We are on a disastrous course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate so far has been no different from that of any other year and next year's budget debate will run along the same lines of endorsement and opposition depending on which side of the House the speaker is.  Many Opposition Deputies have privately agreed that this is a good and an extremely honest budget.  However, politics ordains that Opposition speakers must take a critical role.  That is expected but the <Col N="667" /> budget introduced three weeks ago by the Minister was anticipated and even forecast by Opposition politicians and by the media, with a good degree of accuracy. The pre-budget figures had shown that the country was living beyond its means, that foreign borrowings were excessive and that the cost of servicing the national debt was becoming a crippling obstacle to national development. This was very detrimental to progress in other essential areas of national development.</P>
      <P>Experts and commentators had forecast higher taxation on an indirect basis, on tobacco, spirits, fuel, petrol and so on and also predicted that social welfare allowances and PAYE allowances would be improved.  The Taoiseach had already announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that the Government were appointing a special commission to look into the whole structure of taxation.  All these predictions had been made, so one is entitled to be somewhat puzzled by the reaction of the Opposition Deputies who have thrown up their hands in despair and have run out of a vocabulary in describing the terrible effects the budget will have on the economy.  That is what debate is all about in the House.  The political commentators in the media have been very fair in their assessment and have been constructive in their observations.  Any reasonably minded person will understand and accept that if one wishes to distribute extra resources to any one area one must budget for its provision and extract it from another area that can afford to contribute.  No Minister for Finance, irrespective of what Government he may be in, has a magic wand.  There is no bottomless well of resources and the business of running the country can be compared with any ordinary commercial undertaking.  If you wish to expand you must make resources available from some other source.  This is a simple principle that many Opposition Deputies do not yet appear to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1980 budget was responsible, well planned and, above all, a caring budget for those less well off.  It helped considerably <Col N="668" /> the old age pensioners, the needy, the disabled and the blind and it gave worthwhile increases to social welfare recipients, indeed the largest increases in the history of this State. That is as it should be.  The Government would have wished to do even more, if possible, to expand the welfare services. The Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health and Social Welfare was referred to generally as the most caring Minister holding that portfolio.  That reputation was gained because of his approach to those less well off and their needs.  That approach is well and truly stamped on the budget package in so far as social welfare is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey, has, to say the least, been most unfair and indeed destructive in the speech he made to the House on the day following the budget, but one has become accustomed to that type of contribution and each time less gracious, which has not one iota of constructive comment.  During his speech he referred to the Taoiseach's style and operation and went on to liken that style in some way to the budget presented.  I am not quite sure what Deputy Cluskey had in mind, but if that phrase which he used relating to the budget &ldquo;all dressed up and nowhere to go&rdquo; can be applied to any individual I would suggest that the Deputy in question is certainly one of the front runners.  It is clear that the Opposition parties are upset and perturbed because of the constructive, practical and farsighted measures taken in the budget.  It could very well be referred to and termed as an old style, old-fashioned type budget on the grounds that it takes from those leading the good life to give to those in greater need and above all brings some equity into the taxation system.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest handicaps affecting the ability of Opposition Deputies in contributing to the budget debate is their reluctance or inability, I am not sure which, for whatever reason, to put forward any alternative constructive measures or suggestions as to how <Col N="669" /> they would handle the PAYE or taxation system.  That has been very evident since 1977 and certainly the public, the person outside, cannot be blamed for asking the question, if the Opposition Deputies are so anxious to reform the taxation system how would they do so and from where would they take the extra moneys required? Not once have we heard any of the Opposition Deputies say how they would go about bringing this type of equity into taxation.  Both parties have been very vocal in demanding a better deal for the PAYE sector but they have never said how they would go about it or how they would raise the moneys necessary to bring the type of equity into the system that the Government introduced in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>It is the easiest thing in the world when in Opposition to say that we should do this or that and one can be very irresponsible in making such contributions, promises and statements.  I do not think that anybody expected the swift and major moves taken by the Minister to ease the burden in relation to the much publicised PAYE sector and he proved that actions speak louder than words.  The Government have shown by their proposals their very genuine desire to bring equity into the taxation system. There is no doubt that the PAYE sector had a very real grievance and now that has been recognised by action on the part of the Government.  We await with interest the findings in the future of the commission to be appointed to investigate the whole system more deeply and thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I was extremely glad to see the response to the budget proposals by the ICTU and only the very irresponsible or the mavericks will at this time wish to continue the demonstrations, one-day strikes and so on in the so-called pursuance of tax equity.  Nobody will disagree that the biggest single problem that continues to damage our industrial image abroad and at home and our prospects of an economic survival is the strike weapon.  We have said before and must say again that we are putting our economic development and employment <Col N="670" /> prospects for young people in total jeopardy.  The vast majority of our people, our workers, trade union officials and employers, are realistic and fair-minded but too often we are held to ransom by a very small minority who seem to dominate large numbers.  This country has made tremendous advances in recent years and one must ask why a small number seem so determined to wreck the efforts of this development and the great plans to be made for the future.  In disputes everybody suffers but none more so than the weaker sections of our community. In the recent past, during last year, we had so many strikes and disputes that the disabled and the old had difficulty in getting their pensions and in going to collect them.  They were unable to use their free travel and to travel in public transport.  They were left without heat and light.  These are only some of the areas.  The very existence of needy sections of our community was affected. The better off always get by with some inconvenience but not the weaker sections.</P>
    <P>Following the general recognition of the inequities of the PAYE system by the Government in the budget, I hope that all workers will reflect on the damage that strikes cause to the economy.  In negotiating wage increases during the coming year, responsible-minded trade union officials, workers and, indeed, employers should recognise the need for restraint.  As a member of the EMS, we shall come under severe pressure from our European partners to keep our financial structures in reasonably good shape. The more affluent and efficient EEC partners, such as Germany, France, Holland and Belgium, have settled for much lower wage increases, in single figures.  It will be argued, and quite rightly so, that inflation in those countries is also in single figures, but price rises follow wages and this is something that many of our people fail to, or do not want to recognise.  It is however, a fact of life which we have experienced over the past few years and so often seen happen.</P>
    <P>Where there is a dispute, it is vital that the strike weapon should be used only as a last resort.  Claims and grievances <Col N="671" /> should be dealt with in a manner that would avoid disruption of service and, in particular, disruption of the essential services which have a major impact on the welfare and day-to-day convenience of the general public.  Industrial peace is a must if we are to survive as a viable, economically sound nation.  If necessary, the tiny minority who ignore their trade union and are keen to make their own rules, to the detriment of everybody else, must be forced out of any position of responsibility and influence.  A great onus is on all responsible people, trade unionists and employers, to bring about peace and harmony for our future good.</P>
    <P>Unemployment continues to be one of the major problems although since Fianna Fáil came back into Government in 1977 they have done exceptionally well on the jobs front, despite many difficulties over the last two-and-a-half years.  More jobs have been created than ever before in the history of this state. Much money was invested by the Government through the IDA and the Government's decision in the budget to increase by £30 million the state's interest and investment in industrial promotion is to be welcomed.  It is vital that every encouragement be given to private enterprise to increase their efforts in the role of job expansion in the area of productivity.  This has benefits, not only in giving employment and creating more jobs, particularly for young people, but also in the spin-off to other ancillary services and industries and, of course, to the economy itself.</P>
    <P>The IDA have done excellent work in jobs promotion during the years, in attracting industries from abroad, in the face of mounting competition each year from within the EEC.  It is an unfortunate reality that job losses each year reduce considerably the gains due to the increase in new industrial developments over the years.  Apart from that, I have no reason to doubt our ability to reach full employment within the eighties.  The IDA still need the full financial support of the Government to implement their plan to continue to attract foreign investment to this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> We, as a nation, could do a lot more to help home industries and secure more jobs in our factories, by being a little more patriotic in a very simple and painless way.  I refer to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  For years now, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been preaching the theme &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; and a very good campaign has been in operation during the past two or two-and-a-half years.  Its success, however, must be questioned very seriously.  Deputies Ahern and Corish, speaking in the House yesterday on the budget, referred to this aspect and to their disappointment that this campaign had not been more successful and I agree with their views.  To be fair, there are two very important points as far as buying Irish-made goods is concerned, the first is price and the second is quality&mdash;some people might place them in the reverse order.  Amazingly, in many foreign countries the quality of our Irish goods is considered to be world class.  At home, however, their quality is questioned. Perhaps this is a trait in Irish life.  If the consumer would only purchase an additional 3 per cent of Irish goods or spend an additional 3p in the £, an extra 10,000 jobs could be created.  This is an easy opportunity to display a simple form of real patriotism and every effort should be made to encourage people to think well before buying foreign-made goods, if Irish-made goods are available.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of promoting Irish-made goods, of course, is in the hands of the stores and shops.  If these are not stocking a sufficient quantity of Irish-made goods, it is difficult to blame the consumer who wishes to purchase goods, perhaps specific goods, and is very reluctant to return home empty-handed. While shopping for furniture, I was amazed to find, in a leading store in Dublin&mdash;I shall not mention the name&mdash;one Irish-made suite in a display of about 25 or 30.  This is one of the main reasons why the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign has not been completely successful. The particular Irish item on display was something in the region of 25 per cent more expensive than its foreign counterpart.  It did not look attractive <Col N="673" /> and was not typical of Irish made goods available in that category.  Quality wise Irish goods are equal if not superior to anything made abroad and furniture is no exception.  Irish made furniture can match anything coming from other countries.  I queried a salesman regarding the display of Irish goods and was told that they are more expensive and that the quality was not as good.  That is dreadful irresponsibility on the part of any assistant in a leading Irish store and it does nothing to contribute to the success of the Irish goods campaign which could bring about better employment in Irish industry.  The Minister should consider some other means that would encourage or assist stores to stock or promote the sale of Irish goods. Valuable jobs could be achieved in this way.  It would mean a beneficial contribution to our balance of payments and a general improvement in our economy.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about housing during the debate.  Housing continues to be a Government priority and the Estimates published show an increase of 20 per cent over the moneys expended in 1979.  Every Deputy is aware of the dire need for better housing, particularly in the city.  I hope that in future more people will endeavour to provide their own homes.  In this respect it is well to note that Ireland has one of the highest private house ownership populations in the world, as high as 70 to 75 per cent. This amazes many foreign visitors and, while we can take pride in it, we must be aware of how much remains to be done. There is a great problem in Dublin city, which is not surprising in view of the size of the population and the number of people Dublin has to cater for.  It has a population of over 850,000 people.  One of the reasons for the housing shortage in Dublin is the large number of young people who come there to study and take up employment.  More and more of them are going into self-contained flats.  At one time they went to hostels or digs but fashions change.  Consequently many young married couples are finding it extremely difficult to get even flat accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> We are building as many houses this year as any other year but the problem is made more difficult because of the increase in the number of people seeking local authority housing.  Young employed people earn big money and the new budgetary proposals on taxation will increase take home pay considerably. I should like to see more couples striving to buy their own houses. Young people should be encouraged to save for their future.  It is accepted that the cost of housing has soared in the last five or six years but so have incomes. Young people interested in saving for the future are in a fortunate position and have great opportunities.  They can save substantially for the future if the will is there.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the increased taxation on petrol, tobacco and alcohol.  As I mentioned earlier, the Government needed revenue for the purpose of bringing greater equity into taxation, social welfare and to increasing the finance required for additional employment and other essential services. Nobody in their right senses, taking all the circumstances into consideration, would argue that this was not the correct course to take.  We consume more than £1½ million per day in alcohol.  All responsibly minded people have a right to be concerned about the future when one reflects on this kind of figure.  Young people are by far the biggest spenders on drink and any publican will tell you that the big spenders on spirits are young girls.  Price increases on alcohol would be useful, apart from the financial reasons, if they meant that alcohol would be consumed in moderation.  The same arguments apply to tobacco.  I look forward to the Minister for Health, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, closely monitoring the situation in relation to smoking, as the former Minister did in the interests of the health of young people.</P>
    <P>Fuel and energy will become the scarce commodities of the future.  The price rise in petrol will make many people think twice about wastage.  Too many motorists use their cars on trivial <Col N="675" /> journeys.  Some of my own friends, neighbours and acquaintances take their cars to the corner shop and to the church which is about three minutes away.  Motorists use their cars at weekends for unnecessary journeys. They go out for a few hours on Saturdays or Sundays.  We are all entitled to do these things but we must pay for the wastage.  Opposition speakers shed a lot of crocodile tears for motorists.  In this respect memories are short.  In 1976 the then Minister for Finance put on an additional 15p on a gallon of petrol.  At that time that represented a much larger percentage increase than the increases stated in this year's budget.  Shortly before that motor taxation had been increased drastically by 24 per cent to 50 per cent depending on the size of the car. Let us not have criticism from Fine Gael or Labour.  Motorists will not fall for that.</P>
    <P>Economic planning is a hazardous occupation these days due to the ever-increasing costs of energy.  Every user of energy, and particularly the motorist, can play their part in conservation.  It is time to tackle this problem.  If the budget proposals contribute to a slowing down in the use of petrol it will have achieved a good service for all.</P>
    <P>In his budget statement the Minister announced the introduction by the Revenue Commissioners of a mobile tax advisory service.  This looks very well on paper, but I would suggest to the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners that they should have a long hard look at the PR image of the existing information services available to taxpayers in the Dublin district.  As a Dáil Deputy I get excellent assistance in any contacts I have with the various tax offices. However, I am told frequently by many taxpayers who have queries of one sort or another that they do not receive a very civil response, in their view, from many of our paid servants.  I would hope that type of attitude would apply to a very small minority only of our State employees.</P>
    <P>The public are paying for this service and they are entitled to be treated in a <Col N="676" /> normal, courteous, businesslike way. Such complaints, I might add, are usually levelled against younger civil servants. Perhaps it is caused by immaturity and it takes a little time for them to mature and to get their feet back on the ground.  However, where this discourtesy takes place, the public should be encouraged to refer their complaints to a higher officer, or for other staff investigation. The emphasis being put on the new advisory service will, I hope, make all inquiry officers think about the service they must give to the public.</P>
    <P>For some years now much has been threatened about those who abuse our social welfare benefits and evade paying their rightful share of tax.  The Minister told us that over the past few years there has been a significant increase in the number of cases where proceedings were initiated successfully.  It has been recognised that, through legitimate means and otherwise, many businessmen and private persons, particularly professional people, have not paid sufficient tax.  As far as non-payment through legitimate means is concerned, it should be easy enough for the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister to close any loopholes which may exist and to eliminate areas of tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>In the case of the professional person, whether he or she be a member of the medical, technical or services professions, or whatever, I advocated previously that a person paying for services should have some tax allowance extended to him or her.  I can appreciate the administrative difficulties could be overcome but surely in these days of computerisation such difficulties could be overcome easily and without much cost, with the additional spin-off in collecting additional taxes and bringing further equity into our taxation code.  In this city alone there are thousands of people, perhaps, offering various services to the public. One has only to look at the advertisements under the heading &ldquo;Useful Services&rdquo; in the evening papers to see advertisements by back-lane car salesmen, motor repairers, panel beaters and furniture makers.  The list is long and varied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> The abuse of our social welfare system is an area which causes much frustration and bitterness.  I am delighted that the Minister for Social Welfare is implementing further measures to control and detect abuses of unemployment and disability schemes.  It is felt that many of the self-employed tradesmen who are making big money and evading income tax are also drawing unemployment benefit and all the other welfare benefits which are available.  If that is so, it is a downright disgrace and an injustice to be punished with the full rigours of the law.  Every effort must be made by the Department to stamp out these abuses and, in doing so, no expense should be spared.</P>
    <P>The budget has been accepted as constructive and progressive.  The challenge is there for people to work harder and show more initiative.  Let us all hope that this challenge will be taken up in a constructive way and that the proposals before us will prove to be a stepping stone to greater progress for all and the improvement of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been debating the budget for a month now. The public debate on the budget has gone on far longer because, for many weeks before its introduction, we had a great build up to what was suggested would be a doomsday situation.  A climate was created deliberately to ensure that people feared February 27 when the Minister would present his budget to the House.  That is nothing new.  People have become quite used to it.  It was the habit of previous Fianna Fáil Governments to create that kind of an atmosphere: things were not going well and the budget to be presented by the Minister would hurt everyone irrespective of their walk of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This atmosphere was created deliberately so than when the budget was presented people would say&mdash;and I am sure many did say on this as on previous occasions&mdash;that it was not so bad after all.  This gave a bit of a lift to the Minister and to the Government.  People <Col N="678" /> have had time to see what exactly is in the budget and various sections of the community have realised gradually that budget day was not such a good day for the country.  Many people may say: &ldquo;It did not hurt me directly&rdquo; but, as they perused the various statements and figures presented, they realised that nationally it was not a good budget. There were those who were hurt by what was presented on budget day, some more than others.  Other sections of the community benefited a little and some, one might say, a lot.</P>
    <P>Overall it is now generally accepted that the budget presented by the Minister for Finance on February 27 was intended just to tide over.  The Taoiseach, speaking in the House some time later, confirmed that.  On 5 March he told the House, as reported in the Official Report at column 1320, that:</P>
    <P>As the year unfolds, developments will be watched and assessed.  We shall maintain our supervision over the economy during the year because we regard this as a dangerous, difficult and crucial year from the point of view of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>That statement, and a number of others made later, has confirmed the view of many that we are likely to have another budget this year.  I do not believe the Minister, when presenting the budget, was convinced that he was budgeting for a full 12 months.  Perhaps the Government were hoping for some financial injection from the EEC, or some other source, or were expecting an oil find which would distract people from the effects of a second budget.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Government did not face up to their responsibilities.  They took off on a number of weekend holidays and went to Barrettstown but, having considered the budget, one wonders what went on there.  Those weekend sessions were made to look serious but I should like to know if they were merely political gimmicks.  Were they used to bring together the Cabinet to overcome the differences and personality clashes which existed between the various Ministers?  The budget does not give the <Col N="679" /> impression that they were serious &ldquo;think-ins&rdquo;. In my view those sessions were used to patch up political differences rather than seriously to consider the nation's affairs and the budget that was presented in February.</P>
    <P>When the budget was presented I wonder if the Government were sure that its provisions would be put into effect. When I first entered politics I learned that once a Government made a decision they did not go back on it.  A Minister who was being forced to change his mind would resign rather than yield. Even though certain decisions were greeted with protests and great opposition people accepted that Government decisions were final.  The Minister for Finance announced a resource tax in the budget and later the Taoiseach told us that it would be a short-term expedient. If that was his view the Minister for Finance should have made the House aware of it when introducing the budget. A lot of thought goes into the preparation of the budget speech and more time is devoted to it than to any other Government statement.  Therefore, it is hard to understand why, if it was the Government's intention to make the resource tax a short-term expedient, that information was not given to the House by the Minister on 27 February.  In the course of his budget statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The resource tax on all holdings of £70 RV and over at a rate of £3.50 per £ RV will be introduced from 6 April 1980.  It had been intended that this tax would have been payable in one instalment on 1 September.  But, in line with what I have already indicated in relation to income tax, I propose that this date should be 1 October. Marginal relief will apply to holdings between £70 RV and £79 RV.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give any thought to the possible reaction to that statement. Last year we had the imposition&mdash;or was it?&mdash;of the 2 per cent levy and this year we have had the climb down on the resource tax.  The action of <Col N="680" /> the Government can be compared to the antics of the three card trick player at sports fixtures, &ldquo;Now you see it; now you don't&rdquo;.  On 27 February there was a resource tax but on 5 March there was a paring down of it.  Why was it necessary for the Taoiseach to say in this House on that day:</P>
    <P>We do not pretend that the package contained in this budget is perfect.  In particular, we look on the resource tax as a short-term expedient.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the motorists who were so severely affected by the increase of 100 per cent in the road tax, the increase in the driving licence fee and the 20p on the gallon of petrol had mounted a similar campaign to the one the farmers mounted would the Taoiseach have come in here on 5 March and given some relief and some ease to them.  He probably could not do it in relation to petrol because it was increased immediately but he could have reduced the 100 per cent increase in the road tax or indeed made it a short-term operation.</P>
    <P>When was the decision made that the resource tax would be a short-term expedient? When did the Government look on it as a short-term expedient?  It certainly was not before the budget was presented on 27 February.  I do not think that the decision was made on that night when there was what seemed like an uproar from the farming community because perhaps the Government thought that their protest might fizzle out or it might just last for the papers the following day and then ease off.  If it was made on that night then I believe the next member of the Cabinet who was to speak in this House would have made a similar statement to that of the Taoiseach on 5 March.  That was his successor in the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, who spoke on the day after the budget.</P>
    <P>He is another Cabinet member who either had not yet been told that a tax which caused such an uproar in the country as announced by the Minister the previous day was being tapered down, because if the decision had been made or if it had been due to an oversight <Col N="681" /> that it was not in the Minister's brief then I am sure that would have been corrected on 28 February, the day following the budget, if not by the Government certainly by Deputy Woods who spoke on the budget in this House the next day.  Some may say that he represents a city constituency and might not be interested in farmer taxation or how the farmers were screaming at the tax which the Minister for Finance was proposing.  I will grant that.  But on 4 March, the day before the Taoiseach spoke on the budget in this House, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Power, spoke and the same excuse cannot be made for him because he represents a rural constituency and I am quite sure that if there had been a Government decision prior to 4 March that Minister would have been very pleased to announce it in this House; it would have been welcome news to many people in his constituency.</P>
    <P>I wonder was this a Government decision at all or was it just a decision of the Taoiseach.  It would not be the first time that we had a serious and major public announcement by a Fianna Fáil Minister which was not a Government decision and which the Government were stuck with.  I am convinced that if this had been discussed at Cabinet level and if it had been a Cabinet decision then the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry could not possibly have made his budget speech in this House on 4 March without referring to it.  If one were to look at it from the point of view of pleasing one's constituents it would have meant more to Deputy Power than it would have meant to the Taoiseach.  So what I am saying is that the Taoiseach, on reflection and having considered the amount of uproar there was in the country with regard to the resource tax, decided before coming into this House that he would have to ease the blow.  What a great pity that the motorists did not take the same line as the farmers.  Is it not a great pity that the motorists did not organise meetings up and down the country and make the same fuss about the increase of 20p on the gallon of <Col N="682" /> petrol, the 100 per cent increase in the road tax, the 200 per cent increase in the driving licence fee?  Did they not have as much reason to create as great a fuss as the farming community?  Would they have got the same hearing if they had done this?  Would the Taoiseach have made the same decision in relation to them before coming in to deliver his budget speech as he did in relation to the farmers?</P>
    <P>I suppose we are getting used to this day by day Government.  As I said, it is like the three card trick, &ldquo;Now you see it, now you don't&rdquo;.  We know what happened last year when the 2 per cent levy was imposed.  Do the Government know where they are going or are they governing from day to day?  The people are beginning to think less and less of us in this House because we cannot rely on the Government to think out their programme, announce it to the country and then stand by it.  Many decisions are made which on reflection are seen to be the wrong decisions and pressure groups are likely to have an effect on the voting strength of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If pressure is strong enough we have a reversal of the decision made a day, a week or a month before.</P>
    <P>The imposition of 20p on the price of a gallon of petrol is having a far greater effect than was anticipated even by the correspondents who covered the budget. It was not considered at the time to be a great increase but it is having an effect on the price of many commodities.  We have now reached the stage, never known before, of having to pay for milk deliveries, although this was the case before the budget.  This charge will now be increased because of the additional cost of taking the pint of milk to our doorsteps.</P>
    <P>Many excuses are made for the increase in the price of petrol, and Deputy Morley referred to the need to conserve energy and reduce our dependence on oil imports.  However, I do not believe that was the Government's intention when imposing this 20p increase.  If it were <Col N="683" /> why did they increase the driving licence from £2 to £3 and the registration fee for cars from £5 to £10?  Many people consider that there has been a re-imposition of road tax.  If nobody says anything about the 100 per cent increase in the registration fee this year, is it not likely that there will be a similar increase next year which would bring the charge to £20, the amount paid on many cars before road tax was abolished?  The registration fee for motor cycles has been increased by 400 per cent from £1 to £5.</P>
    <P>What headline is set for anyone feeling the pinch and thinking of increasing prices?  The cue was taken up by others involved in the provision of services for motorists.  Many people, mainly shop assistants, had been accustomed to use the parking area between Henry Street and Parnell Street where the charge was 50p per day.  On the Monday after the budget, following the cue given by the Minister for Finance, the charge was increased by over 250 per cent to £1.80 per day.  The Minister also continued his policy in regard to cheques, the cost of which was increased by 200 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot complain when those supplying services or producing commodities look for increases because they themselves have set the headlines.  Again I must ask whether the Government know where they are going.  Have they a plan or are they governing from week to week?  What has happened to the efforts made by the Government when they first took office to provide employment?  Has this been forgotten about?  There was very little reference to it in the Minister's speech and what reference there was could not be taken seriously because the Government are apparently engaged in other things, in sorting out other difficulties, perhaps internal difficulties.  Not only have the Government lost their drive to reduce the number of unemployed, but they are adding to the list.  I say this because some firms have complained to me of their being unable to collect money due to them from Government Departments.  One small firm, for instance, <Col N="684" /> who provide office equipment to the Department of Justice have not been able to collect on a bill for £9,000 despite having sent many reminders to the Department and having phoned on a number of occasions.  That is a deplorable situation.  Apparently, Government Departments cannot be relied on any longer to pay their bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a specific matter of money owned by a Department to a specific individual but this is a matter that should be raised either by way of question to the Minister concerned or during the debate on the Estimate for his Department.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that. If instructions have issued from the various Ministers to the civil servants that they are not to settle accounts, employment must be affected in so far as many private firms are concerned.  Some instances have been brought to my notice of where firms are very hard pushed but are not able to collect from Government Departments the amounts due to them.  Is this the Government's contribution to employment?  It is very regrettable that small firms depending on weekly or monthly turnover must now wait many months before being paid by Government Departments.  Up to now one could be sure of being paid by the Government for goods supplied or for services rendered but apparently that is no longer the case.  There is not much point in paying a small firm after they have had to lay off staff because of the delay in being paid what was due to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should hope that the next Minister to intervene in this debate would either confirm or deny that the position is as I have outlined.  Is this action on the part of the Government an example of the corrective measures that the Taoiseach spoke of in terms of slowing down the flow of money?  If so, there is a rough time <Col N="686" /> ahead because if the Government cannot pay their bills, what hope is there for the rest of us?</P>
    <P>In his contribution to this debate the Taoiseach said that the budget has the distinctive stamp of a caring social philosophy and that it has been accepted with relief and gratitude by a wide section of the community.  He suggested that critics of the Government might have been gracious enough to acknowledge the achievements in the social sphere.  These words were from the man who, as Minister for Social Welfare, had the opportunity of giving us an example of that caring social philosophy.  Unfortunately, we have not had any evidence of any such philosophy in the two-and-a-half years since Fianna Fáil's return to office.  All we have had from them has been a desperate effort to keep the less well off sections at the level at which Fianna Fáil found them.  Fianna Fáil have been making desperate efforts to maintain that standard of living since they assumed office. Indeed it is true to say that the present standard of living of those people is far below what it was when Fianna Fáil took over.</P>
    <P>During the present Taoiseach's term in the Department of Social Welfare not one piece of legislation was put through this House to improve or extend our social services.  There has been no expansion whatever of any social service during Fianna Fáil's term since 1977, and heaven knows there is ample scope for extension of many of the services being provided.  Let us equate that with our &ldquo;caring, social philosophy&rdquo;, to quote the Taoiseach.  Let us compare that record with that of the National Coalition during their four and a half years in office when, for the first time in the history of the State, recognition was given to the plight of the single woman who reached the age of 58 and who was given an allowance.  That allowance constituted an expansion of the social services.  For the first time also prisoner's wives and children obtained an allowance, as did also unmarried mothers.  Those also constituted an extension of the social services. Then there was granted also an extra <Col N="687" /> £1 per week for pensioners living alone, being a recognition of their plight, never thought of by Fianna Fáil despite the fact that they had been in Government for many years.  Also under the National Coalition Government the means test was eased.  Probably the most significant of all was the reduction of the qualifying age for old age pension from 70 to 66.  Despite the fact that we, when in Government, had committed ourselves to reducing that age still further, there has been no move by Fianna Fáil to bring it down to 65, as had been expected. That did not happen.  Why? Because there was a change of Government. This is the caring, social philosophy of the former Minister for Health and Social Welfare, of the present Taoiseach and his Government.</P>
    <P>For the first time also under the National Coalition Government in related benefit was introduced in 1974.  If one compares what was done by the National Coalition Government in respect of the improvement and extension of the social services with the lack of any activity in that area since Fianna Fáil assumed office, one would be forgiven for thinking that it was a member of the National Coalition Government who uttered the words of the present Taoiseach in this House on 5 March: &ldquo;I believe that this budget carries the distinctive stamp of our caring, social philosophy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What has it done?  The only indication given of a caring, social philosophy of either the Taoiseach or Fianna Fáil was the reduction in the qualifying age for a blind pension from 21 to 18.  Not even that was done by the present Taoiseach when Minister for Social Welfare.  The only indication we have been given of this caring, social philosophy is that reduction of three years in the qualifying age for a blind pension and the increase in the amount of blind persons' earnings to be disregarded when assessing their means for pension purposes.</P>

      <P>Sixty-four other ranks <Col N="696" /> left the Naval Service on termination of their engagement during 1979.  Forty-six of these left on termination of their initial four-year engagement.  This is a normal feature of military life.</P>
      <P>Ninety-three other ranks were discharged by purchase, 35 of whom were recruits.  These personnel left the service for a variety of reasons, life in the service did not suit them, family circumstances, or offers of other employment.</P>

    <P>By Council decision of 25 July 1978 the European Economic Community agreed to participate in financing the expenditure incurred by Denmark and Ireland on fishery protection measures. As far as this country was concerned, the Council decided to reimburse up to <Col N="708" /> 46 million European units of account (IR£31,173,000 approximately) of eligible expenditure to meet short to medium term requirements in the period 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1982.</P>
    <P>A programme to cover the inspection and surveillance requirements in the exclusive waters of the State in the period up to the end of 1982 was drawn up and submitted to the European Commission in December 1978.  The total estimated cost of the programme was £60.5 million made up as follows:</P>

    <P>The Commission's reaction to this programme, received in June 1979, was that expenditure to the extent of 61,127,890 European units of account (IR £41,425,000 approximately) comprising all the capital outlay I have just mentioned, the cost of leasing ships and aircraft up to 31 December 1979 and the cost of operating the leased ships and aircraft up to 31 December 1979, was eligible for financial participation by the Community subject to the limit of 46 million European units of account specified in the original Council decision.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the reimbursement by the Commission of expenditure on maritime surveillance measures provide that claims be submitted by the end of June of the year following that covered by the claim.  My Department's claim for 1977 and 1978 totalled IR £7,883,571 and this amount was paid in full by the Commission in December 1979.  A claim in respect of expenditure during 1979 is at present being prepared and is estimated to cost IR £5.262 million.</P>

      <P>Policy in relation to the promotion of exports by small firms was outlined in the Government's White Paper <i>Programme for National Development 1978-1981,</i> which was published in January 1979.  As therein stated, the bulk of Córas Tráchtála's market advisory and incentive grant support will continue to be allocated towards increasing <Col N="713" /> the number of small and medium-sized firms entering and developing export markets.</P>
      <P>For the current year the allocation of grant-in-aid to Córas Tráchtála has been increased substantially, underlining the Government's determination to give additional encouragement to exporters particularly at a time when international trading conditions are difficult.  On 6 March last plans were announced for the introduction of an intensified marketing and promotional drive for 1980 by Córas Tráchtála.  These plans take special cognisance of the need to service the exporting requirements of small enterprises. They include the setting up of a new small firms export service and the adaptation of a number of existing services to increase their benefits to small firms.</P>

      <P>The assertion made by the Deputy in the first instance is not correct.  The orientation of CTT for a good many years has been towards smaller firms but that orientation has been accentuated this year as a result of the new plans and policy in that respect which I announced earlier this month.  In practice many of the larger firms are much better able to manage their export affairs than the smaller ones.  That is one of the reasons why CTT have to devote a large proportion of their efforts and resources towards helping smaller firms who need a great deal more assistance than larger, more experienced ones.</P>

      <P>Despite its continuing efforts during the past five years, the Industrial Development Authority have not been able to secure a suitable site at Bantry for industrial development. Negotiations had reached an advanced stage with three would-be vendors but could not be successfully concluded because of planning appeal difficulties in one case and the eventual withdrawal of the offer to sell in the two others. However, as I informed the Deputy in October of last year, discussions are at an advanced stage for the purchase of land near Bantry on which it would be proposed to build the 12,000 square feet cluster of small factory units originally planned for Seskin.  I understand that the Authority are also investigating the possibility of purchasing a further site in the area but that these investigations are at a very early stage.</P>

      <P>The scheme is a selective one designed to meet estimated hotel bedroom needs over the next few years both as to number and location.  The scheme does not, therefore, create a general entitlement like previous schemes.  All of the applications have to be evaluated against these criteria and processed in their own right.

      <P>There has not been any excessive delay because the closing date was only at the end of November.  It was necessary to examine in detail the applications and make decisions on them. It was also necessary to await the amount of the allocation for this year. Bord Fáilte were informed about this a month or six weeks ago.  I am aware that if it had been possible to make an announcement before now some hotel proprietors might have started work.  I regret if they are delayed a few weeks in that respect.

      <P>To date, I have referred two proposed mergers or takeovers to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices for investigation by him.  The first reference involved two enterprises involved in the retail sale of grocery goods and I allowed this to proceed after considering the examiner's report of his investigation.  As regards the second case which involved two enterprises engaged in the concrete products sector, I received the examiner's report on 19 March and this is now receiving urgent attention.</P>
      <P>The first report, required under section 6 of the Act, will be represented to each House of the Oireachtas shortly.  In order to make available to the Houses the most-up-to-date information I propose that this report should cover the period up to the end of 1979.

      <P>Will the Minister ask the National Prices Commission, in view of the fact that this year farmers face increases in prices of their inputs of the <Col N="719" /> range of 25 per cent and the fact that their real incomes for this year, taking interest payments into account, will fall by 25 per cent, to have another look at the system of monitoring which applies with a view to the introduction of detailed price control, if necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The monitoring system is kept constantly under review but it is worth pointing out that the present system was introduced in 1973 primarily as a result of requests from the farming organisations to discontinue strict or detailed price control.  The view of the organisations was that strict price control had the effect of eliminating competition in the field of feedstuffs and also in terms of fertilisers.  In fact, the consuming farmer, they felt, would be better off without strict control.  That view appears to have been borne out by experience since.  The monitoring does not indicate that the price levels being charged for these commodities are now any higher than they would be if the older type of strict control had been continued in respect of them.</P>

While the Minister's statement about the history of control and decontrol is correct I should like to know if the <Col N="720" /> Minister is aware that there appears to be second thinking on this subject and that it is felt it would be better to have animal feed controlled and not allowed to fluctuate on the market?</P>

It is only fair to say that on the face of it it seems unlikely that it would because if the commission felt that there was any undue profiteering or lack of competition among those selling these feedstuffs they would have advised me by now to reintroduce the older form of control.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to something which I feel very strongly about and that is that when social welfare recipients are given increases in the budget it is many weeks before the increases are implemented whereas increases on petrol or cigarettes or spirits or anything else are implemented overnight.  In relation to pay increases it is the accepted practice now that they are retrospective, but here the weaker sections of the community, the less well off sections who depend far more on their allowances than most of us, are still held in the balance waiting for their increases and many of them do not even live to receive them.  The period between the time the budget is announced in this House and the time they receive their increases is far too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bring in, over the next 12 months, some legislation to broaden our social services because we are lagging behind most if not all of our European partners in caring for the aged, the infirm, the disabled, the blind and widows.  On 6 April, more than a month after budget day, they will receive a 25 per cent increase.  This does <Col N="745" /> not in any way compensate them for the massive price increases over the last 12 months or since last August or September when the £1 increase was given. When the budget was announced in this House this may have seemed a handsome increase.  In normal circumstances 25 per cent could be considered to be a handsome increase for those on social welfare, but when one looks at the price record over the preceding 12 months one realises that this increase does not go near bringing the standard of living of these people to what it was when Fianna Fáil took office in June 1977.</P>
    <P>Worse than that, only a few hours after the announcement of the budget the price of bottled gas went up by 77p and ESB charges also rose.  In the budget the Minister announced increases in the price of spirits and the pint.  Many old age pensioners whom I know, live for their half glass or pint every day and it can be seriously considered as medicine for them.  If they were denied it many of them would have reason to call on their GP more often.  The cost of living for these people has been increased.  The Minister has not yet given the 25 per cent increase to the old age pensioners, the blind and the disabled and he should consider how much of the proposed increase has already been taken from them due to increases in food prices and other commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is é mo thuairim <Col N="746" /> gurb é an ghné is suntasaí den cháinaisnéis atá á plé againn anois le cúpla seachtain agus seans go mbeidh á plé fós go ceann cúpla seachtain eile ná an tsár-iarracht atá déanta an uair seo le cothrom na féinne a thabhairt do chuile dhuine.  Tá méaduithe móra tugtha do dhaoine atá ag brath go hiomlán ar liúntais leasa shóisialaigh.  Ag an am céanna tá laghdú maith déanta, sílim, ar an gcáin ioncaim a bhéas le n-íoc acu siúd atá ag ioc PAYE.  Go áithrid tá laghdú an-mhór déanta ar an gcáin ioncaim a bhéas le níoc ag lánúineacha pósta.</P>
      <P>Ar ndóigh, leis na rudaí seo a bheith á dtabhairt ar an dtaobh amháin, ni raibh aon dul as ach roinnt cánacha indireacha a ardú.  Ach sílim go bhfuil sé intuigthe ag chuile dhuine gur cánacha iad seo gur féidir leis an bpobal féin smacht áithrid a chur orthu sa mhéid go mbaineann na cánacha sin le hearraí a cheannaíonn daoine dá rogha féin, mar a déarfá.  Is earraí cuid acu gur minic gur fearr do dhaoine bheith dá n-uireasa.</P>
      <P>Gan amhras bhi fadhbanna móra airgeadais le réiteach ag an Rialtas nuair a shocraídear ar an gcáinaisnéis seo a chur le chéile, ach silim féin go bhfuil éacht déanta ag an Aire Airgeadais chun na deacrachtaí sin a shárú.  Ba mhaith liom díriú anois go háithrid ar na nithe den cháin fhaisnéis a thagann faoi mo scáth féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an-áthas orm gur éirigh leis an Rialtas beagnach £19 milliún a chur ar fáil domsa i mbliana le caitheamh ar an Ghaeltacht agus ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge, agus is meadú é sin de £1 mhilliún ar chaitheachas na bliana seo caite.  Tá glan-iomlán £10.835 milliún ar fáil i mbliana do Roinn na Gaeltachta i Leabhar na Meastachán do 1980. Meadú beagnach £1 mhilliún ar sholáthar na bliana 1979 ach méadú £2½ milliún ar chaiteachas na bliana seo caite.  Baineann na priomh-mhéaduithe sin ar fad le Údaras na Gaeltachta, idir chaiteachas reatha agus chaiteachas caipitil ar dheontais.  Baineann siad freisin le ciste na Gaeilge as a dtugtar deontais do Bhord na Gaeilge agus do na heagrais dheonacha eile a fhaigheann <Col N="747" /> deontais ó mo Roinn, agus baineann sé le scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha. Níl laghdú in aon fhó-mhírcheann sa Vóta ach amháin sa cheann a bhaineann le costais an toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i mí na Nollag seo caite.</P>
    <P>Is é bunú Údarás na Gaeltachta, sílim, ó thús na bliana seo faoi Acht a ritheadh anuraidh an chéim is tábhachtaí ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de le fada an lá.  Is don Teachta Donncha Ó Gallchóir, iar-Aire na Gaeltachta, atá an chreidiúint ar fad ag dul go bhfuil Údarás daonlathach Ghaeltachta againn anois.

      <P>Bhímís ag éisteacht le ceithre bliana go leith anuas le Aire Ghaeltachta a tháinig as an bpairtí atá sa bhFreasúra anois.  Bhí sé ag caint taobh istigh den Teach seo agus taobh amuigh de faoi Údáras na Gaeltachta a chur ar bun agus thug sé gealltanais do Theachtaí Dála ar an dtaobh seo den Teach agus thug sé gealltanais do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ó cheann ceann na tíre go gcuirfí Údarás Ghaeltachta ar bun.  Chuaigh sé chomh fada leis an scéal go ndúirt sé dúinn go raibh sé ag cur an Bhille os comhair an Rialtais. Ach nuair a tháinig Fianna Fáil i gcumhacht i 1977 ní raibh aon Bhille dá shórt reidh ná fiú amháin á scrúdú.  An t-aon chaint a bhí ar súil ag an Aire ná an cineál údarás Ghaeltachta a bhí i gceist aige, údarás nach mbeadh aon ghuth toghchánaíochta ag muintir na Gaeltachta ann.  Is é sin údarás go dtoghfadh agus go n-ainmneodh an tAire na baill chuige.  Bhí an tAire Donncha Ó Gallchobhair sásta le cúnamh agus le tacaiocht Rialtais Fhianna Fáil lui isteach ar an obair agus brú ar aghaidh le Bille a chur os ár gcomhair agus le rialacháin chasta a <Col N="748" /> raibh baint acu leis an mBille sin.  Nuair a ceapadh mé féin mar Aire Ghaeltachta bhí na socruithe uile déanta don toghchán, toghchán a thug deis do phobal na Gaeltachta furmhór do chomhaltaí an Údaráis sin a thoghadh iad féin go daonlathach.  Ní raibh fágtha ach orduithe a dhéanamh ag cur Gaeltarra Éireann ar ceal agus ag cur Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun.  Thug mise an chéad chruinniú den Údarás sin le chéile ar an 4 Eanáir agus luaigh mé ag an am sin roinnt pointí tábhachtacha leis na baill a bhí ar an Údarás.  Mheabhraigh mé dóibh go raibh rudaí airithe leagtha síos go soiléir cúig bhliain déag ó shin sa Pháipéar Bán um Athbheocan na Gaeilge.  Séard a bhí ansin ná:</P>
      <P>Is é aidhm atá le beartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht gníomhaíochtaí oiriúnach a eacnamaíochta a spreagadh agus a fhairsingiú agus cúrsaí sóisialacha a fheabhsú ionas go mbeidh deiseanna leormhaithe ag na daoine a chónaíonn sa Ghaeltacht agus arb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáthurlabhra, chun fostaíocht shocrach a fháil agus caighdeán réasúnta mhaireachtála a bheith acu.</P>
      <P>Is de réir an bheartais sin a tugadh cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra Éireann mar a bhí acu sa bhliain 1965, le tionscail fhéiliúnacha a fhorbairt ar fud na Gaeltachtaí ar fad.  Sin iad na cumhachtaí céanna a raibh Gaeltarra Éireann ag feidhmiú futhu go dtí deireadh na bliana seo caite go dtí gur bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Mheabhraigh mé ag an gcéad chruinniú freisin do na comhaltaí gur ar an Údarás atáimid ag brath le lánfhostaíocht a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí, do chainteoirí Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí, chomh luath agus is féidir é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá na cumhachtaí ar fad a bhí ag Gaeltarra agus tuilleadh, fiú amháin, nach iad san Acht a chuir Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun.  Tá béim níos láidre ná riamh ar an nGaeilge san Acht nua.  Baineann alt 8 le feidhmeanna an Údaráis agus is mar seo a leanas a thosnaíonn sé:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Déanfaidh an tÚdarás caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar <Col N="749" /> phriomh-mhéan chumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh agus cinnteoidh sé gurb í Gaeilge a usáidfear a mhéid is féidir nuair a bheidh a fheidhmeanna á gcomhlíonadh aige agus thar a cheann.</P>
    <P>Is féidir an príomh-chuspóir atá againn a chur in aon abairtin amháin&mdash;cainnteoiri Gaeilge a choinneáil sa Ghaeltacht agus iad a choinneáil ag labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá dualgas orainn uile muintir na Gaeltachta a spreagadh i dtreo go mbeidh fonn orthu cloí leis an nGaeilge agus í a chur chun cinn &ldquo;mar phríomh-mhéan cumarsáide&rdquo; mar atá luaite san Acht.  Baineann sé sin go háirithe leis na ceanntracha Gaeltachta oifigiúil nach bhfuil morán Gaeilge á labhairt iontu faoí láthair.  Ó tharla go bhfuil taithí faoi leith ag formhór na gcomhaltaí ar an Údarás ar fhadhbanna den chinéal sin, ba mhaíth liomsa go dtiocfadh an tUdarás ar aghaidh le moltaí fiúntacha.</P>
    <P>Anois nuair a bhí toghchán an Údaráis ar siúl bhí daoine áirithe i gceanntracha ar fud na tíre ag rá gur ceart ceanntracha sa Ghaeltacht oifigiúil nach bhfuil morán Gaeilge á labhairt ansan a chur amach as an nGaeltacht. Ní shílimse gur cheart go mbeadh polasaí mar sin ag Rialtais ar bith.</P>

      <P>Nuair a cuireadh isteach orm, bhi mé ag caint faoi dhream a dúirt i rith aimsir thoghchán an Udaráis gur ceart don Ghaeltacht cúngú agus bhí mé ag rá nach gcreidim fhéin gur ceart go mbeadh sé sin mar pholasaí ag aon Rialtas, gur ceart dúinn a bheith ag cur ina luí ar dhaoine den tsórt sin gur cheart dóibh feabhas a chur ar a gcaighdeán Gaeilge agus Gaeilge a úsáid mar mheán cumar-sáide sa mbaile.  Má tá daoine a cheapann nó a chreideann gur cheart an Ghealtacht a chúngú, is mó an feall nár sheasadar fhéin mar iarrthóirí os comhair an phobail go bhfeicfimid céard a déarfadh an pobal leo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chuir mé in iúl do na comhaltaí go <Col N="752" /> raibh socraithe ann faoi alt 10 den Acht go bhféadfaí an tÚdarás cúnamh airgid a thabhairt dá rogha fhéin suas go dtí £½ mhilliún mar scaireanna nó mar dheontais do shócmhainní in aon chás áirithe le tionscail nó scéim thairgiúil fhostaíochta a bhúnú, a fhorbairt nó a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar chuid den ghnáth chóras beidh foireann an Údaráis i gcomhairle le haon Roinn nó eagras Stáit a bhfuil saineolas maidir le tionscail de shaghas ar leith le fáil.  Tá an uasteorann sin, £½ mhilliún, i bhfad níos airde ná mar a bhí i bhfeidhm do dheontais amháin ó Ghaeltarra dá rogha féin.  Os a cionn sin is féidir leis an Údarás teacht chugam féin má tá cúnamh airgid ag teastáil uathu.  Tá scéim beartaithe freisin faoina bhféad-faidh siad a ráthú go n-aisíocfar iasachtaí.  Ní raibh aon chumhacht den tsórt sin ag Gaeltarra.  Ní bheidh aon cheangal, agus sílim go bhfuil sé seo thar a bheith tábhachtach, ar an Údarás glacadh le scaireanna i gcomhlacht ar bith mar a bhí ag baint le Gaeltarra.  Ach béifear ag súil go bhféacfar chuige gurb í an Ghaeilge a bheidh i réim sna tionscail sin nach mbeidh scaireanna acu iontu.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag glacadh leis go dtógfaidh sé tamall ar chomhaltaí an Údaráis léargas cruinn a fháil ar a bhfuil ar siúl faoina scáth, is é sin, na himeachtaí atá aistrithe chucu ó Ghaeltarra.  Is ar na cúrsaí sin atá siad ag breathnú agus ag díriú a n-aire faoi láthair agus má éirionn leo moltaí a dhéanamh chun feabhas a chur orthu, is amhlaidh is fearr é.  Nuair a bheidh a gcumas léirithe acu, má thagann siad ar an tuairim gur fearr a d'fhéadfaidís leas na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ach cumhachtaí de bhreis ar a bhfuil acu faoi láthair a fháil uainn, is féidir leo iarratas dá réir a chur ar aghaidh chugam agus breithneoidh mé go báúil é le súil go bhféadfainn é a chur os comhair an Rialtais agus go mbeadh an Rialtas sásta gur chóir dóibh ordú cuí a dhéanamh faoi alt 9 den Acht.  Mar chabhair dom, ar ndóigh, caithfidh an tÚdarás a chinntiú go leagfaidh siad amach an cás go cruinn agus go maith, go dtaispeánfaidh siad dom na lochtanna atá sa chóras faoi láthair, an bealach len <Col N="753" /> iad a laigheas, an costas a bheadh i gceist ann agus rudaí den tsórt sin.</P>
    <P>Tá fhíos agam go bhfuil na comhaltaí a toghadh ar an Údarás agus na comhaltaí a hainmníodh ar an Údarás ag obair go dian.  Bhuail mé leo uilig an mhí seo chaite agus bím ag caint go minic lena bhformhór.  Tuigim go bhfuil socraithe acu anois trí lá a chaitheamh i dteannta a chéil i mo dháil cheantair féin i nGaeltacht Chonamara go luath le díriú ar na fadhbanna, ar na deacrachtaí, sna tionscail ar fud na Gaeltachtaí ar fad a phlé agus go ndéanfar níos soiléire do chomhaltaí an Údaráis an obair chruinn theicniúil ag foireann lán aimseartha an Údaráis.  Tá mé cinnte go gcuideoidh sé seo go mór leo siúd nach raibh, b'fhéidir, ag plé le cúrsaí tionsclaíochta taobh istigh nó taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá £13.35 milliúin á chur ar fáil don Údarás i mbliana, is é sin £1.45 mhilliún do chaiteachas reatha agus £11.9 mhilliúin do chaiteachas caipitil ar dheontais do shócmhainni agus d'oiliúint, ar mhonarchana le ligean ar cíos agus ar scaireanna i gcomhlachtaí.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua ag an am seo&mdash;agus tá sé luaite agam le gairid go poiblí&mdash;go mbeidh cuid de Roinn na Gaeltachta ag aistriú go dtí na Forbacha an samhradh seo.  Tá oifig nua tógtha in aice le Ard-oifig Údarás na Gaeltachta agus beidh na teileafóin agus an troscán á gcur isteach inti go luath.  Beidh suas le 30 oifigeach le n-aistriú go dtí an oifig agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé seo freastal níos fearr ó thaobh mo Roinnse dhe ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar fad agus ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta san iarthar go háirithe.  Tá mé cinnte go gcinnteoidh sé go mbeidh ceangal i bhfad níos dlúithe ná riamh ag foireann Roinn na Gaeltachta le muintir na Gaeltachta, leo siúd lena bhfuil siad ag plé.</P>
    <P>Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeidh tithe maithe ar fud na Gaeltachta agus, mar chabhair chun tithe nua a thógáil nó feabhas a chur ar thithe atá ann cheana, tá £800,000 á sholáthar i mbliana, is é sin beagnach <Col N="754" /> £100,000 de bhreis ar chaiteachas na bliana 1979.  Tá méaduithe móra déanta ar dheontais faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht sa bhliain 1977, agus d'éirigh linn méaduithe den tsórt sin a dhéanamh mar gur tugadh líon mhaith airgid do Roinn na Gaeltachta sna meastacháin sa bhliain 1977, 1978, 1979 agus arís i 1980.  Anois, cuir i gcás, tá £2,000 ar fáil le teach nua a thógáil, deontas £750 le teach a fheabhsú, £360 do chóras uisce agus £300 do chóras séarachais, £600 do sheomra folctha le huisce te, £170 le córas uisce nó séarachais a fheabhsú, £810 chun trí sheomra do chuairteoiri a chur le do theach agus £600 chun sealla saoire a thógáil.  Tá na deontais sin ar fáil d'iarrthóiri cáilithe gan aird ar an teacht isteach a bhíonn acu.  Tá deontais níos mó fós ar fáil do mhuintir na n-oileán Gaeltachta amach ón gcósta, 50 faoin gcéad breise anuas ar na deontais atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>Bíonn cúnamh fial le fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta freisin le feabhas a chur ar na saoráidí éagsúla atá ar fáil ar fud na Gaeltachta, cur i gcás, do bhóithre áise agus bóithre portaigh, do scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais, do mhuiroibreacha, d'fhoirgnimh mar choláisti Gaeilge agus hallaí, do chóiríocht saoire, áiseanna chaitheamh aimsire agus mar sin de.  Tugtar cabhair mhór do na comharchumainn agus bíonn tairbhe le fáil ag feirmeoirí aonaracha faoí scéim na bplásán féaraigh.  Tá tábhacht an-mhór leis na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin seo uilig.  Tá an-dul chun cinn déanta ag roinnt de na comharchumann Gaeltachta ó thosnaigh Roinn na Gaeltachta suas le 15 bliana nó mar sin ó shin ag spreagedh an phobail le comharchumainn a bhunú.  Is gleas iontach comharchumann éifeachtach agus is maith is fiú cuidiú leis.</P>
    <P>Tá £1,350,000 á chur ar fáil i mbliana do scéimeanna cultúrtha, sin meadú mór i gcomórtas le caiteachas na bliana seo caite.  Is é an ceann is tábhachtaí de na scéimeanna seo ná scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge faoina n-íocann Roinn na Gaeltachta deontais díreach le mná tí cáilithe sa Ghaeltacht a mbíonn <Col N="755" /> foghlaimeoirí ag fanacht acu.</P>
    <P>Déanadh árdú ar an deontas i mbliana go dtí £1.85 an lá.  Tá sé tábhachtach smaoineamh nach amháin i mo Roinnse a fhaigeann na mná tí cúnamh. Faigheann siad freisin é ó lucht eagraithe na gcoláistí, pé acu daoine aonracha iad nó coistí nó comharchumainn.  Timpeall 18,000 daltaí a thug aghaidh ar an Ghaeltacht an samhradh seo caite agus táimid ag súil go mbeidh uimhir i bhfad níos mó ann i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh comharchumann, nó lucht eagraithe sna coláistí samhraidh siúráilte de go mbeidh comh-oibriú ceart ar fáil idir na múinteoirí, na mná tí agus na foghlaimeoirí. Ach é sin a bheith déanta, tá mé sásta go rachaidh an scéim seo go mór chun leasa don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge.  Is iontach an deis do ghasúir as taobh amuigh de cheanntair Ghaeltachta dul isteach san Ghaeltacht ar feadh mí, fanacht i dtithe a labhartar an Ghaeilge iontu an t-am ar fad.  Tugann sé deis dóibh teacht isteach ar bhlas agus liofacht nádúrtha na Gaeilge tar éis tamaill a chaitheamh i gcaidreamh le cainteoiri dúchais ina dtithe cónaithe féin.</P>
    <P>Is iad cúrsai cultúrtha, cúrsaí teangan, atá i gceist sna coláistí samhraidh seo agus nior mhaith liomsa go mbeadh aon duine in aon Ghaeltacht sa tír ag breathnú ar choláistí samhraidh mar shórt tionscail le airgead a chur ina chuid pócaí fhéin.  Tá roinnt imni ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, sna Gaeltachtaí ar fad, go bhfuil roinnt de lucht eagraithe na gcoláistí nach gcuireann srian ceart nó nach mbionn caighdeán sách ard Ghaeilge ag muinteoirí agus ag daltaí a mbionn ag freastal ar na coláistí seo, agus bíonn imni orm féin.  Feicim le gairid gur labhair fear atá i gceannas comharchumann i mo dháil-cheantar féin go láidir faoi chaigdeán Ghaeilge sna coláistí samhraidh.  Tá súil agam go gcinnteofar go mbeidh caighdeán maith Ghaeilge sna coláistí seo.</P>
    <P>Bionn deontais le fáil ag an nuachtáin seachtainiúil <i>Inniu,</i> agus ag na treimhseacháin <i>An tUltach, Agus, Comhar, Feasta, Deirdre, An Sagart, An <Col N="756" /> Timire, An Gael Óg, Tir na nÓg</i> agus irisí áitiúla Ghaeltachta.  Is cúis áthais dom agus do go leor de mhuintir na Gaeltachta é go bhfuil socruithe déanta chun an nuachtán seachtainiúil <i>Amárach</i> a fhoilsiú aris.  Bionn deontais ann freisin do ghnáthnuachtáin Bhéarla a fhoilsionn nuacht reatha i nGaeilge ach ní bhfaightear iarratais ach ó chúpla ceann seachtainiúil.</P>
    <P>Cuiditear freisin le heagrais chultúrtha, cuir i gcás, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann leis an obair mhór atá ar bun acu leis an cultúr agus an ceol agus rinncí traidisiúnta a chaomhnú, agus silim gur mar sin is fearr é.  Mar chabhair chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ar fud na tire tá £1,250,000 á chur ar fáil i Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta i mbliana, méadú £140,000 ar sholáthar na bliana 1979.  As sin iocfar deontais le Bord na Gaeilge agus le heagrais eile Ghaeilge a mbeidh cláir mhaithe oibre leagtha amach agus le cur i bhfeidhm acu.  Tá roinnt mhaith eagrais i gceist agus níl mé chun iad a lua.</P>
    <P>Bionn teacht isteach éigin dá gcuid féin ag an gcuid is mó de na heagrais sin ach chomh maith le Bord na Gaeilge tá Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge ag brath go hiomlán ar airgead an Stáit. Labhair mé le deanai le Bord na Gaeilge agus leis na comhaltaí ann agus mhol mé gur cheart doibh féin agus don Chomhdháil suí sios agus díospóireacht a bheith acu faoin obair a bhí ar siul ag an dá eagraiocht.  Mhol mé nár cheart go mbeadh treasnaiocht, go ndéanfadh an dá eagraiocht socrú a chuirfeadh a gcuid oibre ar bhunús ceart.  Sílim go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach nach mbeadh airgead Stáit dá thabhairt do dhá eagraíocht leis an obair céanna a dhéanamh.  Tá siad le dul chun caint faoi agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh siad ag teacht chugamsa le moltaí a dhéanamh le go bhfeadfaí comh-ordú nios fearr a dheanamh ar na heagrais Ghaeilge, orthu fhein go háirithe agus ansin b'fhéidir ar na heagrais Ghaeilge eile.</P>
    <P>Níl dabht agam faoi ach go go bhfuil a gcion fein dá dhéanamh ag na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge le blianta fada anuas agus tá mé ag súil go leanfaidh na <Col N="757" /> daoine breátha seo atá ag plé leis na heagrais seo ag deanamh a gcion féin ar son na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>De bhreis ar an soláthar i gCiste na Gaeilge, chuir an tAire Airgeadais £100,000 eile in áirithe dom sa cháinaisnéis mar chúnamh speisialta chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Is é atá beartaithe againn ná an pobal, a bhfuil bá chomh mór sin acu leis an teanga, a spreagadh le beart dearfa dá réir a dhéanamh agus níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt.  Le sin a dhéanamh cheapamar gur cheart airgead speisialta a chur ar fáil le gné nó gníomh amháin mór a dhéanamh i mbliana le cúnamh a thabhairt an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt ar fud na tíre.  Cheapamar clár tarraingteach a chur ar an dteilifís agus ar an raidió.  Agus ba mhaith liomsa agus leis an Aire Airgeadais dá bhféadfaí socruithe a dhéanamh chun tús a chur leis an fomhar seo chugainn.  Táim i gcomhairle le RTE agus le Bord na Gaeilge faoi sin agus beidh mé ag tóraíocht cunaimh ó na heagrais oideachais ar fud na tíre agus ó eagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge le súil go bhféadfar daoine a thabhairt le chéile ina mbuíonta beaga ar fud na tíre chun an leas is fearr a bhaint as an gcúrsa sin.</P>
    <P>Ach ba mhaith liom a rá anseo go bhfuil súil agam nach gceapann RTE nó Bord na Gaeilge go dtabharfaidh mise mar Aire na Gaeltachta an £100,000 iomlán isteach ina láimh féin agus cead acu an clár a chur ar bun.  Sílim gur cheart go mbeadh na meán chumharsáide sa tír seo ag déanamh a gcion féin le fairplay a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus muintir na hÉireann ina bhfuil suim dáirire acu sa Ghaeilge.  Ní cheapaim gur cheart go mbeadh aon eagras Stáit ag súil go bhfaighidís airgead díreach ón Roinn Airgeadais leis an ghnó nó an gníomh ar cuireadh ar bun iad an chéad lá ariamh a dhéanamh go héifeachteach.  Ba cheart go mbeadh sé sin á dhéanamh gan chúnamh Stáit ar leith ar bith.</P>
    <P>I 1972 mhol Comhairle na Gaeilge go gcuirfí leathnú na Gaeilge chuig bord reachtúil ar leith, Bord na Gaeilge.  Bunaíodh <Col N="758" /> an bord sin <i>ad hoc</i> i 1975 agus arís fágadh faoi Rialtas Fhianna Fáil é a chur ar bhun reachtúil.  Rinne siad é sin i Mí na Samhna 1978.  Tá sé leagtha síos san Acht go ndéanfaidh Bord na Gaeilge an Ghaeilge, agus go háirithe a husáid mar theanga beo, mar ghnáth mheán chumarsáide, a chur chun cinn.  Ag an am céanna sílim nach féidir le duine ar bith a rá gur ar an mBord amháin a bheidh an teanga ag brath, mar tá sé leagtha síos go soiléir san Acht go leanfaidh Roinn Stáit agus comhlachtaí eile comhlíonadh na bhfeidhmeanna a bhfuil siad freagrach astu.</P>
    <P>Tá formhór na hoibre réitigh déanta ag an mbord agus tá dóchas agam go bhféadfar dul chun cinn fiúntach a dhéanamh as seo amach.  Is féidir a rá go bhfuil an bord féin ag díriú ar na gnéithe agus na réimsí éagsúla oibre chun an Gaeilge a leathadh ar fud na tíre.  Tá úsáid na Gaeilge ag brath go príomdha ar chumas na ndaoine chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus tá an cumas sin ag brath cuid mhór ar mhúinteoirí na tíre agus ar an gcaoi a múintear an Ghaeilge sna scoileanna agus tá an fhreagracht ghinearálta faoi sin ag titim ar ghualainní an Aire Oideachais agus an Roinn Oideachais.  Mar sin tá spéis ar leith ag an mbord i mbeartas na Roinne Oideachais i ndáil le teagaisc na Gaeilge sna scoileanna ar a n-áirítear inniúlacht agus dúthracht na múinteoirí, fiúntas an teagaisc, na modhanna múinte a bhfuilimid ag baint úsáid astú, na háiseanna teagaisc atá ann agus an lion téacsleabhar i nGaeilge atá ar fáil.  Tá comhchoiste bunaithe idir an bord agus an Roinn Oideachais le cúram ar leith a dhéanamh den ghné thábhachtach seo de chur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Aithneofar, ar ndóigh, gur rud fadtéarmach atá i gceist ansin agus nach bhféadfaí bheith ag súil go mbeadh toradh den tsórt sin le feiceáil abair i mbliana nó an chéad bhliain eile. Aithneofar, freisin, gur gnó atá bunúsach amach is amach d'obair éifeachtach labhairt na Gaeilge.  Mura mbeidh an Ghaeilge á múineadh go héifeachtach, dúthrachtach do pháistí na tire seo, ní bheidh an teanga acu mar ghlúin fhásta ar ball, agus gan cumas sa <Col N="759" /> teanga a bheith ag daoine a mbeidh a dtionchar le haireachtáil de réir a chéile i ngach uile ghné de shaol na tíre, cén chaoi a bhféadfaí a beith ag súil le labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn? Tá an fhadhb chomh bunúsach sin gur ceart go n-aithneoimid uilig tábhacht na ceiste nuair atá a fuascailt fós againn. Dá dtiocfadh glúin iomlán amach chugainn as na scoileanna gan aon Ghaeilge a bheith á cur á labhairt go bheagán Gaeilge a bheith acu, tá faitíos orm gur fánach domsa mar Aire nó don Roinn nó don bhord nó do dhuine ar bith sa Teach seo a bheith ag iarraidh cur ina luí ar na daoine gur ceart don Ghaeilge a bheith á cur á labhairt go forleathan sa tír.  Beidh mise i gcomhairle leis an Aire Airgeadais chun a chinntiú go mbeidh comhoibriú iomlán le fáil ag Bord na Gaeilge ó mo Roinn.</P>
    <P>Bunaíodh an comhchoiste réamh-scolaíochta i 1978 le spéis san oideachas tri Ghaeilge a spreagadh i dtuismitheoirí, agus tá forbairt shuntasach déanta cheana féin i mbunú naíonraí Gaeilge, mar a thugtar orthu, ar fud na tíre. Cuireadh seimineáir fhairsinge oiliúna agus seirbhísí tacaíochta eile ar fáil do stiúrthóirí an chomhchoiste.  Foilsíodh lámhleabhar agus rinneadh léiriú de naíonra i mbun oibre.  Tá córas deontais ann a chuireann trealamh réamhscolaíochta ar fáil agus leathnaíodh an ghluaiseacht ar fud na Gaeltachta le cabhair ó Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ní shílim go mbeidh an tairbhe iomlán le baint as na naíonraí Gaeilge seo go dtí go bhféadfar leanúint den chineál céanna oideachais trí Ghaeilge nó béim speisialta ar Ghaeilge sna bunscoileanna, sna hardscoileanna agus ag an tríú leibhéal fiú, agus tá roinnt mhaith de sin á dhéanamh faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhféadfadh na meán chumarsáide cabhair a thabhairt do dhaoine atá i mbun naíonraí Ghaeltacha.  Sílim go bhféadfaí é sin a dhéanamh le clár speisialta oideachasúil a chur ar fáil do pháistí trí Ghaeilge go luath sa tráthnóna.</P>
    <P>Tá tionscal le úsáid na teanga a leathnú ar cheann de mhór-fheidhmeanna <Col N="760" /> Bhord na Gaeilge agus roghnaíodh sé cheantar speisialta le gairid agus socraíodh ar iarracht faoi leith a dhéanamh leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn iontu le cabhair ón bpobal áitiúil atá ina gcónaí iontu, le cabhair ó na heagraíochtaí uilig a bhí ag feidhmiú iontu idir eagraíochtaí agus eagrais Ghaeilge.  Bhí chuile dhuine ag súil go bhféadfaí mór-iarracht chomhorduíthe pobail a spreagadh ar an mbealach sin ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Bunaíodh coiste chomhdhéanta do shaineolaithe, réimsí soceolaíochta, teangeolaíochta, riaracháin agus staitisticí chun an obair sin a stiúradh.  Tá foireann ag an mbord anois i láthair na huaire i gcuid de na ceantracha sin agus tá dóchas agam go bhféadfar dul chun cinn a dhéanamh iontu de réir a chéile.  Siad na ceantair a roghnaíodh ná Caisleán an Bharraigh, Contae Mhuigh Eo, Mainistir na Féile agus an ceantar máguaird i gContae Luimní, an Daingean i gContae Chiarraí, Cois Móire sna Déise, Contae Phort Láirge, Dúiche Chronáin, ceantair a chuimsionn Cluain Dolcháin i mBaile Átha Cliath agus comhluadar bunaithe ar Scoil Lorcáin i gceantair Bhaile na Manach i gContae Baile Átha Cliath. Cuireadh dianchúrsaí Ghaeilge ar siúl sna ceantair sin i gcomhar le Gael Linn go mbeidh líon réasúnta daoine ar fáil a mbeidh labhairt na teanga ar a dtoil acu féin agus rud a chabhróidh go mór le leathadh na Gaeilge sna ceantair sin.</P>
    <P>Tá iarrachtaí speisialta á dhéanamh freisin le haghaidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Sílim mura bhfuilimid sásta, mar Theachtaí Dála nó mar Sheanadóirí thar ceann an phobail, ár n-iarracht féin a dhéanamh anseo sa Teach le úsáid a bhaint as an oiread Gaeilge agus atá againn nó feabhas a chur ar an nGaeilge atá againn cheana fhéin, nó Gaeilge a fhoghlaim mura bhfuil aon Ghaeilge againn, nach féidir linn a bheith ag súil nó a chur in a luí ar phobal na tíre gur cheart dóibh sin beart a dhéanamh dá réir.</P>
    <P>Bhí súil againn go bhféadfaimid comhoibriú a fháil óna páirtithe polaitíochta ar fad ach, faraoir, ní raibh an comhoibriú sin ar fáil agus shocraímear sin mar Rialtas agus mar <Col N="761" /> an páirtí is mó sa Teach seo dul ar aghaidh linn féin agus tá sé sin ar siúl ann.  Tá ranganna Gaeilge ar siúl uair sa tseachtain d'ár gcuid Teachtaí Dála agus d'ár gcuid Seanadóirí agus freastal mhór ar na ranganna sin agus suim ar leith ag Teachtaí Dála agus ag Seanadóirí nach bhfuil cumas na Gaeilge nó nach bhfuil Gaeilge líofa acu feabhas a chur ar a gcaighdeán agus an teanga a úsáid taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh de Thithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Tá iarrachtaí speisialta á ndéanamh freisin i measc na n-údarás áitiúil agus b'fhéidir gur féidir é sin a dhéanamh i bhfad níos fearr i go leor eagrais eile nó i go leor údaráis phríomháideacha ar fud na tíre mar go bhfuil go leor de na baill ag na húdaráis áitiúla seo a bhfuil líofacht cainte acu féin agus má tá is cóir an líofacht sin a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor oibre, mar a dúirt mé, ar siúl ag an mbord le aire an phobail a dhíriú ar an méid is féidir leo a dhéanamh le cuidiú le leathadh na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Is cuid fíor-thábhachtach é d'ár gcultúr agus d'ár dtraidisiúin go leanfadh muintir na hÉireann le tacaíocht a thabhairt don chultúr agus don tseod is luachmhaire atá againn.  Sílim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh éifeacht leis an obair atá ar siúl, is é sin, má tá sé ar siúl ag Bord na Gaeilge nó ag mo Roinnse nó ag eagrais dheonacha Gaeilge ar fud na tíre, nó fiú amháin ag daoine pearsanta nó pobal beag i gceantracha beaga atá scaipthe in áiteanna áirithe ar fud na tíre.  Tá sé tábhachtach go dtabharfaí seans do phobal na tíre úsáid a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá acu agus tá sé tábhachtach freisin, má theastaíonn ón bpobal an gnó pearsanta a dhéanamh le haon Roinn Stáit nó le haon eagras áitiúil nó le haon údarás áitiúil go mbeadh an seans sin acu.  Sílim go bhfuil athrú mór tagtha ar mheon daoine in údaráis in eagrais éagsúla ar fud na tire agus go dtuigeann siad anois gur bunphrionsabal é gur cheart go mbeadh an seans sin ann do mhuintir na hÉireann a gnó a dhéanamh trí Bhéarla nó trí Ghaeilge nó trí an teanga is toil leo a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> Is i gcomhar leis na hinstitiúidí ar fad agus na húdaráis ar fad atá ann a shláneofar an teanga agus tá súil agamsa go mbeidh comhoibriú le fáil go fíal uathu sin ar fad.  Tá áit, mar a dúirt mé, ar leith ag na heagrais Ghaeilge iad féin san obair atá ar síúl ag mo Roinnse agus tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh comhoibriú iomlán idir mo Roinn agus na heagrais, pé acu ab iad Bord na Gaeilge, Údarás na Gaeltachta nó na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge atá ag obair le slánú na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Dá bhféadfaí na hiarrachtaí ar fad atá ar siúl acu sin a chomhordú i dtreo go bhféadfaí tarraingt in aon mhór-iarracht amháin, ba mhór an chabhair é don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht, agus tá mé cinnte go bhféadfaí dul chun cinn níos luaithe a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé tá caidreamh ar siúl le tamall le RTE le cur leis an méid Gaeilge a chloisimid agus a fheiceann muid ar an raidio agus ar an teilifís.  Rinneadh teangmháil le Ranna Stáit ar súil go bhféadfadh aon saoránach a thógródh é sin a dhéanamh a chuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Cuirfear dlús leis an obair sin de réir a chéile.  Bhí áthas orm gur shocraigh Cathaoirleach RTE go mbeadh téipeadáin áirthe de chláracha trí mhéan na Gaeilge ar an dteilifís.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag súil nach gceapfadh éinne gurb é sin an uasteorainn ar chláracha Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom gur ag dul i dtreise agus ag dul i méid a bheadh na téipeadáin sin de réir mar a thiocfadh feabhas ar obair RTE ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.</P>
    <P>Táthar i gcomhairle le féilte áitiúla áirithe le gnéithe a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge a neartú ina gcuid imeachtaí. Táthar i ndlúth-theagmháil freisin le Glór na nGael le súil go bhféadfar a n-iarrachtaí ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge a threisiú agus le hOireachtas na Gaeilge i leith cabhrú le himeachtaí áirithe dá gcuid.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé agus mé ag tosú mo chuid cainte anseo, tá obair an-mhor le déanamh agus ó thaobh na Gaeilge dhe, ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh gan cabhair agus comhoibriú i gcónaí ó Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ó na heagrais ar fud na <Col N="763" /> tíre atá ag plé le Gaeilge.  Act ní mór comhoibriú a bheith ar fáil freisin ó eagrais eile nach bhfuil ag plé le Gaeilge, nó ó údaráis a bhfuil go leor plé acu i gnóthaí na ndaoine ar fud na tíre.  Ní mór dúinn cinntiú go gcuirfear an Ghaeilge agus an cultúr ar bhun seasta sa tír seo ionas, faoi dheireadh na hochtóidí, más féidir, go mbeidh chuile dhuine sa tír nó a bhformhór in ann an dá theanga a úsáid agus go mbeidh Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, tá áthas orm nár tháinig aon laghdú ar an scior airgid atá ar fáil againn i mbliana sna Meastacháin do Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Ó tharla go dtáinig ardú ann, taispeánann sé an spéis atá ag an Rialtas i gcúrsaí na teanga agus na Gaeltachta, agus taispeánann sé freisin go bhfuilimid dáiríre faoi chaomhnú na teanga.  San gcáinaisnéis shocraigh an tAire Airgeadais agus an Rialtas go ndéanfaidís, chomh fada agus a d'fhéadfaí, cothrom na féinne a thabhairt do chuile dhuine, agus sílim gur tugadh ardú i bhfad níos mó ná mar a bhí ag súil ag na ceardchumainn nó ag éinne taobh istigh den Theach seo agus ag a lán taobh amuigh de ar na liúntais leasa shóisialaigh a bhí ar fáil ag bain-treacha, do shean daoine, do pháistí agus daoine eile ar fud na tíre.  Tá sé sin tábhachtach mar tá ardú áirithe tagtha ar phraghsanna.  Nuair a chuirnhnímid ar an phraghas atá anois ar ola agus an oiread tionscal ar fud na tíre atá ag brath ar ola, níl aon dabht go gcaithfí ardú dá réir a chur ar phraghsanna na nithe a bhfuil gá leo chuile lá.  Shocraigh an Rialtas go dtabharfaí faoiseamh ar cháin ioncaim dóibh siúd a bhí ag íoc b'fhéidir níos mó ná mar ba cheart dóibh, nó mar cheap siad féin go mba cheart dóibh bheith ag íoc.  Deineadh é sin nuair a shocraíodh ar faoiseamh mhór a thabhairt do lánúin phósta ina gcuid cáin ioncaim.</P>
    <P>Shocraigh an Rialtas seo, mar chuile Rialtas Fhianna Fáil a bhí i gcumhacht, gur cheart aire speisialta a thabhairt dóibh siúd ins an íseal aicme agus cinntiú go dtabharfaí liúntais leasa shóisialaigh do dhaoine den tsórt sin a chuirfeadh ar a gcumas maireachtáil <Col N="764" /> agus a bheith chomh maith as agus a bhí daoine roimh an cháinaisnéis.  I mbliana tá tús curtha ar obair mhór an Rialtais cinntiú go dtabharfar cothrom na féinne do chuile dhuine agus go mbeidh isliú ar an méid airgid atá dá fháil ar iasacht as taobh amuigh den tír.</P>
    <P>Tá an Rialtas ag cinntiú go mbeidh airgead ar fáil ón Roinn Airgeadais chun go mbeidh an IDA, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus na heagrais atá ag plé go díreach le fostaíocht, in ann é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá sé tábhachtach tuiscint gurb é sin bunphrionsabal Fhianna Fáil a thugamar ár n-aghaidh air agus muid ag plé na cáinaisnéise ag tús na bliana seo.  Tá sé soiléir ón gcáinaisnéis go bhfuil an t-airgead atá riachtanach ar fáil le fostaíocht a chur chun cinn, agus tá sé tábhachtach nach mbeidh aon laghdú ar sin.  Má theastaíonn uainn an tír a choinneáil ar an mbóthar ceart, ár ndaoine a thabhairt abhaile a raibh gá orthu go dtí seo dul thar lear, tá sé tábhachtach go mbeidh dóthain airgid ann le haghaidh na heagrais atá ag plé le fostaíocht.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta atá thiar sa gcathaoir ansin nár cheart domsa bheith ag plé le gnothaí Roinn na Gaeltachta nó na Gaeltachta nó Údarás na Gaeltachta istigh anseo.  Sílim go dtaispeánann sé an cineál meoin atá ag páirtí Fhine Gael i leith na Gaeilge agus i leith na Gaeltachta.  Is cosúil go gceapann an pairtí sin agus a gcomráidí a bhí leo sa gComhrialtas nach bhfuil gá ar bith an Ghaeilge nó an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú mar nach bhfuil mórán bainte acu le gnóthaí eacnamaíochta na tíre.</P>
    <P>Má tá cultúr dúchais agus ár dteanga féin againn agus muna gcinnteoimid go bhfuil fostaíocht ar fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta ní bheidh seans acu a bpáirt a ghlacadh i ngnóthaí na tíre.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeidh an seans sin acu.  Ta mé sásta go raibh muintir na hEireann fíor-shásta le cáinaisnéis na bliana seo agus go bhfuil siad ag tnúth le cáinaisnéis na bhliana seo chugainn, mar tá a fhios acu go bhfuil tús curtha leis an dea-obair i mbliana agus go leanfar leis an bhliain seo chugainn, go gcinnteoidh Rialtas Fhianna Fáil, mar a rinne siad ariamh, <Col N="765" /> go mbeidh airgead ar fáil le haghaidh riachtanaisí.  Tá a fhios ag daoine go mbeidh faoiseamh cháin ioncaim chomh maith agus is féidir é agus go mbeidh, ag deireadh an lae, cothrom na féinne do phobal na hÉireann ar fad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my point.  I wish to speak on the budget, because it is about time that we got back to that subject. What concerns me most are the industrial relations implications of this budget, which have not been very widely referred to and, indeed, have got very little attention.  Inevitably, industrial relations in any year are centred on the major pay deal for that year, which in recent years has become known as the national wage agreement and last year as the national understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every national level in the past, whether it was spelt out or not, has been based on the principles of index linking. In other words, pay rises were always reasonably in line, usually a little ahead <Col N="766" /> of, price rises.  Even the Taoiseach was prepared to say that the budget will contribute 4 per cent to price rises for May of this year.  He did not say what percentage it would add after May of this year. The Leader of the Opposition has estimated that the figure will be 6 per cent in the full year.  Indeed, there is not much between the Taoiseach's estimate and that of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Inflation is running already at an annual rate of 16 per cent or very close to it and simple arithmetic will tell us that the annual rate for this year's end should be somewhere between 24 and 22 per cent, if things do not get even worse. Whether we like it or not, whether the Minister for Finance likes it or not, that means that we are now faced with wage claims of the order of 22 per cent.  I say that with no joy whatever in my heart, as an inevitability.  Indeed, the reaction of the trade union movement to the Minister's radio interview last Sunday will reinforce what I am now saying. Can the Irish economy&mdash;run down as it is at this moment, and in fact now in reverse because this year we shall have a minus growth, if that is a correct term&mdash;be asked to face wage increases of 22 per cent?  That means loss of jobs and very poor industrial relations for the remainder of 1980 and, possibly, into 1981.</P>
    <P>Back in 1975-76, the Coalition Government were faced with a world recession brought about by the 400 per cent increase in oil prices visited on them overnight.  Faced with that crisis, the then Government introduced food subsidies to help the poor, to mitigate the worst effects of the ravages of inflation. They also reduced income taxation and, as part of the deal, we got a very good national pay agreement.  Inflation fell rapidly and by the end of 1977 was down to 8 per cent.  This happened because we had a Government of social justice, of equity, with concern for the people in our society with less money. Since then, money has been lavished on the rich.  We had the abolition of wealth tax.  We had the reimbursement of investments in the Irish Trust Bank of £3.3 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the abolition of rates, quite rightly, on ordinary dwellings because they had become a penal imposition on ordinary householders. However, the Government also abolished rates on the mansions and castles of this country.  It did not matter if people owned 20 or 30 castles; they got remission of rates, which meant that the very wealthy&mdash;some in my constituency owning 20 to 30 houses&mdash;got remission of rates, gaining them thousands of pounds per year.  On the other hand, the person living in the small local authority house got no benefit at all.</P>
      <P>There was abolition of the car tax, again possibly justified for the worker who needs his car to get to work, but there also were the very poor families with no cars and wealthy families with several cars.  Capital gains taxes were reduced to 75 per cent.  Food subsidies were reduced and in this budget we had changes in income taxation which favour only those&mdash;and I want this to go out loud and clear from this House&mdash;on tax rates of more than 35p in the £.  The vast majority of our workers pay tax at 35p in the £ or less.  They will have lost by this budget, whereas the more one goes up the scale, the more one gains.  If you have £25,000 a year you have done well out of this budget, especially if you have no children.</P>
      <P>That is the background to the national wage agreement facing us.  Pleas for moderation coming from a Minister for Finance who has just savaged the people with additional inflation, additional price rises of 6 per cent, are only laughable. The Minister for Finance has a hard neck.  He is whistling in the wind if he thinks that, of all the people in this country, he is going to be listened to as far as wage moderation is concerned.  He has shown no consideration for price moderation.  He has heaped additional price rises on to the present huge price rises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the background to the play which is now starting for the national understanding and I hope there is one coming. <Col N="768" /> We must be realistic.  The portents and forecasts are that we will have an annual inflation of 20 to 22 per cent.  If history is to be repeated, and there is no reason whatever to believe that it will not, that means that wage increases will be 20 to 22 per cent or more.  The only way to break this vicious wages prices chase is to reduce taxation dramatically on blue collar workers, who have not saved anything under the budget, and to freeze prices for some time.  That is the only way to stop prices and wages escalating. As far as the Minister for Finance going on radio and making pleas for moderation from workers is concerned, he might as well be whistling in the wind because he is the last person workers would listen to.</P>
    <P>As far as industrial relations are concerned, this is a sad budget.  It shows no grasp or understanding of the financial pressures on workers, of the view the vast majority of them take of the way the country is run or the unfairness that is correctly perceived on the shop floor and which exists widely in the country.  It does nothing to try to bring equity and justice to the situation, whatever the outrageous claims of the Taoiseach.  At least the Minister for Finance went on radio and faced his interviewer to be asked questions about the budget and the economic situation.  He had the courage to go on.  The Taoiseach would not go on unless he could pick the questioner and the questions.</P>

Deputy Charles Haughey will only go on television when he can talk straight to the camera on ministerial broadcasts.  He is afraid of his life to be asked questions about the budget or about Fianna Fáil Governments present and past.  I challenge the Taoiseach to go on television and radio and face the interviewer&mdash;not the ones of his choice but any interviewer RTE chooses&mdash;who will ask him questions about all major issues of importance facing the country.  What has the Taoiseach to hide?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does he not go on television?  He is hiding something.  He is afraid to answer questions.  I hope the Taoiseach will take up my challenge and defend the budget and answer whatever questions are put by whatever questioner is chosen.  What has he to hide?</P>
      <P>As far as industrial relations are concerned, as main Opposition spokesman in this area I am very sad.  I believe from the bottom of my heart, and I bring the strongest conviction to bear in saying this, that the central challenge facing us is the creation of meaningful jobs at home for all our people.  We can only do that if we have enduring labour peace. The year 1979 was the worst year of industrial relations in my lifetime.  It was the second worst year in history.  That is not to say that they just got bad in 1979. Industrial relations have been bad for ever and a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks at any international table of comparison for any ten years one cares to mention one will see that our best year is worse than the worst year in countries such as Germany, Denmark and so on.  Where does that leave 1979, which was our worst year?  Inevitably 1980 will be a better year.  I have a feeling&mdash;I hope I am wrong&mdash;that the Taoiseach and Minister for Labour will talk a lot about industrial relations as they have already done in the first three months of this year.  The Minister for Labour has talked more about it in that <Col N="770" /> time than he did in the previous two and half years.  The reason is that if they talk about it they give the impression that they are concerned.  They hope that 1980 will be a better year than 1979 and that they will get credit for the improvement. That is very clever.</P>
    <P>The year 1980 is almost bound to be better than 1979 notwithstanding the budget.  If they talk about it and give the impression that they are concerned people will say that they improved the situation and that we only lost one million man-days this year compared with 1.4 million last year.  That might be clever but it is too clever by half.  We had too much of that kind of approach over the years.  That is why we have continuously bad labour relations.  It is not the trade unions, their leaders or managers, employers or owners who are at fault; it is successive Irish Governments who are at fault for labour relations.  We have not provided the labour relations infrastructure, machinery, resources or economic environment in which they can peacefully proceed.</P>
    <P>Rather than helping the situation this budget sharply accentuates the problem. It adds 6 per cent to the cost of living and, therefore, 6 per cent to the wage claims that will be coming in for negotiation in the next few months.  So far as industrial relations are concerned this budget is a stupid budget.  It is irresponsible, thoughtless and reckless.  Industrial relations are bad but not because we have had extremist trade union leaders. We have some of the best trade union leaders in the world, who have been consistently highly motivated by patriotism, but we have never given them due recognition.  It is not because we have bad employers or bad managers, because generally we do not have.  We have a very good employer organisation who have due regard for the national interest, and yet we have appalling labour relations.  The fault lies with successive Governments who have not had the courage to deal with the industrial relations network.</P>
    <P>We can bring about labour peace with <Col N="771" /> a little intelligence, common sense and a few bob thrown in.  Give the industrial relations sector the resources, the infrastructure and the machinery and we will have lasting labour peace because nobody&mdash;certainly nothing above 0.1 per cent of the workforce&mdash;seeks a strike.  I do not know any trade union leaders or managers who seek strikes, and yet we have strikes by the dozen. Man-days are lost in their millions.  Last year we lost 1.43 million man-days.  It is worth noting that on average a man-day costs £23 per day, given that the national average wage is £5,500. Crudely, that means that the cost last year in man-days was £30 million, apart from the loss of investment and exports. It is possible to establish lasting labour peace.  The Taoiseach in his broadcast to the nation&mdash;he will broadcast to the nation but he will not be interviewed or face questions&mdash;talked about industrial relations.  He talks a lot about industrial relations in the hope that this year will be better than last year, the worst of all time.  He believes that, if he keeps talking about it, it will look good.  The Taoiseach spoke about a year of industrial peace but 12 months of industrial peace will not solve our problem.  What we need&mdash;and Deputy FitzGerald, the leader of my party, has been talking about this for two years&mdash;is a decade or a generation of industrial peace.  There is no reason why we cannot have enduring labour peace.  It exists in Sweden, Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany.  Why can we not have it?  Nobody deliberately seeks a strike.</P>
    <P>In my view we have not given the labour relations sector resources or any thought.  Governments have not faced up to the issue because they were afraid. They did not know enough about the situation.  There has not been in any Government sufficient working-class instincts or knowledge to tackle the problem.  The Budget, far from creating the environment for successful industrial relations, has brought us trouble and we will witness that when negotiations open later this year on a new national understanding. <Col N="772" /> I should like to make it clear, as I did in the last two years, that Fine Gael are strongly committed to the continuation of national pay bargaining. We urge moderation in pay bargaining, not just in the overall national interest, which must be primary, but also in the interest of our workers, because it is in their interest that we should stop the wages-prices spiral, this chase that is ruining us all.</P>
    <P>There is little we can do on this side of the House about the havoc that will be wreaked on the industrial relations side by the budget, but we can urge that other improvements be brought about in that sector.  We can urge that there should be a speedy overhaul of the labour relations machinery and the law on picketing, and that there be a speedy up-dating of legislation requiring proper personnel management and an improvement in public sector management, and Government management.  It is accepted that bad management is a factor where there are recurring labour troubles, but it must be emphasised again that there is a stark contrast between the private and public sector in this regard.  There are a few private enterprises with bad personnel management but they represent a small minority.  The same is not true of the public sector.  That does not reflect on the individuals working in public Departments of State, the semi-State bodies or local authorities.  Even if the Lord Himself was put into those jobs He could not make a job of them because of the constraints imposed by Government policy. There is no freedom to manoeuvre.  We have some excellent public servants but they cannot function.  Improvements in industrial relations in the public sector should be brought about.</P>
    <P>Our unions, who serve 1.1 million workers, are starved for want of resources.  According to figures issued by the Registrar of Friendly Societies in respect of 1978 their total budget was £9.5 million.  Unions must provide office accommodation, pensions for their officials, strike pay and so on.  The budget could have made a significant contribution to enduring labour peace by recognising the wonderful national service <Col N="773" /> provided by so many trade union leaders.  They attend the Employer-Labour Conference, tri-partite talks and act on the boards of AnCO, CIE, IIRS and many other State organisations. While those officials attend such meetings there is nobody in their office to answer their telephones because the unions do not have the resources to pay extra staff.  The quality and level of service then diminishes and that is what gives rise to unofficial strikes.  The budget could have made a massive step forward in industrial relations by giving a relatively small contribution to the trade unions.  They should be given the resources to educate and train their officials, to pay their officials proper salaries, to give them proper office accommodation and give them proper staff.  If the Taoiseach addressed himself to the massive management problem in the public sector, we could be praising this budget.  However, he ignores the problem.  Instead of seeking to remove the constraints which the Department of the Public Service are forced by their political masters to impose, the Minister hints at a public sector pay freeze.  This is what the papers read into his remarks on Sunday.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Finance that he should rule out any thought of a public sector pay freeze.  One of the problems is that people in our public service are paid not too well but too badly. We are not going to keep the best talents available in the public service if we pay peanuts.  Whatever the temporary financial difficulties and whoever brought them about the Minister should rule out any question of a public sector pay freeze.  Whatever national agreement is agreed&mdash;and I repeat again that I hope a further one will be agreed this year&mdash;the terms of such should apply equally to the public sector.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to initiate a major review of the State's role as an employer and as a paymaster.  Obviously the State is doing something wrong because most of our industrial relations problems are in areas where the State is the employer, where the Government are <Col N="774" /> the ultimate managers.  That is why I was amused at the Taoiseach addressing himself to the question of bad management. He was talking about himself.  The problem of bad management in industrial relations here&mdash;and it is mainly a problem in the public sector&mdash;is not there because we do not have competent men and women in the public Departments, the local authorities and in the semi-State bodies; we do.  It is there because the Taoiseach and his predecessors have imposed impossible constraints within which public servants must operate.  I urge the Minister for Finance, I urge the Government to initiate immediately a comprehensive review of the Government's role as an employer and paymaster.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the central economic challenge&mdash;meaningful job creation&mdash;I also urge the Government to abandon the Commission on Industrial Relations. It has been flying on one wing now since last July and only a dreamer would expect that whatever report it eventually issues would be accepted by both sides. It should be abandoned.  It is flying on one wing and it is bound to crash in the end.  Legislation should be introduced which will comprehensively co-ordinate and expand the labour relations machinery at central, regional and district level, expand the conciliation and rights service and introduce an element of local fire fighting into the deliberations apparatus.  I urge the Government to do this because I believe labour peace is attainable. I believe, as I have said so many times before in this House, that there is a broad consensus inside this House and outside it as to the general direction in which we should go in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope that when it comes to negotiating the national understanding we will not have the same free negotiating hassle that we had last year, when we had talks about talks and votes not to have talks and then votes to have talks, votes not to accept the results of such talks, more talks and then votes to ultimately accept the fourth round of talks.  This is all sapping the national <Col N="775" /> morale.  It is certainly sapping the morale of those involved in the industrial relations sector.  Let us have some straight talk; let us put our cards on the table.</P>
    <P>That is why I am so affronted by the Minister for Finance who is acting just like his predecessor last year.  His predecessor pleaded for moderation, suggested a 5 per cent increase, asked for rigid discipline.  But last year the midterm elections were coming, local elections and European elections were coming. When pay talks were collapsing in April and May, just before those elections took place, all thought of constraint and rigid discipline was forgotten about.  The 5 per cent was forgotten about.  Ultimately, we had the Government talking about 12 per cent, which then became 15 per cent and could have ended up at much more than that.  Now we have the same thing going on.  The Minister puts 6 per cent on prices and then goes on radio and calls for moderation in the workforce.  He has contributed to this massive posturing going on in labour relations which saps everybody's morale and credibility.</P>
    <P>Straight talking is what we need.  If there are price rises of 22 per cent the workforce demand wage rises of 22 per cent, rightly or wrongly.  The economists say the economy cannot afford these wage rises, and I agree with them.  Why did the Government add a 22 per cent rise in prices when they knew this would be the consequence?  Why were the tax changes not tuned in on those at the bottom end of the market instead of those at the top?  Why do those on the shop floor not get the benefit of tax changes? Anyone paying 35p in the £ or less loses by this budget and will soon find out. But Ministers and Ministers of State with £20,000 and £23,000 a year gain massively by it and therefore they cannot be expected to understand the problem of the worker on the shop floor who gets £60 a week.</P>

      <P>That brings me to another aspect of this budget which has already been pointed out.  However, it is our duty to underline it again and again.  The allocations for all the employment schemes in existence have been cut dramatically. The Government brazen it out and say there are no cuts, that that is only an illusion. There have been massive cuts under the employment incentive scheme, the youth employment premium scheme and the employment maintenance scheme and the Government have welched on their commitment as part of the national understanding to create new jobs.  They have welched on every job incentive programme they have made or inherited, by far the most successful of which was the employment incentive scheme introduced by the Coalition Government&mdash;and 80 per cent of people who got jobs under the scheme have been kept in employment.  It is the big success story.</P>

The budget cuts all the employment schemes, especially the employment incentive scheme introduced by Deputy Michael O'Leary, former Minister for Labour, under which real jobs were created in the private sector, not make-believe jobs in the public sector.  According to figures given recently by the Minister for Labour, 80 per cent of the 15,000 jobs created last year under the employment incentive scheme were made permanent. The employment action team have come and gone and various industrial concerns which were supposed to come never did, not to mention the work experience programme and other schemes which are only laughing stocks.  The successful employment maintenance scheme has also been chopped by the Government and this will badly affect the textile industry.</P>
      <P>The Government have also reneged on their agreement as part of the national understanding to create 5,000 extra jobs and that fact will be thrown in their faces when they begin negotiations on a new national understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this budget will be to push wage claims over 20 per cent and the sad result will be the wrecking of the prospects of our young people in places as far apart as Tuam and Dublin.  If our prices are too high we will not be able to sell abroad.  This difficulty could be overcome when our currency was linked to sterling which depreciated every year and we were enabled to have huge wage increases which did not affect the price <Col N="778" /> of our goods abroad.  We no longer have that luxury and are now linked through the EMS to European countries where they have single-figure inflation and single-figure wage rises.  We are pricing ourselves out of the market, and our wage rises will be too high because prices are too high.  That means fewer jobs and opportunities for young people. The budget is a disaster in regard to industrial relations and job creation.</P>
    <P>In addressing this House the Taoiseach had the audacity to say that there was a caring philosophy behind this budget.  The reality is that it stamps the poor into the ground.  We are talking about an inflation rate of 22 per cent overall, but if one looks at essentials such as bread, butter, sugar, milk and heat the inflation rate thus isolated is a great deal more than 25 per cent.  This means that instead of reducing the stain of poverty we are heightening our shame.  The budget does not confer any favours on the poor; it robs them.  It helps the individual or the couple earning £20,000, especially if they do not have children, but what about the poor man on the dole who has seven or eight children?  He will not receive any tax concessions because he does not pay tax, but he will still have to pay the extra 77p on bottled gas.  If he uses town gas for cooking, as do most of the poor in this city, he is confronted for the first time ever with two increases in ten days.  That is some record.  It is, presumably, part of the Taoiseach's caring philosophy.  But people like the Taoiseach and his Ministers with salaries of more than £20,000 per year will be the ones to gain from the budget and that will be at the expense of the poor.</P>
    <P>The Government have not done anything about borrowing.  There has not been any attempt to bring about a reduction in borrowing as a percentage of GNP.  This has led to speculation about an early election.  But, knowing Fianna Fáil and having regard to present opinion polls, they will not be likely to go to the country for some time.</P>
    <P>Instead of resolving some problems, this budget creates some and accentuates <Col N="779" /> more.  It is said in some quarters that the division within the Government is responsible for the production of a budget which wrecks the prospects of so many of our people.  In these circumstances the sooner the Government go to the country the better.  We have a wonderful country, a country which has great prospects but which needs a sense of direction, a sense of justice, a sense of fair play and which above all needs the kind of leadership that it will not get from the other side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Since most areas pertaining to the budget have been covered I rise briefly to make a few points.  This year's budget is of particular importance in that it is linked with the national understanding but also because of the very substantial increases in social welfare payments, because there is a major start on the road to a more equitable tax system and also because there is a substantial reduction in the dependence on borrowing.  In addition, there is a fresh approach to the taxation of farmers.  The Minister was faced with a difficult task in trying to strike a balance in regard to the aims of the budget but he succeeded in bringing a degree of reality into the various proposals and in this budget the Government have shown a responsible approach to the country's problems.  We now have the opportunity of creating the proper atmosphere between employers and workers and of creating a situation in which we will be in a more favourable position, because of the lessening of the danger of bad labour relations, of attracting industry to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures taken to ease the PAYE tax burden and to create more suitable structures for taxation will help to avoid the senseless type of conflict that has arisen between urban and rural dwellers. The farmers claim that they are willing to pay their fair and equitable share of taxation.  We must remember that income tax in respect of farmers was introduced only a short number of years ago and that time is needed to allow for the adjustment.  Farmers will know now where they stand in relation to the £40 <Col N="780" /> threshold applying for three years and they will accept the more simplified accounts system.  We have been promised, too, a re-examination of the resource tax situation.  I should hope that in hardship cases, especially in regard to farmers in the £40 to £49 valuation bracket, there would be regard to specific circumstances. I am glad to note that there are to be allowances in respect of taxation so far as such work as land reclamation, fencing and the erection of farm buildings is concerned.  This is a very important factor because of the increasing cost of such work.  Farmers may not expect now increases at the levels enjoyed in the previous year and to counteract this situation they will have to depend on more efficient production rather than on a substantial increase in production.</P>
    <P>Pig production is a very important industry in the area in which I come from as well as in such areas as Cork, Kerry and Cavan.  Most pig producers have very large units.  The day has gone when pig production was merely a farmyard enterprise.  There has been developed a very high degree of efficiency in the industry in terms of production, breeding, proper weights and so on.  The producers are very concerned that they are being paid up to £300 per ton less for their products than is being paid on the market for Danish bacon.</P>
    <P>One of the problems so far as our producers are concerned is that the Pigs and Bacon Commission are handling only about 40 per cent of the production while the various factories&mdash;sometimes competing against each other on the export market&mdash;handle the remainder.  The producers are concerned not only for their very existence but in regard to the structure generally in respect of this industry. We are producing approximately two million pigs per year but we are competing on the world market with the Danes who are producing 13 million pigs per year.  From the point of view of the amount of feed used and when this is related back to the grain producer, the miller and all along the line, it will be seen that there is a big spin-off in the pig industry so far as labour content is concerned. Feed is completely home <Col N="781" /> produced except for the protein meals and some additives.  I would hope that the Pigs and Bacon Commission and those factories marketing on their own will come together to bring about a situation in which the producers will not suffer from the present marketing system.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of mention of the super levy on milk production.  Our Minister is totally committed to ensuring that our farmers and milk producers will not suffer as far as this levy or any other price margin arrangement in the EEC is concerned.  In the recent farm and food booklet I noticed that small farmers were going out of milk production, changing over to beef, in which they will have half only of the profitability they would have had in milk.  That will have a serious effect in the 12 western counties, where hopefully in coming years they will receive the grant aids allocated to us under the EEC western drainage scheme and also the scheme to be announced shortly regarding the package assembled by the former Minister, Deputy Gibbons, now with the EEC Commission for approval.  In those western counties, bearing in mind the size of farms and farm structures, which are not suitable for grain production, the ideal would be milk production.</P>
    <P>There is also the situation at present&mdash;under EEC Regulation No. 1271&mdash;in which £2,500,000 was allocated in aid of upwards of 60 per cent of the cost of in-can coolers and cooler tanks, along with which applicants would qualify for a farm modernisation scheme grant.  It was expected that there would have been some 9,000 applicants; yet some six or seven weeks ago there were 5,000 only.  Now the IAOS, who are supervising the scheme, have applied for an extension of the time limit.  It is a pity such schemes are not brought to people's attention more effectively. There appears to be a breakdown in communications in this respect.  There are many farmers who should be availing of these benefits and indeed who need such at present when the production of a quality article is so essential at all levels.  I believe the time has arrived <Col N="782" /> for a reappraisal of all farming activities in the different areas to ensure that where there is grant aid and funding available it will be brought to prospective applicants' notice as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I listened to the gloomy predictions of the previous speaker.  While one might expect that the Opposition would highlight points more suitable to their case, very often at different levels&mdash;not in this House but at county council or county committee of agriculture level&mdash;they cry wolf and make gloomy predictions which can do irreparable damage to industry, especially the farming industry.  One particular instance comes to mind.  In the autumn of 1979 following a meeting of a county committee of agriculture, there were headlines in the press announcing that only 25 per cent of winter feed was available in west Cavan.  As a result people sold their young stock.  It created a scare, a stampede to sell, so that in the weeks prior to Christmas there was a big falling off in the price of store cattle and small stock. The same papers now carry columns of advertisements offering bales of hay for sale, and increasingly higher prices are being offered for young cattle.  I believe politicians can make their point but should not labour it to the extent that it could damage our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals in regard to income tax were very welcome.  Certainly the fact that there will now be 75,000 people no longer in the tax net should reduce the workload of tax offices, affording their staffs an opportunity to deal with other cases which tend to pile up, leaving them with a backlog.  The income-splitting aspect is to be welcomed also and leaves us in advance of some other countries in the EEC in that respect.</P>
    <P>The 25 per cent increase granted in the long-term weekly rates of social welfare benefit were particularly welcomed, as was the increase in the rate of allowance to veterans of the War of Independence to £185.  In this respect I do not believe the Opposition ever dreamt that such increases would <Col N="783" /> amount to anything like 25 per cent; I think they would have been agreeable to much less.  There was one instance at a county council meeting in Monaghan at which a Fine Gael councillor proposed&mdash;a man always very generous in his proposals&mdash;that there be a 20 per cent increase to social welfare recipients 5 per cent under the Minister's eventual figure.</P>
    <P>In a time of stringency, with the Government's deep committment to industrial development, I was glad to note the amount of money allocated to the IDA.  The implementation of the Fianna Fáil manifesto has been nowhere more evident than in this area of industrial development.  The IDA are to be congratulated on their rate of progress not alone in the grant-aiding of industry but on their general approach.  We public representatives find the IDA always ready to listen to our every suggestion, even if it means the securing of only one additional job.</P>
    <P>There was also the innovation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few years ago of the small cluster units, of 3,000 sq. feet plus per unit, for the small industrialist who heretofore erected premises with grant aid in areas where he had not water, sewerage or electricity supply.  It is more advantageous to have a number of these cluster units together, especially when the services are already there.  If an applicant wishes to start a business he can rent a cluster unit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State gave a run down on housing loans and housing grants. Nobody liked to see the withdrawal of the reconstruction grants, but when looking at the figures we should take into account the increases granted for the reconstruction and housing loans.  Inside three years the limit was increased from £4,500 to £12,000 and the income limit from £2,350 to £5,500.  The Minister should insist that local authorities secure sites in the same way as the IDA acquire sites.  When they secure the sites they should develop them, provide the necessary services and sell them to housing <Col N="784" /> applicants.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities know that the cost of building houses has risen drastically.  A three-roomed terraced local authority house can cost around £20,000 to build.  This is very high.  The answer to that problem is for the Minister to insist that local authorities purchase the land, service the sites and then they could give the people on the housing list an opportunity to build their own houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than deal with this budget on a national basis I will discuss it as it affects County Galway. Before the budget many people went to a great deal of trouble trying to convince us that it would be very bad.  As a result people have accepted it and said it could have been worse.  Why do we find ourselves in a very serious financial situation? The Government who were in office a few years ago cannot be blamed. One could not blame it on any Government but a Fianna Fáil Government. Fianna Fáil have to take the blame for this problem, as well as for the present lack of industrial peace.</P>
      <P>The last speaker said that this budget would attract industries to this country and that it introduced a better taxation system.  Heaven help the next Government who come into office because they will have a very difficult job solving the problems created by Fianna Fáil Governments, first under Deputy J. Lynch and now under Deputy Haughey, the present Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I will talk about the problems as they affect County Galway. I am a member and chairman of the Galway County Committee of Agriculture.  We find it impossible to work as efficiently as we did in the past because of the cut-backs in the amount of money we need to carry out our functions. I have with me our allocations for 1980 and for the record I will repeat a few of them.  Under different headings the committee carry out different duties. For the following schemes&mdash;cattle, pig and sheep breeding, poultry development, schemes to encourage horticulture, shelter belt schemes, seed potato <Col N="785" /> development schemes, subsidies through agricultural societies, vermin destruction schemes and a scheme to encourage the breeding of Connemara ponies&mdash;we estimated we would need something in the region of £17,280.  We were granted £13,320, a cut of £3,960.  How are we to operate these schemes this year?</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister of State is in the House to listen to what Deputies have to say with a view to bringing our comments to the notice of the Minister for Finance or even the Taoiseach. Deputy Mitchell appealed to the Minister to take a few notes of what he said because, if Ministers are not <i>au fait</i> with what we are talking about, from listening and taking notes they might be educated.  I appeal to the Minister of State present to listen to what I am saying because I know he was not listenting to what I was saying about the cuts in the allocations for the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Galway County Committee of Agriculture run courses under the EEC 161 scheme.  We estimated we would need £13,180 to run this scheme and we were given £12,000, a cut of £1,180. That may not appear to be a big cut but it is very big in relation to the total sum. Many Deputies who support the Government do not seem to be aware that these cuts will have a detrimental effect on the working of the committees. We also run a number of non-residential courses for which we calculated we would need £4,050.  The Department reduced that figure to £3,000, a cut of £1,050.  We also run short residential courses for which we need £300; that figure was left alone.</P>
    <P>There is something I cannot understand under the heading general administration. Naturally a county committee of agriculture office has to operate efficiently.  Under the following headings&mdash;rents and rates, repairs, lighting and heating, insurance, equipment, telephone and postage, incidentals, printing, stationery, the journal, the annual publication we get out and so forth&mdash;we need £41,330.  The Department <Col N="786" /> decided that we may consider that we want it but we are not going to get it. They decided to give us £35,680, which means a cut of £5,650.  Perhaps in reply to this budget debate or at some other stage, perhaps by letter or some public statement by a Minister, a Minister of State or Taoiseach, the Government might explain to the county committee of agriculture in Galway how under that cut of £5,650 for office equipment and so on they expect the office to operate at all.</P>
    <P>Bad as that may be, we have had one further cut which was the meanest and lowest under the belt that I have ever heard of, and when the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, hears about it, he will agree with me.  For members' travelling expenses for the 11 meetings we hold annually we estimated that we would need £5,000 for our 20-member committee. The Department decided to cut it down to £2,620.  I put the question to the Minister of State: how does he expect a county committee of agriculture to operate on half the travelling expenses they had last year?  I am sure that many members of his party are members of their own county committee of agriculture in Laois or Offaly or maybe the two counties are joined together.  The majority of the members of these committees are not paid politicians as I am. There are three or maybe four politicians on the entire county committee of agriculture.  We are called professional politicians in the sense that for the services we render in the Dáil or Seanad we are paid to some degree, some people say too much and possibly Members themselves will say too little.  How do the Government expect the other members of these committees to attend 11 monthly meetings?  We do not hold one in the month of August.  How do they expect us to run even five or six meeting this year.</P>
    <P>This matter came to our notice at our meeting last Friday.  Various suggestions were put forward and one by myself as chairman was to the effect that we should run the committee into the <Col N="787" /> ground and close it up after about six months, if that would be the wish of the Government party.  The composition of that committee now is a hell of a sight different from what it was when the party opposite were in power in County Galway because they would not let anybody on to the committee.  All the political seats on it were filled by Fianna Fáil councillors and TDs and they decided that they would select the rest of the members themselves.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of all political shades and opinions.  Even the Labour Party are represented on it and we have invited representation from the ICA, the IFA and Macra na Feirme.  We have a very broadly based committee.  The expression of opinion at our meeting last Friday was that they were not at all satisfied with the cut-backs we have had from the Department and they were wondering to whom or through what channel they could appeal so that this could be brought to the notice of the public.  I am glad that I am possibly the first to get the opportunity of standing up publicly, particularly here in Dáil Éireann, to explain the position exactly as it is.  I hope that the Minister of State will bring this message to his Government and as a result we might see some change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various bodies in County Galway to whom we give a few pounds every now and again, such as show societies of one description or another. We try to give something in the region of <Col N="788" /> £50 or £100 if the event is important enough.  We might give a little more to, for instance, the committee who organise the county ploughing championship.  At any rate we are very limited in what we can give them with the small budget at our disposal.  On 25 May this year the national sheep-shearing contest will be held in a place called Duniry in County Galway and there was a request from the organisation running that for some type of grant from the county committee for the purpose of helping to defray the expenses of that project.  The request was for £100, and you cannot do much with £100 these days.  Every day that passes you seem to get a little less for it.  We could not grant them anything.  Is it not terrible that we have a national sheep-shearing championship and that we in the county committee of agriculture cannot grant the organisation running it a few pounds to help defray expenses?  A member of the Minister's party, Deputy Callanan, expressed the view that I am expressing now in relation to the sheep-shearing competition, that money should be available whereby we would be able to give them some type of grant.</P>
    <P>Over the years applications have been made by the county committee of agriculture for additional instructors. When I was not a member of the committee I took up the cause and talked about it here in Leinster House.  Since I became a member of that committee I have put our case on the floor of the House for additional agricultural instructors in Galway, but I seem to be wasting time.  The ratio of farmers to agricultural instructors in Galway is higher than it is in any other county.  It is something in the region of 690 farmers for every agricultural instructor.  How could an agricultural instructor look after 690 farmers and give them the service which they deserve and which he would like to give them?  We made application for additional agricultural instructors for the sole purpose of increasing agricultural production of getting a much better ratio of agricultural instructors to farmers.  I should like to see the ratio at something in the region of an agricultural instructor for every 250 farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> On the question of seeking additional staff for county committee offices in Galway and for the regional offices out of which a number of regional instructors work, in Tuam six agricultural instructors work out of an office which has no secretarial help whatsoever.  This point has been brought to the notice of the present Minister for Agriculture and to the notice of his predecessor and the storm was blown very much into our faces.  The county committee also requested that the regional laboratory in Athlone should be used for blood testing and so on, so that the problems that exist in blood testing&mdash;and particularly those that existed last year&mdash;will not continue to occur.  Some people do not seem to be happy with the present arrangements. The Minister must be tired listening to talk of county committees, but how can they operate in 1980?  Would the Minister please take a note of this request and relay it to the relevant authority, presumably the Minister for Agriculture and, if not, to the Taoiseach?  It is possible that there has been some mistake.  The county committee will be meeting again in a month's time, if we can afford to meet, and I should be happy to have, by then, some reply to the questions I have raised here today.</P>
    <P>As a result of this budget, the Galway Vocational Education Committee has suffered a 25 per cent cut on what was looked for on the administrative side, and a 35 per cent cut on maintenance. Salaries are up, which makes the position worse.  Possibly the worst feature on the subject of education in general is that capital expenditure in regard to education has been cut from £53 million to £49 million.  Some of the biggest problems in primary education in Galway are caused by the lack of schools and of extensions to existing schools, about which representations have been made to the Department. Many of the schools have prefab buildings beside them, erected a number of years ago.  This is not peculiar to the vocational education side.  These buildings were a stop-gap or a temporary measure but have now become a <Col N="790" /> permanent feature in the playgrounds of most schools.  Many of our VEC schools need to be replaced.  New schools have been promised here and there, particularly in the Tuam area, but as a result of the present financial situation in Galway this cannot be done.  Prefabs are not very satisfactory in many ways. They are not joined to the main building. They create problems for students and teachers and are generally unsuitable. The teaching profession have expressed their disapproval and dissatisfaction on this subject from time to time but their protests seem to have fallen on deaf ears. A new national school has been promised for Tuam for a couple of years, but to date we have heard nothing about it and it would appear that we shall wait a few more years before we hear anything about it.</P>
    <P>There is a big problem in Ballinasloe at the moment, a town with a growing population, which I cannot see any hope of being alleviated during 1980.  Additional facilities are also being sought at New Inn, Glenamaddy and Portumna and no action has been taken in any of these areas, particularly in 1980.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking on education, in December 1979 I asked the Minister for Education if he was aware that there was no running water or toilet facilities in Leitrim national school, Loughrea, County Galway.  His answer was that the Department had sanctioned a grant towards the cost of a scheme for essential improvements, including water for sanitation.  To make a long story short, terrible problems exist there.  Whether it is lack of communication between the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works I do not know, but there is some breakdown in communications there.  Perhaps the Minister might take up that subject with a view to having something done about it?</P>
    <P>In January 1977, the then Minister for Education sanctioned a new national school in Gorteen, Ballinasloe, County Galway.  To date, there is no school, and no prospect of it either.  I was proud to arrange a deputation on the occasion when the Minister made the decision to <Col N="791" /> grant the new school.  Whether the present Government are trying to throw a spanner in the works or getting another Government Department to do it for them I do not know, but there is no sign of a school and these people are becoming very impatient.  The Minister will have terrible problems on his hands regarding that area if something is not done.</P>
    <P>I should like to talk for one minute about the educational establishment I attended a long time ago, Ballinlash national school, which had a problem with a boundary wall, regarding a water butt.  Although the management of the school had been in contact with the Department of Education, through the Office of Public Works, it was not until a parliamentary question was put down about it that we had any action at all.  I am convinced that, were it not for this question being put down, we would not have any action today either.  We are having a bit of it at the moment.</P>
    <P>I also made representations by way of parliamentary question to the Minister for Education in regard to proposals for additional accommodation at Cummer national school, Tuam, County Galway. The answer that it is being considered is not satisfactory.  I would like to have more action on it.  Perhaps the Minister will take a note of it and as a result of that we might get some action.</P>
    <P>This budget has created a terrible problem in Galway as far as housing is concerned.  I have a lot of papers before me including the estimates for Galway County Council for the coming year and a copy of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  As with all other local authorities we have a housing programme which we hope to put into operation and carry through successfully.  In 1970 we built one rural house in County Galway.  The situation improved in 1971 and 1972 and the improvement was carried along in similar fashion through 1973, and 1974 and 1975.  It had been doing quite well up until last year when we had a problem.  This year we have a terrible problem.</P>
    <P>There was a shortfall last year in the funds for all local authority housing in <Col N="792" /> Galway of £475,000.  The Minister's Department deal with this.  We did not do all the work we had hoped to do last year.  For instance in Clarinbridge, Corofin, Tuam, Loughrea and Moycullen, we were supposed to have new staff.  As the Minister is aware, a specific amount of money must be laid out by the Department for such things.  It is given for the express purpose of having new staff.</P>
    <P>However bad the problem was last year it will be much worse in 1980.  I am not taking into consideration schemes planned for Tuam, Corofin, Portumna and Moycullen&mdash;Tuam, eight houses; Corofin, six; Portumna, ten; and Moycullen, 12.  We might be able to start schemes for demountable rural dwellings in Athenry, Ballygar, Clifden, Roundstone if we get additional money in the region of £585,000 from the Government.  We have another scheme, but no new work can be undertaken and the programme of rural housing will have to be curtailed.  There is a list for Loughrea, Tuam, Eyrecourt, Woodford, Clarinbridge Williamstown, Kilconly and Kilconnell.  We estimated that we could start these schemes between 1 April and 1 August.  They would amount to about 100 houses.  Unless we get money for new staff from the Department we cannot make a start.  I hope the Minister takes note of what I am saying. The Minister can see the problems the members of Galway County Council have and the disastrous shortfall in the amount of money.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the cost of housing.  The Minister can appreciate that we may be in the last generation of home owners because of the escalating cost of houses.  A lot of people have to rely on local authority housing.  If we do not get the necessary finance I do not know what these people will do.  There will be more people going into flats.  Deputy Leonard spoke about loans being increased for reconstruction and new housing.  He did not refer to the abolition of the home improvement grant.  Not alone does that hit the individual but it is a big problem for local <Col N="793" /> authorities.  It was a retrograde step and a bad decision.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach at the Ard Fheis, when he was keeping the troops going, eventually put in the boot and said that we would find oil off the west coast.  I believe there is oil there and there is a strong rumour that it has been found. We never needed it so much.  It would want to flow very quickly or we will collapse entirely.  As far as the allocation for local improvement schemes is concerned, last year we got £240,000.  This year we have been allocated £171,000. As a result of Fianna Fáil administration last year we had a postal strike that lasted a long time.  That is part of the reason why we did not expend all the £240,000 which was given to us.  I put down a number of questions to various Ministers trying to pin them down and to make money available for bog development, bog roads and drainage of bogs. This is very necessary at present due to the high cost of imported fuel.  I made an effort to get the Minister for Energy to make a commitment, but whether he did not understand me or not&mdash;and that is quite possible&mdash;he did not give me a commitment.  There should be 100 per cent grants available for repairs to bog roads, the making of new bog roads and the drainage of bogs.  The allocation of £171,000 for local improvement schemes in 1980 does not meet the number of applications we have submitted. The total cost of meeting those applications is £477,626.</P>
    <P>In this regard one must take into consideration the fact that the cost of heating a home in early 1973 was £78 and the average cost now, not taking into consideration the recent increases in fuel, is £700 annually.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance must appreciate the need to improve and develop bog roads to give people an opportunity of harvesting turf.  I have been informed that the Irish Sugar Company have 15 machines cutting turf west of the Shannon and that they cut 700,000 yards of bog in 70 different areas.  A similar area of bog is cut by private individuals <Col N="794" /> annually in the west.  As a result of the increase in the price of various fuel at source and due to the imposition of Government taxes there is a great demand for turf, a demand which will increase.  If the Minister does not accept the information I have given him he should consult the article written by Desmond Rushe in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 14 February 1980.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that there was not a change in the system of capital taxation on farmers.  That capital taxation was introduced in 1975 and it was to be adjusted every three years in line with inflation. Nothing happened in 1978, although we were told during the election campaign of 1977 that Fianna Fáil would abolish it entirely.  We lost power in 1977 and, consequently, we could not carry out our promise of adjusting it in 1978.  The Government should do something about that.  The problem is that on a natural transfer, or in the event of a death, a farmer is put into a bad situation in that he must sell part of the family farm to rescue the rest of it.  During the election campaign of 1977 many Deputies, and potential Members, spoke about this but no action has been taken since.  In many cases family holdings have to be broken up because farmers do not have the ready cash and do not have any way of borrowing it.</P>
    <P>Any farmer with a land valuation over £40 is in terrible trouble.  He must face the increases in the price of machinery, fertiliser, oil, and the general increases in the cost of living.  It is very difficult to compare those involved in agriculture in different parts of the country.  They cannot be lumped together into one category.  I spent a successful three weeks in County Cork before Christmas and I had an opportunity of comparing the farming situation there with that in the west.  The land and the weather conditions vary greatly.  There is little point in comparing the land around Fermoy and other areas in the south with the land in my constituency.  Taking similar valuations into consideration a farmer in the west, regardless of how good he is, cannot earn an income similar to that of <Col N="795" /> the farmer in the south.  With few exceptions western farmers are in need of special consideration.  We must contend with a heavy annual rainfall in the west. This year in the factory in Tuam, where extra machines were at the disposal of farmers, through no fault of the operators or the farmers, the tail-end of the beet had to be sent to other factories. The rainfall in the west, generally speaking, makes life that much more difficult for people engaged in agriculture there in comparison with farmers in other parts of the country.  This should be taken into consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>I was also disappointed by the cuts of about £2 million in arterial drainage this year, on 13 December 1979 I put down a question to the Minister for Finance in relation to a scheme which my father was responsible for putting into operation in the early 1950's: the drainage of the River Nanny, a tributary of the River Corrib.  A Minister of State from that area, Deputy Killilea, promised the farmers there that this river would be drained.  The reason why it was not done up to now was that it was being used as a water supply for the town of Tuam. Since then an alternative water supply has been found and as a result drainage can be done now.  But I understand now that this river must take its place on the priority list.  If that stream takes its place on a priority list then the youngest Member of this House will not see it carried out if he lives to be 100 years of age.  It is necessary.  It was part of a drainage scheme.  It would have been done in the first stage of the Corrib/Clare drainage scheme were it not being used as a water supply for the town of Tuam.  It floods hundreds of acres backstream from the town of Tuam, and this should be taken into consideration and money allocated for its drainage.</P>
    <P>One Deputy tells me that I am talking about the Dunkellin again.  Only last week I was talking about the Dunkellin and I will keep talking about it.  In County Galway we have two Ministers of State, Deputies Killilea and Hussey, and a Minister, Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn.  It is possibly a disappointment <Col N="796" /> to Deputy Callanan that he is not a Minister, but he might come up trumps tomorrow.  I hope he does, because that will make the situation more embarrassing for him and his colleagues.  Recently we also had Deputy Molloy who was also a Minister.  The EEC granted £42 million for drainage in the west&mdash;£28 million for field drainage and £14 million for arterial drainage.  By letter in 1971 it was stated by the late Deputy Noel Lemass, who was then responsible, that the draining of the Dunkellin would start in 1972.  Various promises have been made since about the Dunkellin.  But most tragic of all is the fact that we got £14 million for arterial drainage in the western regions and, with all the State cars in County Galway, they could not borrow a few pounds out of it to drain the Dunkellin where there are approximately 100,000 acres of land to be drained.</P>
    <P>It is possible that it might be done sometime in the future but the people there have lost confidence in all public representatives because they are floating down the Dunkellin.  There are people in County Galway who might be expected to have a certain amount of political clout and they are doing nothing about the Dunkellin.  They may listen to the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, if he tries to persuade them to spend a few pounds on it.  There are two drainage committees, the IFA drainage committee and a Fianna Fáil drainage committee.</P>

      <P>A deputation from the IFA drainage committee met the then Minister of State, Deputy Wyse, and he said that the only problem was that he <Col N="797" /> could not get engineers.  That seems to have been a problem for quite some time. Surely the Office of Public Works pay the same rate for engineers as any other branch of the public service, and they should be able to pay them in competition with private industry.  Perhaps the Minister of State present might be able to get something done.</P>
      <P>There is another problem in relation to the drainage of the Island river, Williamstown.  We are told that this is part of a greater arterial drainage scheme, the drainage of the Suck.  But in turn the Suck is a tributary of the Shannon. So the Shannon must be drained, the Suck must be drained and then the tributary of the Suck, the Island river, will be drained.  There is quite a lobby of support for the drainage of this river at the moment.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would convey my remarks to the relevant people.</P>
      <P>The overall effect of this budget and Government policy on the draft roadworks scheme is that we are short £735,641.  The Minister might draw this to the attention of his colleagues in Government who are on the local authority and who pay no attention to it whatsoever.  Quite a number of things had to be deleted, a number of schemes in Athenry and places of that nature.  As a result of Government action also the council find themselves no longer responsible for road restoration; at least they cannot spend any more than £50,000 on road restoration, whereas we estimated that about £90,000 would be needed for group water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must pay for the maintenance of the Connacht-Clare drainage scheme, and it will cost £271,668 in 1980; the Killimer-Cappagh scheme will cost £109,678 and maintenance of the Corrib-Headford scheme will cost £107,455, making a total of £488,801. There has been an increase of about 25 per cent, which roughly corresponds with the rate of inflation.  The local authority must find that amount, although the Government did not give a 25 per cent increase and we feel they <Col N="798" /> should be responsible for the provision of these funds.</P>
    <P>The local authority also find themselves with a supplementary claim from the Western Health Board of £121,509 in respect of 1979.  This was not notified to the council until 31 December 1979 and it has not been provided for in the estimates.  This creates a very difficult financial position.</P>
    <P>During the past two-and-a-half years the price of the following commodities has increased as follows: one pound of butter has increased from 53½p to 66½p; a gallon of petrol from 87p to £1.51; a standard loaf from 24p to 36p; a pint of beer from 38p to 59p; one pound of tea from 90p to £1.06; four kilograms of flour from 84p to £1.34; and electricity charges have risen by 70 per cent.  The cost of running a car as small as the Mini is £40 per week.</P>
    <P>The change of leadership seemed to promise something, but nothing has been delivered.  Fianna Fáil must have valued the services as Taoiseach of Deputy Lynch to the extent of £100,000.  He was able to keep the hurling fraternity with him and it will take £100,000 from this Government to keep them going.</P>

      <P>This budget is just not true.  Advantage was taken of many and various things, including money not collected during the postal strike which is now being taken in and which is really a windfall.  There has been only a paper reduction in borrowing.  During his speech the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;We must all ensure that this new burden, unwelcomed though it may be, will be shouldered by all who can bear it&rdquo;. The new level of tax free allowance is not to be extended to the self-employed.  A person such as a carpenter will still get the old tax free allowance and this is discrimination in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also discrimination in relation to farmers.  The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, said that farmers must pay £100,000.  That was three years ago when farmers had a much higher income.  The reduction in income this year is given as 30 per cent but that money is being exacted from farmers in <Col N="799" /> the form of a new resource tax; they must pay their tax and then pay a resource tax.  I call that wealth tax under another name.</P>
    <P>Existing business has also been neglected.  I am not referring to grant-aided businesses from overseas which have the advantage of tax allowances and IDA grants and can, perhaps, export all their production to the parent company.  I am referring to old-established businesses in our towns and cities which have been giving employment. Many such businesses are going to the wall and anybody who reads the newspapers will agree with me.  The Government have not been able to do anything to help them because of the Government's profligate spending under the manifesto which has rendered them impotent.</P>
    <P>They could have done something about the very high interest charges being paid by ordinary businesses which exist on overdraft accommodation or term loans.  Because of the money they spent to buy government they are not in a position to offer any help.  The Central Bank have been approached by the four main commercial banks seeking a 2½ per cent increase in interest charges.  What did it cost the farmer to borrow money from the ACC last year?  The figure was 20.375 per cent.  The situation has arisen that our own barley, in the worst places as far as milling is concerned, is now outpricing foreign imported tapioca. People will suffer serious losses in such areas, particularly in Wexford because the barley must sometimes be moved as far as Belfast to compete with imported barley.</P>
    <P>Because of their manifesto, their spending and their removal of tax on cars and rates on houses, this Government have created a situation whereby the figures coming to the Central Bank gave them no option but to place strictures on the commercial banks and force them to charge higher interest rates&mdash;interest rates which were crushing in the extreme.  Existing industry will produce reduced profits or no profits at all.  The worker depends for his job on the creation <Col N="800" /> of profit; otherwise the day will come when there will be no money for wages.  The action of the Government was dictated by political expediency in their effort to buy power.  The purchase was made and we are now paying the price.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan referred to the difficulties faced by local authorities who have been limited to an increase of 10 per cent in their expenditure at a time of 18 per cent inflation.  The money coming from the Government is being reduced rather than increased and that is why there is no money for roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct the statement I made last night when I said that the 1977 CIE annual report was not available.  The report to which I was referring was the 1978 report which is published but which apparently is not available generally.  At least, I do not think that Deputies have received copies of it.  It was only today that I was able to get a copy in the Library.</P>
      <P>I think everybody here will agree that the railways should continue in operation. From the public also I have had a unanimous feedback in that regard. Despite the losses sustained on this operation in recent years, losses that have been accelerating rapidly since 1970, the public consider the railways to be an essential part of our transport network.  That is not to say that we should retain the railways at a prohibitive cost, but it is time that the Department of Transport defined the role of CIE in such a way as to let us know what is in store for the future and what financial outlay is anticipated for them in the years ahead so that economies can be effected and that there is a reasonable return to the taxpayer for the money involved.  In this context the feeling generally is that the financial affairs of CIE in terms of expenditure have got out of control and that, consequently, we must examine specific policies of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening I was questioning the wisdom of the electrification of the suburban rail system in the Dublin area. Already, the Government have allocated £46 million for the electrification of the Howth-Bray line, but if the whole rapid rail transit system in the Dublin area is to be electrified I understand that the figure involved will be in excess of £200 million.  It would be necessary to have a fair amount of public debate on this issue with a view to ascertaining whether the expenditure would be justified and whether the increase in the number of passengers using such a system would justify expenditure of that extent.  In that regard, the figures are a little off putting. For instance, the latest figures at my disposal&mdash;these <Col N="802" /> are for 1977&mdash;indicate that in Dublin 200 million people used the bus services whereas a mere seven million people used the Dublin suburban railways.  I understand that the latter figure has increased by about two million in the intervening years but it is still a minute portion of the total traffic. Economists tell me that in their opinion the increase in traffic using the rail system after it had been electrified completely would not justify the extra expenditure involved and that expenditure would be in the region of £120 million but in terms of present-day costs the amount involved in the electrification of the whole system would be in the region of £200 million, whereas the use of buses run on diesel by way of augmenting the system would cost merely something in the region of £80 million.  Therefore, there are major financial considerations involved.</P>
    <P>Obviously, if the whole system is to be electrified the taxpayer will be sub-venting CIE to a far greater extent than is the case now.  In 1979 the company's losses were estimated at £57 million though the initial estimate was of the order of £36 million.  In these circumstances one must question the way in which the Department allocate money to CIE.  It is evident from reading the report on CIE of the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas on State Sponsored Bodies and from what the chairman of the company says that he is not the one who decides on what moneys are to be made available.  Perhaps that is as it should be, but the accounting system is particularly false and should be remedied.  As the chairman of the company pointed out to the committee, both he and his officials are aware that the estimate given at the beginning of a year in terms of the needs of CIE will not meet the needs of the company for that year. Obviously, then, what is needed is a more realistic accounting system.  I understand that the loss of £57 million to which I referred could be broken down as follows: £39 million on the rail service, £12 million on the Dublin suburban buses and £3 million on rural bus services. If we add to this loss the payments <Col N="803" /> to CIE as a result of the social welfare scheme of free travel for pensioners and also the amount involved in respect of the school transport scheme as well as the capital allocations to the company, the cost to the taxpayer would be much closer to the staggering figure of £100 million.</P>
    <P>However, there is one bright spot in this area of the operations of CIE and that is the road freight system which in 1975 was inclined to show a less than break-even situation.  But it was pointed out to CIE then that this section would have to pull its weight.  Strangely enough, the road freight section has not been losing money since then.  I am convinced that management in that area is largely responsible for this improvement.  It shows what can be done with the right effort and if there is present the organisation and the will to improve a situation.</P>
    <P>Last evening I criticised the lack of planning in CIE and I referred to their omission in terms of projecting what they are capable of doing in future and of what the cost would be.  The figures I quoted are justified and I should like the Minister to ensure that there is planning in CIE on a much more rational basis. What can be expected from planning that is undertaken on the basis of a survey which, for instance, in the case of road freight, was conducted in 1964? Such a situation is totally unrealistic in the business world.</P>
    <P>Something I object to in relation to transport is the restriction on private enterprise in regard to their entering into the field of bus operations and of the haulage business.  Restrictions and the licensing of private hauliers should be eliminated and free enterprise given a fair crack of the whip.  I have seen private bus operators down the country operating on what could be regarded as the very poorest runs, runs in which CIE would not be involved but which proved to be quite profitable for the private operators concerned.  I am confident that if the £3 million which was lost on the rural bus services last year were to be put into the hands of private operators these services would be run at a hefty <Col N="804" /> profit.  According to the NPC, the prices being charged by private operators are less than those being charged by CIE in almost every case.  Why should we tolerate a situation in which private operators are prohibited from engaging either in the haulage or the bus services business?</P>
    <P>It is time that we had a specific Department for Transport, that we had a Minister for Transport to co-ordinate all road and rail services and not have the divisions we have at present which represent part of the reason for the chaos in our transport system.  I should like to see some of the recommendations, especially that for a transport system for Dublin itself, as recommended by Professor Foster, implemented.  I should like to see more co-ordination.  Above all, I should like to see the eventual foundation of such a Department to co-ordinate all of the services which are in quite a mess at present due to lack of proper consultation and co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport policy is a very comprehensive subject spreading across a number of major areas of our economy.  It is indeed opportune that this report should have come forward from the National Economic and Social Council.  We should also compliment Deputy Quinn on having put down the motion because it affords the House an opportunity to discuss transport policy at the right time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has recognised already, in a very broad address delivered to the Institute of Transport, the major areas for consideration in regard to transport policy.  The Transport Consultative Commission is at an advanced stage of reporting, possibly has reported.  There is also a lot of discussion taking place with the two local authorities in Dublin, and no doubt in other parts of the country, on transport, its complications, the need for policy change and to improve the infrastructure associated with it.  I should like to think also that out of our discussion and the reports becoming available to the Minister we will see major changes <Col N="805" /> and initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>The very appointment by the Taoiseach of a Minister for Communications, the very title, demonstrated a recognition of the upgrading of transport as a key aspect of communications.  It is appropriate also that Posts and Telegraphs should have been allied to the Minister's responsibilities, with a Minister of State, because in the Joint Oireachtas Committee report we touched on that area of cross-involvement between those two Departments. No doubt that report will be studied in detail, in which we suggest that in some aspects common ground might be found in regard to transport policy and the operations of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We suggested also that rural areas might foresee the possibility of utilisation of postal deliveries with rural transport.  In our deliberations in the Joint Oireachtas Committee we discussed with some UK advisers the feasibility of such integration of transport and mail delivery.  This has been experimented with in some remote parts of the United Kingdom and the general consensus to date shows that it has been operating reasonably successfully. Under the umbrella of communications there is the possibility of some improvement in transport policy as well as some economies which might be effected.</P>
    <P>Dealing with transport policy one comes automatically to CIE and the major debate on CIE's subvention, finances, loss-making, and social service role.  One always has to form very definite opinions for or against CIE's role, how efficiently they are functioning, or in regard to what changes might be introduced. In our deliberations in the Joint Oireachtas Committee with the board of directors and senior management we discussed this aspect of their operations at length, their method of reporting, their public image, and how they might improve on that aspect of their operations.  In the discussions and exchanges we had with Mr. St. John Devlin and his senior management I came to the conclusion that there was <Col N="806" /> need within CIE for some major new thinking in the management structure at senior level.  I would suggest that the Minister examine in some detail the situation obtaining and possibly consider making some major changes in that area.</P>
    <P>We found at the Joint Committee that the appointment of a chairman on a part-time basis&mdash;I should say that this was my personal observation&mdash;coupled with the workings of a general manager and the remainder of senior management meant that the everyday decision-making was not responding to the needs of such a complex transport authority. That is an area in which there is possibly a need for a new national transport supremo responsible for everyday decision-making and for responding and reporting to the Minister and his officials. At present an arms-length semi-State organisation, operating not on a profit-making basis, and which cannot be based on the desirability of providing a social service only, creates a situation in which their operations and method of reporting gives them&mdash;unfairly&mdash;an image in the public mind that they are losing vast sums of money.  On that point we asked the management of CIE at the time whether they felt their method of communicating the actual results of their financial year was in their opinion giving their organisation the image it deserved. They replied that, yes, they probably had this image of losing money, an image which was not justified.</P>
    <P>In regard to the rail sector perhaps the Minister would examine the possibility of making that part of the subvention above rather than below the line, as an actual subvention to cover loss, because I do not think that is quite what it is, although it is very often written up as being a loss. Indeed the chairman of CIE reflected on that point in his review of their 1978 report when he referred to most of our EEC partners and their difficulties in operating a rail service contending that, without exception throughout Europe, the operation of a rail service is not a financial proposition, if one is to consider it in the normal, commercial, profit-making <Col N="807" /> sense.  Therefore, in that area of transport policy there is need for a fundamental shift in financial reporting and management.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning a couple of aspects of the Minister's speech to the Institute of Transport because he has very rapidly put his finger on a number of main areas and shown great awareness of those warranting attention. On that occasion, 7 February last, very soon after the Minister had taken up office, he said that at that stage he had an open mind on the issues involved and that he was not excluding any options. That is probably the type of approach we should have to transport policy at present.  I think there would be an agreement on all sides of the House that transport policy and infrastructural requirements for the present decade will be something completely different from the demands of the past.  I do not think the old way of organising a transport policy of co-ordinating development with our infrastructure will suffice for the challenge ahead.  I suggest that in evolving a transport policy instant action is needed, plus the formulation of a medium to longer term policy.</P>
    <P>When considering immediate action we can all dwell at great length on the transport demands of Dublin city and county.  I represent a County Dublin constituency with tremendous growth and the development of two satellite towns, each of which is estimated to have a population of over 100,000 by the end of the eighties.  One realises that the demand for an efficient transport system will be more demanding in these areas than ever before.</P>
    <P>In the NESC report Professor Foster said he was not in favour of the toll road system.  The report argues against the introduction of toll roads, noting that the proportion of national income spent on road development has fallen over the past decade.  The report said that, while increased spending on the road network was justified, it should not be undertaken too quickly since this could lead to supply shortages and sharp increases in construction costs.  That paragraph was also <Col N="808" /> quoted in <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>I cannot see how any Government can provide the funds necessary and at the pace needed to improve the infrastructure in my constituency without seriously considering the need for a toll road system.  The toll system has been implemented in some of the wealthiest countries of the world and has proved effective. That system means that the people making the maximum use of the roads contribute to their maintenance.</P>
    <P>Three major national roads pass through west County Dublin&mdash;the Naas Road, the Western Road and the Navan Road.  A great deal of money will be needed to develop these roads and the surrounding areas.  They will demand an imbalance in investment compared with similar sections of roadway throughout the country.  I suggest that the Minister, in consulation with the Minister for the Environment who recently charted his intentions for a national road network for the end of the eighties, should discuss the possibility of accumulating funds and of voting them directly into infrastructural improvements.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the demands for massive investment in a transport policy and in the immediate requirements of CIE are considerable. If we do not make vast sums available we will not be able to make the necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>I have to disagree with Deputy Deasy's remarks about the rapid rail system.  The time for further consideration and discussion is long gone.  We should be beyond the point of deciding whether to have an electric or diesel rail system.  I am glad to note CIE have gone beyond that point.  The Coalition were in Government when CIE's recommendations were made known.  It was a very difficult decision to arrive at because it involved a commitment of over £200 million to have the scheme fully implemented. The decision has now been taken and I hope the work will soon be under way.</P>
    <P>We should consider having the new rail system operated by an organisation other than CIE.  This is another aspect of the discussions we had at the Joint Oireachtas Committee.  CIE are the <Col N="809" /> body providing the actual transport but they tend to get involved in other work&mdash;developing the rail system, building buses and so on when they should be buying these services, equipment or transport vehicles.  When they co-operate in a manufacturing facility to assemble buses straightaway there is a drain of key management personnel.  If CIE take over the new rail system the cream of their engineering staff will be sucked into the new capital development programme and the other aspects of transport policy&mdash;operating the equipment and the rail system&mdash;will deteriorate.</P>
    <P>In their annual report and in their submission to the Oireachtas Committee they said they were curtailing staff recruitment.  They will probably recruit staff for these capital projects, but I suggest the new system would develop more quickly if CIE did not get too involved in providing the facilities needed to improve the transport facilities available to the community.  That is possibly an over-simplification of a complex issue, but it should be looked at.  I have no doubt that the Minister will look at that aspect of the transport policy and see what can be done to improve the service being provided by CIE.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one recommendation in the report which has already been superseded by the Minister. The report said that action might be facilitated if responsibility for transport in general were centred in a single Department of State.  It went on to say that in relation to Dublin transport, pending a decision as to whether a transport authority should be established, a desirable first step would be the establishment of a co-ordinating committee to direct the implementation of transport improvements and to supervise planning, such as was recommended eight years ago by the Dublin Transportation Study.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there is a need for a consultative group to pull together all the strands under the guidance of the Minister in order to ensure that we make <Col N="810" /> a start in Dublin, because transport policy will have to evolve out of Dublin nationwide.  The biggest difficulties and problems are in Dublin and if they are tackled first a lot of very advantageous benefits will spin off in improved transport policies throughout the country. Therefore, I compliment Deputy Quinn on introducing the motion, which is to note the report.  I have no doubt that the Minister will do that and we are looking forward to some new major emphasis on transport policy from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the report of the NESC on transport policy, which I suspect will be known henceforth as the Foster report, we are told in the introduction on page 10 that:</P>
      <P>The transport problem in Ireland is no longer one of information, so much as of decisive action.</P>
      <P>Surely all of us here, no matter on which side of the House we are, will find ourselves in agreement with that comment. After the wave of reports, studies and consultations that we have had about the transport situation in Ireland generally and in Dublin in particular, we must admit that there is now sufficient information available on the basis of which we might determine a national transportation policy.  What is required and what, with the best will in the world from our new Minister, we have not yet quite seen is the political will to make the decisions and the commitment to make available the financial resources required to implement such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will disagree with me when I argue that the transportation problem in Ireland has now reached crisis proportions. This problem has several main aspects.  In the first place the CIE rail system, in particular the Dublin com muter system, is on the verge of collapse, if that is not too strong a word, because of the rundown of rolling stock and general under-investment.  When I am talking about CIE in this context it would be unrealistic of me to blame this Government for some of the problems which CIE face and which they have inherited <Col N="811" /> not just from this Government but from the preceding Government and the Government preceding the preceding Government.  Be that as it may, we are now faced with the present situation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are traffic chaos and endless delays in movement in our larger cities and towns.  Thirdly, some of our national road networks are grossly inferior in terms of carrying the transport load they are expected to carry. Fourthly, a particular responsibility of the present Government&mdash;road maintenance&mdash;appears to have ground to a halt in recent months.  I do not know how many Members of the House listen to the early morning programmes on RTE.  The state of our roads has now become a national joke on the national radio station, and much as the Minister and Government Deputies may wince when they hear the &ldquo;Potholers' Club&rdquo; referred to once again on RTE in the morning, there is not a comeback because the state of affairs is pretty much as it is described.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, the absence of any fair policy in relation to public transport fares now makes it prohibitive for low income families to travel at all except where necessary for work or other essential reasons.  Sixthly, in many parts of the country people who are without private transport face great difficulty in travelling outside the national rail and bus network because of continuing cut-backs in localised public transport.  Seventh, workers in most rural areas face a real cut in their living standards this year due to petrol price rises including the massive increased tax on petrol announced in the budget.  The absence of effective public transport in most areas of the country means that they must continue to use private transport.</P>
    <P>I remember arguing on the budget last year with Deputy Callanan on the other side of the House, who has plenty of experience of the degree to which the private car is perforce used as an essential method of getting to work in many rural areas.  He was defending the decision to take off tax on private cars in relation to this need for people to use <Col N="812" /> private transport to get themselves to work.  I wonder how he and other Government Deputies feel this year with the so-called registration fee doubled and with the massive increase in the price of petrol.  They can hardly justify it on the same grounds as they justified the taking off of the car tax last year.</P>

      <P>The year before.  In relation to CIE, while there may be some room for efficiency&mdash;though not as much as is generally thought&mdash;at certain levels, it could be argued that the subsidy to the company is too low by international standards.  We have yet to face up to the fact that if we are going to have an effective public transport system we have to pay for it.  The allocation to the company this year is the same as for last year at around £56 million.  At a time of almost runaway inflation clearly this means higher fares or a reduction in services and possibly both.</P>
      <P>The Foster Report makes it clear&mdash;and here again there is perhaps all-party agreement&mdash;that one of the greatest single difficulties in relation to transport policy is that it is too fragmented. No one Minister or body is responsible for it.  The Minister for Transport, the Minister for the Environment, local authorities and CIE all share responsibility in one degree or another.  It can hardly be wondered that we do not have a national transportation policy if we have not some form of centralised, if not control, at least direction and oversight of all the myriad problems that are to be faced in the elaboration of such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons we in the Labour Party favour the re-allocation of responsibility for transport policy to one Department of State.  If it has to be under a Fianna Fáil Minister I would be as happy to have it in the hands of the present Minister as of any other.  In addition we favour in each of our larger urban areas the creation of a single transportation authority under the Department of State concerned.  This is the only approach which will bring order into <Col N="813" /> decision-making in this vital area.  If order and efficiency are to be created in a transport area we need early decisions from the Government on other matters in addition to those already mentioned, and I stress early decisions.  The casual observer might be misled by the Government amendment to our motion here this evening into the belief that the Government do intend to take urgent decisions. With due respect to the Minister and the Government, the terms of their amendment amount to no such indication of intent.  The amendment is designed simply to try to soften the cutting edge of the motion, but I am afraid it does not succeed in doing that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the areas in which decisions are necessary we need a clear decision by the Government first of all on the role which they envisage for public transport in the future, the extent to which it will be available to meet the reasonable demands of the population and the degree to which public transport should be subsidised in the future.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we favour the improvement of public transport services, not their cutback.  We favour their improvement on grounds of social equity and not least of energy conservation. We also need a clear decision on the respective roles of rail and road transport in the future, not only in relation to the movement of passengers but also in relation to the movement of goods.  Our present rail and road national links are inadequate.  The question now is: how much can each be improved and what weighting should be given to both in the future?  Finally, we need urgent and early decision on traffic management in our larger cities.  The traffic crisis in Dublin and Cork in particular is a scandal.  All the information on which to make decisions in these cities is now available, yet the decisions are not being made.</P>
    <P>I wish now to expand in a little more detail on the role of CIE which carries a major responsibility in this area.  It is only fair to remark, in defence of an organisation which is often the butt end of many of our more bitter jokes, that it <Col N="814" /> does not come out of the Foster Report at all badly.  Page 136, paragraph 1114 of the report notes quite categorically &ldquo;We believe CIE have a far from inefficient organisation&rdquo;.  The double negative is not exactly flattering.  On the other hand, the general thrust of the paragraph is clear.  These consultants, who on the basis of some other animad versions in their report are not as favourable to the idea of public transport as we in the Labour Party might like them to be, at least acknowledged that considerable efforts have been made within CIE to improve the efficiency and that these efforts have by and large borne fruit.</P>
    <P>In relation to the more detailed aspects of CIE operations, it must be borne in mind that many of the problems for which CIE are blamed have their origin in other places.  The buck does not necessarily stop on the desk of the chairman of CIE, although there are a few which do, and should, stop there.  In many cases, they ought to stop elsewhere, and, in particular, they ought to stop on the desk of responsible Government Ministers.  Here again I want to make a non-party point.  I believe that all politicians are to some extent to blame for the absence over the years of a coherent and consistent policy in relation to the provision of public transport facilities in our country.  TDs and Senators on both sids of either House will rant and rave about the increased size of the subsidy being demanded by CIE yet again this year.  If they are on the Government side, and more particularly if they are in Cabinet and if they do not hold with the Ministry of Tourism and Transport, they will be even more opposed to the cries for further subsidies which they perceive as coming from an organisation which does not deserve further subsidy.  Yet if there is any one thing which will make a public representative squeal more loudly than an increase in subsidy being allocated to CIE, it is a decision by CIE, on grounds of essential cuts or efficiency, to remove or curtail a transport service within their constituency.  We must all as public <Col N="815" /> representatives, face the fact that we cannot have it both ways.  We cannot look to CIE to provide a national transport service, more especially within our own constituency area and this will apply with special force to rural Deputies&mdash;and at the same time complain, gripe, groan and moan that it takes public money to keep them running.</P>
    <P>We should not forget the origins of CIE. CIE, in their origins, were not part of a great socialist take-over of a highly profitable enterprise&mdash;far from it.  The origins of CIE are to be found in a crumbling private enterprise system of transport which was plainly not delivering the goods because it could not afford, on ordinary, commercial, capitalist grounds to provide the social services which were needed.  As one sector after another of this private transport system began to crumble the need for a national transportation authority became evident and CIE was born.  The irony is that, having created a national transportation agency in CIE, we stopped at that. We did not see the need to integrate the work of a national transportation agency with a national transportation policy. We assumed that one would do duty for the other and are now reaping the fruits of this neglect.</P>
    <P>In passing I should like to say a very small word, as someone who drives around the city of Dublin most days and has driven through many other of our cities as well&mdash;in favour of the Dublin bus driver.  Again, the Dublin bus driver is the butt of many jokes, some of them unkind.  I do not know which of us in this House has ever had to pilot one of these enormous vehicles through the chaos, through the snarling mass of vehicles that goes by the name of commuter traffic in Dublin these days.  Bus drivers have to do it many hours a day, often during unsocial hours and in my experience, as the driver of an ordinary car, you are ten times as likely to receive courtesy from the drivers of many private vehicles on the road today.  That point should be made in fairness to the bus drivers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> My final point in relation to CIE is really a culmination of the points I have been making up to now.  We cannot allow it to be said that public transport should be provided solely on the basis of the ethics of a market place.  If we decided that a long time ago, we would have an entirely different kind of transport service and one which would not go even as far towards meeting our needs as the present CIE system does. We have long since acknowledged, however grudgingly, that the needs of essential social services, such as health, education and similar matters, are of such overall public concern that they cannot be left to private whim and to the length of the individual's pocket.  We look now to the Government, despite their idealogical bias in other directions, to establish the same claim for a national transportation policy.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of roads. Towards the beginning of my speech I drew attention to the fact that the road maintenance programme is severely at risk in view of the cutbacks of the present administration.  I urge on that administration that even at this late stage they should take some heart from the report and put at least some substantial amount of money into the business of maintaining our road network and, if at all possible, into improving it.  I take the point in the report that even if one had all the money in the EEC or wherever one could not lump it all into the provisions of new roads or the maintenance of existing ones because one might have a squeeze on the supply side as a result in that private enterprises who repair and build roads would be able to squeeze prices up.  Some of the things that happened in relation to house building over the past few years make that point even more dramatically.  However something must be done.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many Members travel the main road to Limerick or Cork very often but if they do they will have occasion to pass through the town of Naas and will know that if one leaves Dublin travelling towards the south or south-west anytime after 8 a.m. and <Col N="817" /> before 7 p.m. one can add anything from 30 to 90 minutes on to the time of the journey.  This will be accounted for solely by the length of time it takes to get through Naas.  That is a dramatic example. One would assume that such a town being on a major road would have had urgent attention, but it has not.  I should like to see it getting more attention from the Government in terms of capital expenditure than it has had up to now.</P>
    <P>Another thing the Government ought to be doing which, with all due respect when I look at the road programme I do not see much evidence of, is identifying those areas where the minimum of expenditure would produce the maximum social benefit in terms of road expenditure. Naas is an obvious example.  I hope I shall not be accused of undue parochialism if I single out a project which is in my own constituency.  It is the Dundrum by-pass.  It could be argued that it is quicker these days to commute into Dublin from Drogheda than it is from Dundrum.  One can get a train from Drogheda to the centre of the town in less time than it takes at rush hour to come from Dublin 14 into the centre of the city.  I shall not deal with the saga of the famous Dundrum line which was closed down under a previous administration.  This road improvement, relatively inexpensive in itself, falls into the category of road improvements which, while not hugely expensive, would have a disproportionately large beneficial social effect.</P>
    <P>Another matter which concerns not just my constituency but neighbouring ones is the Southern Cross Route. Before the last general election we had a commitment from the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Soon to be known as the Southern Crucifixion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it would be supported by them.  There has been a lot of foot dragging on this and it is usually justified on the grounds that they have to wait for proposals to come from Dublin County Council.  There is a certain <Col N="818" /> degree of truth in this and Dublin County Council have their own problems in relation to the Southern Cross Route.  The irony is that the Minister for the Environment has sanctioned a CPO for an alternative road to the Southern Cross Route, known as the Green Route, which was explicitly rejected by Dublin County Council because it would direct too much heavy traffic into high density urban areas.  I ask the Government to make sense of the conjunction of a commitment to the Southern Cross Route and the endorsement of a CPO for a road that is designed to do something entirely different.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with some of the things the Minister said recently about car parking in Dublin.  I made a suggestion to him in a letter by way of a postscript, not entirely seriously but not entirely jocosely either.  There is one sure and simple way to solve the problem of illegal parking in Dublin and that is to allow anybody who finds a car parked on a double yellow line to keep it.  That would put a sharp stop to some of the problems we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The transport authority that must eventually be established for Dublin must take into account that Dublin is no longer just a city with a periphery.  It is a city with a centre and a number of growth centres dotted around its rim.  We must look at the provision of transport services not only in the light of providing a public transport service between the periphery and the centre but between different parts of the periphery. If one wants to go from one part of the <Col N="819" /> periphery to another one must first go into town and out again.  One of the exceptions is the famous No. 18 bus route which runs around the edge of the city and whose run is extended in the summer in order to bring residents of the working class suburbs on the western side of the city to the sea to swim. Otherwise they would have to go all the way into town and all the way out again. Any policy, whether related to roads, CIE or the planning of bus routes, should take this factor into account.</P>
      <P>In the Labour Party we believe in public transport and that the major reason why it is not doing its job properly is that it is not being allowed to do so.  There is no sense in saying that private transport would do the job better. There is no way in which a privately owned bus will get from Dundrum to O'Connell Bridge any quicker than a publicly owned bus.  The reason one does not travel any faster than the other is not related to ownership but to traffic controls, management systems and overall Government policy in relation to roads and public transport.</P>
      <P>I make the plea to people to consider the role of CIE as an essential public service which is under-subsidised by comparison with many other European cities and which, given half a chance, will do the job extremely well.  There is a contradiction in the Foster report which notes that the motor car is the dominant method of transport at present and simultaneously notes that probably less than half the households in the country actually have a car.  This is a dilemma they did not face up to themselves.  If they and the Government were to face up to it properly we would come to the conclusion that public transport is the better bet for a speedy and satisfactory urban transport system for the majority of the population.</P>

      <P>I will instance it for the Deputy and I am sure that he is not so naive as not to have listened to it before on several occasions.  The increase in the capital allocation to CIE has gone from £15 million in 1979 to £25 million in 1980.  Of that amount £10 million is for the railway electrification programme and £15 for the modernisation of the other sections of CIE.  On top of that £25 million there is a subvention of £56 million towards the running costs of CIE.  I should like to ask Deputies Horgan and Deasy if they feel that the Government should continuously offer an open cheque to CIE.  Do they believe that this subvention should go on forever?  Can we justify paying out of this year's budget £71 million?  We have heard a lot about the PAYE sector and it is their taxes we are talking about in regard to this subvention.  I should like to know if Deputies would agree that that should continue indefinitely as if money was growing on apple trees?  We must stop and reorganise.  That is what we are doing.  That is the difference between the contribution of Deputy Quinn and other Members.  Deputy Quinn looked at the problem in a fair manner.  Members cannot say, on the one hand, that CIE cannot be stopped and, on the other hand, ask &ldquo;Where do we stop&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital budget indicated the Government's commitment to the Department as a whole. Last year £38 million was allocated for capital purposes and this was increased to £58.46 million this year.  That should quench the argument put forward by Opposition Deputies forever.  Deputy Horgan spoke eloquently about the problem of the <Col N="821" /> Dublin bus drivers.  I agree that their job is very frustrating and that it is getting worse daily but the Department cannot solve their problem.</P>

Opposition Deputies should turn their attention to their own political parties who control the corporation and then spread their wings to their friends on the county council.  Deputy Horgan spent some time talking about the Dundrum route and made some valid points, but he is wasting the time of the House bringing up that problem here.  The solution to the problem of the Dublin bus driver rests with Fine Gael, Labour and the other political parties who have joined together to keep Fianna Fáil out of power on those bodies.</P>

      <P>It would be a profitable proposition for the corporation and the county council to provide proper car parking facilities because they would be filled regularly.  Many Deputies, in mentioning potholes on roads throughout the country, referred to the joke on the radio every morning about this.  Deputy Horgan has a misconception about the &ldquo;Pothole Club&rdquo;.  I believe he is mixing that up with citizen band radio.  We filled that pothole in our own positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago the corporation and the county council spent weeks considering the striking of a rate.  Following protests and walk-outs they refused to strike a rate on the basis that central Government should subsidise the rate. This year those authorities have been permitted to strike a rate which is 10 per cent in excess of last year's figure. Would Opposition Deputies strike a rate in excess of 10 per cent this year?  In spite of what those Deputies have said, there are no potholes on rural roads.  In my county we are proud of the fine roadways we have.  We spent our money in our time wisely and well.  The roads in Galway are unique.  When travelling from my constituency to Dublin one passes through Athlone to Kinnegad, a fine main arterial road and one does not run into a problem until Lucan.  A few years ago Deputies Horgan, Quinn and Deasy, when Members of another House, argued consistently with me about a gentleman, a member of the Labour Party, who, as Minister for Local Government, took away the capital allocation to the county council to complete that portion of the road. Since 1977 between 12 and 14 miles of that road has been completed.  Dublin County Council should exercise pressure on the Department of the Environment <Col N="823" /> to complete that portion of the road.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister gave an in-depth report which clearly and unequivocally pronounced the Government's road and transport policies on this intricate problem.  The question of establishing a Dublin transport authority will be dealt with in the commission's report to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I did not regard Deputy Quinn's comparison of transport and health service policies as a good analogy.  The health services truly can be regarded as a necessity of life. Apart from that the Deputy's contribution was quite good.  The Minister has said that the Government appreciate the need to review transport policy from time to time in the light of changing circumstances. It was for that reason that the commission were set up.  It was appreciated that there was a need to review the ituation in view of CIE's position.  It must be remembered that the Dublin city bus service in 1969 made a profit of £61,000 but in 1979 lost £12.8 million.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for the debate.  When opening it I said I hoped the debate would be constructive because what we are looking for are decisions.  In fairness to all who have contributed, the debate has been constructive, but keeping to the spirit of the debate I must say there has not been a decision nor have we had an indication of the kind of decisions we may be getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion was specific.  It asked the House to take note of the report and went on to request the Minister to announce a commitment to eliminate duplication of transport administration and to establish a Dublin transportation authority.  We did not try to set out the form that authority would take and we did not attempt to tell the Minister how duplication should be eliminated.  We appreciate that that is a job for the Minister.  Frankly, I am disappointed that the new Minister, whose political <Col N="824" /> skill and courage I have no reason to doubt, was not able to indicate that he personally recognises there is duplication and that he would like to eliminate it.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the Minister's speech on the motion but I cannot find any indication in it of any proposed action to eliminate duplication.  In fairness to the House, I should say that the Minister expressed recognition of the duplication.  As I said, the Minister's personal commitment to do something about it is not there.  Where does that leave us?  The report in question is a substantial one.  There are many parts of it on which fundamentally we disagree but it poses a question about decisions that have to be made.  Like all such reports, including that produced by the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas and many others going back to 1971, we find the same kind of recommendations in principle.</P>
    <P>We had hoped something more would be achieved this time.  The motion is in the names of all of my colleagues in this party and none of us can see why the Minister could not have given us that commitment last night.  Such a commitment would have been particularly useful for Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council who have refused to buy a pig in a poke, who rightly refuse to make decisions about road planning for transport until they have seen the colour of Fianna Fáil's money.  Both Dublin councils have refused to commit themselves to major road plans without commitment from the Government and I refer to successive Governments.  There are historical reasons for that.</P>
    <P>I hope the absence of a transport policy can be remedied as soon as possible so that the local authorities' reservations can be removed.  I draw the attention of the House to pieces of property in this city which have been made derelict by the presence of a yellow line on a map brought about by a decision of city and county councillors.  These sites have remained blighted ever since because the necessary funds to implement the decision which they courageously took in their innocence in those days did not <Col N="825" /> come through from central government, Governments of different complexions. For that reason they are rightly refusing to commit themselves and the property of the city and the people around it until such time as they get a clear commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to clarify, and one of them certainly is for the benefit of the Minister of State.  First is the ideological question about the philosophical approach to transport policy.  Deputy Killilea, in reply to our submission, stated that because Fianna Fáil had made extra funds available to CIE, therefore this was evidence of their commitment to the public transport system and evidence of their commitment to some of their capital programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The belief that any problem can be solved by throwing sufficient sums of money at it is peculiarly a capitalist one, and it is not one that we <Col N="826" /> share.  Some problems cannot be solved by simply throwing money at them.  To simply argue in defence that because extra funds are being made available therefore the philosophical basis is the same does not meet the case.  We have argued that it was the labour movement that took health care out of the market place, so that people do not die because they do not have the money as they did in the past.  Fianna Fáil in return argue that that was a basic fundamental human right and because people could die one could not possibly argue on that score.  But the same argument applies in relation to education, where people do not die from the lack of it: it also has been taken out of the market place.  The Minister attempted to reply to the statement I made and he said that the idea that there is no social conscience in the Government in relation to public transport is not borne out by the fact that £56 million was given to CIE last year and that surely there was an obvious recognition of a social commitment there.  He said that the suggestion put forward by a right wing banker or economist that the whole thing be put into a social context is wrong.  He said that there is another side of the argument and asked how long the taxpayer would continue to pay.</P>
      <P>No matter what money is spent, whether it is £1 million or £56 million, it should be spent as efficiently as possible, whether it is on health care, education or transport.  So I am with him on that.  We recognise that the money that will go for a public transport system will come out of every one of our pockets.  That is not at issue.  But we are saying that in the absence of clear transport policy local authorities will be forced into making premature decisions about road programmes for which there is no commitment in finance and that consequently when the Minister is at the Cabinet table and the Minister for the Environment is looking for his funds and the Minister for Transport is looking for funds to meet his own various Department Estimates there will be a conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That conflict will not be constructive <Col N="827" /> to the transport of people here if there is no clear transport policy.  I regret to state that we have had no indication that there will be a clear transportation policy.  I hope there will be a clear transportation policy, because it is our view that there are two attitudes to transport competing for scarce funds at the moment.  One is the substantial roads lobby, not represented in this House by the relevant Minister; the other is the public transport lobby.  The funds are limited, and they are limited in any administration.  How is that going to be resolved around the Cabinet table at the moment?  Is it determined by size or by argument or by political intrigue or all the other things which, in the absence of a clear policy, inevitably become the resource to which one applies in order to resolve these difficulties.</P>
    <P>There has got to be a clear transport policy.  We would argue that one more report&mdash;let us call it the McCormack Report&mdash;is not going to throw that much light on the matter so that everything will become illuminated in a way that it is not illuminated now.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to stop the Minister saying here and now in this House that Fianna Fáil believe in a system of transport that would provide equality of access for all of the people of this country and particularly for all of the people of this city irrespective of what age they are, irrespective of what money they have and irrespective of what disability they have in relation to being able to drive or not.  It is sad, but perhaps not inevitable, that no such statement has been made in this House by someone who had the opportunity to do so.  The Minister could have indicated, without pre-empting the conclusions of the McCormack Report, without pre-empting the valuable work that the commission is doing, that on the basis of what is there today there seems to be a substantial case for a transportation authority, that in principle he is in favour of it, that there are issues in relation to contracting services with CIE or running them oneself&mdash;Deputy Lawlor referred to the rapid rail&mdash;and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> I do not wish to be argumentative and I do not wish to score political points, because all of us here suffer from the lack of such a policy.  Getting such a policy through is not easy because a lot of the argument that has got to be made must be made in private, and argument in private against forces and against people who frequently do not appear above the trenches can itself be very difficult and very lonely.  If the Government had behind them a motion in the House passed by all parties, if they had behind them a statement in the House stating that they are committed in principle, the Government would have been that much further down the road.  Regrettably they are not.  The Minister could have spoken in favour of the motion tonight and that would resolve his problems immediately. It would give him a fair stick to do what I think he must do and what, hopefully, Labour participation in any subsequent Government would be able to do.  I use those words advisedly because we have no illusions about the difficulty.  Until such time as roads and transport are under the same political umbrella we are not going to get the sort of transport policy that we need.</P>
    <P>There was a certain phrase used by a former Taoiseach who was rather unceremoniously retired before Christmas who talked about grasping nettles and difficult nettles.  This is, I would suggest, a difficult nettle.  I would like to think the Government have the courage to grasp it.</P>

They will even protect the hands of the Minister of State and I am sure he has had many stings in his time.</P>

      <P>The other reason a decision of this nature is critically important is because the Dublin City Council are being hi-jacked into trying to make decisions in relation to a road system.  They are doing so in the absence of a national transport policy.  They are doing so in the context of the most rapidly developing capital city in the whole of western Europe, where urban transport is a critical component for urban development. Foster states, indeed, that the city planning department are responsible for land use planning and were involved in the Dublin Transportation Study and have produced a long-term plan for the development of new satellite communities. He says it is crucial that adequate transport-facilities be provided for these new developments.  He says that the city planning department have recently prepared a revised city plan but that its publication has been delayed because of the lack of agreement on the transport component of the plan.  One cannot expect responsible local authority members <Col N="830" /> to make decisions in the absence of a clear policy.</P>
      <P>In conclusion we are not asking the Government, in accepting this motion, to commit themselves to something very precise, to box the Minister into something that is very restrictive in terms of the negotiations that must take place.  We are simply asking for a political commitment to tidy up the duplication of administration that exists and, secondly, to establish&mdash;and we will let the Government design the form and shape of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

By supporting this motion the House could give to itself a degree of commitment to the establishment in political terms of a transport policy that is needed and will be needed increasingly in the years to come.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - School Certificate Examinations.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I sought permission to raise on the Adjournment the following matter: the effects of Rule 10 (2) of the Department's rules and programme for the day national certificate examination.  This must be one of these occasions when the Minister comes in wondering what the question is all about.  I asked for permission to raise this matter because I believe the major effects of the rule in question to be twofold, that in both cases they are bad and that something should be done about changing them.  I intend to illustrate my point by quoting from the rules and from a number of Dáil questions that were answered by the Minister within the past few days.  Rule 10 (2) provides that in Irish one-third of the marks are allocated to an oral test and that two-thirds are allocated to a written test, that a candidate will be required to obtain at least 30 per cent in the oral test to qualify for an overall grade of D in the subject or for a higher grade and that a candidate who obtains less than 30 per cent in the oral test will not be awarded a grade in the subject irrespective of the marks obtained in the written test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this rule can be stated simply.  It is that regardless of how well a candidate fares in the written section of the examination, he will not receive any <Col N="833" /> grade unless he achieves at least 30 per cent in the oral part of the examination. On 25 March I asked the Minister for Education if he would give details of the system used for marking the group certificate examination in Irish, both oral and written.  In his reply the Minister informed me that:</P>
    <P>In Irish one-third of the marks is allotted to one oral test and two-thirds to a written test.  A candidate is required to obtain at least 30 per cent in the oral test to qualify for an overall grade of D in the subject or for a higher grade; a candidate who obtains less than 30 per cent in the oral test is not awarded a grade in the subject; irrespective of the marks obtained in the written test.  The detailed instructions to markers of the written test and to the examiners in the oral test are confidential.</P>
    <P>On the same day I asked the Minister for details of the number of students who took the group certificate examination in Irish last year but who were not awarded any grade.  He told me that 12,422 candidates sat for the day vocational group examination in 1979 and that of these 831 were not awarded any grade.  When we look at the marking schemes for this examination we discover that no grade is awarded to a student whose percentage range for the examination is less than 10 per cent and that no grade is awarded either to a student who may have got 40, 50 or 60 per cent in the written section of this examination but who has failed to get at least 30 per cent in the oral part of the examination.  It is not clear from the reply given by the Minister&mdash;though this is for the obvious reason that I did not frame the question in that way&mdash;as to how many of the students who were not awarded any grade in Irish in the group certificate examination met this fate because of their failure in the oral section of the examination or how many were in this position simply because they failed the examination as a whole, getting less than 10 per cent in both oral and written combined.  It is fair to assume that anybody who got less than 10 per cent in <Col N="834" /> the written part of the examination would not do well either in the oral part.</P>
    <P>The significance of this is that failure in this one part of the subject can mean that a student who is otherwise perhaps quite good at the language will fail to get a grade at all.  The consequence of this for students who sit for this examination especially can be very serious because they are required to have, for apprenticeships, a certain number of subjects. Therefore it follows logically that if they fail to get a minimum of 30 per cent at the oral part of this examination, whatever chance they may have of getting Irish as a subject for their group certificate, for apprenticeship purposes, has been totally obliterated.  I would argue that this is, firstly, unfair and, secondly, anti-educational.  It is unfair in the sense that it discriminates against group certificate pupils in a situation in which, for instance, intermediate certificate pupils do not have the same restrictions placed on them by way of an oral examination.  In relation to oral examinations in general I would be at one with the Minister on their importance, in relation to spoken languages generally and to the Irish language in particular. But I feel that to carry it to this length, at a time when the essential Irish requirement has been abolished by and large from the examination system, is a relic of the past at which we should look again.</P>
    <P>I have said also that I regard it as being, to some extent, anti-educational, and more particularly anti-Irish because if we want to encourage the spread and growth of the Irish language; if we want to encourage the study of the Irish language in our schools in general, and in our vocational schools in particular&mdash;which are the schools most closely affected by this&mdash;we should not be maintaining in force a regulation which, in the way in which it is being administered, will tend to suggest to pupils that if they have the option between Irish and another subject, they would be safer choosing the other subject rather than Irish.  I know the Minister, and indeed the Minister of State, would not want <Col N="835" /> this to happen but I put it to him that the objective way in which the system is working makes it far more likely that this will happen than that it will not.  In a non-party way&mdash;because the Irish requirement generally was removed under the last administration, and I suspect that this was simply an oversight at the time&mdash;I would ask the Minister to reexamine the situation with a view to its discriminatory effect and the possible bad effects it has on the degree to which students in our vocational schools, studying for group examination cer tificates in particular will be encouraged to take Irish as a subject.  This is without prejudice to the overall importance of the oral language in examinations.  Indeed I would accept that the number of pupils who fail to get a grade because of the failure to get a minimum of 30 per cent at the oral is probably fairly small. But that, in a sense, sharpens the point I am making.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the situation, to adopt an attitude, and to redraft the rule so that pupils for this examination will be awarded a grade on the basis of their real marks in that examination, however apportioned between oral and written, but not on the basis that they absolutely have to achieve a certain level in either part of the examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the case made by Deputy Horgan.  I am glad that he clarified it because he himself anticipated that there might be some anxiety here as to what precisely he had in mind in connection with the oral Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the permission of the Chair I shall give very quickly the background to it and then perhaps add a comment or two.  Since the day vocational courses and group certificate examinations were instituted it has been Departmental policy that an emphasis be placed on teaching Irish as a spoken language.  To this end syllabuses were constructed, conditions were devised and teachers trained with a view to ensuring that oral Irish should form an integral part of the <Col N="836" /> content of the language lesson.  Nobody was allowed teach Irish without being equipped with a teastas timire Gaeilge. On the course leading to this diploma the method of teaching spoken Irish and comhrá formed an important part.  These conditions were designed to ensure that students who sat for examinations in Irish had every chance of adequate preparation in the oral as well as the written elements.  For the record I should say that anybody who has an arts degree which includes the subject Irish is also qualified to teach Irish in a vocational school.</P>
    <P>Before 1966 the relationship between marks awarded for oral and written Irish in the group certificate examination was 40:60 respectively.  Since 1967 the ratio has been 1:2; that is, 100 marks maximum for the oral test against 200 maximum in the written.  It was thought highly advisable to include a proviso in the conditions for awarding marks to show that a serious attitude was adopted towards the test in oral Irish.  Directives and instructions have been prepared and issued to teachers explaining the width and content of the field to be covered and the criteria by which marks were to be allotted.  Candidates are not examined by their own teachers.  CEOs arrange to exchange teachers between schools.  No teacher is accepted as an examiner without having full qualifications.  It is thought that 30 per cent is not an unreasonable line of demarcation between pass and fail.  If some form of sanction were not introduced it would be possible to certify a candidate as having some knowledge of Irish without him or her having reached any standard whatsoever in oral proficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens in the intermediate certificate examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before these conditions were issued it was thought advisable to consult experienced members of the teaching profession.  No criticism or complaints have been expressed concerning the conditions by teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this sanction were removed it would follow that teachers would incline <Col N="837" /> towards a grammatical translation method which would lean heavily on written questions and the method of answering these on the paper.  This would not be in accord with Government policy to foster spoken Irish in the schools situation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Horgan, as is his custom, is concerned not merely with the maintenance of a <i>status quo</i> but also with examining every possible area in order to ascertain if there is any injustice being done to any one student.  That is a great aim and objective but I was very happy&mdash;and here I speak with some little experience of the teaching of Irish in vocational schools&mdash;that the system allowed me to part with the old emphasis on the modh coinniollach, tuiseal ginideach, the preparation of bun abhairs and poems which meant often that a person could qualify in the subject without necessarily having any proficiency.  I think Deputy Horgan will accept that what we should be doing in our schools at that level is continuing the emphasis on the spoken word.  As one of the examiners in that particular oral examination, I would say that too much stress was never laid on the grammatical correctness of a candidate; if he or she <Col N="838" /> were able to convey their thoughts, albeit in rather imperfect Irish, if they could communicate at all, generally speaking, from my experience, examiners were very sympathetic.  While I agree with Deputy Horgan that we must always be mindful that we do not even appear to cause any injustice to a candidate, I should like to hear him, at some future date, on how we could re-arrange what is there, so that these examinations, especially those in respect of the Irish language, are not akin to what obtained when I was at school with the subject of Latin, when there was this grammatical emphasis.</P>
    <P>Irish is not a dead language and we want it to be a spoken language.  In those circumstances the requirement of 30 per cent for somebody who has come from the national school, who has been for two or perhaps three years in the vocational school, is not being unreasonable and is in accord with what we would wish to do for the language.</P>

    <P>In regard to (c) of the question, presumably what is in mind is the tax payable as a result of the provisions of section 28, Finance Act, 1974, which restrict personal reliefs where a farmer has non-farm income and his farming profits are exempt from tax&mdash;the rateable valuation of the farm being over £20 but under the threshold for liability to tax on farming profits.  This restriction applies in connection with the tax charge on the non-farming income.  It is estimated that the additional yield arising from this measure will be of the order of £¾ million in 1980.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to the Deputy's previous question on 22 November 1979, the text of the proposed directive is being brought to finality by the Council. Discussions have been more protracted than anticipated and it is now expected that the directive will be formally adopted in the coming months.</P>

      <P>Toureenard national school now has an enrolment of 21 pupils.

      <P>The person concerned originally claimed injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme on 29 May 1978 in respect of an ankle injury on 26 November 1977.</P>
      <P>Following investigation of the claim, it was decided on 6 September 1978 that the employment in which the injury occurred was not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  The claim for injury benefit was disallowed.</P>
      <P>Subsequently the claimant appealed against the decision that the employment was not insurable.  The appeal was heard on 7 September 1979 when it was decided that the employment was insurable.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the revised decision the claim for injury benefit was allowed for the period from 26 November 1977 to 1 May 1978, the date of the last certificate received.  Payment of the total amount of injury benefit due has now been made.</P>

As he has not submitted medical evidence of incapacity after that date he did not claim disability benefit from my Department.  It is understood however that he resumed work in August 1978.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded a widow's contributory pension at the maximum rate appropriate to a widow with no dependent children and a pension order book payable from 24 August 1979 was issued to her.  Arrears of pension from 8 June 1979 were withheld pending return of the pension book in payment of invalidity pension which she was receiving up to the date of her husband's death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> She continued to cash the invalidity pension but as invalidity pension and widow's pension are not payable concurrently it was necessary to recall both pension books in October 1979 to recover the amount overpaid to her.  The widow's pension book was re-issued payable from 7 December 1979 and an adjusting payment was issued to her at the same time.</P>
    <P>The pension number quoted by the Deputy refers to another widow who lives in the same street.  A somewhat similar situation arose in her case but the matter has now been resolved.  The widow's pension book which had been recalled has been returned to the widow and she has received an adjusting payment after account was taken of the amount of invalidity pension overpaid to her.</P>

      <P>1.  My Department do not operate any vessels for use in fisheries inspection.</P>
      <P>2.  There are four small boats&mdash;all under 17 ft. in length in use by the scientific staff of my Department.  Each vessel would be operated by one man.</P>
      <P>3.  It is expected that work on the construction of a new fisheries research vessel will commence later this year.  Present plans are that the vessel will have an overall length of 47.50m., and will be slightly less than 500 gross registered tonnage and fitted with 1.500 hp engine. The design of the vessel provides for a crew complement of 14 with additional accommodation for at least six scientific staff.</P>
