      <P>Last week I had a question down to the Minister for Finance asking him to clarify the position about a marginal tax relief in the budget and you, Sir, turned it down very peculiarly on the basis that it was anticipating the budget debate.  It is very difficult to debate the budget if we cannot be precisely clear about what the Minister means.  This week I had a question down to the Taoiseach asking him about his attitude to the EMS after 12 months of membership and you, Sir, turned it down on the basis that it was anticipating the debate on the budget.

      <P>On this question of availability of the speech, I wonder would it be possible, to prevent any disagreement and to avoid creating an unwelcome precedent, for the Minister to pause for a moment and make sure that copies of his speech are distributed to Members of the Opposition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it will be some minutes before they are available.  If I may say so, I do not think the House will find itself at a disadvantage that they are not immediately available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sat there for five to ten minutes on many occasions without having had a copy of a ministerial script.  If the Deputy wants to make a big bruhaha of this because he has been delayed two minutes he is free to do so.  I suppose I may start again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to legislate for the implementation of arrangements negotiated by the employer organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government last year in the national understanding under which the Government undertook to underwrite a shortfall of up to 5,000 jobs in the employment target for the year, to be achieved by a special joint public and private sector employment programme. This programme was to be financed jointly by Government and employers, with each contributing a maximum of £10 <Col N="215" /> million.  The Bill provides, therefore, for the establishment of a £20 million employment guarantee fund and for the collection of a surcharge of 0.35 per cent on the employer's social security contribution for the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1980.</P>
    <P>The guarantee programme is an important element of the national understanding. It is seen by the parties as a practical measure to give effect to their shared commitment to employment.  It provides a unique opportunity to take steps quickly to support employment creation or the maintenance of employment in areas where action is most urgently needed.  It also provides an opportunity for the development of useful projects which in the normal course would not get off the ground quickly.</P>
    <P>At the outset I would like to pay tribute to the participants in the tripartite committee set up under the terms of the national understanding to oversee the employment guarantee and other measures on employment.  The representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry, without exception, displayed a constructive and understanding attitude which was essential for the successful working of the committee.</P>
    <P>While, of course, the members of the tripartite committee had as their primary objective the generation of additional employment to make good a shortfall of 5,000 jobs on the employment target for the year, they showed a keen appreciation of the realities and issues we have to face.  I should like to mention just one illustration. The withdrawal of the employment maintenance scheme at the end of this month as a result of objections from the EEC Commission presented a real threat to the position of many firms in the clothing, textiles and footwear industry in this country.  The members of the tripartite committee have agreed to the use of portion of the employers' contribution to the employment guarantee fund to finance a replacement scheme which will assist the <Col N="216" /> threatened firms for the remainder of 1980.  This shows a responsible and practical appreciation on the part of the committee of the fact that, in present circumstances, employment maintenance can be as important as the creation of new employment.</P>
    <P>Before going on to describe the achievements to date of the tripartite committee, I should like to say a few words about the general outlook for employment in 1980.  As Deputies realise, our situation cannot be viewed in isolation from what is expected to happen on the broader international plane.  In the OECD, expectations for 1980 in regard to performance in all areas of economic activity have had to be reduced, directly as a result of the higher prices for oil which each economy in the area now has to bear.  For the current year, the forecast is that economic growth in the OECD will be much lower than last year.</P>
    <P>Accompanying this lower level of activity will be a rise in unemployment in most member countries, an increase which will be quite sharp in certain instances. The EEC Commission see the outlook in much the same light.  Their recently published annual report on the economic situation of the Community forecasts a slowdown in economic growth in 1980.  The growth in total employment experienced last year is likely to be arrested and, with the continuing rise in the population of working age, unemployment is likely to rise again somewhat in the Community as a whole and, on the basis of present or anticipated policies, to grow to 6.2 per cent of the labour force.</P>
    <P>While we will have to accept that our target of a 25,000 increase in numbers in employment this year will not be achieved, our performance compares more than favourably with that of many of our EEC and OECD partners.  The present reality of an unfavourable international economic environment must be squarely recognised.  Our target must be to consolidate the progress we have already made and, having done so, to seek to advance further to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> The Government regard employment as a paramount priority.  Accordingly, when settling the public expenditure allocations for 1980, I focused on certain expenditure programmes as being critical to the attainment of our employment objectives and dealt with them on a priority basis.</P>
    <P>Although the rate of growth of public expenditure has been sharply curtailed in line with the need to get Government borrowing under control, I provided for an increase of 32 per cent in the provisions for infrastructural investment in the Public Capital Programme over what was spent last year.  The development of our infrastructure not only provides substantial on-site employment but also is a powerful inducement to the growth of industrial employment in the future.</P>
    <P>I also provided for increases in excess of the general norm in the allocations for the Industrial Development Authority and Coras Tráchtála, whose activities are so important to the development of industrial employment.  Over the last few years the sterling work of the IDA has resulted in a record number of new job approvals, a substantial number of which will be coming on stream this year.  The large 1980 public capital programme allocation for industrial promotion will, I believe, enable the IDA to reach its target of 30,000 new job approvals this year, thereby sustaining the momentum of employment growth in industry.</P>
    <P>The present depressed state of international labour markets shows our employment achievements during 1979 in a particularly favourable light.  Final figures for employment for the year are not yet available but there are firm indications that total employment during the year grew by about 15,000.  We did not, therefore, reach the level of employment creation we had hoped for but, in a year in which we were beset by international and domestic economic difficulties, the increased employment recorded represents a very creditable achievement.</P>
    <P>The Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment met for the first time in <Col N="218" /> September 1979.  They concluded that a substantial shortfall on the employment target for the year was inevitable and decided, therefore, to trigger the employment guarantee mechanism.  The committee have been meeting regularly since then to consider proposals for employment creation in both the public and private sectors.  The broad allocations approved to date by the committee account for about £18 million of the £20 million available for special employment initiatives.  The balance of the fund will be allocated very shortly.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the committee's decision to finance from the employers' contribution to the employment guarantee fund a temporary scheme of assistance to be known as the &ldquo;employers' temporary subvention&rdquo; in place of the employment maintenance scheme. A noteworthy feature of the new scheme, which will run for the remainder of 1980 is a requirement that firms employing more than 100 persons must submit development plans if they are to be eligible for the full benefits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Committee have also decided to support a special national programme for the provision of sport and recreation facilities which the Taoiseach proposed to the social partners in his consultations with them.  The need for major sport centres, community recreation and sports centres and outdoor pursuits centres has for a long time been keenly felt by communities all over the country.  The decision to provide these facilities will therefore be generally welcomed&mdash;particularly by young people.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the facilities being provided will not be for the exclusive use of a particular group or groups within a community.  It is a condition of support for these projects that there should be general access to them.  I want to stress also that these sport and recreational projects will be in addition to the schemes for youth and sport already financed by the Government through the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Other projects or initiatives for which fund approval has been given include: a 1,000-job public sector programme including <Col N="219" /> environmental improvement schemes, temporary youth employment projects, tourist amenities and county development team projects; a temporary extension of the employment incentive scheme to cover the payment of a temporary supplementary premium of £10 per week in respect of all eligible persons under the scheme and a further temporary supplementary premium of £10 per week in the case of each eligible person who has also been on the live register for at least 26 weeks in the 12 months immediately preceding employment under the scheme.  The supplementary measures came into effect on 31 December 1979 and are due to terminate on 30 June next; recruitment of 200 additional engineering apprentices under a scheme to be sponsored by AnCO; construction of an airport at Waterford; provision of a dredger for Waterford harbour to be built by Ross Company Ltd., New Ross.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the employment guarantee fund is jointly financed by the Government and by the employers' organisations.  The Government's contribution of £10 million will be provided from moneys to be voted by Dáil Éireann.  Last December the Dáil approved an additional Estimate for £3 million to enable spending on approved job-creation schemes to get under way. A further £7 million has been included in the 1980 Book of Estimates presented to the Dáil last month.</P>
    <P>The employers' £10 million is to be raised by way of a surcharge on the employer's social insurance contribution. The original intention was that the surcharge should be collected under the pay-related social insurance system and that deductions should commence before the end of 1979.  It was very quickly realised, however, that it was not practicable to introduce the surcharge other than at the beginning of a contribution year, that is, 6 April.  The tripartite standing committee accepted this and, accordingly, agreed that the introduction of the surcharge might be deferred to the contribution year commencing on 6 <Col N="220" /> April 1980.  This did not interfere in any way with spending on approved projects as the Government had already paid over a portion of their contribution.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the tripartite committee agreed that the surcharge should not apply in respect of public sector employment as the Government was contributing separately to the employment guarantee fund.</P>
    <P>The text of the National Understanding specifies a surcharge of ½ per cent on the employer's social security contribution.  The tripartite committee confirmed, however, that the purpose of the surcharge was to raise £10 million and that the rate of surcharge should be determined accordingly.  The employer organisations, in particular, were most anxious that the rate of surcharge should be as closely estimated as possible.  The decision taken in this year's budget to increase the income ceiling under the pay-related scheme from £5,500 to £7,000 was, therefore, extremely relevant to the calculation of the appropriate rate of surcharge.</P>
    <P>The rate of surcharge required to yield £10 million under the present income ceiling is 0.35 per cent.  It would have been 0.4 per cent under the old income ceiling.  The surcharge will apply only for the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1980.  It was not practicable, therefore, for me to bring legislation before the House until the decision to increase the income ceiling had been announced. As Deputies will realise there is nothing in the Bill which was not provided for in the employment guarantee provisions of the National Understanding.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this Bill is as a result of the tripartite negotiations arranged last December. Of course, we are glad to see that there is something positive being done in this forum to create jobs in what the Minister admits now is a year in which the targets will not be achieved.  It seems to me to be a bit hypocritical on the part <Col N="221" /> of the Government to say that they are creating those jobs when in fact the vacancies are being created because of cut-backs in the Government's budget. There is an exact matching programme for the creation of jobs, as listed by the Minister today, and the cut-backs listed in the budget.  In effect, what is happening is that an extra £10 million is being taken from the employers to pay for schemes which the Government are not funding this year.  I am surprised that the employers and the unions have been taken in by this bit of deception.</P>
      <P>We see grants for environmental work listed in the Minister's speech today. This has been cut from £4.2 million last year to £2.1 million this year.  The local improvements scheme is down from £2.7 million to £2 million this year.  That is also listed.  The Minister makes a big play about how he is going to do great things for youth employment.  He said that the committee have decided to support a special national programme for the provision of sport and recreation facilities but the grant for youth employment is down from £1.5 million last year to £500,000 this year.  The employment maintenance scheme is cut from £8 million last year to £4 million this year. That is a substitution scheme under this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also listed the work experience programme as one of the things to which they are giving a temporary extension of the employment incentive scheme to cover the payment of a temporary supplementary premium of £10 a week.  The work experience scheme was cut from £2.8 million last year to £1.8 million this year.  The tourist development area, which the Minister mentioned in his speech this morning, is one of the places where the money will go to.  He had already taken the money away from this in his budget when there were cuts from £1.75 million to £1 million.  The items I have just read out total well over the £10 million which the Minister said he is subscribing.  He had already put that in the budget without going into the bigger things like the housing grants, <Col N="222" /> which were severely cut from £30 million to £23 million, and the water supply and sewerage schemes, which have also been cut.  The Minister is now claiming credit for having subscribed £10 million when in fact he had already cut it in the budget.</P>
    <P>This does not seem to me to be in the spirit of what was intended by the national understanding.  I am amazed that the employers and the unions fell for this bit of deception and did not throw it back in the Minister's face saying that those should have been supplied in the budget in the normal way without the cuts.  These are cuts in money terms.  The cuts in real terms are very much greater than the cuts I have listed out.  All that is happening under this Bill is that the employers will have £10 million taken away from them to do work which it is the Government's duty to do.</P>
    <P>Many of the things are very worth while doing and I have no complaint to find with the nature of the work or with the employment level that will be achieved.  The Government are pretending that this is new job creation when in fact they are putting those people out of work by withdrawing the money.  Now they will get the employers to re-employ them by contributing £10 million.  At the same time they will deprive the employers of 35p per week per employer from 1 April next.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary, when this Bill was coming before the House this morning, that the Minister should last night announce the substitution of a new scheme for the employment maintenance scheme.  Many of the decisions being taken to spend this money are not being made by this House.  They are being made under the tripartite conference of employers, unions and Government. When public money is being voted and spent this is the place where the Minister should make those announcements and the place where decisions should be taken as to whether or not the schemes are worth while.  We have a long list of schemes which were read out by the Minister this morning already listed in the press before the House had a chance of debating either the setting up of the <Col N="223" /> fund, the worthiness of the projects on which the fund is to be used or any other matters.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister a parliamentary question a month ago about what documents were available to the tripartite conference I was told that those documents were confidential.  They are evidently confidential to Members of Dáil Éireann, but are not confidential to members of the trade union conference or whatever employers' body were represented on the tripartite conference. It is evidently all right for those documents to be discussed by them and apparently then transferred to the public arena by a briefing by some member of the tripartite conference.  It seems to me quite obvious that some member of that conference briefed at least one of the papers the day before yesterday as otherwise this information could not have appeared in yesterday's papers.</P>
    <P>The Minister also engaged in this practice of not first giving the information to the Dáil.  Knowing he was coming into the House this morning to have this Bill discussed, he issued an official announcement last night about the employment maintenance scheme.  That is bound to encourage a fairly sizeable number of people in the country in their belief that this House is irrelevant.  The Minister is certainly making it irrelevant this morning by making an announcement about the Bill last night.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that money is being provided for an extension of the employment maintenance scheme.  I am not sure that it will be operated in the same way that it has been up to now, but certainly a lot of firms in the textile trade would have found it impossible to remain in business for the balance of this year if money was not provided by way of subsidy of wages.  There is a rider added to that, to which the Minister referred and which also appeared in yesterday's papers, that each of those firms receiving money under this scheme should come back during the course of the year and give a development plan for the future.  That is a good idea.  We <Col N="224" /> should by and large ensure that when public money is given out there is some assurance given to the public who subscribe this money that some effort is being made to see that the objects for which it is subscribed will be achieved&mdash;in this case it is the continuance of textile firms and of employment in those industries.  Many people might say we should throw our hats at the textile industry and accept cheap imports from the East, but I do not agree with that.  There are many worthwhile skills in the textile industry and there is a long tradition of employment in that industry, too.  To allow these industries to disappear because of temporary difficulties caused by imports would be a grave error.</P>
    <P>A bigger investment should be made in this industry not just to keep people in employment, although that is very important, but to ensure that the skills involved in those jobs are not lost to the country.  When the EEC come to grips with the damage being done to the textile industry, not just in Ireland but throughout the Community, by cheap imports from the Far East we will not be able to get back into the trade if we allow these industries to die.  We should see keeping these skills as an investment in the future.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill it appears that the employers will continue to subscribe until expenditure reaches the £20 million level. In my view it would be more correct to say until the employers subscribe £10 million, because it is conceivable that the Government could put a clamp on employment at £19.9 million and in that way the employers would have to subscribe for ever and a day.  It should be visualised that this emergency fund will not be in existence forever and that it will not always need subscriptions from employers. The Minister should amend that section.  I will be putting down an amendment to the effect that the employers contributions should continue only until their half of the fund has been reached and not until the sum of £20 million has been provided.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes £10 million for the <Col N="225" /> Government from the employers and pretends the Government are giving this money under a job creation scheme. That is not so because the jobs were already there.  There are a number of other very important points in the national understanding to which the Minister did not refer.  Subparagraph (1) of the National Understanding for Economic and Social Development reads:</P>
    <P>This combined action will aim at offsetting the shortfall within a period of three months.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to this.  His avoidance of these points makes me suspect that the only thing the Government are interested in is collecting another £10 million for employers.  Subsection (2) of the national understanding says:</P>
    <P>The Government will introduce legislation to reduce the statutory limits on adult working hours.</P>
    <P>Has that been done?  What is the position there?  Subparagraph (3) (a) says:</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the establishment of a National Hire Agency will be proceeded with immediately.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that this document is dated last April.  A sum is provided in the Estimates for the National Hire Agency, but what has been done in this regard?  Has it been founded?  Has a chairman been appointed? Has staff been hired?  What is the purpose of the money provided in the Book of Estimates for that agency?  Subparagraph (3) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>A satisfactory long-term solution to our employment problems also requires that the greatest possible number of jobs be provided in productive employment which is commercially viable.  To this end the Government will provide for the establishment of a National Enterprise Agency.</P>
    <P>What is the position here?  The document from which I quoted is dated April <Col N="226" /> 1979, almost 12 months old.  Subparagraph (3) (b) continues:</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the functions of the Agency will be:</P>
    <P>(i)  to establish organisational responsibility for the commercial exploitation of new development opportunities...</P>
    <P>(ii)  to provide a mechanism to ensure that commercially oriented research and development is effectively applied in the economy.</P>
    <P>It is also envisaged that the Agency will engage directly in manufacturing, service and trading activities either by itself or in partnership with other organisations...</P>
    <P>I do not think anything has been done in this regard, except to provide a sum in the Estimates for the National Hire Agency and the only purpose of bringing in this Bill, as far as I can see, is to collect another £10 million from employers in social welfare insurance.  The money being spent under this Bill was saved by the Government through pruning. The Minister lists the areas where the money should be spent and they are the areas which were cut back in the Book of Estimates for 1979.  The Minister is getting the employers, through extra stamp money, to fund this scheme while pretending he is providing the money.  As I said, I would like him to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage which will limit the contributions by the employers so that when their 50 per cent of the fund has been contributed, the extra social welfare stamp money will no longer be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is presented to us as part of the agreement comprising the National Understanding and of course, elicits the immediate support of all representatives in the House.  One cannot let this Bill go without referring to the background of the national understanding. That agreement was posited on the basis that the Government of the day would continue to maintain employment as a major plank in their policy platform.  The Minister repeated today <Col N="227" /> that employment remains a paramount concern.  While the protestations and verbal commitments of this administration are repeated weekly in such policy statements, the fact is their actions are at variance with those stated comments. While we can support this measure, the fact is that the recent major economic statement by this Government in the budget, and in the Book of Estimates and the capital figures produced before the budget all point in the direction of deflationary policies throughout 1980 in which employment must be the main casualty.</P>
      <P>This measure will in no way substitute for the overall depressing direction which Government policy is taking in relation to employment.  This measure could be described as a shabby sleight of hand, especially when one considers the sort of cuts made recently in direct employment creation areas.  The Minister admitted in his speech that employment targets would not be achieved this year. How could they be achieved when we look at the implications for the economy which recent Government measures entail? For 1980, a 1 per cent growth rate has been predicted and that really means stagnation when it comes to job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the autumn of this year about 50,000 young people leaving second-and third-level education will be in search of jobs.  The policy measures recently announced do not afford any confidence to those young people that they will be successful in their quest for jobs.  In the body of his speech the Minister sounds a retreat from previous policy commitments to employment creation.  The understanding and the agreement of trade unions was given on the basis that the main thrust of Government policy would continue to be in the direction of more employment creation. As a result of criticism especially from the unions, based on their belief that the Government are retreating from previous commitments to employment, the Minister has come to the House to-day with a welcome effort to try to convince the unions of the credentials of the <Col N="228" /> Government.  The Minister's task is not easy because the unions are able to read the result of recent Government economic actions as well as anybody else, a 1 per cent growth in the economy for this year, a cut in personal living standards, a sharp increase in consumer prices, a cut-back in the house building sector, building costs expected to rise by 20 per cent and the effect on employment of the cut-back in the Government's real allocation for the housing sector which means a drop in employment. The main casualty as a result of the budget can only be employment.  The Government have apparently decided that in the list of narrow options before them to bring the economy around, employment will be the main casualty.  That is why this measure can only be described as a substitution policy, if not dishonest.</P>
    <P>There have been real cuts in the capital programme, a cut-back in the building construction industry and so on. This measure departs from the agreement to which the Government committed themselves in the national understanding and therefore it was necessary for the Government to come in here and say that they were willing to go ahead with some of the elements in the national understanding.  The agreement on the employee side in those talks was given on the basis of the Government's continued commitment to employment creation.  The Minister made the point that we are not alone in our distress, in our failure to create more employment and that it is an insurmountable problem in other EEC states. Ireland has the biggest proportion of young people who are wage earners and probably no other EEC state is faced with a challenge like ours in providing jobs for these people.  When the Government admit that there can be no success in job creation they are retreating from their commitment and there is a distinct difference between us and the other member states in this connection.</P>
    <P>There have been signals before now but this morning the Government clearly indicated that they are retreating from <Col N="229" /> their commitment.  One cannot separate the substitute provisions put forward this morning from the general direction of the economy outlined in the recent budget which will give us a 1 per cent growth in the economy.  It is obvious that employment will fall this year when one takes into account the real cut-back in the house building programme.  All the vital employment areas suffered real cut-backs this year.  There is no point in saying that other countries have this problem.  That excuse is not good enough as our problem is far more acute and failure is not acceptable.  In our situation it cannot be other than catastrophic having regard to the number of young people who will be seeking work for the first time this year.  Without exaggeration this can be described as a crisis year for employment.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason that the Minister came in here this morning is because there has been mounting criticism that the Government have been dragging their feet on the economic packages that comprised the national understanding. The provision of the National Hire Agency and the setting up of the State Planning Board have been making slow progress and the statements of trade union leaders indicate that they have been coming to the conclusion that the Government are dragging their feet on these matters.  The Government committed themselves to these elements in the national understanding, but progress has been very slow and that is part of the reason why the Minister came in here this morning with this belated commitment to this aspect of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted in his speech that there had been a jobs shortfall of 5,000 in 1979 and also indicated that he did not expect employment targets to be reached at all in 1980.  There is an ominous silence on what the Minister intends to do in relation to the shortfall in 1980.  We are approaching a time when we will either commence negotiations for another national understanding or we will have some kind of free-for-all in wage negotiations.  The Minister will be <Col N="230" /> making a huge error if he thinks he will be able to get any national understanding at the expense of a departure from job creation policies.  The trade union movement knowing these problems cannot and have no desire to depart from their commitments to employment creation.  The Minister and the Government would be making a mistake if they thought it possible to get another national understanding at the expense of specific employment policies.</P>
    <P>Most of the EEC states mentioned by the Minister have adopted programmes to assist young people in search of work quite apart from the general management of their economies.  In our period in office we introduced the premium employment programme, we later extended it to the employment incentive scheme and the present Government have continued to operate that scheme with some changes I have noticed.  In our period we resisted the extension of the employment incentive scheme into the service area. We believed that the crucial areas which required financial assistance to create new jobs over a period were located in manufacturing industry.  Under this administration that scheme was extended. Recently it was interesting to note that in answer to a question here in the House we were told that in the extension of that scheme to services £.5 million was paid last year to the Irish banks.  When asked that question under the employment incentive scheme the Minister could not say what new jobs had been created as a result of the £.5 million given to the Irish banking groups.  Whatever one may say about the Irish banks, they do not qualify as candidates who are in the financial difficulties of other citizens. The mind boggles at the thought that at budget time the general citizenry are counselled to moderation, belt-tightening and so on and yet £.5 million can be shelled out to Irish banks to create new jobs in those banks.  No information can be given as to how many new jobs were created.  The reason that we in our period would not extend the cash to this area was that the Irish banks obviously follow a recruiting policy and I doubt if one extra job was created in the Irish banks <Col N="231" /> last year as a result of that present from the Irish taxpayers to the banks.</P>
    <P>It is that kind of spendthrift, nonsensical, gimmicky policy that has brought the economy to its present parlous condition. It is not simply an Opposition ploy to describe the Minister coming in this morning as though he were giving us a supplementary employment policy.  He is not announcing supplementary, anticyclical youth employment policies. These are purely in substitution for things he has already removed.  I ask the Minister for Finance, who must be concerned with the question of saving in expenditure, to look at the strange financial behaviour under the employment incentive scheme where money has been handed out.  There is no information about the jobs created and there is a big doubt as to whether that money is needed in that area at all.  After all, if that £.5 million had not been given last year to the banks to provide extra jobs it could have been applied elsewhere.  It is still quite a lot of money and there are a number of schemes, such as amenity schemes, up and down the country in which young people could have been employed with the use of this £.5 million.  I am sure other similar instances could be disclosed of which this Government could be described as guilty.</P>
    <P>The small measures announced here this morning, which may be described as correcting measures, can be supported. The Minister appeared to be conceding in the course of his speech that employment will suffer throughout this year.  He makes the now familiar point of members of this administration that it is bad the world over.  Who will forget the time when, if anyone made the sensible point that there was a world recession, there were cries from the Opposition that this was passing the buck to the world?  Now we have Ministers who pass the buck every day to the EEC, saying simply that the EEC are suffering and therefore this little country must suffer.  This administration have got the entire rhythm of this economy wrong since 1977.  They poured on assistance and financial aid at <Col N="232" /> a time of growth and recovery and now, when conditions are in reverse and changed, we are left with no leeway at all in terms of assistance and management of the economy.  Therefore we are facing a year in which we will have a low growth rate&mdash;stagnation practically because 1 per cent is stagnation&mdash;and credit restrictions.  A general depression in the climate of business will mean that the small firms from whom one could expect the major portion of new jobs to come will be heavily penalised in this year and will be working very hard indeed to stay afloat.  They will be in no position to provide extra jobs.</P>
    <P>At any stage the type of schemes announced by the Minister and by other EEC states of a similar nature are purely priming exercises and are no substitute for a general thrust towards an economic policy of employment creation.  It is particularly hard to understand, in a year such as we are facing with difficulties abroad, why the real cuts have been chosen in areas like building construction. If a major part of our economic problems can be described as balance of payments it is very hard to defend the virtual freezing of funds at real levels in the employment construction industry. This year undoubtedly a cut-back in house building will occur.  It is very hard to defend that kind of development in the context of employment creation when you take into account the fact that the building and construction industry does not add to our balance of payments problems.  The material are homeproduced and it is a labour-intensive industry, which in the past has had very close connections with the Government party.  Yet that industry, employment-intensive though it may be, will suffer very sharp cut-backs over this year.</P>
    <P>Overall it is an economy heading into double digit inflation and higher unemployment and the Government of the day appear to accept its failure to create extra jobs.  It is very hard to see how the understanding that has been arrived at in previous years between unions, employers and Government can be attained in such conditions.  I have some experience <Col N="233" /> of contacts and consultation negotiations in this area.  The Minister and the Government will be making a big error if the think that understandings of a wide economic nature can be arrived at, with the trade unions in particular, in the context of the kind of deflationary policies now being pursued by the Government.  If the Government are, as they appear to be, departing from the main employment plank of their platform, which up to now they maintain they were in favour of, it makes it that much more difficult to arrange any kind of comprehensive formula with the unions for any subsequent national wage agreement.  Therefore, little hope can be held out to the young people looking for jobs this autumn because there are no policies, apart from the deflationary ones, to be observed from this Government.</P>
    <P>The schemes are purely marginal in their effect in the sense that all these special schemes have been adopted in the other EEC states and are accepted by their authors as being purely marginal and peripheral to the main economic effort.  If, as appears to be the case, our economy is being faced resolutely in the direction of no growth, with high inflation as a result of higher indirect taxes, then it is a correct statement of the position to say that it will be a bad year for employment and will mark a fall in employment.  It may be that this Government in looking at the options for its own political survival has decided that this is probably the only route available to it and that, if there must be a casualty, then it will have to be in the area of employment, hoping perhaps for better days.  That is not a satisfactory approach and certainly not a very hopeful one if one wishes for a satisfactory outcome to discussions between unions and employers under another national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>This measure of the Minister this morning can be supported as far as it goes&mdash;and that is a very limited extent. It is merely a substitute for the cuts which have already taken place.  It is in the context of budgetary management which is emphatically deflationary&mdash;and <Col N="234" /> most economists now accept that our growth rate will be below 1 per cent over the coming year&mdash;and it is in that scenario which is accepted by the Government that one must see this Bill this morning.  One can therefore give it only the limited welcome that that picture deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be a very poor Waterford man if I did not back this Bill to the hilt.  It may be to a large extent making up for some of the shortfalls in the 1980 Estimates, but then half a loaf is better than none at all.  I see some excellent points in the Bill before us today. It is a good deal broader than I had anticipated, but even in its broadness it has a lot to recommend it.</P>
      <P>Primarily when this tripartite committee was set up I understood that the object was to provide new employment and to maintain existing employment where industries were in danger of collapse.  By maintaining the Employment Maintenance Scheme in another form the Bill goes a long way to shoring up the type of shaky industry to which I have referred. I am aware that the Employment Maintenance Scheme will cease on 31 March and that something was badly needed to ensure that industries which are undergoing a rough time should have some financial support to keep them on a business footing.  This is particularly the case, as stated in the Minister's speech, with regard to the clothing, textile and footwear industries.  One could also extend that statement to the leather or tannery industries.  They all come within the same context and are all undergoing a very difficult period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of these industries have closed down over the past few years and in recent months a good few others have been threatened with closure.  With regard to the leather and tannery industry, we had a closure in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's own constituency, Gorey, within the past 15 months and there are other threatened closures.  If this Employment Maintenance Scheme was not replaced as is done in this Bill, a number of other industries <Col N="235" /> in that sector would also be in danger of going to the wall.  I must support the Bill very strongly in that regard.</P>
    <P>Of late, we have seen a number of textile industries, specifically in the Sunbeam-Gentex group, being threatened with closure.  I hope that the money being provided through this Bill will also help in stabilising those factories&mdash;be they Youghal, Westport, or Clondalkin.  That type of assistance is very badly needed and we would be very poor Waterford men and Irishmen if we did not support the Bill in that context.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister listed a number of projects which have already been passed for financial support by his Department.  We, in Waterford and in the south east generally, are absolutely thrilled by the news that this fund will support the projected Waterford air-strip or airport to the tune of £700,000 and that a sizeable contribution will be made to provide a new dredger for Waterford Harbour Commissioners to be built by the Ross Company of New Ross, County Wexford.  That type of stimulation for the south-east is badly needed and greatly welcome.  This is an area which for far too long has been the cinderella, industrially speaking, of this country.  That type of infrastructural support, in my view, will give the necessary boost for the expansion which has been lacking and which other centres have seen over the past ten or 15 years. We have seen the booms in the Shannon industrial area, in Cork city and Cork harbour areas, in Galway city, while the south-east, and Waterford city in particular, have stagnated in recent years.</P>
    <P>I hope that the injection from this fund which we are supporting here today will bring about the same industrial prosperity for the south-eastern region and the Waterford city and county area, more specifically.  The FUE together with the trade union movement have been the front-runners in seeing that this fund was set up and utilised to the best effect.  When I inquired from the FUE some two months ago how much of the £20 million had already been sanctioned, <Col N="236" /> I was told that a mere £4 million had been set aside for specific projects at that time.  I am interested to learn today that that £4 million has now increased to £18 million and ask the Minister, in his reply, to give us a detailed account of where that £18 million is going.  I must pay tribute to the officials of the FUE, both nationally and locally, and also to the trade union movement, for the interest they have taken in this fund.  I doubt that this fund would ever have got off the ground if it had not been for their assistance and their drive.  They are to be congratulated and it is lovely to see their ambitions coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>It is a disappointment to learn that the job target of 25,000 per annum was greatly reduced in 1979.  The figure of 15,000 mentioned today in the Minister's speech has come as a great surprise to me and, I am sure, to every Member of the House.  It seems that the job creation programme which was so widely pushed forward by the previous Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, has now come unstuck.  Perhaps it was a false type of job creation programme in that it provided jobs galore in the public sector without any due consideration as to whether they were productive or not. Perhaps it was a false base, but it did provide badly needed employment.  I would hate to think that type of programme was been abandoned completely because unemployment figures will soar and our young people will have fewer and fewer opportunities&mdash;not that the job creation programme in its entirety was to be supported because a lot of it was unproductive.  However, it had a lot of good points.  It is sad to see it fading to such a large degree.  A drop from 25,000 to 15,000 is a major shock. I hope that downward trend does not continue and that the Bill will help to arrest that slide.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he is using the funds being made available by the Bill to support sport and recreational facilities.  I did not think that the fund would be utilised in this fashion, <Col N="237" /> but seeing that there have been vast cuts in the 1980 Estimates in this area it is to be welcomed that some substitute scheme has been brought in.  There is nothing more demoralising to the youth, public representatives and parents than to see a complete lack of sporting and recreational facilities.  This is one area where there should not be a cut-back and I hope this trend will continue.  I should like the Minister to be more specific about the type of financial support for the provision of community and sport centres, whether it will be funded through national organisations as has been the tendency in the past, or through local authorities who will be able to give grants for specific projects.</P>
    <P>We have had serious cut-backs in our local authority estimates for 1980.  In many instances we have had to eliminate completely provision for such desirable projects.  The 10 per cent restriction on rate increases tied our hands to such an extent that we are only able to keep essential services ticking over.  Very desirable projects have had to go by the wayside.  I should like the Minister to let us know to what bodies the money will be distributed and what bodies will have the job of granting it to the various sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill, and why not?  It is money we did not expect to get.  It will do tremendous work for certain areas where there are serious shortfalls and problems with regard to infrastructure, industrial projects and employment.  If the Bill does what it sets out to do&mdash;and I am confident it will&mdash;it is to be welcomed 100 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for the important reason to me that there are substantial moneys in it going to my own constituency in Waterford.  It is money that is vitally needed and will give us encouragement for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a tendency through the years for Governments to take over responsibility for the creation of employment. They have the primary responsibility of ensuring an environment in which industry will flourish and increase. <Col N="238" /> This dates back to the thirties and forties when during and after the great depression Governments took upon themselves, under the guise of changing economic theory, to be the instigators and providers of incentives and the environment in which industry can thrive.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech indicated that this Government have failed in their objective of creating employment as mentioned specifically in their election manifesto.  The employment targets have failed despite attempts in the past few years to clothe that failure.  The Minister's speech is an official confession that the employment targets or the promises made to the ordinary man in the street about his employment prospects will not and have not been achieved.  That is the brutal fact of the present situation in relation to Government economic policy and the employment scene.  In relation to 1979, during which year the Government said they would increase employment by 20,000, there is an official acknowledgment to-day by the Minister for Finance that there was a shortfall of 5,000 jobs.  In other words, they did not reach their target by no less a figure than 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am dubious even about the 15,000 extra jobs supposed to have been created.  This has not manifested itself in the live register, that is, among those officially listed at employment exchanges as being unemployed.  Despite statistical assurances given by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, and the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, that there is some kind of indirect multiplier relationship between the reduction in the live register and actual jobs created, I do not believe that that multiplier relationship is a correct one.  I believe that the shortfall is greater than the 5,000 mentioned by the Minister.  I look forward to a time when we will get an acceptable live register which will reflect the real number of people on it and reflect the creation of employment.  It is not apparently reflected in the present live register, which has been amended in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> In relation to 1980 there is another confession.  Perhaps I might quote part of the Minister's speech where he said:</P>
    <P>While we will have to accept that our target of a 25,000 increase in numbers of employment this year will not be achieved, our performance compares more than favourably with that of many of our EEC and OECD partners.</P>
    <P>Whatever about our OECD partners, many of whom have not reached a similar stage of economic development, it must be accepted that we are the second lowest well-off nation in the EEC.  Therefore when we are talking about doing as well as our EEC partners, that is a false comparison to draw.  We are under-developed when compared with some of our European partners, particularly France and Germany; therefore we should not be compared with those two nations.</P>
    <P>There is the admission in the Minister's speech that our growth rate must be reduced downwards.  The figure of, I think, 1.5 per cent was mentioned recently in <i>The Economist.</i> I think that was the OECD suggested figure.  That growth rate is not sufficient for any progress to be made in our economy in 1980.  In real terms it means the output of the economy in 1980 will have fallen <i>vis-á-vis</i> inflation&mdash;in other words, that we will have been taken a step backwards.  This will be reflected in ordinary worker-industry terms as a substantial rise in unemployment levels this year.  I was sorry the Minister did not spend more time discussing employment potential in 1980 or in discussing in depth the meaning of the reduction in our growth rate this year.  What unemployment level can we now expect in the course of this year on the basis of a suggested growth rate of 1½ per cent?  If we examine the increase in productivity in relation to national output&mdash;and there is an annual increase in productivity which may vary perhaps between 2 per cent and 4 per cent&mdash;if we are to increase our output by 1 per cent only, <Col N="240" /> then the result in relation to employment is that we shall have substantial increases in the numbers on the live register.  On the basis of the figures available to me I predict that by next winter the number on the live register will have gone over the 100,000 level. This is a figure none of us wants to see and which we would do everything in our power to prevent.  But, looking at the respective economic policies of the last Government and this Government, it is becoming patently obvious that the policy being pursued by Fianna Fáil can be described only as spendthrift, stop, go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I take your point, Sir, but I wish to refer to the policies pursued by Fianna Fáil and those pursued by the last Government in relation to the creation of employment.  That necessarily means I must refer&mdash;and I will do so briefly&mdash;to the policies of two governments.</P>

      <P>I shall not detain the House long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> The activities in relation to the employment policy of this Government contrast starkly with those of the last Government.  The policies of Fianna Fáil over the past two years have been to spend large sums of money on the basis of substantial budget deficits.  Last year the overall budget deficit was over £1,000 million, a catastrophic sum in relation to a small economy like ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue the point much longer.  The budget deficit for 1980 is estimated in all at nearly £900 million.  That demonstrates the continuation of a spendthrift policy in an effort to reach employment targets, among other desirable social activities.  The fact of the matter is that the spending policies of this Government have led to a serious rate of inflation, now admitted to be around 20 per cent.  That contrasts starkly with the situation in which the economy found itself in 1977, when the last Government went out of office leaving the economy with a healthy 6.7 per cent inflation rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is certainly not obeying the Chair now.  I do not know whether he has spoken on the budget but certainly all of that is more relevant to the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the point I want to make and it was necessary to refer to these other matters in order to make the point.</P>
      <P>The last Government pursued a conservative economic policy with the objective of reducing the rate of inflation. By the end of their term of office they had substantially achieved that objective. Even taking into account the dreadful energy crisis we experienced, we achieved a low rate of inflation which is the prerequisite of industrial expansion and increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic policies of this Government have brought this country into a <Col N="243" /> situation in which the inflation rate is now 20 per cent and in which the level of interest for many people is also in the region of 20 per cent.  It is costing 20 per cent to get industrial loans even for firms to survive.  I shall leave that matter there. However, I can say, as an economist, that in the present economic environment employers find themselves trying to survive on a 20 per cent inflation rate at a time when money is costing them 20 per cent per annum.  This is not an inducement to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>That is the net point the Minister must accept.  He showed recognition of it in his speech by accepting that a 20 per cent inflation rate and a 20 per cent interest rate on commercial loans will not lead to a substantial increase in employment in the foreseeable future.  He knows it will be extremely difficult for small employers, in particular, to survive.</P>
    <P>There is now a serious doubt about Government policy in relation to increased employment.  All we have been getting are confessions of failure not only in relation to last year but 1980 as well.  Before this year is three months old the Government tell the country: &ldquo;We are very sorry but we cannot even achieve the employment targets set for last year&rdquo;.  The Government were only codding the people with these targets now found to be unattainable.</P>
    <P>This Bill carries an implicit confession that the Government alone cannot provide the necessary funds to create employment.  In the national understanding the Government agreed that if they could not achieve employment targets they would call in those who could help to achieve them, the employers and the trade unions.  I doubt, however, if that is a long-term solution. The employers are contributing their share of taxation and so are the PAYE workers.  They cannot be relied on in the long term to help to maintain employment levels.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this Bill is another confession of failure, another example of Fianna Fáil hypocrisy.  They think they <Col N="244" /> can still dupe the electorate as they did so successfully in the past.  They must be told that it is not in the long-term interests of the country, or indeed of Fianna Fáil, to keep on playing that game.  Another matter affecting employment levels is the restriction on funds of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief on this. The level of funds being made available to local authorities means that there will have to be redundancies in the public sector at local authority level.  These bodies have been limited to a rates increase of 10 per cent and the capital allocation for roads has been cut. Therefore there will be a substantial increase in unemployment at local authority level during 1980 and that will not help the general employment picture. The spendthrift policy of the Government is coming to a halt because there is no more money to spend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister told us that the employment maintenance scheme <Col N="245" /> had to be withdrawn because of objections by the EEC Commission.  I submit that the Commission were wrong.  In a developing economy such a scheme was necessary particularly because industry here had been protected for years.  Now our industrialists have to face serious competition from international rivals on international markets.  Therefore I question the Commission's objection to this scheme.  At the same time I welcome the temporary subvention from employers to the employment guarantee fund to finance a replacement scheme, although I do not think it was intended originally that the employment guarantee fund would be used in this way.  I understood that fund would be used as a grant scheme rather than an employment maintenance scheme.</P>
    <P>From the EEC point of view I wonder what is the net difference between the scheme the Commission objected to and the replacement scheme.  Surely this replacement scheme is open to the same objections from the Commission.  I should like an assurance from the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>The textile and footwear industries are in crisis.  In my constituency the Irish Leather Company have been suffering severely and have closed down the factory in Gorey.  There have been lay-offs in the Dungarvan plant.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that there is a future for the leather industry.  I have not received such an assurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to be in the position to do the same for my constituency. There are no hard feelings about the matter.  I am perturbed about the long-term prospects for the leather industry.  It is important that we have a leather-processing industry to process the hides from out meat industry.  The situation in relation to Waterford is not satisfactory.  It has been acknowledged within Government circles and the IDA that Waterford is a matter of concern in relation to industry.  The closure of the Munster Chipboard factory is a disgrace. It is a further disgrace that this industry, which is based on thinnings from our forests, has been allowed to remain closed when there is available to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry a mechanism under the Forestry Act since 1940 to become financially involved in that industry.  I feel a decision has been made at Government level to leave this factory closed and deprive Waterford of an employment potential in the region of 300 directly and an extra 200 indirectly through transporters and foresters.  The Cabinet have made a decision to sacrifice the Munster Chipboard factory in favour of the chipboard factory at Scarriff, County Clare.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in a recent reply to me blamed an unofficial picket for the closure of the factory.  That is not the reason for the Minister and the Government refusing to take a financial interest in that company. The Minister, despite two consultant reports which he has in relation to the future of the timber processing industry, when it was pointed out that in the long term it is necessary to have processing facilities for the thinnings of our forests, has allowed the Munster Chipboard factory to close down.  It is reprehensible that an employment potential of 300 should be thrown to the wind when that employment is based very soundly on the need to have the thinnings of our forests processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am accusing the Fianna Fáil <Col N="247" /> Government of discriminating against Waterford in relation to Munster Chipboard in favour of the Scariff Chipboard factory in County Clare.  It may well be because there is a Minister from County Clare in the Cabinet that this has influenced that decision.  If that is the case it is a political scandal, which cannot be defended by the Fianna Fáil Government or any government when we are talking about the livelihood of the people in many parts of the country.  Since we are talking about employment I challenge the Minister to respond to my allegation about the Munster Chipboard factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

I wonder whether or not it would be relevant for me to reply to the imaginary decision of the Government, which the Deputy has raised, and having raised this to claim it as factual and then to criticise this as being scandalous on the basis of his imagination.  That does not seem to be within the scope of this Bill.  I do not know what other imaginary things he will have to say.</P>

      <P>I take your point and I shall not pursue it further.  I merely say that in relation to employment in Waterford city we have suffered severely and I am concerned about the manner in which the Government have failed to support the Munster Chipboard factory and have cost Waterford city guaranteed employment of 300 men, most of whom are married.  That is an unfortunate decision by Fianna Fáil and it is to the detriment of the industrial future of Waterford city.  If the Minister wishes to reply to my allegations I will welcome that.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the leather industry in my constituency.  I would like the Minister's observations on the long-term future of this industry in Waterford.  I would also like to refer to the decision made by the Government to transfer to Waterford city part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That decision has been welcomed in Waterford because there is a great need to introduce into the city a balance among the service industries.  I ask the Minister to expedite the decentralisation of that part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which is going to Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the main feature of the Bill is the establishment of an employment guarantee fund.  If Deputies are allowed to deal with all of the specific matters relating to industries in their areas we could be here debating this matter for many days.  The Chair will have to be strict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point.  I will now come to the congratulatory bit which the Minister is so anxious to hear. The contribution from the fund to the construction of an airport is very welcome in Waterford.  We have been attempting for a number of years to establish an airport to serve not only Waterford city but Waterford county and that part of the south east, which is in need of airport services.  We <Col N="249" /> purchased a site and allied to that was an industry.  Unfortunately about a month or two ago the German firm involved decided not to proceed and we were left out on a limb.  We were providing an airport without the backing of a large industry. I hope the IDA will fight for a large industry for this area.</P>
      <P>The airport was a substantial undertaking and cost around £900,000.  The subvention from the Employment Guarantee Fund is £705,000 and the balance&mdash;the cost of the acquisition of land&mdash;will be provided by the corporation who have serious funding difficulties because of the present Government policy in relation to capital financing and rating policies in general.  The airport is roughly mid-way between Waterford city, Tramore and Dunmore East.  The runway is 1,200 metres in length, which is fairly substantial, and will take most turbo-prop freight planes and passenger jet planes carrying up to 20 people.  This is very important and will herald a new phase in industrial expansion in the area. The airport development will include, apart from a relatively good runway, a control tower, hangar, beacon and radio facilities, an access road and a car park. This is a very welcome measure for Waterford and is much needed to ensure the industrial future of the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the provision of a dredger for Waterford Harbour to be built by the Ross company of New Ross.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the details of the money being provided under the fund.  I understand it is in the region of £400,000 and that that sum will provide not only a dredger but a pilot launch. That amount is approximately half the money needed, but the Waterford Harbour Commissioners are not in a position to provide the rest of the money. Therefore, this question must be reexamined. Agreement between the Ross company and all concerned could be reached so that the contract for building a dredger may be finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to note that it is intended to provide youth and sports facilities.  This is a welcome development, although it needs further explanation.  I <Col N="250" /> will leave this matter to be pursued further by Deputy Kenny.  The money provided in the present budget, £500,000, falls for short of the £20 million for youth employment promised in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  This is political gimmickry as yet unexplained by Fianna Fáil but understood by the electorate.</P>
    <P>I am happy to welcome the setting up of the fund, although it is a failure by the Government of their employment policy. I welcome the moneys provided for the airport, the dredger and pilot launch in Waterford, and hope this money will lead to a new launching pad for industrial and employment potential and development in my area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Waterford is about to become the new industrial centre.  I welcome this Bill.  It appears to be a tax on employers for the creation of employment and this could be to some extent self-defeating.</P>
      <P>The Government commitment to the youth is not matched by performance. Young people are very sensitive, responsive and critical.  It appears there is a very subtle political psychology being worked here.  The Government can point to the very high target for job creation, which they set at 25,000, and can produce figures to show that something like 15,000 jobs were created, leaving a shortfall of 10,000 jobs.  They can claim that in the prevailing international circumstances that was not such a bad effort. I do not believe the young people will accept that.  If they are not to be left languishing in a limbo of no hope or confidence, there must be a far greater realisation of the commitment given to them by the Government over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the unique demographic structure of this country and with the continuing rise of the working age, more and more young people will be coming on the labour market in the next few years. Unless realistic targets are set, matched by a genuine commitment, there will be a frustration among the young people <Col N="251" /> when they are seeking suitable employment.</P>
    <P>I want to make a passing reference to the state of employment in the textile industry in the Westport area.  This Bill provides a unique opportunity to support employment creation in areas where it is most urgently needed.  The action taken by the Seafield-Gentex board was an asset stripping job.  Unless an adequate explanation is coming from that board it will not be seen in any other light.  It is hard to understand that a factory of 72,000 sq feet, which probably has one of the most modern mills in the textile industry in this country and with a labour force of approximately 208 of which 180 were male employees, should be closed down, taking into account that a large proportion of its output was public service goods.  Many of the employees in that factory have given a lifetime of service and others are young people who have just settled down and are trying to meet repayments on their houses.  The spectre of unemployment rearing its head in a county that emigration has ravaged for 100 years creates great social unrest.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the situation that could arise if 50 per cent of the total male work force in that area become redundant overnight.  The board of Seafield-Gentex in taking this action have shown a callous disregard for the efforts and dedication which those workers put at their disposal down through the years.</P>
    <P>The cost of creating jobs in rural Ireland is relatively high and if the IDA were to create the same number of jobs in six months' time it would cost several million pounds.  Surely this Bill could be put into operation to bring some realism to the situation.  Several deputations met the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister of State who has connections with this area and the case has been well presented to them.  All the facts are in the possession of the Minister and I would urge the Minister for Finance to take whatever action is necessary to maintain that employment or create some other outlet for those workers.  I welcome the recent IDA announcement <Col N="252" /> of further industrial expansion in the Westport area but this was already on the cards and will not make up for the appalling situation which will arise if 50 per cent of the total male work force in that town are left redundant.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that the committee have decided to support a special national programme for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  This is a very welcome trend and I give it my wholehearted support.  In his reply to this debate will the Minister clarify how much of the £20 million placed at the disposal of whatever board is to use this finance can be spent on the provision of sporting facilities?  What body will dispose of the money and what criteria will be used with regard to its disposal?  This announcement is strange when in the budget the Minister increased the VAT on sporting goods, excluding clothing, by 5 per cent.  Many sporting organisations and individuals pursuing the Government's policy of proper use of leisure time will have to pay more to co-operate in the policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government policy of promoting the proper use of leisure time is perfectly correct but it is contradictory to increase VAT on sporting facilities by 5 per cent.  Items such as bicycles, footballs, rackets, nets and other essential items will be increased in cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that money to support <Col N="253" /> recreational facilities will be used not for the exclusive use of one specific group.  Due to lack of Government funds down through the years many voluntary organisations had to provide sporting facilities and sporting complexes, with the aid of public money from the Department of Education or the local authority in the area.  An organisation could use up to a quarter of a million pounds for the provision of a sports complex and could find themselves having to run this complex on a purely voluntary basis.  The Minister should bear in mind that where money is given to sporting complexes of that size provision should be made for the proper management of them.  To run an enterprise costing up to a quarter of a million pounds demands a professional person's capability and capacity to use the facilities to generate sufficient income to keep it moving as a going concern. This has not happened in many of our sports complexes.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify in his reply if the money can be used to aid existing sports complexes that find themselves unable to pay very high interest rates? Many sports complexes are being used to the limits of their potential but they cannot generate enough income to pay off the interest on the debts they accrued in the setting up of the complex in the first place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned the local authorities and their employment position. The 10 per cent ceiling in relation to counties with low valuations does not create enough economic buoyancy in those counties to enable them to sustain their aims in relation to employment and the provision of essential services.  This aspect was apparently not considered when the 10 per cent limit was set but it will have a serious regressive affect on the counties with low valuations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill although it could be construed to be a tax on employers who create more employment.  I urge the Minister to use his influence in relation to the Westport textile situation and to bear in mind the points I have made in relation to the youth and sporting sections of this Bill.  I would remind the <Col N="254" /> Minister that the commitment given to the youth by the Taoiseach and shared by himself is not being matched by a realisation and a carrying into effect. Unless there is a step-up in this young people will avail of the opportunity to judge the Government when the occasion next arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister refers to the withdrawal of the employment maintenance scheme at the end of this month as a result of objections from the EEC Commission and then the effort to include something in this Bill to cover that situation.  We are being over-apologetic to the EEC when we consider that our rag trade, our clothing and textile industry, in 1980 are competing with cheap goods from Taiwan and such places and that we have to tolerate that in the context of being a member of the EEC.  We cannot do anything about it when people can set themselves up here with an office, a secretary and a telex machine and can bring in millions of pounds' worth of goods and put all our small and some larger industries out of business.  We tolerate that without a murmur and we decide to toe the line with regard to it.  It is about time that we told the EEC where to get off.  If we had a good employment maintenance scheme we could continue it without any apology to the EEC, and we could tell them quite clearly why.  We would do it partly because of its value and partly by way of putting our objections forward and saying that there is no way Deputy Kenny's industries in Westport or our textile industries in Youghal can survive so long as they are in competition with rubbish that comes from places like Taiwan via Rotterdam. This is all technically correct and is being done blatantly.  I welcome this measure in so far as it will help to salvage our Seafield industry in Youghal, who are now endeavouring to go it alone.  This will be a very welcome injection of money for them.  I welcome it also in so far as it will help other industries in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I see this as largely a tax on employers.  Who are the <Col N="255" /> employers who can afford £10 million today towards the scheme?  I challenge the Minister to show me where there are industries so buoyant that they can afford this tax of £10 million to contribute towards this scheme.  Let the Government provide the £20 million, £30 million or £40 million which is needed so badly.  We are still talking about only peanuts if we are serious about job creation in industry.</P>
    <P>We are talking about energy problems.  The first thing the Government should be doing at the moment is setting out industrial estates in places like Little Island which should be supplied with natural gas.  If we want to create employment then the vast industrial estates in the hinterland of Cork Harbour should all be connected up to natural gas which could be offered as an added attraction to new industrialists. The second priority is the cleaning up of Cork Harbour.  This may come under environmental work.  We have a potential £10 million shellfish industry in Cork Harbour and what are we doing? Starting with Midleton and then going to Cobh, Cork city and Passage West.  We are pouring out raw sewage and making a cesspool out of Cork Harbour and nothing is being done about that.  If the Belgians or the Dutch had Cork Harbour they would regard it as one of their greatest assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Minister to make sensible use of this few pounds, but I take the Chair's point.  With regard to tourist amenities the Bill will help now that that industry is taking one hell of a hammering with the increase in petrol and drink prices and the general condition of our roads.  Even if the full £20 million were to be spent on our roads it would be lost in the pot-holes.  However, so far as it will help towards beautifying the countryside it is to be welcomed.  Obviously, <Col N="256" /> a priority would be some work in relation to our beaches in providing car parks, toilet facilities and so on.  This would be very welcome, particularly for our lesser known and smaller beaches.</P>
      <P>I welcome also what the Bill does for community sport but we have an extraordinary situation here which I have encountered before.  I am not happy with the wording of the Minister's speech where he said:</P>
      <P>... the facilities being provided will not be for the exclusive use of a particular group or groups within a community.</P>
      <P>This can be self-defeating.  Somebody must take charge of something.  There is hardly any community complex in the country which is not provided by a parish, a rugby club or a GAA club.  Is the Minister going to exclude all these various groups of people?  If he does that there will be very few projects left for him to help.  I apologise to the Chair for referring to a local matter, but we have in our area an instance of where a parish got together and provided a massive complex.  Deputy Bruton has seen it. There is no way that a parish in the area can afford it.  Because of a technicality&mdash;they called it a community council project instead of a sports complex&mdash;they have been deprived of muchneeded funds.  I hope that in this scheme they will qualify for them.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to indicate whether the fabrication industries, such as small projects that have been set up north, south, east and west for the manufacture of various types of small farm machinery and so on, would qualify for help under this scheme.  That would be very important.  They are running very close to the wind at the moment and finding it difficult to pay their way.  I would like to think that something would be done for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome this measure, I see it as really only scratching the surface in regard to employment and creating jobs. Jobs can be created.  I share the confidence of quite a number of my colleagues that there is nothing wrong <Col N="257" /> with the future of this country.  We can create the jobs and we should be creating them&mdash;and not in the public sector.  There is a massive opening for job creation in agriculture.  If we were not so nervous about EEC rules, cutting back and so on, and if we are to forge ahead in agriculture, we could be talking about putting £100 million into it and that would be money well spent.  A lot of our unemployment problems would be solved because all of these jobs in agriculture are productive.  The products can be sold at full market value and profits can be made from them.  I would like to see us going into productive employment in industries based on agriculture.  We can talk for a week about the imaginary assets that we have and all our wonderful industries but basically our major asset today is the first eight or nine inches of Irish soil.</P>

I would like to see him concentrating on the development of agriculture.  Let us ignore these pundits in the EEC who talk about mountains and tell us what we should and should not be doing.  We can find plenty of markets in third countries.  We can go to Venezuela or anywhere else we like and sell our produce.  If they do not want to do it, let them give us the chance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up where Deputy Hegarty left off.  This contribution will be collected from all employers, including those in the agricultural industry, whether involved in processing of farm goods or in actual farming, as farmers employing men or women on the farm.  I am disturbed, to see that, amongst the proposals at present under consideration, there is none which could relate, in any way, to our primary national and natural resource, agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are great opportunities for the creation of employment in agriculture.  In <Col N="258" /> dairying, at present, as the Minister is probably well aware, as far as milking services are concerned, there is an acute labour shortage.  Many farmers who want to take, perhaps, two days a week off are unable to get skilled manpower to do the milking or assist while they are away and must stay on the job for seven full days a week.  This is something which would not be accepted by people in other walks of life.  I argue very strongly that there is an acute shortage in rural Ireland of skilled farm workers. The wages which would be payable in such cases, if the skills were there, would be very good.</P>
    <P>Nothing is being done by any agency to provide the skilled work force to meet these labour shortages in agriculture. AnCo is concerned only with industrial training; the training agencies under the Department of Agriculture are concerned only with the training of farmers. No-one is concerned directly with the training of farm workers.  As some of the money under this fund is being used to recruit 200 additional engineering apprentices under a scheme sponsored by AnCO, money under the scheme should also be allocated to the training of skilled farm workers to assist on the land.  Some of the money should, also, be used towards funding the farm apprenticeship scheme.  There are many opportunities for people who have graduated through this scheme and have acquired skills in agriculture but, unfortunately, because, under successive governments the scheme has been chronically underfinanced, it cannot provide as many trained young men as it should be able to do.  Something should be done to ensure that some of the money collected from all employers, including farmers, would be used for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>It is the case, regrettably, that no person directly interested in agriculture is represented on the management body of the fund and they are thus not likely to be cognisant of the opportunities for employment creation existing in agriculture. I ask the Minister to consider doing something to amend either the composition of the board or the terms of <Col N="259" /> reference of the fund, to ensure that employment creation opportunities in primary production and also in processing in the agricultural field are not neglected, as they undoubtedly are at present.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the purpose of the fund as defined under the Act.  Section 3 says:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall apply the moneys standing to the credit of the Fund for the purpose of defraying expenditure on projects or schemes which in his opinion will result in the creation of additional employment or the maintenance of existing employment.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary, for the money to be spent validly, for any job to be either created or maintained.  All that the Minister needs to prove that he has acted in accordance with his statutory authority is that he had the opinion, at the time when he allocated the money, that this would be the result.  If the Minister's opinion proves to be wrong, it does not matter, so long as he had the opinion at the time that it would result in the creation of employment, that is enough.  In other words, the auditing criterion is subjective, not objective.  It does not matter if, from the expenditure of money under this fund, a single job is created, so long as the Minister thought it might be created when he allocated the money.</P>
    <P>To my mind to draft legislation as loosely as that, without proper safeguards for the expenditure of money and proper responsibility being placed on the Minister to ensure that if he allocates money for a particular purpose, that purpose is fulfilled, is to open the door to the irresponsible expenditure of public funds.  The draftsman responsible for this legislation was not cognisant, as he should have been, of the need to have specific criteria in respect of the expenditure of public funds.  Criteria such as contained in this section provide no adequate protection against misappropriation of funds.  I ask the Minister, between <Col N="260" /> now and Committee Stage, to look carefully at the provisions of this section, to see if they can be tightened up somewhat to avoid this doubt being created.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in respect of the proposed spending of the money is too broad.  The emphasis should be on the creation or maintenance of directly productive jobs, not on any kind of job, whether productive or not.  I know that there are some who will disagree with that statement but I strongly believe that that is where the priority should lie.  By productive jobs I mean jobs which are not just an end in themselves but which, by being created, will generate increased productive capacity and thereby lead to the creation of other jobs on a selfsustaining basis, without any additional State support.  That is my definition of a productive job.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the recruitment of 200 additional engineering apprentices under a scheme to be sponsored by AnCO is the correct expenditure of this money.  It will definitely lead to the creation of jobs in the private and public sectors because of the existing acute shortage of engineers and people qualified in engineering in all aspects of employment. Spending money on other types of local improvement schemes which beautify the country, however laudable that may be, does not necessarily create any further jobs.  It creates a job for the duration of a project, in that a street is being cleaned or some amenities are being added, but does not necessarily lead to any further jobs.  It may, very indirectly, improve the tourist attraction in the area and create jobs in tourism.  That is possibly arguable and if that argument can be sustained it meets the criteria I am speaking about.  The emphasis should be much more strictly on directly productive employment which, in itself, leads to creation of further employment, rather than spending the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis should be on directly productive employment.  The argument might be made that, by spending the money on any type of job, whether productive or unproductive, one is creating more expenditure in the economy which leads to increased demand for goods and services which, in itself, leads to increased employment. This was the argument used in America in the thirties for spending money on all sorts of schemes under the new deal, whether productive or not, on the grounds that, by increasing demand for goods and services, they ultimately created new jobs.  The assumption behind spending money on unproductive jobs as well as productive ones here at this time is that the same effect will ensue here.  The only flaw in that argument, as far as Ireland is concerned, is that Ireland is an open economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If by creating unproductive employment one creates additional demand the likelihood is that more than 50 per cent of that additional demand will be spent on goods and services outside the Irish economy which are imported.  More than 50 per cent of the value of this type of job creation, as far as the multiplier effect is concerned, is lost to the economy and much of the money spent is being spent indirectly on creating jobs in Birmingham, Taiwan and so on because it is spent on imported goods.  I do not believe that the multiplier argument that was applicable in the United States in the thirties is necessarily applicable here.  In the United States at that time the vast majority of any money spent was spent in the US, because there was and is very little import or export from there.  They are largely a self-sufficient economy whereas we are a largely open economy.  We cannot apply <Col N="262" /> the Keynsian argument that applied in the US in the thirties to Ireland in the eighties because we are an open economy.</P>
    <P>The emphasis should be on productive jobs because they will generate further employment within the economy, whereas if they are unproductive they will lead to expenditure on goods and services imported into the economy from outside.  Much of the beneficial effect of moneys collected from Irish employers will be enjoyed outside the Irish economy.  The Minister should have inserted in section 3 some direction to the people concerned with the fund to spend it on productive employment or employment which will have a multiplier effect or some such criterion.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to criticise&mdash;I hope the Minister in his reply will not portray me as criticising&mdash;expenditure on recreational facilities if this improves our tourist potential and thereby leads to greater employment.  If it can be shown to do so it meets my criteria.  If it does not and is merely a non-productive exercise, money should not be collected to spend in that way.  While there is a cash limit imposed on the amount the Government will contribute to the fund there is no such limit on the employer's contribution. Under sections 4 (a) and 5 of the Bill the employer's contribution will be .35 per cent of the amount of earnings paid by him.  If earnings go up by 20, 30 or 40 per cent the employer's contribution will automatically rise because it is a percentage of a figure that is rising. Under section 4 (b) the Minister's contribution is frozen at a cash limit of £10 million.  Section 7 stated that the aggregate amount in the fund shall not exceed £20 million.  That is not an adequate safeguard because one can always keep paying enough out of the fund to keep it below £20 million while still taking a larger proportion of the income of the fund from employers and a smaller proportion from the State.  There should be a cash limit on both contributions and not merely on the Government's contribution.</P>
    <P>In the long run the creation of employment <Col N="263" /> depends on the demand for goods and services produced by people. The only type of employment that will last is one based on a real demand for the results of that employment.  If one is continually adding new burdens to the employer and saying he must pay an additional contribution for this that and the other, or if he employs a person he must go through such and such a formality and must pay so much of a contribution for each person he employs, it will become more attractive for employers to use machines on which they do not have to pay any social insurance contributions rather than men on which they do. It is obviously easier to dispense with the services of a machine than it is with those of a man.  There is the danger that by piling taxes on employment, whether income tax or social insurance contributions as this budget has done, one makes it less attractive to employ people.</P>
    <P>The person making the decision about employing people does so on the basis of whether or not he can sell the goods or services he is producing in the market place.  If he can produce a given amount of goods more cheaply by using machines than by using men he will substitute the machines for the men.  The net effect of a lot of these schemes which are adding to the cost of employment will be to diminish employment.  That is an unavoidable economic reality.  All Governments should be cognisant of that and so should the social partners.  It is not an argument in favour of employers as against employees.  It is a simple reality of mathematics.  If one increases the cost of employing people and the cost of employing machines remains static there will be a substitution of machines for men.  The Minister should be very careful in his economic policy to see that this does not ensue.</P>
    <P>The money is to be paid into the Social Insurance Fund.  There has been a considerable delay in the presentation of reports of the Social Insurance Fund to this House.  If this continues there will considerable delays in presenting reports to the House on the way in which the <Col N="264" /> money is spent.  I mentioned that the Social Insurance Fund Report for 1976 was not furnished to this House until December 1979.  In other words, three years elapsed after the end of the year to which it applied before they were able to present their accounts to the House.  If we have to wait for three years for a report on the way this money is being spent, we will be waiting too long.  That sort of delay is not acceptable.  Now that additional money is to be paid into the fund I hope the report will be presented to the House with more promptitude.</P>
    <P>Why is the money being paid into the Social Insurance Fund?  As this is a separate fund I would have thought there should have been two funds.  Why it is necessary to intermingle the two funds as proposed at present?  I would have thought a separate fund should have been created and that the two should not be mixed up together.  From my reading of the Bill I cannot quite understand why this intermingling is taking place.  I am sure there is a valid explanation and if there is it should be given to the House.</P>

      <P>We have had a fairly wideranging debate covering economic principles and arguments, many of which seem to be more appropriate to the budget debate.  The debate touched on the employment situation and development proposals in many parts of the country even in relation to specific industries.  Obviously it is not appropriate that I should chase each hare raised during the course of the discussion but it is important that I should put the broad principles which were touched upon in proper context and that I should reply to some of the arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one or two introductory points in response to what Deputy Barry said at the beginning of his contribution. I will not make any comment on the fact that the speech was five or ten seconds late.  Deputy Barry said there had been discourtesy to the House in having a statement issued yesterday without informing the House in the first instance.  I want to explain what the tripartite committee do, what their function <Col N="265" /> is, what their relationship with me is as Minister for Finance.  They do not have a direct relationship to this House. Deputy Barry does not seem to understand that.</P>
    <P>The decision on the announcement yesterday about the employer's temporary subvention scheme was taken by the tripartite committee at their meeting last week.  The committee are free at any time, as they have already done, to announce the outcome of their considerations. As chairman of the committee, I facilitate the committee to the extent agreed between us as to the announcement's about what they have agreed.  It was the intention of the committee that that decision should be published last week.  In the event it was not possible to do that.  In response to the decision of the committee I made a formal announcement on their behalf yesterday.  This is not a matter specifically within the responsibility of the Minister for Finance on his own in respect of which he would be answerable to this House.  Obviously, he would make the announcement here if he had the sole decision or the sole function. This demonstrates on the part of those who made the criticisms, and Deputy Barry in particular, a lack of understanding of the role and function of the committee and the Minister's role as chairman and one of the parties to the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now putting the matter clearly on the record.  Unless people want to find instances of discourtesy on every little detail such as a speech not being ready, or something like that, far from being discourteous it seemed to me to be giving useful information to the House about a matter in respect of which the Minister is not immediately responsible for making available to them details of the kind I announced on behalf of the committee yesterday.  When I was doing that on behalf of the committee, and in response to their decision, it did not occur to me that this was a discourtesy of the nature about which Deputy <Col N="266" /> Barry made such a brouhaha.  If little matters of that sort are to be the subject of nit-picking and taken up as being discourteous, we might get to the stage&mdash;although I assure the Deputy it will not happen to me as Minister for Finance&mdash;where somebody might be afraid to do anything positive or courteous in case somebody else wanted to put another interpretation on it and say it was discourteous.</P>
      <P>I am in no way responsible for the fact that a report appeared in one of yesterday's papers about this matter.  Perhaps it was earlier; I am not quite sure.  It did not come from me.  I have had many positive and useful discussions with the tripartite committee.  I will come back to that later.  I respect their integrity and their confidentiality.  If journalists happen to get information they can and do treat their sources as confidential.  I do not suppose the reporter concerned will disclose where his information came from.  My Department and I respect confidentiality, I also respect the attitude to that of the other parties.  It is as well not to pursue that further.  I do not think any purpose would be served by pursuing it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry and Deputy O'Leary implied&mdash;not implied; it is fair to say they stated&mdash;that I had engaged in something ranging from hypocrisy to pulling the wool over the eyes of the parties to the tripartite committee.  Deputy Barry went so far as to say I was fooling the committee.  He said he was surprised that the employers and trade unions could be misled and in some way fooled in a way which, his perception being naturally sharper than theirs he had taken note of.  He said I fooled them into acting as dupes by making substitute arrangements for expenditure programmes which he implied I had cut off completely in the course of the arrangements for the public expenditure programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two things need to be said.  First, I do not share his opinion of the employer or trade union organisations who serve on this committee, probable because I met them in a very positive framework since I became Minister for Finance.  Even if it <Col N="267" /> were my intention to do that, I do not think they would be easily duped.  Secondly, the allegations made by Deputy Barry are wrong.  He may wish to be wrong.  He may choose, as Deputy Collins did on other occasions, to represent his allegations as being facts and then reach any conclusion he wishes. That is an old game.  Anybody with even the most basic training in logic will know that, if you start from a false premise, you can argue to any conclusion. Deputy Barry engaged very freely in that this morning.</P>
    <P>The programmes for employment creation under the employment guarantee fund I am talking about are for additional employment over and above any programme of employment the Government have in hand, over and above what is being done through the various departments, whether industry, agriculture, health, education or any other.  I repeat with deliberation that there is no intention on our part of fooling the employers and trade unions into doing in the employment area what the Government are not prepared to do.  This is true for very good reasons.  First, the need to do so does not arise because of any failure by the Government to meet their targets or employment commitments.  Secondly &mdash;and this is confirmation by another route&mdash;I do not ask people necessarily to accept my version of this, although I am quite satisfied as to my own credibility and consistency in the area. Deputy Barry may take as a fact from me that this programme and many of the matters announced here were decided before the determination of the Government programme of expenditure for this year had even begun.  That, as a corroborating factor if no more, in itself confirms what I am saying and refutes what Deputy Barry said.  It is very important not just as vindication of me as Minister for Finance of the Government but because of the special relationships that have been built up in the tripartite committee as an element of the national understanding that it should not be allowed to be undermined either by <Col N="268" /> ignorance&mdash;Deputy Barry has demonstrated a fair measure of that in relation to what the purpose of this committee is&mdash;or perhaps by a certain malevolence regarding its whole purpose and what it can achieve.  I could not allow that situation to be created, I hope those factors will emerge.</P>
    <P>I can give some other corroborating factors which may help to deal with some of these allegations that there has been a shortfall.  This morning the Taoiseach referred to the fact that we speak with one voice and there was a smart-alec comment from an Opposition Deputy referring to &ldquo;Michael who&rdquo; as if I am the mouthpiece for somebody and have no mind of my own.  I rely on my record and performance to prove that I do my job as part of a team and not just as a mouthpiece for anybody but for the Government and people.  We claim consistency and team work.  Apparently, you prove that you are your own man by expressing your own personal opinion irrespective of how it fits in with an overall, comprehensive party decision. But not only as between the two Opposition parties but as between two members of the Fine Gael Party this morning we had contradictory positions openly stated in relation to job creation programmes.  We had Deputy Barry complaining about certain environmental schemes, tourist development schemes and other schemes not being pursued to the same extent in the Public Capital Programme this year as they had been.  As I heard it, his complaint was a matter certainly warranting severe criticism.  That may be his personal opinion but I think I am entitled to listen to him only as spokesman on Finance for his party and take note of what he says. But the spokesman for Agriculture openly takes issue with the spokesman on Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He said he was not in <Col N="269" /> favour of what he called non-productive employment, jobs for the sake of creating jobs.  He even mentioned environmental scheme programmes specifically.  He went on to speak about a number of others, the very ones in respect of which Deputy Barry, as spokesman on Finance, criticised us for cutting.  Indeed, if there was to be that kind of aberration, Deputy Barry would be managing the public finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With scarcely any response.  Now Deputy Barry finds it difficult when the facts are put before him as a reality.  Let me remind Deputy Barry and Deputy O'Leary, in their capacities as spokesmen for their parties, that for some reason they may wish to preach doom and gloom.  That may be their purpose and function as they see it but they are preaching against a number of realities.  None of them in talking about a cut-back on employment programmes made any reference to the fact that even this morning I specifically said that, as Minister for Finance, I had in examining the public expenditure programme made a priority of the agencies concerned with job creation.  They ignore that.  To demonstrate that priority the allocation for the IDA this year on the capital side was increased from £119 million to £145 million, a 23 per cent increase. Unless one ignores the reality all around us and particularly outside Ireland, a jump of that sort is in itself clear evidence of the Government's commitment to not only maintaining but expanding employment here.  That is only one example; I can give more later in relation to housing.  This, in addition to the 25 per cent increase in the provision <Col N="271" /> for Córas Tráchtála shows, that in regard to the employment area and agencies specifically concerned with them we intend, in what I do not deny is a difficult economic environment to maintain and try to expand employment. I have been made even more conscious of the difficulty of the times having attended a meeting of EEC Ministers on St. Patrick's Day.  Perhaps some here chose to ignore the realities in the world and would say that, whether or not there are difficulties in the OECD countries or in the developed countries, we should not even mention these difficulties.  I not only mention them but I am prepared to ensure that we maintain the level of employment. The evidence is that we are succeeding in doing so.</P>
      <P>At this point I must make two comparisons. I have referred to the international environment particularly within the EEC&mdash;and this was confirmed at the meeting on St. Patrick's Day&mdash;of reduced growth.  It would seem from what Deputy P. Barry and Deputy M. O'Leary said that they would wish me to ignore that, that they would wish me to suggest to the Irish people that we should ignore these realities.  Deputy O'Leary particularly seemed concerned that there may be a reduction in growth in Ireland this year, as if that kind of thing had not happened anywhere else or should not be allowed happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that there will be a reduction in growth as a consequence of the international economic environment and we as an exporting nation, and particularly as an energy-dependent exporting nation, will be affected immediately. We will find perhaps that the impact of this will result in a reduction of up to 1 per cent in our growth target on what it would have been otherwise.  That is a factor deriving from the outside.  It is simply a consequence of the reduction in the demand in the markets we supply, a reduction in the growth patterns in the economies on which we as an exporting nation are particularly dependent.  It is a factor also of the increased cost of energy.  These are realities.  I would <Col N="272" /> suggest to the House, particularly to the spokesmen for Finance, that at least we owe it to the public to acknowledge those realities.  Though I was being accused here this morning of being almost two-faced, of being hypocritical or hiding things or doing nothing about them, I am stating the realities.</P>
    <P>Having said that these things have an impact on growth, I am saying that nonetheless Government policies and programmes lessen that impact.</P>
    <P>In my responsibility as Minister for Finance, with particular responsibility for economic planning, I am determined to ensure that we will to the maximum extent possible absorb these unwelcome impacts from outside.  I demonstrated this in relation to the allocations I proposed to the Government particularly in relation to the Public Capital Programme.  The provisions of this bill constitute further evidence and I shall deal with some of them in greater detail in a moment.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies opposite would not expect me to be so restrained as not to make some relevant comparisons, because we are talking about employment here.  The last year for which these figures are available, namely, 1979&mdash;and allowing for what I have said: that the projections for this year throughout the EEC are, if anything, worse&mdash;showed that we had an unemployment figure at the time of the impact of the energy crisis of 7.9 per cent: lower than Belgium, which had about 1 per cent more; about the same as Italy, which was about 7.7 per cent; and not too far above the United Kingdom or Denmark, which were over 5½ per cent, or France, which was 6 per cent.  The average in the EEC as a whole at that time was over 5½ per cent.  In other words, our position as a country that has not the same resources is very respectable and is a vindication of Government programmes and of the positive and consistent direction in Government.  That was the position as it obtained in 1979.  I can assure the House that that direction is being and will be maintained in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> When I hear some of the suggestions from the other side of the House about what we are failing to do in employment it is worthwhile to contrast them with the situation that obtained in 1975 after the impact of the oil crisis at that time.  We then had the highest rate of unemployment in the EEC.  Indeed the two former Ministers who were complaining this morning had some responsibility for this&mdash;the former Minister for Transport and Power and former Minister for Labour.  Before they commence to criticise this Government's &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, as they represent it, they might reflect for a moment on the fact that at that time they were out on their own.  Ireland had no comfortable partners in the unemployment situation.  We were just short of 9 per cent in 1975 and nearest us, way at the bottom of the league, was Italy with 5.3 per cent.  France then was 3.9 per cent, as distinct from 6.1 per cent at present. Luxembourg was 0.2 per cent; Denmark was 4.6 per cent&mdash;all of them lower then than they are now or were in 1979.  But we were higher then than we are now or were in 1979.  We were very much on our own at the bottom of the employment table or the top of the unemployment table.  The two former Ministers who complained this morning about our employment programme must be acutely aware that this rings rather hollow at a time when we are able to absorb the shocks&mdash;and they are shocks &mdash;on western developed economies at present.  We are succeeding in doing that very much more effectively than they managed at that time.</P>
    <P>Indeed these spokesmen even touched on the consumer price index, which is not particularly relevant to this debate. Nevertheless I may be forgiven for saying that there was mention a few times of an inflation figure of approximately 21 per cent in 1975&mdash;of which no doubt the Opposition will be very well aware&mdash;in Ireland at a time when it was approximately 13 per cent in the EEC.  The corresponding figure in Ireland in the course of last year was of the order of 13.2 per cent when it was of the order of 10 per cent in the EEC.  We were in 1975 very much the highest in inflation but we <Col N="274" /> were nowhere near that last year in the EEC league.  I merely mention that; I am sure the world knows it.  What amazes me is that Opposition spokesmen, and particularly those who were members of a previous Government, can ignore these realities and come in here and endeavour to convey an impression that we are in a period of doom, gloom or desperation when the very opposite is the case.  In fact I think one or other of the Opposition spokesmen this morning&mdash;and I do not know when they speak as spokesmen or whether they are giving their personal opinions, but I would prefer to take the responsibility of a front bench man as a spokesman&mdash;talked about the 20 per cent rate of inflation we have here.  I do not know.  Perhaps they want to gallop into the doom that is not there.  Perhaps they want to gallop towards realising the worst that could possibly happen.  I am sorry to disappoint them.  That is not the way it is.  That is not the rate of inflation. I do not even choose to present the reality to them.  It is not for me to counsel them in their own interests as a party&mdash;they are the best judges of that themselves&mdash;but it is wrong that the Opposition should try to create doom or gloom where it does not exist and then invite the Minister for Finance to take issue with them.  I think what I have said should clear the air very considerably.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may revert to the matters raised in relation to the Bill itself and endeavour to deal with them in the order in which they arose.  Deputy P. Barry asked about the setting up of a National Hire Agency.  I can tell the Deputy that arrangements are going ahead under the direction of the Minister for Labour&mdash;though it is not germane to this Bill nevertheless out of courtesy I should mention it&mdash;and discussions are proceeding with the employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  A similar situation arises in relation to the National Enterprise Agency.</P>
    <P>A discussion paper has been sent to the ICTU and to the employers in relation to the National Enterprise Agency and if I had not been involved in the debate here this morning I would have <Col N="275" /> been engaged in discussions with the social partners, particularly the trade unions, on the finalisation of this matter.  I will be meeting the ICTU within the next week for discussions in this area.  I hope that this clears up any doubts in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said there is a direct link between cut-backs in the budget and the schemes being catered for in this Bill. I have dealt specifically with that, but I want to make it clear that many of the proposals being confirmed here today were decided on before I started examining the current and capital budget programme for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The procedure in relation to project examination by the tripartite committee is that a number of suggestions are made to the committee by the social partners, the State-sponsored bodies and other organisations.  These proposals are analysed in great detail, they are discussed from the point of view of job creation, not just for its own sake but what one might call work generation. This is a very important part of the committee's consideration.  One of the priorities of such consideration is that the jobs being created will in turn generate permanent employment in so far as that is possible.  There is always the prospect of permanent employment being created in each case.  Of course that is not the only criterion, as can be seen from a number of the decisions taken.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of the committee we defined clear criteria for the allocation of fund resources to projects, and the desirability to create jobs which in turn will generate other jobs is one of the central elements.  We reached global agreement at last week's meeting of the committee on the allocation of £18 million of the entire £20 million.  That leaves £2 million to be allocated.  In broad terms I will give the amounts of the allocations.</P>
    <P>A sum of £5 million has been allocated for the subsidy towards the Employers' Temporary Subvention Scheme; £2 <Col N="276" /> million for supplementary payments under the employment incentive scheme; £5 million for 1,000 jobs in the public service&mdash;that had been decided before the Government programme for current and capital expenditure was announced&mdash;and up to £3.5 million for a programme of youth employment and sports facilities.  There are other projects from the FUE earmarked for the balance of the £20 million.  The committee go about their job in a critical, detailed and businesslike way and they analyse carefully proposals from the various applicants. I have said already £18 million has been allocated and decisions in principle have been taken on them.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the recreational projects.  In this connection it is not necessary for me to vindicate the Government's commitment to youth programmes as against the commitment of the previous Government.  I invite the Opposition to look at the Estimates provided in their day and in ours and they will find a vast gap between what we are and have been doing and their failure to do anything.  I will not make any further point on that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the sports council.  His contribution to that body, set up by us, was to allow them to die. Consequently, the Minister of State, Deputy Tunney, had to begin the work all over again.  These facts are not forgotten by sports organisations and others.</P>
    <P>These projects are in addition to facilities being provided by the Government through the Department of Education. The purpose is to provide jobs at the construction stage and in the supervision and maintenance of the facilities when they are built.  I am particularly glad the Opposition have welcomed that part of the programme in the same way as the social partners welcomed it when the Taoiseach announced it some weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The tripartite committee have now taken a decision in principle to go ahead with it.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education, in consultation with the sports council, Cospóir, <Col N="277" /> have already presented to the tripartite committee a list of the specific projects they would propose.  They are well equipped to do that.  It is a matter for the tripartite committee to decide which of these projects proposed by the Minister of State and the Sports Council they will pursue.  This will have to be on the basis of free access.  I interpret Deputy Hegarty's concern as saying that one has to have a person with full-time responsibility as distinct from having a voluntary approach on the part of an amateur, which is also very welcome.  I agree with that but I am sure the Deputy will also agree that what we have in mind here&mdash;I believe I can interpret the Committee's decision very clearly&mdash;is that those particular projects will not be limited in use or access to any part of the public.  It cannot be one sports group who will have the facility.  They will be community facilities in the real sense of the word.  They will not be limited to any educational institution.  They may be made available to educational institutions and sports clubs but they will, by definition, be for general community use. I can assure the House that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the FUE, the Confederation of Irish Industries and I, as Minister for Finance representing the Government's interest in this, are all agreed on those priorities.  There will be employment involved in the construction, maintenance and supervision of the programmes when they are done.</P>
    <P>I am sure I will be forgiven if I say that it is evidence again of the Government's commitment in this area.  The Taoiseach proposed it and I followed it through at the committee.  We welcome the very definite response we got from the partners to the committee, which has been endorsed to a very considerable extent by the House this morning.  It clearly demonstrates my view that proper provision for our young people by recreation or facilities ranks very high in the Government's programme in relation to employment and in relation to facilities made available to them.  The facts speak for themselves, <i>res ipsa loquitur.</i> When these facts are analysed, on our record or by comparison with the <Col N="278" /> record of our predecessors, I have no doubt what the conclusion of the young people of Ireland will be.  It will be the same as it was two and a half years ago for very good reasons.</P>
    <P>In reply to some points made by Deputy Bruton, I am not in a position to give directions to this committee about what they should do or the criteria they should set.  I should not be in that position. It would be totally to misunderstand the whole national understanding idea and the role of this committee within the national understanding to say that I could direct the committee as to how they should apply their money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said that agriculture did not seem to figure very high.  In fact, a number of the programmes that have been provided for here are for agriindustries. The Irish Sugar Company are receiving considerable benefit from some of the programmes.  There is rural road development, particularly in turf development areas, bog roads and development of roads generally in relation to agriculture.  They have also been approved for employment programmes by the committee and have been endorsed and accepted.</P>
    <P>In relation to what the employers' role is as employers, it was suggested this morning that, first of all, we are milking them, secondly, we are fooling them and, thirdly, we are taking the money from them for something that we should be doing.  I have answered that generally but I want to add something which corroborates how that is a misconception which exists on one side of the House.  The sooner that side of the House clear that misconception the better because it is not in accordance with the facts.  It was the employers who made the proposal to set up this fund and Deputy Barry should be aware of that.  It was the employers who proposed that they would contribute £10 million to this fund.</P>

      <P>There is no secrecy attached to this.  If the Deputy goes back to the time when the national understanding was being discussed and this element was also being discussed he will find this information.  The Deputy's sources of information would have to be very poor indeed if he was not aware of the facts.  It does not warrant a public statement from me to disclose something which I thought, quite frankly, was commonly known.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to check back to see what was said at the time by the employer organisations in making these proposals.  If my recollection is any way right I made this proposal public.  Deputy Barry does not seem to have known that.  I am almost certain about this.  It was the Government who subsequently decided to match the employer proposal by £10 million.  Whether or not it was made public at the time becomes an issue of detail now in view of the reality that the initiative came from the employer side and the Government decided that their contribution to it would match the employers £ for £.  That proves once and for all that it is not a question of the Government fooling the employers and getting them to come in on this scheme that we dreamed up as being in aid of our public expenditure programmes, then using the money and misrepresenting where it was coming from and what it was doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the employment maintenance scheme a number of factors arose here.  Some Deputies said that we were being rather too apologetic.  I will go as far as I can and hope that the House will be sufficiently appreciative of the nuances to recognise that what is being done is in the national interest.  I have a feeling that the Chair recognises <Col N="280" /> my problem and my interest in this issue. Notice had been served on the Government for some time that the employment maintenance scheme must terminate by a certain date, along with a similar scheme being operated in Britain.  This matter was clearly indicated to the Government.  The Government had full knowledge of it.  Deputy Barry will find out, if he checks his speech, that he made an issue of the fact that the Estimate only provides a certain amount for the employment maintenance scheme in comparison with last year.  This was certainly published so Deputy Barry must know that the scheme must terminate on 31 March.  I do not believe that even Deputy Barry would suggest that we should provide money for a scheme beyond March which had to terminate on 31 March.  That is the explanation for the reduction, if the Deputy wants to call it that, in the employment maintenance scheme.  As the record will show, that was made as a major point of issue by Deputy Barry and the reality is as I explained. That being so, the Government would not be in a position to introduce a scheme which would be more or less the same as the EEC had shot down here, in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the tripartite committee, particularly the employer and trade union organisations that the contributions the employers were making to the fund could be used for this purpose and I welcome their response.  I want to specifically draw Deputies' attention to a statement I made yesterday.  I announced on behalf of the committee that</P>
    <P>... the Employer and Industry Organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have agreed to provide £5 million from the Employment Guarantee Fund to finance a new temporary scheme of assistance for firms in place of the Employment Maintenance Scheme....</P>
    <P>The new scheme, to be known as the Employers' Temporary Subvention will operate from 1st April until December....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> The scheme will be administered by a steering committee of Employer and Congress representatives....</P>
    <P>Deputies will note a significant absence of the Minister for Finance.  I appreciate that the committee took a decision to enable us to get a scheme which would not fall foul of EEC regulations, as the employment maintenance scheme did.</P>
    <P>I have heard the argument put forward by Deputy Hegarty very often. He asks why we should do what the EEC say?  He says we should ignore them and tell them where to go.  One group in this country who might feel a counter-productive blast if we adopted that attitude is the farming community. It has been suggested here that we should tell the EEC to go to hell; that we should tell them when to negotiate with third countries, whether it is the Lomé countries, ACP countries or countries like China or the Asian countries with whom the community want to develop relations; and that we should tell them what to do with their imports.  Should we tell them we do not want to engage in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades, which is a very important element in terms of our dependency as an exporting nation?  We live in the reality of Europe, which lives in the reality of GATT, and the OECD.  In terms of the overall balance we cannot say &ldquo;give us, give us&rdquo;, but if we have to give something we cannot say &ldquo;get lost&rdquo;.  I do not know if that is what Deputy Hegarty suggested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This action and many others taken by the Government on the employment maintenance scheme are guaranteeing our benefits while not doing it too obviously.  Ireland has done very well in this area.  Anybody who negotiates in the EEC knows the one thing you do not do is to insist on what is your right to the exclusion of the Community interests generally.  The real role of negotiation in the EEC and elsewhere is to interpret the rules of the treaties and the arrangements with other countries to maximum advantage and that is what this Government have been doing very successfully.  It is very easy to sit on the wall and crow &ldquo;we will not have it&rdquo;, but when we get the reaction of our partners we might find that the agricultural element will suffer.  The proposed scheme is a very suitable substitute for the scheme that has been terminated.  I want to express my appreciation for the quick response from both sides.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the committee is essentially job creation.  I was glad to note that the approach of the committee has been flexible and realistic.  When there is a possibility that jobs will be lost unless action is taken, it is at least arguable that what the committee decided was the right thing to do.  A job saved has the same value as a job created.  Some Deputies said that when this scheme was introduced they did not think it was part of job maintenance as distinct from job creation.  This was raised with the committee and I welcome their response. They acted responsibly and quickly when introducing this scheme.  Irish industry, particularly in the sensitive areas of textiles, leather footwear and so on, will benefit from their immediate and positive response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Kenny that the capital of Ireland is not shifting to Waterford, although one would never guess from listening to Deputy E. Collins.  At one stage I thought the wastelands of Ireland were being relocated in Waterford.  The development <Col N="283" /> of the Airport there is important not just for Waterford but for the whole region.  I want to discuss the dredger to be built by Ross Company Limited, New Ross.  The money proposed will be for employment maintenance in the Ross Shipyard Company.  It is important that they be funded from this programme. The intention is to maintain at a very critical time the employment for up to 170 people in the shipyard.  That it will also be of benefit to Waterford Harbour is a happy consequence, but the main purpose is to maintain employment in the New Ross area.</P>
    <P>It will be of benefit to Waterford Harbour to have a new dredger.  At present officials of my Department and representatives of the committee are having discussions with Waterford Harbour Commissioners to ensure that the commissioners make an appropriate contribution to this programme, because we are not going to concentrate all our benefits in one area.  I hope that the Deputies from that region will recognise that funds are available to harbour commissioners and that they can raise funds either through dues or otherwise to make a contribution towards a dredger for them from a company which we on the committee are anxious to ensure will remain viable and successful.  I appeal to the Waterford Harbour Commissioner to take account of that in the course of consultations which will take place in the interests of the jobs in the shipyard company and in the interests of the development of the harbour generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry raised a point in relation to the surcharge on the employers' contribution.  It is to last for one year only, there is no question about that.</P>

      <P>From my reading of the Bill the intention is clearly expressed here but if not any amendment made directly as a consequence of what Deputy Barry said or put by himself will be considered.  Deputy Bruton was concerned that the criterion should be left to matters which in the Minister's opinion would result in additional employment. Section 3 says:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall apply the moneys standing to the credit of the Fund for the purpose of defraying expenditure on projects or schemes which in his opinion will result in the creation of additional employment or the maintenance of existing employment.</P>
      <P>That is the manner in which these matters are expressed in legislation.  From my reply it will be clear to the House that my opinion will simply confirm the decisions reached by the committee.  The Minister does not act in isolation here even with the benefit of advice from his Department.  The Minister implements the decisions of the tripartite committee of which he is chairman.  It is not just a matter of the Minister's opinion, as Deputy Bruton seems to interpret it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said that the Government were dragging their feet on the national understanding.  That is not the view coming through to us in our discussions with the trade unions.  Deputy O'Leary will have to search hard to find any basis for his implication that there is a lack of commitment on the part of the Government.  If the Deputy goes through all the 38 commitments in the understanding he will find that the Government have fulfilled the greater part of their obligations.  We have honoured the pay and taxation terms, and the record of the Government, as a party to the understanding, bears comparison with that of any other party.  What Deputy O'Leary tried to imply this morning was <Col N="285" /> not in accordance with the facts.  The trade unions have not expressed the views attributed to them by Deputy O'Leary.  Naturally the trade unions have reservations about various things. That is what discussions are for.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary was concerned about the building and construction industry and said that we were introducing a deflationary policy.  The Public Capital Programme this year is over £150 million greater than the 1979 outturn. Over £110 million of this will go to areas which will benefit the building industry particularly.  Despite the change in the housing grants scheme, expenditure as a whole on housing will rise by £23 million from £159 million to £182 million this year.  That gives the lie to any suggestion that we are cutting back on building programmes, housing programmes or infrastructure programmes which are central to employment.  In a very difficult international economic environment we are coping a good deal better than most with the realities forced upon us.  It would not serve the House well that the Opposition Deputies be allowed to give the impression that we are plunging into a recession when we are maintaining our development targets.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with nearly all the points raised in this far-ranging debate and if there are further points perhaps Deputies will remind me of them on Committee Stage.  I thank Deputies for their welcome for this measure and I hope we have reassured those who thought that this was either a subterfuge or a piece of hypocrisy.  This is a very positive move on the part of the tripartite committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" />&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann approve of the Health Contribution (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1980, in draft.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that the Minister for Health may by regulations vary the health contribution rate and the ceiling level on which the maximum level of contributions payable by an individual in any particular contribution year is assessed.  The present rate of health contribution is 1 per cent and the ceiling is £5,500.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing that the rate of contribution should be varied for the contribution year 1980-81.  The rate will remain at 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations which are now before the Dáil for approval provide for a variation in the ceiling from £5,500 to £7,000.  The ceiling figure of £7,000 is the same as that specified in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1980, which has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As in the case of social insurance the new ceiling level for health contribution purposes is to apply for the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1980.</P>
    <P>The collection of pay-related health contributions for employees is integrated with the administrative machinery for the collection of pay-related social insurance, occupational injuries insurance and redundancy contributions.  Contributions are collected through the tax collection system.  It is necessary that the ceiling level in each case should be identical. If it were otherwise the administration of the overall system would be greatly hindered.  That approach also facilitates employers in their administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>The revised ceiling level as it affects employees will be the same in the case of the self-employed, farmers and other individuals who are not insured under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>The actual amount of health contributions to be paid depends on the income of the individual.  The ceiling of £7,000 will limit the maximum amount payable <Col N="289" /> by any individual in the contribution year 1980-81 to £70.  In the determination of the maximum amount payable all source of income are taken into account.</P>
    <P>I would now ask the House to approve of the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1980, in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that on his first visit to the House to ask the House to agree to a statutory function of the Minister for Health the new Minister should engage in this exercise which can only be described as bordering on deceit and misrepresentation.  To suggest that in any way the limit for eligibility for these health services in being increased from £5,500 to £7,000 is to disregard completely the facts, the terms of the national understanding and the <i>de facto</i> situation as it obtains.  It is extraordinary that the Minister should have the gall to come in here and suggest to the House that the income limit for the health services' eligibility be increased from £5,500 to £7,000 without any reference whatsoever to the terms of the national understanding or to the chaos which his predecessor and his predecessor in turn created since 25 July last in the health service.  While at this time last year, on 27 March, the Minister's predecessor, who is now Taoiseach, was in the House asking the House to agree to a limit of £5,500 for health eligibility, the other arm of the Government at the time were negotiating the national understanding. As part of that negotiation of the national understanding the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Taoiseach of the day negotiated a different ceiling for eligibility for health services.  In <i>National Understanding for Economic and Social Development</i> on page 8 it is stated:</P>
      <P>The Government have authorised the Minister for Health to make arrangements for an upward revision of the health eligibility limit from £5,500 to £7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the Government had not got around to informing the then Minister for Health that they were negotiating <Col N="290" /> such an upward increase in the eligibility limit because the Minister on 27 March last year was assuring us here in the House that he believed that the limit of £5,500 was a fair one which was acceptable to the ICTU.  He said, and I quote from the Official Report, column 458, volume 313:</P>
    <P>This new limit of £5,500 relates to income for the year ending 5 April 1979.  It will apply throughout the following year, that is during the year up to 5 April 1980.  Before that date it will be reviewed having regard to changes in incomes and it will be increased again if circumstances warrant this.</P>
    <P>We were all surprised&mdash;probably no one more so than the Minister for health&mdash;to find that within a fortnight it had been reviewed and in the terms of the national understanding increased to £7,000.  The Minister for Health at the time then discovered the administrative difficulties involved and announced that he was introducing an interim scheme whereby all those whose earnings were between £5,500 and £7,000 could claim from the VHI the moneys expended on the health service for which they would not otherwise have been covered irrespective of whether they were subscribers to that board. That situation has obtained since 25 July last.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the present Minister walks into the House here today&mdash;and into the Seanad yesterday&mdash;and invites the House, without comment or explanation, to approve the increasing of the income limit from £5,500 to £7,000 without any reference to the national understanding or the fact that people who apparently, through whatever <i>de facto</i> situation, have cover now up to £7,000 are going to discover themselves to be excluded during the course of the coming year because the national understanding will have brought a certain number of them, roughly those who were earning something like £6,500, above the limit of £7,000 as they will find when they get their P.60 form for the financial year up <Col N="291" /> to April.  No regard whatsoever is being taken of the situation in relation to those people, and the Minister has not the courtesy to inform the House that this <i>de facto</i> situation obtains.</P>
    <P>A more important situation which has not been dealt with is the question of the statutory authority for the expenditure of the money on the people whose incomes were between £5,500 and £7,000.  That expenditure has gone on since 25 July last through the aegis of the VHI Board without any statutory authority in the Dáil and no request is being made for retrospective authority for the expenditure of those public moneys.  If authority was to be sought one would have expected that it would have been sought today in relation to both the regularising now of the income limit and the making of new regulations for the coming year.  However, there has been no reference to that in the House. Beyond a reply to a parliamentary question of 23 October last the House has never been informed as to where authority for the payment of these moneys for people whose incomes were between £5,500 and £7,000 came from between July last and now.  The Minister for Health apparently is still making no effort to inform the House, nor indeed is he making any effort to inform the health boards, who have been thrown into utter chaos and confusion because they do not have any legislative or statutory authority for expenditure of moneys on their part&mdash;for instance on the Infant Welfare Scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of requests from individuals and groups seeking to have citizen band radio legalised.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the desires of the people concerned and am favourably disposed to meet their wishes in so far as they are capable of being met without causing unacceptable interference to other users of the radio spectrum.</P>
      <P>An immediate difficulty is that the type of equipment popularly known as citizen band radio, which is being used and offered for sale in many parts of the country, is imported equipment, designed to operate only in the 27 megahertz band.  It may be legally operated in certain other countries where this frequency band has been allocated for it, but not in this country where the 27 megahertz band has, for many years, been allocated to other users.</P>
      <P>Existing licensed users of the radio spectrum expect to be protected against harmful interference from unlicensed users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that during the past six months RTE, in particular, has received many complaints alleging interference to <Col N="294" /> television reception by the types of citizen band radio equipment in use here at present, but no similar complaints have so far been received affecting safety of life services, although that risk exists. The number of such complaints could be expected to increase significantly if a new and potentially very numerous class of user were to be freely licensed to operate in the 27 megahertz band. Before I could do so, therefore, I would have to be satisfied that the types of equipment to be licensed would not cause unavoidable interference to other radio users and/or that a more suitable band was not available.  I am not so satisfied at this stage.</P>
    <P>My Department is, at present, carrying out an in-depth intensive investigation regarding the frequency bands most suitable for a service of the kind in question. It is also seeking more detailed information about developments in this field and about general technological development of this type of equipment elsewhere.  Until I have this report on those aspects, it would be premature for me to make definite decisions.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the legal position is as stated in my answer to Deputy Enright's questions on this subject on 13 December last, columns 1861 and 1862 of Volume 317 of the Official Reports refer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister, if he is not going to allow the 27 megahertz band to be used by citizen band radio users, if he will set aside some other band?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As indicated in my reply to Deputy Deasy, in the first paragraph of my statement:</P>
      <P>I appreciate the desires of the people concerned and am favourably disposed to meet their wishes....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the complaints he has received about interference from citizen band users are genuine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am quite satisfied that they are genuine.  I give the Deputy <Col N="295" /> some instances, because there are a lot of questions here.  The Department have not received complaints of interference to the other services&mdash;such as safety services. I emphasise, however, that there is a risk and while there is a risk, it is my responsibility to eliminate that risk. There are numerous complaints concerning television, as stated in my reply. There are other complaints as well, that there have been cases of interference in categories such as model airplanes.  This has not been proved outright beyond doubt, to have been caused by citizen band radio but we believe it may be. Does that answer satisfy Deputy Deasy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Is the Minister aware that there are 13 other countries in Europe operating citizen band radio legally and that there are no such complaints of interference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply, if the Deputy remembers, I stated that 27 megahertz is the band used for other radio equipment in this country, which may not be so in the countries the Deputy has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister if he is familiar with the letter which was sent by his Department to the National Council of Citizen Band Users on 4 January last, in which the Department threatened users of CB radio with prosecution under legislation which has not yet been discussed in this House and if he condones&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extract:</P>
      <P>However, under the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1979, which has been introduced in Dáil Éireann, the penalty provisions for being in possession of or using unlicensed wireless telegraphy apparatus are being increased to a maximum of £500 on summary conviction and £10,000 and forfeiture of the equipment on conviction on indictment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>That concerns the matter of unlicensed wireless operators.  They are separate from CB.  Citizens band radio is basically a social service, operating in smaller districts.  In certain circumstances that we have knowledge of citizen band has been used as a form of communication from this country to Florida.  I suggest that those people are not working within the controls normally laid down by citizen band radio and citizen band radio organisations.  They should be licensed as amateur license holders.  That is not what citizen band radio is for.  That is the point made in that letter.</P>

I told the Deputy that we have intensive investigations going on.  Senior officials of my Department are having the matter investigated in its entirety at present so that when we bring <Col N="299" /> in legislation to legalise citizen band radio it will be good and will never again in the history of the State have to be tampered with.  That is very important from two points: first, there will be no risk to users of any other type of radio equipment and, secondly, when they purchase their equipment it will not require readjustment and extra cost on them.</P>

Is the amount of fuel in trucks entering and leaving the countries <Col N="301" /> in question measured so that duty will be charged on the difference?

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding motor vehicle licence fees, these may be of two kinds&mdash;fees payable at home and those payable while in other EEC member states.  With regard to fees payable at home it is understood from the Department of the Environment that under the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle which is liable for road tax and which is used in a public place in the State has a legal obligation to pay the appropriate rate of tax on the vehicle. The Department say there is no provision for rebates of road tax for commercial vehicles in respect of periods spent abroad.  Regarding the other question, there is a duty on fuel oil under EEC Directive 68297.</P>

      <P>The Minister answered a question I did not ask, I am asking him if a fee is charged to Irish hauliers when in continental countries by the continental countries in respect of the days spent in those countries?  If that is the case would the Minister not agree that this constitutes double taxation in that the haulier in question is paying taxation for the entire year to the Irish authority and also paying a fee in respect of parts of the same year to the continental authority?  That is double taxation and something that continental carriers operating within the continental country would not have to pay thereby giving them a competitive advantage.</P>

Reciprocal facilities are granted to carriers from those countries while they are in Ireland. It is understood that no road taxes or duties are levied on Irish vehicles while they are operating in the UK, Denmark, Netherlands or Luxembourg.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 11, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decision, announced on 31 May 1979, in favour of the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban rail services covered the provision of new rolling stock for those services.</P>
      <P>CIE have also submitted to my Department proposals for the acquisition of 100 new mainline coaches, the purpose of which is to extend the use of modern air-conditioned coaches to all basic mainline week-day services.</P>
      <P>The CIE plans for the acquisition of new rolling stock envisage the establishment of a new coach building industry at Inchicore by a German firm.  This project also envisages further substantial orders by CIE for rolling stock in the period up to 1990 and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals for the acquisition of new mainline rolling stock and for the establishment of a rail coach building industry to supply CIE's rolling stock requirements are being examined in the context of the study of CIE which is being carried out with the assistance of a firm of management consultants.  The report of the Transport Consultative Commission on passenger transport in Dublin will also have a bearing on the matter in so far as CIE's requirements for rolling stock in connection with <Col N="305" /> possible extensions of the Dublin suburban rail services are concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards the industrial relations aspects of the proposal to establish a rail coach building industry at Inchicore, I understand that CIE are in discussion with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask why a German coach building firm have been brought in to build passenger carriages for CIE when the staff at Inchicore feel they are perfectly competent to do the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Deasy states is not exactly the situation.  Under CIE's proposals it is envisaged that a German firm, Linke Hoffman Busche, will establish a rail coach building industry at Inchicore to supply CIE's requirements both for mainline and suburban rolling stock.  The proposed agreement between CIE and Linke Hoffman Busche is on the basis of an initial order by CIE for 42 coaches for the electrification of the Howth-Bray line.  CIE envisage the link up with the German firm as a singular proposal.  There are other options as well which the Government will consider in time.  I want to emphasise that CIE feel they have not the capacity themselves to build the type of new modern coaches which would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that CIE have a very unfortunate history when it comes to making contracts with foreign firms to build equipment for buses or for rail?  The staff at Inchicore Works are adamant, despite what the Minister says, that they are quite able to build the rolling stock in question, as they build all the other rolling stock for CIE.  They have built the rolling stock which is in operation at present for passenger carriages, but they have not been allowed to build it for four or five years.</P>

      <P>The management of CIE claim that, due to the sophistication of this new equipment, they may not be capable of providing them.  It is they who have made this proposal.  One of the conditions of the draft agreement between CIE and LHB is that, in recruiting workers for the new factory, LHB should give preference as far as is possible to CIE staff seeking employment with them.  I would not push that case for the moment, as CIE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are meeting on the matter and may be able to resolve current difficulties.  The Government have made a commitment to spend £46 million on the Howth/Bray line and it is up to CIE to bring forward proposals to implement that.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> Had the Government any role in that decision?  Is the Minister aware that the facts quoted by him in relation to the skills available at the Inchicore Works are totally at variance with the truth?  The fact is that the Inchicore Works have been building for the past 150 years all rail and coach work generally.  Is the Minister aware that this very issue is likely to give rise to a national strike in the next few weeks?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland exercises jurisdiction over Irish-registered ships wherever they may be.</P>
      <P>In the case of foreign ships, Ireland exercises jurisdiction, within the territorial limit of three miles, covering such matters as boarding by customs, production and verification of ships' papers, and documentation of passengers and cargo.  It also includes examination and surveys by authorised officers, with power to detain a vessel found to be unseaworthy in any respect, and compliance with international regulations relating to maritime rules of the road and the display of lights and signals.</P>
      <P>Ireland has taken power, under the relevant international convention, to intervene, either within territorial waters or on the high seas, to take special protective measures in the case of a ship which presents a serious threat of oil pollution off the Irish coastline or of related interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> Irish harbour authorities and pilotage authorities exercise control within the legally prescribed limits of their jurisdiction in regard to such matters as the taking on of pilots, safe passage through navigable waterways and berthing and un-berthing.</P>

      <P>In relation to foreign ships Ireland has jurisdiction while they are within Irish coastal waters and this jurisdiction is firmly exercised in relation to ship safety.  International conventions relating to intervention on high seas in cases of oil pollution casualties which were drawn up in 1969 authorise the State to take protective action even outside territorial waters against any ship which presents a risk of serious oil pollution to the State's coastline or to related interests, for example, fisheries and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>An inter-departmental committee has been investigating the best possible uses of Bord na Móna cutaway bog with a view to ensuring that they are properly developed and used in the best national interest.  An interim report by the committee was published in August 1979.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 9.3 of the report which states that it is likely to be a number of years yet before firm recommendations can be made on the optimum uses of cutaway bog.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to paragraph 10.6 of the report which indicates that the committee are satisfied that Bord na Móna should continue their existing development and utilisation systems for cutaway bogland as the cutaway emerges following extraction of the full fuel resources and that retention of deeper peat for arable crops and vegetable production is a matter on which a decision can safely be deferred for some time.</P>
      <P>The committee's terms of reference did not cover the question of the eventual ownership and management of Bord na Móna cutaway bog as it was felt that only when a good deal of progress had been made in determining the uses to which the cutaway bog should be put that the problems attending ownership and management could be approached in a meaningful way.</P>
      <P>The committee are continuing their investigations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Representation is adequate.  The committee were set up in September 1977 with representatives from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and Bord na Móna.  I <Col N="322" /> would think that the representation there would be adequate for the purposes the Deputy mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we are intensifying our extraction of turf at the moment because of the energy situation, would the Minister accept that more and more areas will have been dealt with and perhaps deeper peat destroyed in the process and that therefore the decision on the question is an urgent one?  When does the Minister expect a final firm decision to be taken by the Government on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to indicate when the final report will be available from the committee and it is extremely unlikely that the Government will take a final decision until that final report is available.  As I have already indicated, the committee expect that it will be some years before the final report can be produced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it going to take some years?  Would the Minister not agree that when the term &ldquo;some years&rdquo; appears in a civil service document it usually means not some but many?  Will the Minister personally satisfy himself that this long time scale envisaged is justified?  Perhaps a quicker decision might be more appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had made inquiries on the lines the Deputy is now suggesting because it seems that the period involved is very long.  I have not completed my inquiries in that regard but it is clear that there are a number of possibilities involved. The Deputy referred in his question to farming and I have referred to horticulture but there are other producers, such as producers of biomass, and other developers who have been investigated.  The Deputy is aware, I am sure, that the interim report referred to possibilities of development of amenities such as boating and fishing and so on on cutaway bog.  Therefore it is not a simple matter of deciding what is suitable for farming.  The Deputy will also be aware that there are different <Col N="323" /> qualities in cutaway bog in different parts of the country.  So the task is a good deal more complex than it might appear at first sight.  Having said all that, like the Deputy, I feel that the indication of the length of time that we will have to wait for a final report is long and I am endeavouring to see if it can be shortened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will outline his proposals for the provision of an experimental biomass generating station at Bellacorick, County Mayo, and if his attention has been drawn to fact that the present rate of planting will be insufficient to meet the demands of the proposed experimental station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the National Board for Science and Technology that the proposals for the provision of an experimental biomass generating station arose as a logical outcome of R &amp; D work undertaken following <Col N="324" /> the energy crisis of 1973 on biomass conversion.  This involves the use of organic material as a fuel or as the source of petro-chemical substitutes.  The main focus of such R &amp; D in Ireland was on the production and use of short rotation forestry and forestry residues.</P>
      <P>Under the EEC scheme for the granting of financial support for projects to exploit alternative energy sources, a biomass demonstration project was formulated with the NBST acting as a general co-ordinator and involving activities by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, the ESB, Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais.  The project initiation date was 2 April 1979.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the project over the five year period 1979-84 was estimated at £4.50 million.  The cost involved in the first two years of the project is approximately £1,250,000,40 per cent of which will be met by EEC funds.  After this the project will be reviewed by the EEC for subsequent funding.</P>
      <P>This demonstration project involves: the growth and harvesting of short rotation forestry biomass; the recovery of conventional forestry residues; the on-site processing and transportation of this biomass; the combustion of this biomass in a central electricity generating station.</P>
      <P>Bellacorick, County Mayo was chosen as the site for a demonstration project because of the following advantages: its proximity to the chosen conversion facility, namely, the ESB station; the availability of ESB generating and transmission infrastructure; the availability of up to 1,000 acres of peat cutaway; the availability of 500 acres suitable for high yielding forestry plantation; the availability of existing mature conventional forestry from which the residue could be made available to the combustion facility.</P>
      <P>The planned programme of planting, which is geared to the demands of the proposed experimental station is, I am advised, generally on schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I have this information available here but I was under the impression that the station is there.  The supply of biomass as a raw material at the station is a new development. Was that the Deputy's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The rotation of biomass is five to seven years.  There are reports that the rate of planting will not be sufficient to give the equivalent output that the mills use at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Bord na Móna are planting 400 hectares of short rotation forestry and half of this would be at Oweninny, County Mayo, and the other half at Clonsast in County Offaly. In addition, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are planting 200 hectares at Bellacorick.  It is proposed that the ESB would be supplied with 15,000 tons of dry matter per year and that the balance between the biomass produced from the short rotation forestry and the 15,000 tons would be made up of forest residue.  There is some leeway there, but the overall requirement will be met so that there will not be any reduction in the output of the station.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, records for County Mayo exclusively are not kept by the Electricity Supply Board, as the county is covered by their Galway and Sligo district offices.  The board tell me, however, that on reconsideration they feel that information relating to their Ballina and Castlebar group offices would present a more representative picture of the actual situation in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The board inform me that electricity supply to applicants in these two districts was being made available in February 1980, approximately three to four months from the date of firm quotation, as compared to an estimated six to nine months in February 1979.  The board stress that these are averages and the periods can vary considerably depending on the location of the houses and the local supply conditions.</P>
      <P>The board also tell me that 185 applicants have been given firm quotations but have not yet been connected to supply. A further 300 to 400 applicants have requested quotations but have not yet received them although many have been given rough estimates.  The board add that many of these applications may never become firm applications for supply as they are made by people pricing sites or considering building new houses.</P>
      <P>In addition there are approximately 30 applicants eligible for supply under the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1976, who have not yet been connected to supply.  They are now scheduled for connection by September 1980.</P>

      <P>The board pointed out that the time they gave was an average and some people may be waiting longer than the three or four months mentioned. In some cases the applications relate, perhaps, to houses in the more remote areas of County Mayo.  I am sure the Deputy is more aware of that than I am. This involves the board in providing an infrastructure and work in connection with that infrastructure was seriously disrupted as a result of very bad weather in the winter of 1978-79.  While the board have caught up fairly well, the whole programme was interrupted.  I accept that there may be people waiting as long as the Deputy says and certainly I will communicate to the board the concern expressed by him to ensure that the backlog is cleared as soon as possible.</P>

    <Title>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1980: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1980 in draft.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking earlier I made the point that the few words spoken by the Minister in moving this variation to the regulations did not illustrate the present situation.  The Minister suggested that he was increasing the income limit for persons with full eligibility for hospital and certain health <Col N="362" /> services and this is not, in fact, the situation.</P>
      <P>The existing regulations made this time last year and discussed here on 27 March 1979 provided for the hospitalisation insurance scheme to be made available in full to all people with incomes under £5,500.  The then Minister was pressed very firmly to increase that figure but adamantly refused to do so, although at the same time the other arm of Government, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Taoiseach, separately negotiated and successfully concluded the national understanding, under which the income limit for full eligibility was increased to £7,000.</P>
      <P>The text of the national understanding stated that the Government had authorised the Minister for Health to make arrangements for an upward revision of the health eligibility limit from £5,500 to £7,000.  At this stage it is surmise but apparently they had not seen fit to have any great prior consultation with the then Minister for Health, who appeared to be strangely unaware of the increase in the income limit and initially pleaded inability to introduce the increase. Eventually, under pressure to honour the terms of the national understanding, he introduced what he described as an interim scheme.  Under the terms of that interim scheme, all those earning under £7,000&mdash;the additional people being those earning between £5,500 and £7,000&mdash;were from 25 July last brought into the full hospitalisation eligibility scheme.</P>
      <P>They were told they could obtain a refund of any money outlayed from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  This was a rather strange situation, especially in view of the fact that even persons who were not subscribers to the VHI were instructed to seek refunds from that board. In reply to a question on 23 October 1979 the then Minister for Health stated:</P>
      <P>The expenses involved, and for which a payment may be claimed, are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  Portion of the premium paid to the Voluntary Health Insurance <Col N="363" /> Board for the board's public ward scheme.</P>
    <P>2.  Hospital consultants' bills, to persons without voluntary health insurance for services received as in-patients in public wards.</P>
    <P>3.  Hospital consultants' bills for services received as out-patients in public clinics.</P>
    <P>4.  General practitioner bills for maternity services.</P>
    <P>I also understand that cover was to be provided for people in the £5,500 to £7,000 income category in respect of infant welfare services in cases where a child was referred from the clinics for specialist attention.  Had they been within the income limits the parents would have been covered for that specialist treatment of the infant.  They had been excluded under the terms of the scheme announced in the Dáil on 27 March and the regulations signed by Deputy Haughey, the then Minister for Health.  On foot of the terms of the national understanding they were re-included. This involved the health boards in the area of confusion which had been created by mid-summer by the differing levels and standards of negotiation conducted by different Ministers, all members of the same Cabinet.  At this stage I myself found difficulty in establishing the situation but apparently the health boards were obliged to bear the cost of the specialist services provided for children referred under the infant welfare scheme in respect of people with incomes between £5,500 and £7,000.  I may well be wrong in that and if so I would not be at all surprised.</P>
    <P>If confusion exists in my mind, that confusion is rampant throughout the health service.  It is rampant among officers of the health boards who do not know where they stand in relation to this interim scheme, a scheme which was announced in July last to be serviced in the main through the VHI and for which there is not one iota of statutory authority.  It is not good enough that the Minister should come here and totally disregard the scenario I have just outlined, <Col N="364" /> when that has been the <i>de facto</i> situation since last summer, and to give the impression that there is an increase in the income limit when in fact the increase is not doing any more than regularising the situation which has obtained for almost four years.  I regard it as an insult not only to the general public but to the House that the Minister should fail to make any reference to the <i>de facto</i> situation that has obtained and expect Members of the House to be so ignorant of the situation as to accept his bland request that we agree to these regulations without comment.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we should have to speak in this fashion to the Minister on the occasion of his first visit here as Minister with legislation.  Surely the Minister should have considered it of vital importance to explain to us why public moneys have been expended through the VHI in respect of hospital expenses, consultants' expenses and general practitioner and maternity services expenses in respect of people whose incomes were between £5,500 and £7,000 last year and who are clearly not covered by the regulations signed by the then Minister for Health a year ago but who have had their expenses paid through the VHI even in cases where the people concerned were not subscribers to that board.  Surely it would have behoved the Minister to explain what was the statutory authority for the health boards to have expended public money in respect of those in the £5,500 to £7,000 band.  Would the Minister explain where the statutory authority was vested in his Department to allow them to expend that money in respect of those people considering that those regulations setting the limit for full eligibility at £5,500 are still law?</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has inherited this mess of pottage and that the person who stirred the pot originally has now moved on to higher office but I would have expected that the present controller of the pot would have at least served up an offering to the House that would, in some measure, have gone towards explaining what had happened, <Col N="365" /> when the increase in the income eligibility limit had taken place, how he or his predecessor had arranged the statutory authority for the change and, most important, why there is not now any increase in effect being made in the limit for eligibility.  By merely regularising the position that has obtained during the past year and in view of the terms of the national understanding which provides for an increase in line with the increase in the CPI, a number of people earning less than £7,000 will automatically, because of increases paid to them within the terms of the national understanding, already have moved above the £7,000 limit.  Therefore, when they get their P.60s showing their incomes for the financial year ending April 1980, it will be seen that their incomes will be greater than £7,000 and, thus, they will be removed from the eligibility net.</P>
    <P>It cannot be that the Minister was ignorant of this situation because from this morning's papers, for example, we learn that he conducted talks only yesterday afternoon with representatives of the ICTU in relation to this very point.  We read that the congress representatives very fairly made the point that, as they understood the matter, there was negotiated in the national understanding a ceiling of £7,000 in respect of their members and that the least that might have been done in the making of these new regulations would have been to ensure that people earning less than £7,000 at the time of reaching agreement on the national understanding but whose incomes have increased beyond that figure as a result of the terms that understanding would have continued, by way of changes in the regulations, to continue to have the benefit of the same degree of cover as they were enjoying at the time of the acceptance of the national understanding. That would not have been an improvement of the situation but merely a continuation of the existing level of cover. However, the Minister did not see fit to accede to that request and, consequently, what he is inviting the House to do this afternoon is to agree to a reduction <Col N="366" /> in the number of people who have full eligibility for hospitalisation and for certain other health services.  We are being asked to agree to the taking out of the net of a certain number of people and presumably this will be regarded as the continued phased improvement of the health services.</P>
    <P>There is some difference in the statements issued after yesterday's meeting by the congress and those issued by the Minister as to what took place.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today we read that:</P>
    <P>After meeting an ICTU delegation yesterday, Dr. Woods said that the eligibility for health services would be increased to £7,000 from June 1st, 1980, and would relate to income for the year ending April 5th, 1980.</P>
    <P>Dr. Woods said that this would mean that persons whose earnings was less than £7,000 in the year ended April 5th, 1980, would now be eligible for the full range of hospital services, including free maintenance and all tests, medicines and consultant services in public wards.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the interim scheme to which the Minister's predecessor acceded last summer, is it not the situation that those services are already available to all persons whose incomes were less than £7,000 per year at the end of the financial year, April 1979?  Is it not a fact also that the national understanding which operated in the financial year just ending will have taken a considerable number of those people beyond the £7,000 limit, thereby removing them once again from eligibility for the full range of hospital services, including free medicines and consultant services in public wards?  Is this an example of the phased progress that we are to have in the health services?</P>
    <P>Is this the measured, phased progress we are now to get in the health services&mdash;that the people who at present enjoy some cover are to be removed from that cover and the House is to be told that there has been an increase in the number of people covered because there is an increase in the income limits&mdash;when we all know that this is a <Col N="367" /> charade, that the House is not being given the full facts of the situation?</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that I can only describe the introduction of these regulations as regressive because they have not taken account of the <i>de facto</i> situation and have not increased the income limit in line with the terms of the national understanding. I see a congress representative quoted in this morning's <i>Cork Examiner</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Cassells said the Minister's proposal would adversely affect the present entitlement to hospital service of thousands of workers.  A large number of workers, mainly married persons, would lose the benefits obtained for them under the understanding. He explained this by pointing out that those on £6,000 at the beginning of the current understanding would pass over the £7,000 mark this year, and thus be left out of the free health services scheme.</P>
    <P>This would not be my understanding of the situation because people would have needed to pass the £7,000 limit by the beginning of April 1980 so as to pass out of full eligibility during the financial year running on from then because the income in respect of which they would be assessed would be that earned in the financial year up to the end of April 1980.  It is my understanding, looking at the national understanding, that people who had been earning somewhere in the region of £6,400 or £6,500 at the beginning of the understanding will, by virtue of its terms, discover that they have gone above the £7,000 limit by the time this financial year runs out in a couple of weeks time.  Those are the people&mdash;how many I cannot say but I would imagine certainly thousands&mdash;who will move outside the full entitlement to services. Those are the people who will discover that, irrespective of the negotiations initiated by congress, the Taoiseach of the day and Deputy O'Donoghue, they will be materially worse off on foot of these regulations the House is apparently being invited to pass with acclamation this afternoon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> This scheme is still not a comprehensive hospital insurance scheme despite the comments made on its introduction, those made since and indeed those made by the present Minister at a certain time. This scheme still contains anomalies. One might have expected that the amendment of the regulations after a year would have sought to iron out some of those anomalies or injustices.  Instead of that we discover that they merely iron out some of those currently entitled to benefit.  We are now being invited to believe that it is an equitable situation that a single person earning £6,950 should be entitled to full hospital cover, including the cost of specialist in-patient and out-patient services, whilst a husband, with wife and five or six children earning £7,010 should find himself having to pay all of the costs&mdash;the specialist costs if they are in-patients or out-patients in hospital&mdash;having to pay also all of the costs of the general practitioner maternity services and indeed all of the cost apparently of the child/infant welfare referral service.</P>
    <P>Is that a just or equitable situation? When we raised those points with the Minister's predecessor he was at pains&mdash;as he was so often in those times&mdash;to point out that he was tackling everything in a progressive, orderly fashion, that whilst he had not quite reached 100 per cent efficiency, he was aiming at that and that he would, in a phased way, eliminate all the anomalies in due course, with each year showing a gradual improvement in the services.  He has gone.  This is the first health regulation to be made since he left.  It is regressive; it excludes people from these services, makes no attempt to correct the anomalies, does nothing to iron out the inequities and takes some of those people already eligible out of the system.  That is the first piece of health legislation we have had from the Taoiseach's successor as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I note also in this morning's <i>Cork Examiner</i> that:</P>
    <P>It is understood that the Minister promised the unions he would have another look at this particular <Col N="369" /> problem if Congress presented to him information concerning those who would fall out of benefit</P>
    <P>A nice expression, &ldquo;those who would fall out of benefit&rdquo;.  I suppose that is another way of saying those about whom he is taking a deliberate, conscious decision to take out of certain benefit and who at present enjoy it.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>because of this year's pay increases, and indicated he might introduce some interim measures to cover this.</P>
    <P>We are trying, almost at the end of March 1980, to find out details of the interim scheme the Minister's predecessor introduced last July.  On the day on which we come in to discuss these regulations&mdash;which should throw some light on last July's interim scheme&mdash;we are told that the present occupant of the office, if he receives some information from congress&mdash;presumably he has not that information to hand&mdash;might introduce another interim scheme.  Is this to be the latest panacea for all health ills, one interim scheme being built upon another until there is such a plethora of them we cannot see the wood from the trees?</P>
    <P>Even bearing in mind the difficult financial circumstances in which we found ourselves would it not have been better to have taken the income of a person which the national understanding increases would bring to £7,000 and cast that in these regulations as being the figure for continued maximum elegibility?  That would not have represented an improvement of the situation; it would merely have maintained the existing level of cover for the existing number of insured persons.  That is not what was done.  What was done was to take the figure that had obtained all through last year&mdash;which ignores increases granted to people under the national understanding&mdash;and cast that as being the statutory limit to operate for another 12 months.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain clearly to us&mdash;apart from the ordinary adoption of the Estimates and Supplementary <Col N="370" /> Estimates of the Department of Health&mdash;where the specific, statutory authority is vested in his Department for the expenditure of any moneys in relation to consultants' services and general practitioner maternity services in respect of people whose earnings were between £5,500 and £7,000 in the financial year in question.  An obligation rests on the Minister to explain to the House whether&mdash;apart from the adoption of the ordinary and Supplementary Estimates of his Department&mdash;there was any other authority vested in his Department for the expenditure of moneys on those people, especially bearing in mind that there was a specific legislative machine, namely, regulations to be made under the Health (Contributions) Act, 1979, allowing the Department of Health to expend public moneys on consultants, hospital in-patient and out-patient costs and certain other charges.  I want the Minister to explain to the House how the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General are satisfied with the method whereby that money was expended.</P>
    <P>Another anomalous feature which apparently these amended regulations will create relates to farmers.  Full eligibility in their case was equated with a £60 valuation.  As pointed out by the Minister's predecessor on 27 March 1979:</P>
    <P>Following through in the existing traditional practice, we are equating the £60 poor law valuation with the £5,500 limit which gives you a multiplier of £93 per £1 valuation.</P>
    <P>I am not sure it gives that amount.  Apparently there is to be no change in the £60 valuation, but the regulations have been regularised to £7,000 which would appear to have changed the farm valuation multiplier from £90 odd to £116.6 per £1 valuation.  I would have thought that this change in the assessment of the farm multiplier on the basis of valuation should have been adverted to by the Minister and explained by him.  I hope that in his reply he will take the trouble to give the House the sort of information <Col N="371" /> one would have expected to have been given in his introductory statement.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the sort of difficulty this will create in negotiations for a future income understanding, when the £5,500 was set by the Minister the national understanding negotiators secured a limit of £7,000.  At that time the ICTU had asked for a limit of something between £8,000 and £9,000 short-term pending the introduction of a no-limit scheme.  It was only with great reluctance that the ICTU representatives settled on a figure of £7,000.  If a year ago the ICTU sought to have all those with incomes of between £8,000 and £9,000 included in the insurance scheme and at that time reluctantly settled for £7,000, what limit would we reasonably expect them to settle for a year later in any new negotiations? It cannot be with any great degree of anticipation of success in future negotiations that the Government should now settle for a continuation of the existing figure in these regulations.</P>
    <P>There is one hope.  A year ago the Minister for Health stoutly defended the £5,500 limit and claimed it could not be bettered, saying it covered 83 per cent to 85 per cent of the population, that it was acceptable to the ICTU and to people generally, but he had his words thrown back at him within a few weeks when the Taoiseach announced acceptance by the Government of a figure of £7,000.  Will the Minister for Health give us some indication of whether there is any likelihood that the Taoiseach, who has some peripheral knowledge of this situation, may also decide to increase the income limit for full hospital insurance cover within the next 12 months?  There cannot be any doubt that the holding of these regulations at £7,000 can only have the effect of making any future agreement in relation to pay and wages more difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain the percentage of the population now eligible for full hospital insurance cover as a result of these regulations compared with the figure three months ago.  I am not seeking for comparative figures from <Col N="372" /> the point of view of the perecntage covered when the limit was £5,500 in April last year.  What will that percentage be in July next, bearing in mind the exclusions the Minister for Health has decided to make from these regulations?</P>
    <P>Another injustice and inequity which the previous Minister was pressed about and refused to mend his hand on is the case of the two-earner family where one is above the income limit for cover and the other below it, and where there are children.  I have argued strongly in the House before that where there is such a family the State receives two contributions whereas if only one is working the State would have to provide the same hospitalisation insurance cover.  If one such earner is above the income limit and the other below the limit, the State very unfairly and in a mean way assigns the children to the higher income earner and by so doing if the children have to go to hospital, though the State is receiving two sets contributions, they are not covered for consultants, fees, in-patient or out-patient charges.</P>
    <P>Up to 1979, all manual workers irrespective of earnings had full cover for all hospital costs, including consultants. Through the introduction of this scheme last year, manual workers earning £5,500 and later £7,000 now discover themselves without cover for consultant costs.  That situation has been continued. Indeed all the injustices, anomalies and inequities in the scheme last year are being perpetuated by the Minister in these regulations.  The scheme introduced a year ago provided full cover for those earning less than £5,500.  Some weeks later the negotiators for an agreement on incomes insisted that cover would be provided for those earning less than £7,000. In regard to the interim scheme introduced last year and referred to by the then Minister in the House on 23 October last, the Minister explained how much he knew at the time about how the scheme was to work.  No explanation was ever given about where the money came from for the funding of that interim scheme.  No reference was made to the operation of that scheme, the number of <Col N="373" /> additional people it covered and the number of people covered by it who would be excluded by the passing of the regulations today.  I hope the remainder of the Minister's period as Minister for Health will be happier for him, the House and those of us who have to deal with Health and that there will be no need again for the tone I have been forced to adopt in this debate because of the contribution the Minister made when introducing the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The health contributions regulations we are being asked to pass here this afternoon are in a direct line of descent from the regulations introduced by the Minister's predecessor and the scheme introduced by him.  The Minister is in an odd situation in that he is not only a new Minister for Health but he has been appointed Minister for Health by the man who was his immediate predecessor in that office and who has now been elected Taoiseach.  He must be rather like one of the relatives who in Victorian times were summoned to the reading of a will by the family solicitor and who arrived in the hope of considerable largesse to discover that Uncle Joe either had no money at all or had left the entire sum to the cats' and dogs' homes and who had then to return home with their expectations sharply trimmed or with the problem of facing up to cutting down on expenditure patterns which in anticipation they had already begun to indulge in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chill wind of financial reality as far as the Minister is concerned whistled through the lines of his very sparse attempt to justify a very inadequate set of health contribution regulations.  It is unfortunately plain that in the wake of the national understanding and the preceding regulations, the Minister has now been forced, as the Victorian relatives in their situation would have been forced, to make do with a succession of interim measures designed to keep the wolf from the door.  This is not Government by the aristocracy or indeed by the meritocracy, but by the adhocracy. I fear that this is the way it will continue under this administration <Col N="374" /> because ad hocracy is of the essence of their style.</P>
    <P>We have not even been told by the Minister how much he proposes to raise by this increase in the ceiling from £5,500 to £7,000 and how this fits into the overall resource allocation of the health services.  I argue that we are entitled to a much more detailed analysis of the state of health eligibility services in the wake not only of a change of administration but of the national understanding and, more particularly, in the wake of a very serious, reasoned and substantial criticism made of it by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I am astonished by the apparent attempt in the Minister's speech to put the blame for what is essentially a political decision on an administrative sector.  The Minister says in relation to contributions:</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the ceiling level in each case should be identical.  If it were otherwise the administration of the overall system would be greatly hindered.</P>
    <P>The level of contributions and the level of benefits are in the first analysis a political decision made by the Minister. He cannot hide behind administrative convenience or inconvenience when he talks about the level at which these might be fixed.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the lacunae in the regulations in the same detail as Deputy Boland did.  He spoke about all the things that were not in the regulations.  We could talk about all those things until the cows come home. As they stand, the regulations are difficult enough to object to but they do not go even one-tenth of the distance necessary towards arriving at a situation in which we would get the kind of full and free hospital and health services that as a nation we ought to be aiming for.  I hope it is not as sinister as it appears to me, but the Minister said, when introducing those regulations:</P>
    <P>I am not proposing that the rate of contribution should be varied for the contribution year 1980-81.  The rate will remain at 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> This is a stark reminder to everybody that when it comes to ways and means to pay for the health services, regardless of the eligibility level which operates in those health services, the Minister has two variables with which to play.  He can raise the income limit for eligibility above the £7,000 at a cost to him of a certain amount of money in that it will cost a certain amount of money to treat the people who will either become eligible or who will remain eligible who otherwise would be ineligible for health services treatment under the regulations, or he can gain money by bringing into the net a slightly larger amount by contributions. On the other hand he can, I suspect, with very much greater financial effectiveness and without raising the income eligibility limit a little, increase the percentage, easing his financial problems without incurring any extra expenditure by bringing more people into the health services who would not otherwise be entitled to come into them.</P>
    <P>I hope that this remark by the Minister is not an indication that next year he will not be so generous, if that is the word, and that next year we can look forward to an increase in the percentage. If we have to face that next year I am quite sure that the trade union movement will make their reaction to this year's and the last few days' events seem very mild indeed by comparison.</P>

      <P>Health costs are soaring.  No matter what Government are in power health costs will continue to soar.  This is an important service and we must be very sure that it is as efficient as possible.  The people we are legislating for today are not the people who are ill but those walking around in good health. We must have an efficient service.  As the life expectancy of the population increases so the number of older people increases and there is a greater demand on the health services which, in turn, become more expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early part of the century the life span was estimated at being 50 years.  It is a very welcome trend that the life span <Col N="376" /> has been extended to 68 years, 72 years, and even higher.  This is something we can be proud of and it is a tribute to the efficiency of our health service.  A number of these people are frail and ill and need help.</P>
    <P>We are recognised as a nation prone to hospitalisation.  Our bed ratio per head of population must be the highest in Europe.  We must try to change that trend.  For that reason I would like to pass a few comments on what I think might be necessary.  At present the cost per patient in hospital is in the region of £300 per week.  There is a shortage of beds in our regional hospitals.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not take the GPs into consideration.  The family doctor can play a major role in the health services. There is no point in passing legislation providing free hospitalisation if we do not have hospitals.  The GP should be given help from the Department to provide a service for those people who are just over the borderline for a medical card.  Parents are often forced to send their children into hospital because they cannot afford to pay doctors' charges. Hospitalisation has now become very expensive. What are we doing to keep those people out of hospital?</P>

      <P>What we are doing now is a waste because many people for whom we are providing this service will not be able to avail of it.  If we are to provide a service we must provide accommodation to give that service.  It is like advertising a dance and not naming the venue.  I am a member of a health board and I am speaking from experience. We cannot get people into hospitals.  Therefore, why are we wasting <Col N="377" /> time making provisions for people to go into hospital when we do not have the hospitals?  This is very important.  The Chair may say that this is not relevant but I believe there is nothing more relevant to a patient than a bed.</P>

      <P>This 1 per cent will increase the health contributions.  It could increase the contributions of farmers and insured workers to over £70 a year.  That is a hefty contribution.</P>
      <P>There is a certain amount of confusion about the new health legislation. Some people are duplicating their payments. This point needs to be cleared up.  Is it possible to ascertain whether people are making contributions to the VHI which are not necessary?  Many people, not alone patients but those who administer the service, are not clear who qualifies under this legislation.  For the past 12 months many people inside this House have not been clear about this matter.  Deputy Boland outlined the position very well and I am looking forward to hearing the Minister's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to refer to Deputy Boland's comments.  I do not know why he chose this occasion to ascribe to me deceit, misrepresentation and other horrible things with which I am not particularly well acquainted.  This is a relatively simple measure.  There are other related matters which can be discussed and to which I will refer later.  It is important to make clear the position in relation to Deputy Boland's statement, particularly his statement before lunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before lunch he was very adamant that this scheme had not been covered or mentioned in any way, that there was no basis for it and that it had not come before the House.  After lunch he changed that somewhat by making reference to the Supplementary Estimates <Col N="378" /> put before the House.  I presume that in the meantime he either realised or was informed of the fact that the special VHI refund scheme was before the House, is on the books, was provided for last year and is provided for this year. There is no question in relation to the authority for such a scheme.</P>
    <P>A sum of £100,000 was provided in the Health Supplementary Estimates for 1979&mdash;there is a detailed statement in the Estimate which refers to this&mdash;which was to cover the cost of compensating persons in the £5,500 to £7,000 income range for certain medical insurance expenses incurred since 25 July 1979.  That Supplementary Estimate was submitted to the House and approved by the Dáil last December.  Provision is also included in the Book of Estimates for 1980 for a sum of £300,000, under the heading G.7 on page 87, which shows both the 1979 and 1980 figures for that scheme.  Lest anybody be led into thinking that there was a lack of authority, discussion or honesty in relation to it, the scheme is there and has been there for all to see and to discuss in the House.</P>
    <P>The interim refund scheme was introduced to meet the Government's undertaking under the national understanding and it applies to persons whose incomes in the year ended 5 April 1979 were between £5,500 and £7,000. It provides for the payment of part of the premium of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's public ward scheme and for the payment of consultant fees for in-patient services in hospitals in the public ward or for out-patient services in public out-patient clinics.  It also provides for the payment of doctors fees for maternity services.  The scheme is operated by the VHI on behalf of the Minister for Health and it is paid for from the Exchequer Funds and not by the persons directly affected.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the contributions to the discussion on the draft regulations. Despite the fact that the draft regulations deal with the ceiling limit for health contributions and not eligibility levels, it was inevitable that eligibility for the services would loom large in the debate.  The proposed ceiling level of £7,000 for <Col N="379" /> health contributions is identical to that fixed for social insurance contribution purposes.  Deputy Horgan wondered why there should be an administrative link here and claimed that I put the blame on the administrative factor in this instance.  The Deputy wondered what the rate would increase to next year.  It should be sufficient to note that the rate has not increased at this point.  The Deputy should recognise that only recently we set the contributions for the pay-related social insurance scheme at £7,000, and that to have a separate scheme operating for employers, employees, the Revenue Commissioners and all concerned would lead to additional expense and inconvenience. An inter-departmental working party which dealt with this at the setting up of this new scheme recommended that the ceiling should be related to the average industrial earnings of the transportable goods industries and suggested that a multiplier of one-and-a-half times should be used in determining the ceiling. They also recommended that the two limits for administrative purposes should be kept at the same level.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recognised in their discussions that there would be considerable administrative difficulties, but were concerned about many of the points raised by Deputies. The aim of this scheme is to ensure that the ceiling will encompass the bulk of the earnings of the vast majority of workers.  It is not a static ceiling but will be reviewed annually taking into account the movements in the average earnings in the industries mentioned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the more general issues raised concerning eligibility for hospital services, the changes which were made last year marked a major step forward. Entitlement to services was based on income and not on employment status. Deputy Boland questioned the change made at that time whereby all manual workers had full cover irrespective of income and he claimed that we were departing from this change.  Does the Deputy at this stage think that services should be given irrespective of income? The whole basis of the scheme was to <Col N="380" /> give the services in relation to income and that is being continued in the present regulation.  That is a reasonable approach and all reasonable people will accept it.</P>
    <P>The changes made last year were a major step forward and entitlement to services was based on income and not on employment status.  Many of the anomalies heavily criticised here in the past were eliminated, for example the distinction between manual and non-manual workers in regard to eligibility for hospital services.  The area of eligibility was clarified and a great number of doubts and difficulties were removed. The effect of the scheme is that the entire community are now entitled to avail of maintenance in public wards including all necessary tests, drugs and medicines which may be required, free of charge.  To listen to Deputies one would think that we had taken a regressive step, that we did not have a comprehensive health service. Admittedly if people want to go into semi-private or private wards they will incur additional charges which they must pay.  In this scheme there is only one limitation, persons earning less than the new limit of £7,000 and their dependants will be entitled to consultant services free of charge whereas a person earning more than £7,000 will be asked to meet the cost of consultant services but will be able to avail of a special low cost scheme introduced by the VHI to cover any expense involved if faced with this situation.</P>
    <P>The premiums which the VHI charge at present are very reasonable.  A married man with a wife and three or more dependent children can get cover for about £21 per annum, taking tax deductions into account.  That is about 40p a week.  Deputy Boland ranting and trying to ascribe to me all sorts of weird and awful misrepresentations is talking basically about people earning over £7,000 in the previous year being asked to subscribe for the average family of three children, about £21 to a voluntary scheme.  For a single person the net cost comes to about £6 per annum.  Now we are expecting everybody to get terribly <Col N="381" /> excited and upset because something woeful and awful is happening in these simple regulations and it is going to cost a single person of above £7,000 a year on last year's income £6 per annum. Deputy Boland has not got the situation in true perspective.  I do not anticipate that there will be any significant changes in these rates for VHI in the coming year.  There will be some minor changes.</P>
    <P>To clear up any possible misunderstanding, I stress that the income limit for eligibility purposes will not be based on the income for 1980-81 but on the income accruing in the year which commenced in April 1979.  This means that persons whose income in the year ending in April 1980 was less than £7,000 will not lose entitlement to consultant services even if their incomes in the following year were to exceed that figure.  Therefore, the income year is the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the past year on the day the measure comes into operation.  The overall situation as regards entitlement in 1980-81 will be that about 85 per cent of the community will be entitled to entirely free hospital services as against 83 per cent under the arrangement made last year.  That is a statutory arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien in particular raised the point that there seems to be quite a few people making contributions to VHI who may not need to.  In effect he is right in the sense that quite a few people, nevertheless, of themselves prefer to contribute <Col N="382" /> to the VHI scheme for various kinds of cover.  The numbers covered by VHI have increased rapidly in recent years.  The numbers covered in 1976 totalled 557,000.  This increased to 594,000 in 1977. This was happening even during the Opposition's term of office therefore, and it has continued to happen since then. It increased to 645,000 in 1978 and 697,000 in 1979. The total numbers covered in the present year are 840,000 or about 25 per cent of the entire population. This illustrates clearly that many people who are the users of the services we are discussing who are entitled to free hospital services, including the services of consultants, wish to make their own decisions in this regard.  Persons who avail of accommodation in private hospitals or homes are entitled to a subvention towards the costs they incur. Persons who choose to use private or semi-private accommodation in public hospitals are charged only rates which are very heavily subsidised.</P>
    <P>The range of services available free, apart from consultant services, to persons who will have earned more than £7,000 in the year ending 5 April 1980 include out-patient hospital services as well as in-patient services also the drugs subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about the position of families where the income of the breadwinner is marginally over £7,000. Should the circumstances in individual cases present unusually difficulties, provision exists to enable health boards to grant assistance in such cases.</P>
    <P>I will try to answer more specifically other questions raised by Deputies. It is important to bear in mind in relation to this regulation that we are not dealing with eligibility.  We are dealing with a ceiling level for health contributions and that is all that I have asked the House to agree to and accept. The House approved a ceiling of £7,000 for social insurance contributions only last week.  In effect, at this point we are attempting to bring the income limit for health contributions to the same level of £7,000. To do otherwise certainly would be to create a great deal of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland raised the question of <Col N="383" /> specialist out-patient services for children referred from child health centres. These services are available for all children without reference to income. They were not part of the interim scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the point I was making was that that situation does not appear clear in the hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in general in relation to making clear what the scheme is.  It becomes difficult to make clear even what this scheme is and what is happening, and I have not finished in that respect.  I want to go on to some other aspects, particularly pertaining to the present position in relation to the interim scheme.  I agree with Deputies that it is important that people should be fully aware of what they are entitled to and I will take steps to ensure that this is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland raised the question of the <i>de facto</i> situation which exists in relation to the special scheme which was introduced during last year.  I have pointed out that the present arrangements relate to the statutory arrangement and Deputy Boland has suggested that some people who <i>de facto</i> have been in benefit because of a separate refund scheme may fall out of benefit as a result of this. This point was raised by the ICTU.  This interim scheme will continue until June and there is more than adequate time to identify and discuss any situations which may arise.  I trust that in relation to the interim arrangement in relation to the national understanding this scheme will continue to be covered.  It is covered in the Estimates and it will continue to be covered by the refund through the VHI system up to June next.  Presumably the ICTU will include their request for an even higher eligibility limit in their submission in relation to the next national understanding.  That matter can be considered in that context.  The scheme and the fund are there and will continue to be there until June.  What arrangements need to be made can be discussed.  In this <Col N="384" /> context the ICTU representatives said that they would prepare a brief specifically on the question of any people who may come out under the new statutorily increased eligibility limits and that those submissions can be discussed then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>A person under the refund scheme earning £6,800 in the financial year ending April, 1979, is covered under the present interim scheme but the scheme does not refer to his income in the preceding year.  Surely that person will have gone over £7,000 under the terms of the national understanding, in the financial year ending April, 1980, so even though the interim scheme is in operation, he will be outside it?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair must point out that the Deputy would be entitled to ask a couple of brief questions at the end but we cannot continue by way of question and answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme would continue to relate to his previous income, which was the one at April 1979, in other words, would continue as it was at present up to June.  In effect, he would remain covered under that scheme up to June.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that because of the administrative difficulties involved in changing the levels, if it is necessary to have a special refund scheme for people who come into that category, provision will be a matter for discussion then, beyond the basic regulations. Certainly, those people who might come into that situation will be covered up to June, because the scheme will still be based on the year ending April, 1979, which is the same one to which the national understanding discussions and interim arrangements last year related.  If they come within the £7,000 they can go for their hospital services card and be covered under the new scheme.</P>

      <P>We are talking about a ceiling which must relate to the ceiling for the social welfare schemes and we are regularising that situation at present. Any exceptional situations which may arise as a result of that, or in addition to that, are matters which can be discussed within the scheme within which they are covered at present.  We are talking here about the statutory increase from £5,500 to £7,000.  There was a <i>de facto,</i> independent, separate arrangement operating under a special, separate scheme provided for separately and which will be discussed and debated separately.  Some people can still come within that scheme but most of the people now within that scheme will come within the £7,000 limit.  For any of those who do not, they can be considered within that scheme.  That is the most I can say to the Deputy on that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland also raised the question of what the farmers' position would be.  Separate regulations must be made covering the multiplier for farmers.  They are not part of the incomes ceiling and regulations.  The regulations dealing with the multiplier for farmers will be submitted to the Oireachtas in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boland raised the question of the upper limit in relation to eligibility.  I was not quite certain what he meant.  I thought he meant that there should be no upper limit to eligibility.  He has confirmed that now.  I want to be clear on that.  Does Deputy Boland, as spokesman for the Fine Gael Party, say that there should be no upper limit and that therefore it should be completely&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;related to all, irrespective of their income?</P>
      <P>The service is currently quite comprehensive, as people have suggested.  I wanted to make that point clear also.  In effect, the service is very comprehensive, with a very comprehensive range of services. It is misleading and a misnomer to talk about seeking a comprehensive service. The only area which is not covered for people above £7,000 is consultancy services.  There is at present a very simple way of covering that.</P>
      <P>The question of the revenue involved was referred to also.  The additional revenue which will accrue in 1980, from January to December, as a result of raising the ceiling from £5,500 to £7,000 is estimated at an additional £1.7 million. In a full calendar year, the extra income is estimated at £2.6 million.</P>
      <P>The overall expenditure on health services in 1980 will be about £550 million and the health contributions will bring in about £35 million, or about 6.4 per cent of the total cost of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland also asked a question about two-income families and made a point about that.  Where the two parents <Col N="387" /> are working, if each parent has an income under the limit, even if their combined income is over the limit, then the children are covered.  Therefore, the two incomes added together do not exclude the children.  If either parent has income over the limit, then the children are not covered.  I do not know if the Deputy was making that particular point or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>Certainly, I shall note the point which the Deputy has made in that respect.  The Deputy also referred to manual workers but we have discussed that subject already.</P>

    <P>In conclusion, I hope that I have been able to clarify, to some extent, the position of what exactly has been done at this time and what is covered.  There seems to be some confusion expressed, even here today, about what is and what is not covered by the schemes.  I think the position is quite clear and the interim refund scheme still exists.  It is provided for in the Estimates and is there to be used during the year, in so far as this will be necessary.  It is a separate scheme from the regulation and will be considered separately.  Taking the situation as a whole into account, we have a pattern of eligibility which offers reasonable cover for the entire community and compares favourably with most countries <Col N="388" /> which are similarly circumstanced.</P>

      <P>In assessing farm incomes the Government have got it wrong.  Farm incomes fell by well over 25 per cent in 1979 and the likelihood is that there will be a further fall of 20 per cent this year.  Any improvement that occurred in the position of farmers <i>vis-àvis</i> other wage earners since we joined the EEC has not only been cancelled out but in 1980 their position relative to PAYE workers will be worse than it was before we joined the EEC.  It is typical of the negative approach in the budget.  It is a series of do nots.</P>
      <P>To speak about an increase in farm taxation of 32 per cent in real terms in a year when farm incomes will be down by 40 per cent shows how crazy it is.  Any sane person knows that a dynamic agriculture needs a high rate of investment. Farm incomes at present are subject to a severe price cost squeeze.  With a rapidly increasing tax bill that does not make sense because farmers must rely on additional productivity to compensate for the price cost squeeze.  At best real incomes will fall by another 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A standard definition of income tax is that it is a payment to local or central government for services provided.  When the subsidy is removed from fertilisers a farmer pays more for it.  It is a saving to the Exchequer and is income tax.  When a subsidy is removed from rates a farmer <Col N="389" /> pays more.  That again is income tax. When the Minister said that the farm tax bill increased from £52 million in 1979 to £86 million in 1980 he was embracing three taxes&mdash;income tax, rates and resource tax.  He conveniently ignored the 2 per cent levy, the disease levy and the removal of fertiliser subsidy.  In justice and equity this cannot be done. The total expected from agriculture is £95 million.  This is an increase of 32 per cent in real terms over 1978 during a period when family farm income will have fallen by from 35 per cent to 40 per cent.  If the Government are serious about the development of agriculture provision must be made for investment, expansion and modernisation in addition to full depreciation on farm machinery and buildings.</P>
    <P>In a good year in the middle seventies investment in agriculture would be as high as 15 to 20 per cent.  If we get agricultural production back on its feet or, to use a Fianna Fáil phrase, get it moving again, we must have that kind of re-investment.  Even if one was to tax farmers out of existence, which is what they are trying to do, one would not make a significant impact on the PAYE tax burden. If one is to help the PAYE people one's best bet is not to discourage or drive farmers out of farming but to concentrate on the development of agriculture and further it by way of grants, to fight the cause of agriculture at the negotiating tables of Europe, ensure that the farmer is allowed to produce to full capacity and that more EEC and Government grants are made available for further drainage and expansion.</P>
    <P>As I said in another context, the salvation of the economy does not depend on the Porcupine or Kinsale Head but on a buoyant economy.  Everything we produce has to be processed at home. Raw materials are available here for industries based on agriculture.  It has been proved by those involved in marketing that markets are there for our produce. We have the best produce in the world. We have the most suitable climatic conditions. There is a levelling out of <Col N="390" /> agricultural prices in the European market places.  This means that the Dutch, Scandinavians and others who had to import large quantities of feed from California and South America will find it increasingly difficult to compete whereas the Irish farmer with his natural advantages of good grass and a suitable climate will be in a more competitive position as time goes by, given the necessary incentives and encouragement. For goodness sake, settle the tax question once and for all.  Like other citizens farmers should be taxed on their profits, no more no less.  Let us not predetermine any amount of tax they should pay regardless of whether or not they make money.  This system was in vogue long enough with rates.  In other European countries farmers pay tax but they do not pay resource tax or rates.  If they have a good year they pay and if they have a bad year they do not.</P>
    <P>The Government two years ago told farmers all that they would do for them if they got rid of the socialist complex that was running the country and that no more queer taxes such as those fellows introduced would be brought in.  Instead of that the Government compounded the problem and made matters very serious. They know that that kind of revenue cannot come from the industry even with the limited allowances being given to farmers. Things are not well in the industry. Knowing that, they clap on the resource tax and try and offset some of the crazy things they have been doing to pay for some of the stupid moves they had to take to get into Government in the first place.  I would hope that before it is too late, before the farmers are back on the streets again, before the whole agricultural industry is thrown into chaos, wisdom will prevail with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The budget has been introduced for some time now and, as we go on, its faults are becoming more and more noticeable.  When I told somebody at home that I would be speaking on the budget today I was asked: &ldquo;Which budget?&rdquo; It was a fair comment.  We have one every day of the week.  Farm costs have <Col N="391" /> gone through the roof.  Farmers' incomes have levelled out.  They will be working on tight margins.  They need encouragement rather than discouragement.  That applies also to our fishermen who have taken a fair hammering in recent years as a result of EEC regulations.</P>
    <P>Fishermen had just begun to develop when we joined the EEC.  They had begun to invest in boats of a substantial size.  They had begun to spend money, and then they found they were hampered by EEC regulations on the amount of fish they could catch, where they could fish, and so on.  Apart from those restrictions, in the market place of Europe the Government are unable to fight for the cause of the fishermen, and particularly the inshore fishermen who are a breed of fishermen who do not exist in the other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the inshore fisherman has fished for herrings off our coast line in very small boats in years gone by, and in later years in slightly bigger boats. Basically he is not the type of man who is causing the problem.  He is not to be compared with the people who come in the large flotillas and vessels from Holland, Russia and all over the world, and rape our waters.  It has been proved conclusively by independent people that the stocks of inshore fish in Irish waters have improved over the years.  These people are not doing the damage.  This point has not been made loudly enough and plainly enough by our Minister and our Government to protect these people.</P>
    <P>We saw in yesterday's press that their leaders are now pointing out that, because of the depressed situation in fishing at the moment, Irish fishermen will have great difficulty in making their repayments to Bord Iascaigh Mhara for their boats.  Because of the high cost of fuel oil, which was jacked up out of all proportion in the budget, they will find difficulties in operating this season.  Surely a great case can be made for a short-term subvention of a couple of million pounds for these men to help them through their difficulties.  If the Government will not help them, and if we in this <Col N="392" /> Parliament will not help them, we will be doing a great disservice to that industry. While they are having some difficulties at the moment, in the long term the future for Irish fisheries must be bright.</P>
    <P>People are now developing a taste for fish.  Fish foods are becoming more and more important in Europe.  People in Europe have gone crazy for shellfish of all types.  We are completely ignoring that fact.  Our Government and our Minister are oblivious to the value of our shellfish industry.  We are now deliberately using Cork Harbour as a cesspool, a harbour which could be a £10 million shellfish industry if we had treatment plants.  If a small creamery, or industry, or even a farmer starts to do something, there must be a treatment plant, and that is only as it should be.  It is not extraordinary, but our local authorities are told: &ldquo;We will send in an expert and he will prove that there is no need for one.  The place will not be any worse than it was&rdquo;, forgetting that it is bad as it is.  We should adopt a positive attitude&mdash;and it probably would not cost very much more money in the end&mdash;and have treatment plants in our harbours. We should set up a shellfish industry and create jobs in the process.  We could create a new market, beautify our harbours and show the Europeans what we can do.  We could have beautiful clear water in which people could bathe and enjoy themselves as is their right as citizens.</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil speaker said we have to look at the capital side of the budget.  I have been looking at the capital side. What are we doing with the money collected from the people?  A Government can be judged on how they collect money and what use they make of it. The Government seem to be collecting a lot of money in this budget, but all they seem to be doing is staving off disaster. We could accept some of the damaging aspects like the savage increase in the price of petrol if, at the end of the day, the Government could say; &ldquo;At the end of the year we will have our balance of payments in order.  We will have curbed inflation.  We will have our economy in a <Col N="393" /> sound position.&rdquo;  They are not saying that.  They are budgeting in a deficit situation.</P>
    <P>When Ministers come back from abroad we hear wonderful stories about new industries, but rarely do they seem to materialise.  I hope the recent visit to America by the Minister will produce extra jobs.  In the Cork Harbour area nothing has been done to create any new industry since this Government took over.  Nothing has been done to encourage the creation of new industry.  If the Government were serious about jobs in the harbour area, where the infrastructures are already provided, and where millions of pounds were spent during our term of office in providing water and effluent facilities, and now that we have put the natural gas into that estate, the logical step is to have a gas grid for all industries in that area.  Give them a full supply of natural gas and solve the doubts that exist, real or imaginary, regarding energy.  You could tell them: &ldquo;There is your site, with water and everything else laid on, including energy.&rdquo;  If we are serious about creating new industry that is the first step.  Also, existing industries in the area should be offered a similar facility.  They would grab it&mdash;assuming it is competitive and there is no reason it would not be.</P>
    <P>A very important factor in this connection is the total inability of the Government to prevent imports of cheap goods from all over the world.  These goods may come through places like Rotterdam but are probably coming from Taiwan, Russia or somewhere like that.  It is not fair to have these products arriving in Cork Harbour while in that very harbour we have steel works capable of producing these goods just as efficiently at realistic prices.  While entrepreneurs are allowed to operate and bring in these cheap goods we are doing untold damage to home industry.  We have a Buy Irish campaign and a genuine appeal to people to buy Irish, but the important thing is for our Legislature to ensure that Irish products get pride of place and have a fair chance to compete at home.  That does not seem to be happening at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> I was glad to hear the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs say at the Ard Fheis that he would soon be canvassing for phones.  If any single thing has held up development of industry in our area it is the inability of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to provide phones for industry, for young people endeavouring to start in business.  I could cite case after case.  This very day we have a massive tyre distributing firm with a new factory complex and vans ready to roll but they have no phone. Only today they were told by the Department that there was a cable problem.  They have all sorts of problems but they should get down to solving them.  Otherwise, they are hindering industrial development, hindering young people trying to create jobs.  There is no point in saying: &ldquo;You have only five employed and you should have six&rdquo;.  You will never have six if you do not get a phone.  There is no reason why hauliers or Irish people in any business should not have a telephone on the desk in a matter of weeks.  This is not happening.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesman on tourism I must refer to the drastic effect of the budget on tourism.  Inquiries I have made before speaking here indicate the general feeling among hotels and guest houses that the levy on petrol and heating oil and its effect on food prices and costs generally will do much damage to tourism this year.  If people can buy petrol 20p or 25p cheaper in the UK, beer and cigarettes cheaper, that will influence them.  What do people want but a few weeks driving around enjoying the scenery and basically relaxing, with limited money to spend?  According to those in the tourist industry Ireland is no longer the place to look for such a holiday because we are now in the expensive bracket of the Scandinavian countries.</P>
    <P>We were getting on nicely with tourism and the Minister sitting opposite played his part in difficult times dealing with the problems we had last year in encouraging tourism.  He did his best to sort out the energy problem at that time. We had a bad year in 1979 but we were anticipating that everything would be <Col N="395" /> right this year.  Yet, we start off on the wrong foot by slapping 20p extra a gallon on petrol, and putting up the cost of drink.  Those of us who have to stay in Dublin hotels&mdash;and we do not stay in very expensive ones&mdash;find that every week there is another pound or 50p added to the bill.  They say it is due to increasing costs.  We are now in the expensive league and our hotel prices will soon compare with those in Strasbourg, Dusseldorf and so on.  There is no need for this.  Tourism has been a major contributor to our economy.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to make the point that the budget seems to be a series of &ldquo;don'ts&rdquo;&mdash;Do not do this; do not do that.  It is negative.  Could there not be a positive note?  Could we not spend money in the tourist area and say &ldquo;We will boost Bord Fáilte.  We will give Ivernia a boost so that they will not have to go to the industrialists of Cork.  We will undertake as a Government to put our roads right.  We will not rely on money coming from the EEC and confine ourselves to roads where this money can be used.  We will spend money on the roads generally.&rdquo;  That is the first thing.  This also applies to industry, agriculture and tourism.  Let us spend money boosting farm guesthouses, on beaches and holiday resorts.  That would be a positive approach and in the end would mean more revenue than the negative attitude of trying to clean up from everybody because in the end there would be no money left.</P>
    <P>It is only right to mention a matter that has been sadly neglected over a number of years by the Office of Public Works, the whole business of arterial drainage.  In recent years, farmers, supplemented by substantial EEC grants, carried out major land drainage work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the budget to suggest that more work will be done.  Something will have to be done because the water is flowing from our <Col N="396" /> rivers on to our land.  The river Blackwater scheme has been No. 22 on the priority list for many years and it appears that it will not progress from that position for some time to come.  Unless the Government approach this problem realistically the assistance we got from the EEC and the work that has been carried out to date will be useless.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to industrial development particularly in relation to the south of Ireland.  Some people hold the view that Cork has got enough as far as industrial development is concerned, that it is a region that should not be pushed.  I should like to remind the House that the region is ready for massive industrial development.  The groundwork has been carried out and there are almost 2,000 acres of land in public ownership.  I am referring to places like Ringaskiddy, Little Island and the area adjacent to the harbour. There has been a lot of talk about the new Irish oil company refining oil here and I suggest that that work be carried out at the existing oil refinery in Cork. There is little point in looking for sites elsewhere in the country.  The refinery in County Cork can cater for huge tankers. If oil is found off our coast the logical thing to do is to send it to that refinery by pipe or tanker.  The workers in that area are skilled and accustomed to refining oil.  The oil companies own more than 1,000 acres of land which is ready for development.</P>
      <P>When talking to industrialists recently I got the impression that they were depressed about the state of the economy.  They felt that things had got out of control and they did not know what will happen to the Irish pound. They believe we are dealing with a rudderless ship that is being buffeted about by every little economic irritant.  They complained that the present squander-mania attitude spearheaded by the Government commenced after the 1977 election.  They feel that because of this attitude the Irish pound will further decrease in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little point encouraging people to save because they are asked to pay <Col N="397" /> tax on any interest they earn in excess of £70.  Young people have abandoned the idea of thrift.  I grew up in a more difficult era when the emphasis was on thrift.  It was not possible to buy any item then unless one saved for it.  There are many easy payment systems in operation today but they are not so easy because the item must be paid for eventually. The Government should encourage young people to save the deposit on a new house and to educate their families and one incentive they could give would be to increase the interest limit before taxation.  Bankers are clamouring for such a move.  If we managed to encourage people to save there would be fewer on local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>The increases to social welfare recipients were badly needed, but, regrettably, the benefit of them was eroded within a few weeks because of increases in the cost of food and gas.  Those increases in benefit would need to be doubled to counter the rises in prices sanctioned in the meantime.  I would like to think that after the hardships imposed by the budget we would be aiming towards a better economy, that we would be finding our way out of our difficulties but instead we are going further and further into debt.  Last year we were told that almost all the receipts from the PAYE sector went towards paying the interest on the national debt.  Where are we heading?  We must encourage agricultural production and create industries based on agriculture.  We must sell our agricultural produce in every market available bearing in mind that there is a great demand for our produce. However, nothing has been done in that direction.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister in question will see the light and, even at this late stage, endeavour to control inflation, to control prices which have gone completely out of line.  There is no way that agriculture can survive unless something is done about inflation.  If we deliberately jack up road haulage costs by putting 20p a gallon on diesel that will put up the cost of transporting milk, sugar beet and <Col N="398" /> so on.  It will mean increased costs at farm level.  Unless the Government make an effort to keep costs down farmers will not be able to offer the housewife good food at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>I shudder to think what the Government's policies will mean to the entire economy.  The Tánaiste said yesterday that the present high rate of inflation was due to the increases in the public sector, but it was he who gave the extra employment in the public sector.  He said that it was not caused by Fianna Fáil buying votes in 1977.  I say that that was the cause; they raised people's expectations beyond what we, as a small exporting nation, could afford.  We have absolutely nothing to offer except small industries based on agriculture.  Everybody will need to show restraint if we are to survive. That was the message of the Coalition. That was the only true message.</P>
    <P>I hope by now everybody realises that was true, that a change of government did not mean a magic wand and that any promises Fianna Fáil made would have to be paid for dearly.  They have been paid for over the last couple of years. Fianna Fáil promised to get the country moving but they succeeded in bringing us down again when, under the Coalition Government, we were approaching the crest of the wave.  The Government should move towards Coalition policies, towards creating new and worthwhile industries, towards salvaging industries that are going to the wall before it is too late.  We were talking this morning about £20 million, £10 million of which is coming from employers.  That is peanuts when it comes to saving industries at the moment.  A lot of money will have to be found and spent but it is worth finding if we as a nation are to take our place with the other nations in Europe as we had been doing in the mid-seventies.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> The budget proposals in general are intended to provide the revenue for the many and varied services provided for the community by the State.  The service for which I am responsible, Defence, has become in recent years one of the most important provided by the State.  It is for that reason that the level of expenditure on the Defence Forces has continued to rise.  It is also an indication of the Government's determination to strengthen the capability of the Defence Forces to meet their obligations. Stability and security are essential prerequisites to social and economic developments.</P>
    <P>This year the Estimate for Defence shows an increase on the amount allocated in 1979 and while the cost of improved pay and allowances for the troops accounts for a considerable portion of this increase, there is also a substantial amount available for the planned programme of improvements in equipment, accommodation and facilities generally.  One of the new premises to be constructed this year is the new billet for the Women's Service Corps.</P>
    <P>The Government are especially mindful of the important national service rendered by members of the Defence Forces and every effort has been made to ensure that conditions generally are such as to provide adequate compensation for the troops.  Rates of pay and allowances are, of course, a very important factor both in attracting recruits of appropriate calibre and retraining in service those soldiers whose initial term of enlistment has expired.  As a result of improvements in pay and allowances and conditions generally I am glad to say that recruiting figures for the first two months of this year show substantial gains and it is confidently expected that this upward trend will continue.</P>
    <P>Recruitment and retention in the service should also be enhanced by the easement of PAYE taxation bands announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  This means that for all ranks the take-home pay after tax deductions will show a significant improvement in the coming months.  This should give an <Col N="402" /> added incentive to soldiers contemplating re-enlistment and a significant fillip to recruitment figures.</P>
    <P>Public reaction to the budget has been very favourable.  In my own constituency, and in many other parts of the country, I found that while some complaints were expressed about individual facets the consensus was that the budget is a good one.  The Minister for Finance asked the public to look upon the budget as a whole and they are doing so.  The public appreciate that the underlying principles on which the budget is based are sound and they recognise it as a budget which ensures the future wellbeing of the country in the social and economic fields.</P>
    <P>A number of changes are included in the budget which are of considerable significance to many of those for whom my Department have special responsibility. Veterans of the War of Independence played a vital role in the foundation of the State and it is only fitting, despite the present difficult budgetary situation, that an effort should be made not only to maintain their financial position but also to introduce some new concessions for them and for their dependants.  The budget proposals for the abolition of income tax on military service pensions, the creation of a new category of allowances in favour of widows of special allowance holders and the extension of the free electricity and free television licence concession to widows of veterans generally represent substantial innovations in the general provisions for veterans of the War of Independence and their widows.  These developments are of real value to the survivors of a generation which played a key role in the foundation and emergence of the State and I have no doubt that the House will join me in welcoming their introduction.</P>
    <P>The annual budget has come to have a direct and significant impact on the Army Pension Vote administered by my Department, which includes provision for the payment of some 20,000 pensioners and allowance holders.  The Vote contains provision for pensions and allowances for retired members of the <Col N="403" /> Defence Forces and their widows and dependants.  It also contains provision for pensions and allowances for veterans of the War of Independence and widows of military service pensioners. In addition there is provision for the various schemes of concessions granted to veterans.  These include free travel within the State for veterans and their spouses or the widows of veterans.  Also included are the free electricity allowance, free television licence and telephone rental and funeral grants.</P>
    <P>The 20,000 pensions and allowances involved are comprised mainly as follows: 3,000 military service pensions in respect of active service in the War of Independence; 6,000 special allowances to persons who had membership of certain prescribed organisations, Óglaigh na hÉireann, Cumann na mBan, Fianna Éireann and so on who are now unable to support themselves because of old age or infirmity; 5,000 pensions under the Defence Forces pensions schemes for retired members of the Defence Forces and widows of members of the Defence Forces; 500 allowances to dependants of soldiers and members of prescribed organisations killed or disabled in action; 750 wounded and disability pensions payable to soldiers and members of prescribed organisations in respect of wounds and injuries; and 4,250 allowances payable to widows of military service pensioners.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the abolition of income tax on military service pensions is a concession which recognises in a special way the position of military service pensioners. The possession of such a pension implies active service during the War of Independence and, therefore, it is not in any way invidious to extend this concession to that category of pensioners.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that it has been found possible to do something further by way of assistance to the widows of veterans. In particular the payment of the proposed flat rate allowance to the widow of a veteran who dies while in receipt of a special allowance will do a <Col N="404" /> great deal to mitigate the hardship that arises when the special allowance ceases in such circumstances.  Widows of military service pensioners are in receipt already of an annual allowance which is related to the amount of the pension of the deceased military service pensioner. This is subject to a minimum annual figure.  The arrangement was introduced in 1971 and I am glad that the Minister for Finance has found it possible to provide for the widows of special allowance holders.  The new allowance is at the rate of £185 per annum and will be payable with effect from 1 July of this year.  This very welcome development will require amending legislation and I would hope to take the necessary steps in that regard without delay.</P>
    <P>A military service pensioner, as the holder of the Service (1917-1921) Medal with Bar, satisfies the fundamental condition&mdash;that of being a veteran&mdash;for the award of the special allowance.  Nowadays, however, in the majority of cases what is required essentially is that the applicant be the holder of a duly awarded Service (1917-1921) Medal without Bar but this gives rise to problems.  With the passage of time it is becoming progressively more difficult to obtain acceptable verification for the award of medals.  The Department try to be as flexible as possible in dealing with these cases but in fairness to those who are entitled to the medal it is only right that before an award is made, as a minimum, the balance of available evidence should be in favour of the applicant.  Cases will arise where, because of the absence of acceptable corroborative evidence, applicants who at another time might have qualified will fail in their application for a medal.  We have in effect reached the stage at which anyone who intends to apply for a medal should do so without delay.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already there are some 4,000 veterans who are availing of the free electricity allowance and the free television licence.  Under the present arrangements when a veteran dies the concession ceases and in many cases this <Col N="405" /> can constitute a distinct hardship. Therefore, I welcome the concession in the budget whereby, from 1 July next, the concession will be applicable also to veterans' widows.</P>
    <P>A major objective in this year's budget was to create greater equity in the taxation system.  There has been dissatisfaction among the PAYE sector at the level of taxation but it is accepted by them generally, I think, that the Government in the budget proposals responded very fairly to the workers demands in this regard.  Added to this is the fact that the Government have decided to establish a commission on taxation with the object of providing an equitable tax system.  I am glad to note that the ICTU have accepted the setting up of such a commission and have said that they will co-operate with the commission.</P>
    <P>Down through the years, and particularly during periods of inflation, problems have arisen with the PAYE system but it might be useful to recall that this system was sought originally by the trade unions and was, at the time of its introduction, regarded as a major achievement.  Prior to then workers received bills for income tax at the end of the financial year.  I recall in my early days in the Dáil being approached by workers who had received bills for what might now be regarded as relatively small amounts of money, requesting me to intercede with the Revenue Comissioners to have the amounts reduced or to agree to have them made payable during a period.  Indeed, I have known incidents where workers received such bills and, being unable to meet the demand, packed their bags and went to Britain, so great was the stress on them at that time. The PAYE system, by providing for the deduction of tax as income was earned, was a very considerable advance so far as the worker was concerned on the system which had obtained up to then. Consequently, as a system PAYE is far from being totally bad, but reform is necessary and that is a question with which the commission on taxation will concern themselves.</P>
    <P>I have taken particular note of the efforts <Col N="406" /> on the part of Deputy FitzGerald and other Opposition Deputies to denigrate the very worthwhile improvements <i>vis-à-vis</i> income tax in the budget. The procedure they adopt seems to be that they identify the amounts which individuals with a particular level of income will receive as a result of the changes made by the Minister for Finance and then measure them against increases in living costs which they speculate may arise.  Obviously, they are not comparing like with like here.  The saving to the taxpayer is clear and identifiable while the increases suggested in living costs are speculative.  Some of these increases may result from budget policy but many would arise in any case. For example, a very considerable factor in the cost of living to which I have referred already is the increase in world oil prices.  Regardless of whether changes were brought about in taxation rates, those increases in costs would have arisen anyway.  Surely it must be accepted that the improvements in the lot of the person paying tax under the PAYE system helps him to meet costs increases resulting from, for example, the OPEC increase in the price of oil, an increase over which we do not have any control.</P>
    <P>It is a basic simple fact that the Minister for Finance has raised the tax exemption limits, thereby relieving many low-income people from the burden of paying tax&mdash;in fact, the number is 75,000 people&mdash;and by widening the income bands most taxpayers will be paying at the lower rates.  These are incontrovertible facts.  They are understood and appreciated by those paying tax under the PAYE system and the prophets who predict doom in the far distant future will have an extremely difficult task in convincing these people otherwise.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the tax system changes which have led to very favourable mention.  A special feature is that of income splitting for married taxpayers. This represents a major improvement in the system and enhances the place of the family unit in the community. I might add that, far from being <Col N="407" /> forced to bring in the changes in the budget in respect of income-splitting&mdash;as alleged by some Opposition speakers&mdash;the facts are that it has come about by a positive decision of the Government.  Indeed it is true to say that, in the proposals in this budget in respect of income-splitting, we are very much in advance of quite a number of countries in western Europe.  All in all the budget proposals in respect of PAYE improve the lot of the taxpayer whether married or single.  The changes in personal income taxation announced in the budget will have the effect of increasing the take-home pay of all ranks in the permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>For example, taking account of the special PAYE allowance of £400 and the change in the tax bands, the tax bill of a single recruit whose current basic pay is £74.13 will be reduced by about £2.50 a week.  In the case of a private, Three Star, with six years' service, who is married with three children and earns £95.66 a week, his post-budgetary income tax commitment will be reduced by about £3.50 a week, while the saving for a single, Three Star Private with equivalent service and earning £92.15 a week will amount to approximately £2.50 a week.  As a further example, a married sergeant with one child and nine years' service earning £108.27 a week will save £4.25 a week.  Of course the position of married personnel with children will be still further improved by the increases in the children's allowances announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement.</P>
    <P>The major concern of all Fianna Fáil Governments down the years has been to improve the lot of the underprivileged. The present Government is no exception and it has been their particular concern in these difficult times to protect those who, for one reason or another, are unable to help themselves, whether because of old age, unemployment, illness or whatever.  Prior to the introduction of the budget there were many and varied proposals and suggestions from a wide variety of individuals and groups as to <Col N="408" /> what those dependent on social welfare payments might expect, or should be granted, in the forthcoming budget.  We have read in the press and heard on the radio and television of the demands of those genuinely interested in the plight of those in need and, of course, of the demands of those who are perhaps more interested in political expediency.  It is very important to note that every single claim or prognostication was at a much lower level of increase than that actually provided by the Government in the budget.  That very surely underlines the Government's concern for the poorer sections of the community and their determination to see to it that such people are properly looked after.  Let me repeat that the increases of 25 per cent in the long-term payments, on pensions and such like, and 20 per cent in short-term payments, such as disability and unemployment assistance, are very much greater than anybody had thought likely or indeed possible.  Much as the Opposition may attempt to denigrate the Government's efforts in this field there is no question but that the public have expressed their support for and appreciation of what we have done, in no uncertain terms.  I should add that the budget increases, together with the increases granted last October, mean that the rates will be higher by 31 per cent and 26 per cent respectively next April than they were a year earlier.  The total cost of the increases proposed in the budget in social welfare benefits comes to £95 million in 1980 and represents a major re-distribution in favour of the less fortunate members of our community.</P>
    <P>I know the House shares the concern of the Government for those genuinely in need and have no doubt that the dramatic measures taken on their behalf will be welcomed.  So far as my Department are concerned the important point to remember is that, in assessing eligibility for the granting of special allowances for veterans, many social welfare and kindred benefits are ignored and others partially assessed only. Briefly the following are not taken into account: children's allowances under the <Col N="409" /> Social Welfare Acts; maintenance in a hospital, sanitorium, county home or like institution; prescribed relative allowance; home help allowance and payments for light work done by patients.  In addition a nominal amount only of the old age pension, whether contributory or non-contributory, is taken into account.  The same applies to widows' pensions, retirement pensions and invalidity pensions.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the increases of 25 per cent in long-term benefits and 20 per cent in short-term benefits, such as unemployment and disability benefit.  The cost of these and other improvements to the Exchequer, including the increases in children's allowances, represents the highest allocation ever made for social welfare services in any budget.  For example a contributory old age pensioner will receive an additional £4.90 a week from April next, giving him or her a pension of £24.50 a week.  A married couple on old age pension will get an increase of £8.55 a week, bringing their pension to £42.80 a week.  There are also increases in the supplements payable to pensioners living alone or those over 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>In the case of widows who are receiving contributory pensions, the personal rate of pension is increased from £18 per week to £22.50, an increase of £4.50. The rate for dependent children is raised from £6 a week for each child to £7.50. Therefore, a widow with three dependent children will receive a pension of £45 a week from April next, or £9 a week more than she receives at present.  The disabled maintenance allowance has been increased by £4.05 to £20.25 a week.</P>
    <P>Of course children's allowances are an important source of income for families and go directly to the mother.  I am glad that these will be increased again from July by £1 a month for the first child and £1.50 for each subsequent child.  This will mean an increase of about 29 per cent in children's allowances, bringing the monthly cheque to £4.50 for one child, £11.50 for two children; £18.50 for three, £25.50 for four and £32.50 for five children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> Taken together the increases in social welfare benefits represent the highest ever allocation made to social welfare services, with a massive transfer of funds to those in greatest need.  The Government are pledged to protecting the needy in these difficult economic times and have honoured that commitment significantly.</P>
    <P>Because I had charge of tourism during the past two-and-a-half years I should like to make a few comments on statements made by Opposition speakers in regard to this area.  They, including Deputy Hegarty who has just spoken, made great play of increases in a variety of taxes and charged that these increases would affect our tourism industry adversely. I do not accept that tourism, one of our vital industries, will be affected adversely by these increases.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the increase in oil prices by the oil producing countries will have an effect on prices of oil-based products everywhere, and inevitably the prices of these products will be increased in other countries as well as here.  Indeed the general economy of every country in the world is being affected by the enormous increases imposed by the OPEC people.  As well, the price of petrol has been higher in many of the countries competing with us for tourists.  Even after the increases in the budget here the price of petrol in some of the countries competing with us is higher than here. One cannot very well use our prices for comparison purposes with the prices last summer in competing countries.  Rather the comparison must be with prices as they are today, or as they will be when those countries have introduced their own budgets.</P>
    <P>What particularly prompted me to refer to tourism is that Deputy Barry, in his speech immediately after the budget and in his budget statement on television, referred to 1979 as a disastrous year for Irish tourism.  He said that because of budget changes this year the situation will be much worse.  A few moments ago Deputy Hegarty alleged that last year was a bad one for Irish tourism.  I should like to point out again, as I have done on <Col N="411" /> many occasions towards the close of last year, that far from being a bad year for tourism this country last year, 1979, earned the highest income in the history of the State from tourism.  More than £400 million was earned and of that money more than £300 million came from tourists from outside the State.  That was a remarkable achievement when one takes into account the postal strike and the petrol shortage at the height of the tourist season.  It is a great credit to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Though it is true that in real terms the income was fractionally below that of 1978, one must not forget that 1978 was a record year for tourism, when tourist income outstripped in real terms the tourist income in 1969, which had been the highest ever up to then.  Despite all the problems and difficulties faced by this country in 1979, including world wide downturn in economic conditions, tourism continued to develop here and the number of visitors from Europe was much higher than in any previous year. The Government were concerned last year to protect this great industry.  The extra money made available to Bord Fáilte for publicity purposes, the guaranteed fuel voucher scheme and my personal involvement with tourism promotion in Europe in 1979 infused a spirit of confidence in the industry which resulted in an income of £403.5 million as compared with £376.5 million the previous year, which has been a record year.</P>
    <P>If the parties opposite have to rely on this well propagated Opposition hoary untruth about Irish tourism in 1979&mdash;an untruth which they continue assiduously to propagate&mdash;to bolster up a case against this budget then they are attempting to build a case against the budget on a very poor foundation indeed.</P>
    <P>Considering the importance of the industry, it would be unpatriotic deliberately to publicise a drastic fall in the numbers coming here on holiday, if that were true.  Words fail me to describe what I think of those who propagate such matters when they know them to be <Col N="412" /> untrue, knowing as they must the damage they can cause to what is a vital industry.  We do not exist in a vacuum. Many other countries are vying with us for tourists.  If foreigners believed that last year had been a disastrous year for Irish tourism, then they would have good reason to decide not to come here this year.  Visitors to Ireland can be assured of a welcome here and of a very pleasant holiday.  Bord Fáilte do not have a gloomy outlook.  Invariably they face up to problems and overcome them.</P>
    <P>What surprises me is that the two parties which formed the Coalition and which had such poor tourism results should have the gall to mention tourism at all.</P>
    <P>Listening to Opposition speakers in the course of this debate it was obvious that they found considerable difficulty in finding anything of consequence which, with any credibility, they could be really critical of in the budget.  They searched around, clearly without success, in an effort to find some subject which would help them cloud the real issues, and having failed in every other area they raised for the umpteenth time the matter of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and attempted to blame it for our economic problems, as if oil price increases had never been heard of, or worldwide economic problems did not exist.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts.  The promises made by us in the manifesto were put into effect, very much to the advantage of the people of this country individually and also to the general advantage of the economy as a whole.  I am not referring solely to the removal of rates from private houses or tax from cars, much as these benefited the individual, but also to the much more important areas of the provision of jobs, increased production, reduction of inflation, higher investment, particularly evident in the first two years of office of this Government and before the exceptional increase in oil prices took place, which disturbed not just the economy of this country but the economies of all the countries in the world, be they big or small, even the economy of such a powerful country as <Col N="413" /> the United States.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the provision of jobs later because it is one aspect of the economy in which the Government are particularly interested.</P>
    <P>The fact is that gross domestic product in 1977 and 1978 grew by nearly 7 per cent, which was the highest rate achieved in the EEC and OECD countries.  Investment was high and kept increasing rapidly as compared with a fall in investment during most of the Coalition period of office.  Inflation was brought down to manageable levels. Later the enormous increase in oil prices created the major problem.</P>
    <P>However, it was in the field of job creation that we had our most notable success.  National figures are available to show how the number of unemployed has been reduced and new jobs created. Indeed recent figures published show a significant fall in the number on the live register this year as compared with last year so I do not need to deal with the matter at that level.</P>
    <P>I will, however, briefly refer to the situation as we found it at local level in south and mid-Louth in 1977 when we took office because this reflects the national situation.  There were 1,919 registered unemployed persons in the Drogheda employment exchange in July 1977, the month in which we took office. In July 1979, two years later, the number of registered unemployed in the Drogheda employment exchange was 1,090.  The number of unemployed had been practically halved in two short years.  This was a tremendous achievement never before witnessed in that area, an achievement which nobody would have been willing to prophesy in July 1977, but which had resulted from the carefully planned policy of this Government and carried through effectively despite the very obvious problems facing us.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach stated recently, the concern of the Government will continue to be to ensure that our people who may be unfortunate enough to be unemployed will have jobs made available to them <Col N="414" /> and the young people of the country will be sure of employment when they leave school.  It is true to say that there are now many employment areas where there are unfilled job vacancies.</P>
    <P>For mid-Louth the Coalition period in office was nothing short of a disaster. When they left office the two major industries in that area, AET in Dunleer and Castleguard Textiles in Ardee, were on the verge of collapse and eventually closed their doors.  One would have to live in that area, which has a great rural, industrial reputation to appreciate the gloom and despair which permeated the whole area&mdash;workers unemployed, many of them for the first time in their lives, and large numbers of young people with no prospects of employment in their own area.  In a relatively densely populated rural area this was a frightening situation.  As I said, one would have to have savoured the situation as a member of the community to realise the plight of the people there.</P>
    <P>What is the position in the same area today, two-and-a-half years later?  After-two-and-a-half years of putting the job creation programme, about which the Opposition appear to be so critical, into operation these are now the facts.  The factory at Dunleer, the AET factory, has been taken over by an Irish company, Basic Engineering, which is now employing about 250 people.  A new factory owned by Westinghouse is in the course of being built in Dunleer.  They have already advertised for employees and hope to go into operation in the summer. They are expected to employ 288 people over a three-year period.  The old Castleguard factory in Ardee has been taken over by another company and is now employing 100 people.  A further new factory is in the course of being built in Ardee and some of the workers are already being trained to work in that factory. The furniture industry has expanded very considerably and has taken on quite a considerable number of new employees and there are prospects of another industry there.  This is a complete and almost unbelievable transformation in a short space of a couple of years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Let me add that those jobs are not jobs in the public service.  Opposition speakers, particularly Deputy John Kelly, like to claim that all of the jobs created under our policy were public service jobs.  All of these jobs are in the private sector.  Not only were these jobs provided, but they generate further employment in the services sector.  The state of despair which we had inherited from the Coalition in mid-Louth has now been dispersed and young people can look forward to the future with confidence. What was achieved there is indicative of the progress made all over the country. The people of my constituency will be hard to convince that Fianna Fáil policies have been anything but successful.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up another point in relation to statements made by Deputy John Kelly when he criticised the creation of jobs in the public sector. There were, of course, jobs created in the public service.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the fact that those working in the technical and technological areas in the Post Office are civil servants and will continue to be such until legislation is passed by the Oireachtas to establish the statutory boards set up by me on an interim basis.  There were very large numbers of technicians and installers taken on over the past two-and-a-half years to speed up the modernisation of our telecommunications system.  These were jobs created in the public service.  Is it suggested that these jobs were not essential? Indeed, if any criticism might apply in this area it could be that we did not recruit even more personnel.</P>
    <P>I refer to this particular aspect of the public service because it is one for which I had a responsibility and I certainly make no apologies whatsoever for the increased employment in the public service for which I was responsible.  The global condemnation of our policy by Deputy Kelly would lead those who have no knowledge of the real situation to believe that the increased employment in the public service simply meant the creation of desk jobs.  Government policy in the <Col N="416" /> telecommunications field was to develop the system as rapidly as possible, to make available sufficient money to develop the telecommunication system and to employ more and more technicians. It is a fact that more technicians will be needed in this area.  Again, let me point out that they are in the public service. I wonder if Deputy Kelly objects to that.</P>
    <P>While I am on this particular subject I must confess that I was somewhat surprised to find the CII issuing a statement criticising the amount of money made available this year for telecommunications development.  The reality, of course, as the CII are aware, is that the Government propose to spend £650 million on telecommunications development over the next five years, that each year this development will accelerate and each year more money will be spent.  The amount, therefore, being made available this year is a realistic one.  The task of implementing the accelerated programme, which is aimed at raising the quality of the telephone, telex and data services to EEC levels and meeting without delay the demand for telephones is a formidable one and one which cannot be achieved without the co-operation of all concerned.  I have no doubt that that co-operation will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Now, to return again to my reason for speaking on this particular area, the creation of jobs in the public service, let me repeat that the creation of jobs in the telecommunications field was a vital necessity if our economy was to develop to its full potential.  The Government propose to continue to concentrate on employment.  Admittedly, the circumstances are more difficult but we have the will and the ability to achieve our objectives in this area as we have proven in the past.</P>
    <P>The economic problems which arose in more recent times were not of our making.  They arose mainly from the enormous increases in oil prices.  When oil prices were increased by the OPEC countries it was understandable that the individual who had to pay more for oil or petrol, or indeed for the increases in <Col N="417" /> prices in a varriety of goods resulting from the oil price increase, would naturally be concerned about his own particular problem in finding the extra money to pay for these commodities. The fundamental problem which faced the country, however, was the fact that the £140 million, which the increase cost the country as a whole, was, as it were, lifted out of the finances of the State and transferred elsewhere.  In other words, this money which could have been turned to good account in our own economy, was now gone from it.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Government recognise that our borrowing, particularly for current purposes, had got to be cut down.  I do not want to bore the House with a comparison between State borrowing and borrowing by an individual family, but a study of the consequences in both cases will show them to be very similar.  Borrowing for capital purposes, wisely spent, can be good, borrowing for current expenditure can be an extremely risky venture.</P>
    <P>So, a start has been made on reducing Government borrowing.  In simple terms, we recognise the need to live within our means and we are acting accordingly.  A gradual approach to this ideal has been adopted, otherwise we could create serious deflationary problems.  As the Minister for Finance has pointed out, the overall borrowing requirement will fall from 13.7 per cent of GNP in 1979 to 10.4 per cent in 1980.  It should, however, be noted that the Public Capital Programme will increase by 15 per cent, including a 22 per cent rise for the industrial promotion groups.  This will sustain the growth of employment and of the economy generally and will continue to produce the results which I have already outlined in respect of employment.</P>
    <P>Taxation, of course, was necessary to achieve the worthwhile results which will flow from this budget to the benefit of PAYE taxpayers and those dependent on social welfare as well as to the economy.  Particular note should be taken of the fact that emphasis has been placed as far as possible on discretionary <Col N="418" /> expenditure.  Much of the new type of taxation will be paid by the individual only if the taxpayer himself decides to do so, by spending in the discretionary area. To that extent the individual can control the amount he pays.</P>
    <P>This budget was specially designed to ensure a continuation of economic development, to improve the lot of those who are dependent on social welfare payments, to continue the process of initiating a fairer tax system and to start on a process of coming closer to living within our means.  It is a realistic budget. It has clearly been recognised as such by the public who see in it an honest effort to deal with the serious economic problems, mainly due to outside influences, which beset us while at the same time ensuring continued improvement and development in this social area, seeing to it that the less well off sections of the community are properly cared for and ensuring employment possibilities for the young people who now account for a high proportion of our population.</P>
    <P>Long and careful thought and preparation went into the compilation of this budget and, if one is to judge by public reaction to it, then it is the successful budget it deserves to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been going on for a number of weeks.  The more I hear Ministers speaking on it the more I am convinced it is a bad budget. They are trying to pad it out.  They talk about the income tax concessions.  If a person is in the £20,000 a year bracket this budget means an extra £2,000, and that is a worthwhile concession; but the person in the £5,000 bracket is not getting anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government say there is jam for everybody but with all due respects, the public are not fooled.  The Minister said he heard the odd criticism about this budget.  Obviously he has not been reading the results of the opinion polls. They are chastening.  This Government, who swept into power just over two years ago with a massive majority, find themselves, according to the opinion <Col N="419" /> polls, in a minority position.  When one reads the results of these polls one can understand why this is such a muted Government.</P>
    <P>We hear talk of elections, not from the Government but from political pundits. The Government are staying very quiet because they have taken soundings on their recent budget.  One could say that this budget was much ado about nothing, promising a lot and achieving nothing.</P>
    <P>Let us look at local authority funding. We hear many complaints about the state of our roads&mdash;potholes, dangerous roads, unkept roads and so on&mdash;but what is the position at the end of the day?  Cut-backs.  We hear about a 10 per cent increase on last year's allocation.  In some cases local authorities overspent on last year's allocation and that means they are going to get less than 10 per cent this year with 20 per cent inflation. Local authority funding is most important because if local authorities are run down our whole infrastructure will break down.  Local authority services&mdash;water, sewerage, roads, parks and so on&mdash;are in serious jeopardy because of the Government's cut-backs.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of housing.  We are heading for a very serious housing crisis.  Inflation is rampant in the building sector and the allocations we hope to get will not keep abreast of inflation.  Consequently there will be a serious cut-back on public housing.  Yet we see ever-increasing housing lists.  There has been a dramatic decrease in money invested in building societies.  This time last year the amount invested in those societies was approximately £20 million and this year it is down to £7 million.  That gives an indication of the seriousness of the social and employment problems in this area.</P>
    <P>The Government seem totally unaware and unconcerned about how people will provide homes, how they will get the necessary finance and that they are living in intolerable conditions in certain urban areas&mdash;rat infestation, overcrowding, and rundown housing with inadequate <Col N="420" /> sanitation.  As any public servant representing these people will admit, these are day to day problems.  How do we keep these people happy having regard to what the budget holds out for them?  We had housing problems before but I thought that economic progress would get rid of this social evil once and for all.  However, it is developing into a very serious problem and the Government should take drastic action.  It will not solve the problem to increase building society rates, with the excuse that there is no inflow of money and they need an incentive to attract it.  The reason for these problems is the Government's monetary incompetence.  They are muddling on from one financial problem to another, promising all but achieving nothing.</P>
    <P>In relation to prices Fianna Fáil made all sorts of derisory comments when we were in office but they should now look at their record on prices and hang their heads in shame.  Butter was 53½p and it is now 66½p and bread has also gone up. When butter went up by 15p during the Coalition term there was revolution and revulsion from the Opposition side of the House and statements that the economy would be wrecked and that the tourist industry would go by the board.  When we left office petrol cost 87p a gallon, it now costs £1.51 and no doubt it will cost more shortly.</P>
    <P>The motto of this Government before the last election was &ldquo;If you have a problem we will solve it.&rdquo;  Due to the inefficient handling of the economy there are many headaches about to-day.  The price of bread, for instance, has increased by 70 per cent.  This sort of thing hits not only the consumer but the whole commercial structure of our life, making us less competitive and pricing ourselves out of the market.  When one looks at the price increases, the promises and the bland approach now adopted by the Government one cannot be surprised when one reads about opinion polls that show the Government up in a disastrous light.</P>
    <P>The Government's days of codding the electorate with fancy PR exercises <Col N="421" /> are over.  With their majority the Government have no fear of being beaten on any issue that might come before the House, but as sure as day follows night they will have to face the electorate eventually and they will be judged on their false promises and on their performance since coming to office.</P>
    <P>The Government talk about their concern for the less well off.  They gave a reasonable increase in allowances but in the budget as a whole there is no attempt to solve the problems of the underprivileged. Sympathy and gestures of concern are of little consequence to the less well off.  Some form of action is required to heal this cancer in society. While giving increases in a budget offers some form of relief it does not solve the problems that exist, particularly in the densely populated urban areas and unless these problems are tackled they will multiply.  The Government should set up a task force to examine the problem areas and come to hard decisions.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in the urban areas relates to education.  Education can lift people out of their misery.  When one examines the figures for the centre of the city one sees that only 10.9 per cent completed secondary education and only 1.8 per cent completed university education.  That gives a fair indication of the serious social problems we have here.  Are these people to be forever more condemned to be the have nots of our society?  Are these people to multiply and perpetuate this problem?  On the figures I have quoted, 10.9 per cent secondary and 1.8, it is clear that this is what will happen.</P>
    <P>I have said previously in this House and I will say again and again until people get tired listening to it, that this is a vital area.  People are condemned to schools that in some cases are run down. They are overcrowded and even though there is overcrowding in the classrooms there are empty rooms in the schools. This problem requires the will on the part of the Government to tackle it.  We are not talking about vast sums of <Col N="422" /> money, we are talking about very modest sums.  If money is limited&mdash;and it is&mdash;then the amount available must be redistributed to that Department and one must take the cream off the top and give it to the bottom.  The people I am talking about have not got a voice in society.  A large number of them do not vote.  Why vote?  What is there to vote for?  They are condemned to a system.</P>
    <P>They are not educated and basically nobody gives two damns whether they are educated, and then we wonder why we have the spate of vandalism in our society.  We wonder why windows are broken and cars wrecked.  We should examine the causes of these happenings before we apportion blame.  If we examine the causes and are honest with ourselves the blame will be apportioned to Governments who fail to take action in these areas.  The INTO, crying out as a professional body seeking for something to be done, brought out a report on the education of disadvantaged children and again it fell on deaf ears. Why should this be, given the small outlay? Are the Department of Education so hidebound and caught up in their own rules and regulations that they cannot adopt educational policies and priorities for particular areas?  If they cannot do that they are failing in their object which is to ensure that our children are educated.  God knows, we hear the slogan that we cherish all our children equally.  The children I am talking about are not being treated equally, far from it, and it is easy to dismiss them because they have not a strong voice.  It is time that matters like this of social concern were dealt with quickly because if they are not they will reap a distasteful harvest. Today we see vandalism of the worst type in our cities and we must tackle that problem in every area, using all the means at our disposal.</P>
    <P>There are ways in which we can deal with the problem, by developing proper housing and a proper environment and by job creation, particularly in the inner city.  Of the children in some of the schools that I know 60 per cent of the parents do not work.  In some areas 80 <Col N="423" /> per cent of the people live in overcrowded, high-density flats.  You can see the powder keg ready to explode if it has not exploded already.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss and saddened when I see that nothing is done to deal with this problem.  I ask the Minister responsible for this area to take his courage in his hands and if it means creaming money from another area of education he should do that.  The section from which he might cream it would be loud and articulate in voice because they have the benefits of the moneys spent on their education and they have now the voice to protect their own interests while the people I am talking about would not have.  Politicians are there to protect the people I am talking about, not to respond to the strongest voice in society.</P>
    <P>This budget has not done very much about the question of industrial relations. It was felt that it had responded to people who marched in the PAYE tax campaign, but when the sums are done&mdash;and in some cases they are&mdash;these people will not have come too well out of it and, given the rate of inflation, will find at the end of the day their standard of living eroded.  Instead of the hope and promise of a better standard of living they will find themselves worse off.  The last thing that this country wants now is industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>This Government will have to ensure that industrial peace is maintained and that the hopes and aspirations of workers are as far as possible attained. This can only be done by arresting our very high inflationary rate.  The budget has done little to make people confident that the inflation rate can be arrested, because it can add from 4 per cent to 6 per cent on to inflation.  That, coming on the heels of the savage price increases about which we have become so accustomed to reading every day, is not creating the kind of climate required to deal with the whole area of negotiations to keep demands at reasonable levels. We are all aware that if demands are excessive they will perpetuate inflation.  If Governments, by their very actions in <Col N="424" /> budgetary policies, create inflation, how can we expect workers to be restrained and responsible?  Governments should be seen to act in a responsible way and ensure that they are doing all in their power to keep down inflation.</P>
    <P>There is no use in going on television or going along to dinners in chambers of commerce and lecturing people as to what they should do.  One leads by example; one is governed by example.  If the example is not there, people will have little confidence and will not respond. What this nation needs today is leadership.  It needs integrity; it needs responsibility; it needs somebody at the helm who can be looked to and responded to and to whom one can say with confidence, &ldquo;We shall make the particular sacrifices that are required, because we know that we have a Government who are prepared to play their part.&rdquo;  Sadly, this Government are not playing their part.  They are not being responsible and do not inspire confidence. That is a pity, because the potential of this country for development is great.  We have a population of young, vigorous men and women, a population which is reasonably well educated and would be only too anxious to respond to some call for idealism.  What do we see? A series of gimmicks which started at the last election by way of a document called the manifesto, which has now been cosily tucked away and not spoken about.  That is not good enough.  That is the kind of irresponsibility about which I am talking.</P>
    <P>People will not respond when they see this trick-of-the-loopery going on from time to time.  People want effective, sound leadership and when they get that, they will respond accordingly.  If one tricks them&mdash;and I believe that they were tricked&mdash;they will respond in the opposite way.  A very serious problem facing our country in the coming year is getting down to negotiating increases to ensure that workers' living traditions are protected and improved, that we have the minimum disruption in employment and are getting the highest rate of productivity.  Unless we get these things <Col N="425" /> working together, we shall be going no place.  We shall not achieve any real growth rate in our economy and, consequently, living standards will suffer.</P>
    <P>Actions by this Government, prior to the last election and since, have been responsible for the problems that we have seen over the last couple of years. One must ask, when are they going to take themselves seriously?  They were given a mandate, they were given a whacking majority and they have not responded to that majority in any way. Over the last year there was a squabble for power and now that the squabble is over, we have a divided house.  Like all divided houses it is not peaceful, nor is it conducive to peace, nor will peace emanate from it.</P>
    <P>The first thing that the Government must do is convince the public and the electorate that they are now a serious government, with serious policies capable of dealing with the very pressing issues of today.  On the whole question of finance, cut-backs and statements from various Ministers, there is no visible policy.  We hear of a transport system which is costing this country a considerable sum of money.  Whether we are getting good or bad value is a rather moot point.  Certainly, our transport system requires to be looked into.  We had recently a rather startling report, to say the least.  A lot of it I would not go along with, because it advocated the closing of our rail system.  Our rail system must remain.  Any country that wants to expand its economy must have proper communications.  Our rail system must be preserved whatever the cost.</P>
    <P>What disturbs me is the on-off situation of a rail system within the city. There are plans for a rapid rail system. These plans were costed but the figures are probably out of date now.  Recently the Minister who is in charge of that area threw cold water on the plans and despite the great need for such a development there is a question mark over it.  We are building satellite towns around our city but we have no lines of communication between them and the city.  It is a crazy system.  The rapid <Col N="426" /> system was costed at one stage at £250 million.  Surely finance could be borrowed from the various funds available for such projects.  It would have the effect of saving fuel and getting people to their places of employment in an efficient and orderly way.  If it was an efficient system it would induce people to leave their cars at home, again saving fuel.</P>
    <P>We built towns in Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Ballymun.  These are vast areas of population but the infrastructure and road network to them is totally inadequate and unsatisfactory.  It forces people to use their cars thus using a very scarce and expensive imported resource.  I asked a question about the rapid rail during a debate on a Private Members' motion and was told that a transport commission were sitting and until they reported the Government could not make any decisions.  New Ministers came in and made decisions.  One would ask oneself what the purpose of these committees is if Governments have already made their minds up.  If one does not want to do something about a particular situation one sets up a committee which meets a few times.</P>
    <P>The Minister is saying we cannot have rapid rail.  Where are we going?  Surely it is easy to see that it is needed.  CIE who are the transport authority who deal with this have been pressing for it because they see it will alleviate many problems and solve others.  They were cast aside and time dragged on.  As a result of that inflation is putting the price up and making it a bigger excuse for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>If one travelled in any of these suburban trains lately one would notice that the rolling stock is disgraceful, dangerous and uncomfortable.  Despite that one cannot get on to these trains because the demand is so great.  Surely that is proof that we should have a firm commitment from the Government to this type of urban transport.  It would have the effect of improving the commercial life of the inner city because people could come from areas like Tallaght in 19 minutes.  In other words they would <Col N="427" /> be sure of getting a train at 8 a.m. and being in their place of employment by 8.30 a.m. whereas if they got a bus at 8 a.m. they might get into their place of employment at 9.30 a.m.  People tend to lose touch with the city, commercial life tends to suffer and all in all the whole situation requires serious consideration and commitment from the Government. The commitment is not forthcoming and the will is not there.  The channels for getting finance are there but the Government do not see this as a priority and consequently it is put into oblivion.</P>
    <P>Something should be done to keep the city moving.  The Minister stated recently that he would ban cars from the city. One does not ban this and that unless one has an alternative ready.  The way to curtail cars coming into the city is to have a viable alternative.  The commuter will leave his car at home, given the price of petrol today, if he is guaranteed that he can travel from A to B in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The commitment to put money into road development and developing bus lanes will have the effect of improving our transport and encouraging people to use the public transport system.  To glibly say no to a rapid rail system because they have not got money for it and a few days later to say they will ban cars from the city and that will solve the congestion is indicative of the woolly thinking of the Government who do not know where they are going.  It is regrettable to have to say that but it is a fact. The sooner the commission report and the Government make decisions the better. In the long run the saving on fuel will be astronomical.</P>
    <P>As regards energy conservation I am worried about the Government's total inaction on this.  The Taoiseach set up a Department of Energy.  I hope they use some energy to save some energy because to date nothing much seems to be happening in that area.  Even within that Department one must question the use of imported fuels and ask: &ldquo;Is there no other way in which we can conserve energy?&rdquo; In 1978 the bill for oil was £2 <Col N="428" /> million.  That figure is possibly £3 million by now.  There is no real policy.</P>
    <P>Small industries, not major industries, are building their own incinerators and burning their own refuse and, in the process, saving fuel and saving capital. That is private initiative working.  The Department of Energy seem to be paralysed and totally inactive.  I know a policy was presented to the then Minister for Health, now the Taoiseach, on fuel conservation in hospitals which would make a saving of the order of £2 million on oil costs by burning waste.  It seems to have fallen on deaf ears.  No notice seems to have been taken of it.  More developed and more sophisticated countries have a fuel conservation policy and they are not as dependent on imported fuel as we are.  We seem to be suffering from squander-mania and to have very little sense of responsibility about energy conservation.</P>
    <P>Is there any incentive for firms to conserve fuel?  I know there are grants.  Are there any sanctions on firms who will not conserve fuel?  In some countries, if an industry uses the same amount of energy as they used last year for the same unit output, a penalty clause is built in to a percentage of their fuel. They must reduce their fuel consumption per unit of cost or they are penalised.  We should look at areas like that.  The days of not caring much about fuel conservation because of low costs are long gone. They are gone for six years and we still have not adopted any policy in this area. Why?</P>
    <P>I put down a motion and got it passed in my local authority to have Ballymun, which is a vast complex, heated by burning waste.  This is nothing new.  It is not a revolutionary idea of mine.  It is done in England and all over the Continent.  It costs in excess of £1 million to heat that complex and the amount of oil which could be saved gives an indication of what could be done on a national basis if we were serious about energy conservation. Our competitiveness will depend on our ability to conserve fuel and to use it in the most efficient way.  If we continue to use it at its present high cost, we will <Col N="429" /> price ourselves out of markets very quickly.</P>
    <P>The effect of our oil imports on our balance of payments is very serious.  We cannot go on with a major deficit in our balance of payments.  This is an area we can do something about if we have the will to do it.  I would have thought that the Government, in the plight they are in, would be looking for areas like this. Then there is the question of district heating&mdash;heating whole areas of houses from central boilers and cutting consumption dramatically.  There is no lead from Government sources.  We should try to get the private builders involved. Despite the cost of fuel, people still want central heating whether from a back boiler, or using oil, or whatever. Whatever fuel we are using must be used to maximum advantage.  The ESB can play a major role in energy conservation. This is done in Germany, Denmark and Norway.  The concept of district heating is not new in those countries.  It is part of their whole economy and was even when fuel could be purchased at low cost. Now more than ever, we will have to consider that type of approach.</P>
    <P>The employment premium scheme was very important in certain industries and kept them going.  It played a very effective role and it now appears to be ending.  This could have&mdash;I hope it will not&mdash;very serious effects on industry. Because of competition and for many other reasons, certain industries are finding it hard to be viable.  This scheme should never be abandoned.  It should not be a hand-out or a benefit and it should be tailored from time to time.  It should be used, whether sparingly or otherwise, to create or protect jobs particularly in the clothing industry.  Many of these industries are labour intensive and, if they go to the wall, this will involve relatively high unemployment, and the cost of replacing those jobs will be tremendously high.</P>
    <P>An increased contribution by employers to the PRSI scheme was announced. We must ask ourselves are we serious about encouraging employers to take on additional workers.  More and <Col N="430" /> more we are making it harder and harder for employers to take them on, because the cost is becoming prohibitive.  This is a very serious area.  The Government have a grave responsibility to ensure that the employment we have is maintained and that we are not seen to be putting additional burdens on employers, thus preventing them from employing additional workers.  I will not detain the House any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly about some items in the budget. First, in general terms, I should like to say something about certain functions of the budget.  We all know that a budget is necessary to regulate and readjust the economy and further to appraise the general concourse of fiscal matters, immediate, past, proximate and, in the longer term, to take cognisance of various trends and identify them, and not alone identify them but earmark them, to curb and slow down unhealthy growths within the economy and to stimulate others that would bring benefit to the economy.  Another function of the budget would be to embark immediately on a course of action to pursue real advancement in the community towards proper development and social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many factors, mostly external, have contributed to a rise in Exchequer borrowing.  This cannot be sustained and it would not be proper to attempt to sustain it.  As a people, we must cut the cloth more to measure and by determination and effort, coupled with careful and skilful management of the economy&mdash;which fortunately we have&mdash;we must bring our fiscal situation under control.  We must appreciate that deficits are not a 12 months phenomenon, not a once-off wonder, but that rather that they factually remain within the accounting system and at some stage required taxation to continually finance them.  We must tailor our cloth to measure.  The simple maxim would be that today's people cannot live on tomorrow's people's toil nor can to-day's gratification be at the expense of tomorrow's misery.  Public finance must be kept in reasonable balance so as to <Col N="431" /> improve the position of poorer sections of the community and not to negative investment growth or hinder employment.</P>
    <P>The present budget is realistic in that when scrutinised it measures up to these criteria.  Here, I consolidate my argument by welcoming the recent announcement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the IDA of over 400 jobs for the Bray area and the £5 million investment also recently announced. This is a clear example of confidence if we have people willing to continue this level of investment, which is not solely in the new industry category but is in a mixed category.  It involves new industry, traditional industry and also the family business.  My understanding is that there would be further investment and industry in the north Wicklow area, if land for such a purpose were available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien was really muddled as to whether he was speaking in terms of road transportation or rail transportation. My belief is that there is provision in the Estimate and there is Government commitment to the rapid rail system from Bray to Howth.  The Deputy was more than pessimistic in suggesting that there was no commitment.  I assure him that there is.  Also, in the Bray area I am pleased to say that we are aware of a mobile 1,000-line telephone exchange coming in.  That is much needed.  Also proposed is the transfer of 260 lines from the Bray to the Shankill exchange.  This is an investment in the community and shows confidence in the community.  I am pleased to welcome the new arrangements made by the Taoiseach in his recent very successful talks in Paris.  We hope that this telephone deal will get under way very quickly.</P>
    <P>I have read or heard many speeches relating to the budget from the Opposition. I use the term generously when I say &ldquo;relating to&rdquo; the budget or budgetary proposals.  Many of the speeches appear to me to smack of star trekking or crystal gazing.  This evening, Deputy O'Brien introduced election speculation, the latest unspecified opinion <Col N="432" /> poll.  He got involved in the percentage points inflation syndrome. He made sweeping statements and use of the ponderous adjectives of crisis.  &ldquo;Serious&rdquo; crops up eight times in the space of four minutes.  This was an endeavour to portray Dublin as the Dublin of &ldquo;Strumpet City&rdquo;.  It seems to me that there is a competition for some kind of medal on the Opposition benches to find who will manage to debase our community and our country.  It also seems as if &ldquo;Roget's Thesaurus&rdquo; has been turned over repeatedly in the search for the collection of synonyms and adjectives which will create this climate. Deputy O'Brien did raise his speech at one stage to a positive level but he must have realised that he was losing ground in this competition and he fell back into the quagmire in search of his medal. Perhaps the next Fine Gael speaker will tell us if there is such a competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The competition seems very much on your side.  &ldquo;Roget's Thesaurus&rdquo; must really have been in use and Deputies must have been looking at the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;.  Apparently, they did not reach the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; as they had to repeat it time and again.  When they open their book tomorrow and look at the various adjectives there for it, they will perhaps move into that sphere.  I hope that I am not helping any Deputy in his efforts to win this medal but, fair play to them, if there is a competition and if the leader of the Opposition is to announce the winner of this infamous competition, we can wait.  Perhaps we on this side of the House could announce the winner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much speculation in what is supposed to be an appreciation or examination of budgetary proposals. We look at the reality of our situation. We are not a self-contained or selfsufficient economy, unfortunately, but rather an open and developing economy, vulnerable and facing many challenges. The budget offers a firm basis for the <Col N="433" /> community to tackle some of these challenges.</P>
    <P>The challenge of oil costs which amount to £800 million must be tackled. It is my hope that the increase in the price of petrol imposed in the budget will bring about the necessary and vital conserving effect.  People acknowledge and appreciate the harsh leveller which this £800 million bill is.  It is not sufficient to appreciate this as a leveller.  There is a duty on a government and on a community to tackle such a problem.  A government must introduce a measure, such as that in the budget, in order to curb the use of petrol thereby conserving fuel and leading to a better balance in our fiscal affairs.</P>
    <P>A further challenge is the necessity to move towards taxation equity.  I welcome the decision announced by the Minister for Finance to set up a commission to look into the question of taxation. That decision indicates that while a major advance on PAYE has been achieved more remains to be done before we reach a fair and equitable tax system.  I wish the commission well in their deliberations and I trust that speedy recommendations will ensure.  I should now like to deal with an issue on which I have received a lot of representations, the question of unearned income.  That matter is very hurtful and causes genuine discontent, even anger, amongst certain people.  They are annoyed when they see part of their investment strategy and savings in the form of superannuation contributions over many years being classified as unearned income and made liable to a certain taxation rate.  I have confidence that the commission will deal sympathetically with this issue.</P>
    <P>The budget will ensure an increase in take-home pay for the PAYE sector and it clearly represents a move from direct to indirect taxation.  That is a good thing. It is only proper that people should be left with the majority of their earnings. They should have a discretion as to how they spend their earnings.  The system of moving from direct to indirect taxation allows for two spending elements.  It allows a discretionary element in relation <Col N="434" /> to expenditure on drink, tobacco and some fuel, and the non-discretionary element relates to the essential commuting to work.  The increase in take-home pay following the concession in the budget will more than compensate for the non-discretionary element I mentioned.  We must consider the effect in villages and towns that an increase in take-home pay for workers will have.  More money will be circulating within the social structures of those communities.  It is a nice compliment to the implemented policy on rates abolition on domestic properties to say that people were left with a lot more money in their pockets rather than having to pay it over at some counter.  That money was spent within the local community. In many cases the abolition of rates meant that people had an extra £5 per week to spend.  After this budget many PAYE workers will have an extra £5 or £6 per week to spend.  If that money is spent locally it ought to lead to improvements in that area.  Some Deputies might consider that an insignificant amount but it is a factor that must be considered.</P>

      <P>I should now like to deal with the extra money which the lower income group will receive as a result of improvements in the social welfare code.  We all welcome the 25 per cent increase in long-term benefits and the 20 per cent increase in short-term benefits.  Fianna Fáil recognise the importance of the family within the community and, accordingly, have substantially increased children's allowances. The £3.50 rate is being increased to £4.50 and the £5.50 rate goes up to £7. <Col N="435" /> Speakers have glossed over that and the fact that people have taken it for granted is an indication of the confidence they have in Fianna Fáil to look after the less well-off people in our community.  The budget also recognises the vital part and involvement of the less privileged and handicapped in our community.</P>
      <P>The measures relating to taxation of farmers do not greatly deviate from the proposals put forward last year.  In the great climate of uncertainty which surrounds farming at present&mdash;much of this is caused by activated ideas and suggestions from the EEC&mdash;there is a lot of worry.  However, it is important that we highlight a static measure in the budget, the retention, for a three-year period at least, of the lower £40 limit.  I want to stress that because I am aware of the variables, the influences, speculations and anxieties that exist in relation to this matter within the farming community. Linking the issue of the resource tax with the fundamental fact that the accounts system will not be fully effective this year I am pleased that the Taoiseach has given a guarantee that the resource tax is a short-term expedient and is not intended to be a permanent feature of the system.  The aim must be for a fair and equitable system of taxation for all the community.  I recognise that various interest groups must play certain roles but I urge everybody to co-operate in tackling the present and evolving issues.  I am confident that the proposals in the budget are tailored to our needs.</P>

I would hope people in their deliberations, in their assessment of the budgetary proposals, will disengage themselves from this race which is apparent on the Opposition benches, that Roget's Thesaurus will be left back on the shelf and that they will not start looking for the synonyms that have been sought and that there will be an effort made to contribute positively across the floor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure Deputy Murphy that there is no competition on this side of the House at all.  It would be our view that we have had adequate competition in political parties, particularly on the opposite side of the House, to suffice for a number of years. If we had had less competition and more attention to national concern and to national welfare over the last two years perhaps this budget would not be depicting the kind of picture that it is depicting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is treated seriously by us although I would like to express a personal view at the outset.  I question the wisdom of the efficacy of such a debate. It is hard to be convinced that anything we say will have a great deal of impact on the Government.  One gets the feeling that parliament is being debased to a significant degree by a debate which seems to be very much along the lines of discussing something which seems to have been essentially rubber stamped.  Is <Col N="437" /> it conceivable that we might have any changes in budgetary strategy or in budgetary detail arising out of contributions which are seriously made by speakers on both sides of the House?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister for Finance in governments now and hopefully in the future to consider this Dáil as a way of gaining insight into the concerns, anxieties, criticisms and feelings of the ordinary man in the street so that we could benefit from such an input. At 8 o'clock on a Thursday evening I feel a little bit like someone who is to some extent substantially going through the motions of a debate which I do not have a great deal of confidence in in terms of its impact on anybody.  It is our duty to say clearly that if we are going to continue with this kind of debate, arid and barren, probably having no effect whatsoever except filling in the time, reminiscent of the work of playwrights like Beckett or people like that, with a nihilistic view of the whole thing&mdash;which I have&mdash;I think we will find that people will eventually lose total credence and total confidence in this parliamentary system.</P>
    <P>Certainly many of us, and particularly young people, do not believe that this Dáil is as relevant as it should be or occupies as central a part of the arena in public life as it should.  This is an example of it.  This debate will play itself out of its end and we will go on to something else.  I wonder if there is any serious consideration given by anybody to anything that is said here?  But perhaps I am unduly pessimistic.  There were changes last year but unfortunately they emanated from lobbies and parties outside the House.  The farming community certainly brought significant changes to budgetary strategy.  Perhaps changes will emanate again from outside bodies.  The farmers show every sign of repeating last year's performance.  It would be better still if changes emanated from responsible spokesmen and from Members of this House who are concerned about national affairs.  So the very wisdom of the budget debate in its present form is <Col N="438" /> something that we should consider.</P>
    <P>Obviously a budget such as this is not something that any member of the Opposition would wish to totally deride and pretend that there are not good elements in it.  But we should see the budget in a very fundamental way.  A budget is not merely a financial exercise, a question of accountancy and a question of balancing the books.  A budget is primarily and fundamentally a social statement, not a fiscal one.  It reveals nakedly and obviously the Government's thinking, the Government's philosophy on matters of social and economic policy; and the social policy is the fundamental one.  The economic policy is the natural growth of the thinking of a Government on its order of social priorities and on the manner in which the country's finances should be ordered to accord to a view of the way the country should be run.  If that is accurate&mdash;and I believe it to be not just accurate but in fact a cornerstone of budgetary policy&mdash;then we have in this budget, at this deep level, a very deficient budget.  In other words it is, and it is clearly seen to be, a reactionary budget in the literal sense of that word.</P>
    <P>It is not an economist's budget but an accountant's budget, a budget whose primary concern is to balance books and to stave off the lobby groups, to do the minimum necessary to accord to the dictates of the courts and in general to contain things so that we will emerge to live for another day.  I would like to think that a budget would be a statement by a Government in economic terms of its commitment to reform those areas of public life and, indeed, public law which need reform.  A budget therefore should be innovative, imaginative; it should have vision; it should be wise.  I do not see any of these quaities in the budget. These are the usual peripheral gestures to small groups and I will resist the temptation to say that they are largely designed for political purposes.</P>
    <P>I am talking about fundamental things like the idea of social justice.  I have heard much about the social benefits in the budget, which were increased by 25 per cent gross.  Can any member of the <Col N="439" /> Government deny that the 25 per cent was eroded long before the budget by the increases in the cost of living, particularly in the necessities of life, with which people in this category have to contend?  References to the CPI are not central in this respect.  There have been increases of astronomic proportions in basic foodstuffs, heating and lighting, compounded by the very revealing policy of the consistent dismantling of food subsidies by this Government, clearly showing that for the poor and the poorer there is little hope of the kind of social justice to which they are entitled. An increase of 25 per cent would be significant if it were accompanied by protective subsidies and certain guaranteed minimum standards, but it has been eroded by the continuous increases which have taken place, facilitated by a Government who neglected to keep the promise in their manifesto relating to the National Prices Commission and the need for stronger price controls.</P>
    <P>Already people appreciate that the budget is likely to be one of the most inflationary in our history.  Its major effect will be to send the cost of living soaring at a higher rate than heretofore.  Within days of the announcement of the magic increases in social welfare payments, the cost of a cylinder of gas commonly used in corporation flats and small houses was increased by a massive 77p.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with aspects of the budget which have not previously been mentioned or have not been dealt with adequately.  A change of emphasis is evident in a number of respects.  This is understandable when there has been a change in Government leadership but it cannot work two ways.  If last year's policies were right and this year's policies are different, something must have happened in the meantime to make the earlier policies redundant.  There is clearly the dropping of certain goals in, for example, the job creation area.  Does this mean that last year's targets were wrong or were not successful?  I see nothing wrong with such an admission. Above all people will respect truth, and <Col N="440" /> time and again it has not been given to them by politicians.  People are fed up with cynical double-talk.  The Government are pretending that things are still the same, but we know that not only the pack has been reshuffled.  There appears to be a rein on the massive borrowing which occurred until now&mdash;borrowing which was completely profligate and designed to deliver on promises made only for political expediency.  People now know that the confidence tricks played during the last general election must now be paid for.</P>
    <P>I am a bit old fashioned about the democratic process and believe that a Government need a new mandate if they decide to change economic policies, otherwise they are acting on a mandate which does not exist or which existed for some other reason.  This is not the budget which the former Taoiseach and his Cabinet would have introduced, nor is it the budget for which they were given a mandate.  There is to some extent an undemocratic aspect.</P>
    <P>The budget does not take a basic look at our finances and make a fresh start by admitting that the way things have been done in the past is not satisfactory.  I know there are heavy pressures on people in public life, and particularly on those in Government, which tend to depress the sense of idealism and commitment to social and political change. When a Government lose the feeling of wanting to change things they are superfluous.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any way of balancing day-to-day reaction&mdash;what we might loosely call &ldquo;crisis management&rdquo;&mdash;with the need to innovate and lead.  It is some time since people were given a lead by politicians and told that there are many things in Irish life which together we could change.  There does not have to be this inevitable, almost Pavlovian, opposition between Government and Opposition. There are ways in which we can co-operate and there is much greater scope for consensus in this House so that we can work for the benefit of all the people. I am mindful of a recent debate in <Col N="441" /> Private Members' time which could have been handled far better by the Government and perhaps there are aspects of the Opposition's affairs which could be better handled, given any hint that a consensus on certain issues would be forthcoming.  Such an approach would be respected.  People do not believe that 82 people on one side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would take issue with the Minister of State in that respect. Most of my constituents, for instance, do not earn more than £8,000 per year on average.  Neither do they live in large houses in respect of which the rates relief amounts to a saving of about £300.  In addition, a high percentage of the people in some areas of my constituency are unemployed and this means that they will not benefit in any way from the income tax relief.  There is not any social justice in that area and not a penny has been spent of the much trumpeted £1 million that was put aside for reforming it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was told that 12 <Col N="442" /> months ago.  The budget, though, will benefit the articulate and, dare I say so, the well-heeled because they are the group in society to whom, sadly, the Government consider themselves as having a primary obligation.  We will continue to have social injustice for as long as there is lack of courage to say to those who have that there are others who have very little even if those others are not organised.</P>
      <P>Another factor which is important and which should be reflected in the budget is the quality of life and it is a factor which does not cost money but there is no evidence of any zeal in this regard. This Government are the most non-reformist that we have ever had.  Their record of legislation since their return to office represents an appalling abdication of duty.  I cannot think of one piece of initiating legislation coming before the House since Fianna Fáil assumed office again.</P>

      <P>The question of the legislation before the House does not arise during this debate. Deputy Keating is in possession and should be allowed to continue without interruption but he must move away from dealing with Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Much more could be done by the Government to introduce standards of social justice and fair play. Such initiatives could be taken both in the budget and in other legislation. Therefore, I appeal to the Government to consider such initiatives, many of which would not be contentious politically but which would have the support, I am confident, of all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saddened at the way in which we structure our budgets, at our failure to ask fundamental questions.  What happens apparently in relation to Estimates for public services is that we take last year's figures and add to them a little if that is economically possible, judicially <Col N="443" /> imperative or politically attractive and we take away from somewhere else.  In other words, there is no fundamental approach. Do we ever get involved, for instance, in what is termed &ldquo;zero budgeting&rdquo; which is a question merely of going back to basics and asking ourselves if the relative ratios of expenditure in respect of the various Departments are any longer the right ones?  Why should we continue forever to spend roughly twice as much in one area as in another?  Should we, for example, give a much higher priority to education than is the case?  To say that there is a cut-back in education is to give only half the picture. There are those in the House who would say that education has been always the poor relation.  Of course, to give priority to education would require courageous decisions and tough public debate and the money would have to come from some other area but I should like to know who decides the order of priorities.  I ask this question because the Government's order of priorities this year is more or less the same as it was last year in terms of the allocation of expenditure. Indeed, that order is much the same as it was in the previous year and in the year before that.</P>
    <P>We should ask basic questions such as whether we get value for money from the time the first penny is spent and whether we should decide on a reformed order of priorities.  Should we say, for instance, that this year we will achieve a complete new frontier in health, education, social welfare or whatever and that, consequently, more money than ever before shall be spent in those areas on the obvious understanding that the extra expenditure must come from some other area?  But the situation is that much of the money is spent on the work of containing and maintaining services while very little account is taken of whether we are getting value from the money we spend.  There is substantial waste in terms of the budget and there is substantial waste in the public service.  It is not necessary to talk about the massive precipitation of people out of jobs.  I am <Col N="444" /> talking about motivating people, setting goals and targets in areas where none exists. I am talking about getting value from money and giving value to people's lives.  One of the major and growing problems in Irish governmental budgetary policy is the burgeoning public service which is threatening to destabilise our whole economic equation. Sooner or later this problem must be faced.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is an enormous amount of potential for good lying untapped in the public service.  There are people in the public service who are anxious to do good work but the reality is different.  It would seem that initiative in the public service is not only stymied but is sometimes penalised particularly if it goes wrong.  The major questions that are asked are ones such as, &ldquo;Is there precedence for this action?&rdquo; Ministers have been known to take refuge in that line also.  The result is that, instead of Government Departments operating to set goals and targets inspired by ideas of achieving these targets within a certain framework and within a certain time with the feeling among the people concerned that they were on some kind of national mission, there is a situation of reaction.</P>
    <P>If the attitude in any part of the public service is that it is immaterial whether a job is done today or tomorrow, money is being wasted but, worse, there is being wasted massive human potential. Therefore, one of the most challenging and exciting tasks that could be undertaken by the Government and reflected in the budget would be to set goals and targets for every area of Government so that each person would know what job he had to do, the period of time in which he should do it and the manner in which it was to be achieved.  Most members of the public service would respond magnificiently to such a challenge because for the first time they would have been asked to join with the respective Ministers in bringing this country somewhere.  The result of that would be that we would get better value for money though my concern fundamentally <Col N="445" /> relates more to the question of human wastage.  Also, we would have to spend in other areas money which is not now being expended.  In pure economic terms there are probably five main goals to be met by a budget.  We should take a brief look at whether or not these have been achieved.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell has received permission to raise on the adjournment the subject matter of question No. 14 on to-day's Order Paper dealing with the building of railway passenger carriages at the Inchicore Works, Dublin.  The Deputy has not more than 20 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to express my thanks to the Chair for allowing me the opportunity of raising on the adjournment this urgent, important very grave matter.  I note that the Minister for Transport is not present.  I understand he is absent abroad.  I accept that.  I note also that the Minister of State at the Department of Transport is not present.  I understand he has an engagement in his constituency, which I can understand also.  I hope their absence will not in any way diminish the seriousness or importance the Government attach to this question.  I am grateful to the Minister for Labour and his Minister of State for standing in on the subject.  I hope they will see to it that this question receives the serious and sympathetic attention it deserves.</P>
      <P>The question to which I am referring is that of the future of the CIE Works in Inchicore, Dublin.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport answered questions in this House to-day in what I would have to consider a most unsatisfactory manner.  That is why I sought permission to raise this matter on the adjournment this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> Major issues are involved in this question. The proposal by CIE is to dispose of at least one-third of their Inchicore Works to a German company known as Linke, Hoffman Busche.  At a glance that might sound a very reasonable proposition but it is a very serious one because of what went before it.  It would seem&mdash;and I hope I am wrong in this&mdash;that semi-State bodies are empowered, without reference to parliament, to dispose of some of their assets and to make basic policy decisions of that nature, to sell from public to private enterprise without any apparent political or parliamentary decision.  The reason this proposal is being viewed with such seriousness and alarm at Inchicore Works is because of what went before it. As somebody born and reared in Inchicore, whose parents were born and reared there, I suppose I am emotionally involved to some extent; not alone that, I speak also as one who has four brothers all of whom worked in CIE in Inchicore. Every family in Inchicore has some connection with CIE Works in one way or another.  In fact Inchicore was built around the CIE Works over the past 150 years.  There was nothing in Inchicore except farmland until the CIE railworks was built there and subsequenly the bus works about 150 years ago.</P>
    <P>In 1973 CIE disposed of the bus-building enterprise at Spa Road, Inchicore, to a company known as Van Hool McArdle.  I raised this question in the House this afternoon and, lo and behold, what are the headlines in the evening papers&mdash;the <i>Evening Herald:</i>&ldquo;CIE is sued for £2½ million&rdquo; and the <i>Evening Press:</i>&ldquo;CIE sued for £2.6 million by Van Hool McArdle&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not dwell on it.  It is in the Belgian courts, because Van Hool McArdle were principally a Belgian concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not; I shall accept the Chair's ruling.</P>
      <P>In 1973 the unions at Spa Road, Inchicore, came to an agreement with CIE, following negotiations, to dispose of the bus-building enterprise there to this Belgian private enterprise company called Van Hool McArdle.  From beginning to end that relationship was a disaster. It lasted for a few years and the end result was as follows: hundreds of skilled men were thrown out of work, incidentally, after continuous bad labour relations from the moment Van Hool McArdle took over.  CIE, as part of the guarantees they gave at the time of the take-over by Van Hool McArdle, offered employment to all those Van Hool McArdle employees who had previously been in the employment of CIE and, to be fair, CIE lived up to that commitment, to this extent, that they reemployed all the craftsmen in Inchicore Works at their new bus maintenance depot, which used to be in Spa Road.  I understand there are now about three times as many men in the bus maintenance depot as are needed.  Therefore, they are carrying, as a result of this fiasco, three times as many craftsmen as are needed.  Secondly, some of those craftsmen who were employed by Van Hool McArdle, subsequent to the disposal by CIE, were offered unskilled work.  Many of these skilled men are now carrying out unskilled work, in CIE and elsewhere, and some are still unemployed. In brief that is what happened to Van Hool McArdle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now CIE propose doing the same with the railway works.  For some years now no new rail coaches have been built at Inchicore Works, mainly because of lack of capital from their political masters; perhaps there are other reasons. Those coaches were always built at Inchicore and built very well indeed.  It is proposed now that the same thing happen with the railway works as happened <Col N="448" /> with the bus works, that it be disposed of to another continental private enterprise company, with more guarantees. Deputies may have read in the paper that strike notice has been given.  Strike notice has been deferred twice. Thankfully talks are going on between congress and the board of CIE in an endeavour to reach some sort of settlement. But I can tell the House that there is widespread fear and alarm in Inchicore that another Van Hool McArdle will be perpetrated on them.  It affects more than just those craftsmen, the latest in generations of craftsmen; it affects the entire population of Inchicore, some 15,000 people.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Labour to spell out categorically in the House this evening&mdash;on behalf of his colleague, the Minister for Transport &mdash;whether or not CIE are empowered to make this decision about Inchicore Works, or whether it will be a political decision; whether or not the Government will decide on the disposal of public enterprise assets.  That is the first thing I want made clear by the Minister this evening: will the Government&mdash;as indicated in the uncertain replies of the Minister of State in the House this afternoon&mdash;make the final decision in this regard and, if so, will they agree to meet a deputation from the workers and unions at Inchicore Works to discuss the full ins and outs of this question?  While the proposal is that approximately one-third of Inchicore Works be disposed of, there is widespread fear that the very disposal of that one-third will threaten another one-third dependent on the first, thereby threatening virtually the whole existence of Inchicore Works.  The population of Inchicore, and I who represent them, are not prepared to sit idly by and see this work force being destroyed.  We want a guarantee from the Government that the interests of the work force at Inchicore will be safeguarded and given more consideration than the work force at Spa Road.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one other aspect and I am reluctant to drag it in now.  In his reply to the question today <Col N="449" /> the Minister, Deputy Killilea, stated that CIE feel they have not the capacity themselves in regard to the type of new modern coaches that would be required for this sophisticated equipment.  He spoke about CIE not having at their disposal the skills and the capacity required. Where did Linke Hoffman Busche get the skills?  Where did Van Hool McArdle get them?  In Inchicore there is a trained work force.  The CIE proposal is to provide the coaches in Shannon&mdash;good luck to Shannon&mdash;where the workers will have to start from scratch and be trained.  I do not accept that Linke Hoffman Busche are able to get the skills required and that CIE are not.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument in regard to the propriety of transferring public enterprise assets to private enterprise.  I am a believer in a mixed economy and allowing private enterprise to have its say, but it is well known that private enterprise will not go into loss makers where public enterprise must operate if a social service, such as CIE provide, is to be given.  Naturally, Linke Hoffman Busche will not take over the losing part. They will take over the bit that is potentially profit-making.</P>
    <P>This does not make sense particularly in view of the willingness at all times of the Inchicore work force to adapt, to accept change, to learn new skills as they have done in the past 150 years. Therefore, I ask the Minister for Labour to convey to his colleague, the Minister for Transport, and to the Government the great distress this has given rise to in Inchicore and in surrounding districts.  I want the Minister to see that this will be raised at Cabinet level and that the interests of the Inchicore work force will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Ballyfermot is nearby and many of the Inchicore work force come from there. Newspapers in the past few weeks have been stating that Ballyfermot has the highest unemployment rate in the country. Are the Government to add further to this deprivation?  Will they treat it as Spa Road was treated?  I want a statement from the Minister that this will be <Col N="450" /> raised at Cabinet level so that the Government can meet a deputation of the Inchicore workers and their unions to discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to express regret at the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Transport.  The Minister of State has a commitment, not a constituency one as has been stated, to meet a group with much wider interests than his constituents.  I can assure the Deputy that their absence does not mean lack of Government concern in this respect.</P>
      <P>CIE in drawing up their proposals for mainline and suburban rolling stock requirements over the next decade developed a proposal for the establishment of a rail coach building industry at Inchicore.  While CIE in the past had manufactured railway carriages, they considered that the technology and design of present-day carriages was such that it would not be practical for CIE to manufacture them efficiently and economically.  In the light of this situation and to ensure the maximum employment content of the project CIE consulted a number of manufacturers with a view to having the carriages constructed in Ireland and they chose a German firm as being the most suitable.</P>
      <P>The setting up of a coach building industry in Ireland would be dependent on the level of orders for rolling stock from CIE.  While a decision has been taken by the Government, at a cost of £46 million, on the electrification of the Howth-Bray line, including the provision of new rolling stock, no decision has been taken yet on CIE's proposals for mainline coaches or for a Rail Rapid Transit System for the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>A decision in these matters will depend on the outcome of the report of the Transport Consultative Commission on passenger transport in the Dublin area, which is expected shortly, and on the study of CIE which is being carried out with the aid of a firm of management consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, therefore, it is not possible to say how CIE's rolling stock requirements <Col N="451" /> will be met, whether by the establishment of the proposed coach building industry or otherwise.  However, the Minister is taking steps to ensure that these inter-related matters will be dealt with as quickly as possible.  I have taken note of the observations made by the Deputy and these will be fully considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as having said:</P>
    <P>The Commission will shortly be presenting its report to me.  As soon as <Col N="452" /> I receive this report I will be determining my strategy for action in this area. At this stage, I have an open mind on the issues involved and I am not excluding any options.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that a decision has not been made on the CIE proposal and, therefore, no commitment has been given.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 March 1980.</P>

In accordance with the recent budgetary proposals the statutory limit for entitlement to the allowance is being raised from 3 April which will result in an entitlement to a reduced weekly allowance in this case.

      <P>This is an application for registration under section 49 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964&mdash;registration of title acquired by long possession.  It was received in the Land Registry on 11 February 1980. The processing of any such application must necessarily take some time and in this particular case certain queries had to be raised and were issued to the solicitors on 29 February 1980.  No reply has been received to date.  Accordingly the suggestion that there has been delay in the case in the Land Registry is not justified.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the attached statement.</P>
      <P>The figures included for receipts by way of grants and subsidies represent the amounts of money actually received under the various headings during the years in question.  They differ from the figures published in Annex II to the six-monthly Reports to the Oireachtas on Developments in the European Communities which represent the amounts of grants and subsidies approved.  This is because there is normally a time-lag between the approval of grants and the date of their payment, with the result that receipts from the Community to date have been less than the amount of grants approved.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question relates to the total indebtedness of State-sponsored commercial and industrial companies and statutory boards.  As at end-December 1979 this figure has been estimated to be of the order of £1,575 million.  In the absence of comparable audited accounts and given the different accounting periods used by these bodies it is not possible to provide a firm figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The exchange of foreign currency by banks and duty-free shops is not governed by specific EEC legislation.  In reply to a recent question in the European Parliament, the Commissioner pointed out that they have no authority to force exchange of currencies by <Col N="336" /> private banks or acceptance of payments in currencies other than the domestic currency of the member state concerned. They indicated, further, that they were prepared to take the question up with the Committee of Credit Associations of the European Community, in which the European federations of banks and other credit institutions are represented.  The full text of this reply was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities No. C 310/14 of 10 February 1980.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I do not consider that a protest to the EEC would serve any useful purpose.  I am having inquiries made, however, about the Commission's approach to the Committee of Credit Institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank of Ireland, as the authority responsible for matters relating to the currency, are monitoring the situation regarding the exchange of Irish currency abroad to ensure its widest possible acceptance.  For example, specimens of the legal tender notes have been sent to central banks and to banks at several airports abroad.  However, a bank will take into account the cost to it of holding Irish currency.  Unless a foreign bank or bureau de change has a matching turnover in Irish notes, which depends on location, these notes can only be disposed of by repatriation to this country, which involves postage and insurance.  For this reason some foreign banks and bureaux de change may quote an unfavourable rate for Irish notes or <Col N="337" /> may refuse to encash them.  The same problem affects other currencies apart from the major international ones. Finally, I should mention that under the Exchange Control Regulations, Irish residents may take only up to IR£100 in cash abroad without special exchange control permission.  This £100 may not include legal tender notes of over £20 denomination.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded a widow's non-contributory pension at a reduced rate, with effect from 16 April 1979, on the basis of the means assessed on the value of a holding of land and capital in the bank.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the decision and, in accordance with the normal practice in such cases, her means were reinvestigated before the papers were referred to an appeals officer for determination. The appeals officer has now decided that she is entitled to an increased rate of pension from 5 October 1979.  A pension order book at the revised rate has been issued to the designated post office for collection by her and a payable order in respect of the adjustment due to her from October 1979 to date has been issued direct to her.</P>

    <P>The widow is not entitled to a pension at the maximum rate as her present means, derived from her holding and the <Col N="357" /> balance of her capital, are still in excess of the statutory limit for the payment of non-contributory pension at the maximum rate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's representations on behalf of the person concerned were considered by me and a reply was issued on 19 February last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that under the provisions of the unemployment assistance scheme a person is assessed with means derived from any holding of which he is the beneficial occupier.  The reports of the investigating officer who examined this case indicate that the person concerned is the beneficial occupier of two holdings with a total land valuation of £10.90.  As he resides in a specified area, <Col N="358" /> his means from land are assessed on a notional basis of fifty times the land valuation which in this case is £545 a year or £10.50 weekly.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance is £16.80 a week&mdash;£27.30 less £10.50 means&mdash; which is the maximum rate applicable to a married man with two qualified children in a rural area whose land valuation is between £10.00 and £15.00.</P>
    <P>If he wishes to appeal against this assessment of means, he may obtain a form for this purpose at his local office. He may also opt to have his means factually assessed if he feels that the notional method of assessment overstates the true level of his income.</P>

      <P>The office has not been closed to the public.  However, in order to enable staff there to overtake a backlog of work created by a temporary staffing shortage due to recruitment problems, and by an increase in the rate of applications for telephones, the Department by newspaper advertisement on 18 February asked the public to refrain for the time being from making inquiries on non-urgent matters.  The need for this restraint is expected to continue for at least a further few weeks.</P>
