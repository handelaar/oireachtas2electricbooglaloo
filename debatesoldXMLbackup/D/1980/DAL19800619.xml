      <P>I want to thank the Chair for his courtesy in looking further into the question of the <i>sub judice</i> ruling on the Rent Restrictions Act and for the prompt reply to me.  I have to say that I am not satisfied with the position where the Dáil cannot consider a matter of this kind in view of the threats currently being made to tenants.  I will have the matter taken up with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for urgent review in order to enable the Dáil to do its work, as it must do in the interests of the people.</P>

      <P>Cúis mhórshásaimh dom an Bille seo a chur os comhair an Tí os rud é go rachaidh sé chun sochair do bhaintreacha daoine a raibh liúntas speisialta acu agus cuirfidh ábhar an Bhille cúnamh breise ar fáil do bhaintreacha shaighdiúirí.  Táim cinnte go nglacfaidh Teachtaí go fábharach leis.  Tá foráil freisin sa Bhille chun iarrataistí a ghlacadh a dhiúltaíodh roimhe sin toisc iad a bheith déanach.</P>
      <P>Tugann an Bille seo cúnamh breise do bhaintreacha na Sean-Óglaigh a ghlac páirt i gCogadh na Saoirse.  Don chéad uair riamh, tá liúntais á dtabhairt do bhaintreacha na ndaoine a raibh liúntais speisialta á n-íoc dóibh.</P>

Cuireadh liúntas do bhaintreacha pinsinéirí seirbhíse míleata ar fáil san Acht Arm Phinsean 1971 agus molann an Bille seo liúntas de £185 sa bhliain a íoc le baintreacha daoine a raibh liúntas speisialta acu.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the widows of special allowance holders as announced in the 1980 budget statement and to improve the allowances payable to the widows and children of military personnel who are killed in the course of their duty or who die from a wound attributable to service within four years of being wounded.  It also contains a regulation-making provision and proposes an extension of the time limit in certain circumstances for accepting applications for disablement pensions and allowances.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the payment of a flat-rate allowance of £185 a year effective from 1 July 1980 to the widow of a person who dies while in receipt of a special allowance.  It also comprehends the widows of persons whose application for a special allowance was being processed or whose special allowance was being reviewed and who, but for dying, would have satisfied the statutory conditions for the grant or further grant of a special allowance.  There are also a number whose special allowance was terminated in the past because their means exceeded the appropriate annual sum prescribed in the Army Pensions Acts.  To bring the widows of such former special allowance holders within the ambit of the section, I propose to grant the allowance of £185 a year to them if their means do not equal or exceed the current appropriate annual sum prescribed for the grant of a special allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> When a special allowance holder dies and probate or letters of administration show that there has been non-disclosure of means on the part of the deceased, an overpayment of special allowance may have arisen.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for recovery.  Nowadays any overpayment that comes to light can usually be met from other moneys which are payable by the Department. Nevertheless as the new allowance may be said to flow from the special allowance, it is necessary to make provision as in section 3.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of a special allowance could also be in receipt of a military service pension under the Military Service Pensions Acts or a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts.  Provision already exists in the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1973, for the payment of an allowance to the widow of a military service pensioner or, subject to certain conditions, to the widow of a person who died while in receipt of a disability pension.  The current amount of any allowance in either of these cases is greater than the flat-rate allowance being provided for in this Bill. Where the higher allowances are payable, section 4 of the Bill provides that the new allowance will not apply.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of section 13 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, the new allowance will be disregarded as means for the purposes of the Social Welfare Acts.  Accordingly the new allowance will be paid in addition to any pension or allowance payable under those Acts.</P>
    <P>I might mention that as a corollary to the introduction of the new allowance, I am arranging that, effective from 1 July 1980, the minimum rate of special allowance will be £185 a year.  This increase is not provided for in this Bill as it is not necessary to do so; the required statutory provision can be made by way of regulations which will be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that if an officer or a soldier is killed in the course of his duty or in circumstances attributable to his service, or dies from a <Col N="1139" /> wound attributable to service and within four years of receiving the wound, his widow and childern will be eligible for the following benefits: Widow&mdash;50 per cent of the deceased's annual pay; Each eligible child&mdash;If the mother is alive, 13? per cent of the deceased's annual pay; If the mother is dead, 26? per cent of the deceased's annual pay subject to a maximum of 40 per cent on behalf of the childern.</P>
    <P>Under this provision if an officer or a soldier dies in the circumstances mentioned, leaving a widow and three children, the allowances payable would amount to 90 per cent of his annual pay. To complete the picture I should say that provision already exists for the payment of certain gratuities over and above the allowances being provided for in this section.  The section also applies to the new allowances certain general sections of earlier Army Pensions Acts and makes the effective date 1 March 1975.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should explain that the section relates to personnel killed or wounded whether at home or abroad.  It is I think a very valuable and worthwhile provision, and while the loss of a husband and father is an irreparable one we should try as far as possible to ensure that the widow and children are provided for.  Any widow whose husband died in the circumstances specified in the section will get the benefit of the new allowances irrespective of the date of death of the husband.  Therefore, a widow to whom the section applies, whose husband was killed at any time before 1975, will be given the benefit of the enhanced benefits from 1 March 1975.  She will already have been in receipt of allowances under the provisions of the Army Pensions Act, 1927, as modified over the years, and the increased allowances now proposed will be applied to her automatically as the Department will already be in posession of the relevant particulars.</P>
    <P>As regards section 6 the position is that a number of cases have arisen where persons who applied for benefits under the Army Pensions Acts in the past were refused because their applications <Col N="1140" /> were not made within the statutory time limit required by the Acts.  I propose to give all such persons an opportunity of renewing their applications within a period of twelve months after the enactment of the Bill, and section 6 provides accordingly.  If Deputies are aware of any such cases I should be glad to hear from them.  The new provision will be publicised by my Department and every effort will be made to identify all relevant cases.  I should perhaps mention that the section does not apply to the review of existing awards which is provided for in the Army Pensions Act, 1973, or to cases which failed other than on the ground that the applicant was late in applying.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a regulation-making provision.  Provision already exists in the Army Pensions Acts&mdash;in section 7 of the 1968 Act&mdash;for the making of regulations under the Acts, but that provision is confined to increases where such increases form part of general increases in the public service.  This section is designed to give greater flexibility by permitting other modifications.  At present even a routine amendment, for example to extend a time limit, requires an amending Bill.  This procedure, which takes up the time of the House, has been commented on by Deputies in the past, and may entail lengthy delays for people who are awaiting benefits.  The House will still be able to keep a watch on matters through the operation of the provision requiring regulations to be laid before it with power to annul them.</P>
    <P>When a disablement pensioner, whose degree of disability is fifty per cent or more, dies, his widow and children are automatically entitled to allowances under section 3 of the Army Pensions Act, 1968 irrespective of the cause of death. Under subsection (4) of that section applications for such allowances must be made within 12 months after the date of death of the deceased.  As the award of allowances in such cases is automatic and does not require any investigation as to the attributability of death to military service, I am satisfied no useful purpose is served by retaining a time limit for applications <Col N="1141" /> in these cases.  Section 7 of the Bill repeals this time limit with effect from the passing of the 1968 Act, on 11 June 1968.  I trust my remarks, coupled with the explanatory memorandum have made the provisions of the Bill clear to Deputies.  I recommend the Bill for the favourable consideration of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy enactment.  The concessions mentioned in the Bill are long overdue. The time limit of four years should be dropped altogether in relation to people who have made an immense contribution to the State.  It would be much more generous to just leave it that where a death is attributable to a wound or injury received in the course of service to the nation, the award would be made. We are talking about the widows and young children of people serving in the Army or Defence Forces.  At the moment, if a person dies four years and a day after he has received the wound his widow and children would be disqualified from the concessions in the Bill. Will the Minister look at this aspect and consider dropping the four years from the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said during the course of the Estimate, the vast majority of us do not appreciate the contribution our armed forces are making not just to the nation but to the preservation of world peace. Having regard to their immense contribution towards world peace the UN and other major powers should also play a role.  In trouble spots throughout the world Irish soldiers are keeping great powers apart.  Particularly in recent events we have seen how members of our forces have made the supreme sacrifice and have lost their lives in the service of world peace.  The sooner we realise the sacrifice made by our Defence Forces in the Congo, in Cyprus and in the Lebanon in the preservation of peace, in preventing a major powers confrontation which could mean the end of civilisation, the better.  It is accepted by parliamentarians throughout the world that in their efficiency, their dedication to duties and in their <Col N="1142" /> tolerance our forces are second to none. The UN and the major powers have a role to play, and as well as the concessions given in this Bill I feel they should give something in addition, such as educational opportunities for the children of the Army personnel who have lost their lives in the service of this noble cause.  The goodwill will be there and the Government could use their position to alert the UN and the powers I have mentioned to this aspect of their contribution to these people who made such a supreme sacrifice.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider making posthumous awards to the widows or families of soldiers who have lost their lives.  It would be treasured by such families and would be a recognition of the sacrifice which their dear ones made to the State and to the world.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that in this Bill.  It is something that would be appreciated by the widows and families concerned and particularly the children who would grow up in admiration of the cause in which their father died.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concession for widows of those who were in receipt of special allowances.  In this respect we have been very niggardly in the past.  We introduced rigid means tests for the families of those who fought for freedom.  Each year they became fewer and fewer, and we should eliminate any form of means tests for widows of people who were in receipt of special allowances. I welcome the time extension for application for such allowances.  We should be in a position to say that people are entitled to an allowance or they are not, and we should not put barriers of that kind in their way.  We legislate in the House to give effect to concessions of that kind and we will not be remembered as being very generous.  Having made the concessions we should not impose artificial barriers in relation to time.  We are noted for that kind of procedure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill at this time when some of our army personnel have lost their lives in the Lebanon.  I put down a question in relation to the widow of one of them.  I was glad that the Minister for <Col N="1143" /> Foreign Affairs, in the absence of the Minister for Defence, gave assurances which did not make the Minister out to be the big bad wolf as was published in some papers to which I have drawn the Minister's attention.  I would be horrified if I thought there was anything of that kind.  I am glad the statement made was wrong and that the Minister took the opportunity to correct it.  I wish the Bill a speedy enactment and hope that once it becomes law there will be no delay in processing applications made under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill are to be welcomed in so far as they begin to eliminate one of the injustices which operate against army personnel. Soldiers who die in the course of duty or from injuries received during the course of duty must have a special place in our legislation.  The Dáil must accept that we have an obligation to the widows and children of soldiers.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill seeks to give effect to that obligation by giving 50 per cent of the soldier's salary to his widow and 13½ per cent to each child, up to a maximum of 40 per cent for the children. A widow with three or more children will receive 90 per cent of her husband's salary.  However, we disagree with the provision that the 40 per cent limit should apply also to children whose mother is dead.  This is discrimination. They should be entitled to 90 per cent. They are orphans because of their father's service to the State, and why should they be charges on the social welfare system?  We also regard it as discrimination against the children that their entitlement ceases if their mother remarries.  They still remain the children of the deceased soldier and the State should continue to honour its obligations to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the provisions of section 6 which extends the time limit in which to claim the pension by a period of 12 months after the passage of this Bill.  I am delighted that Deputy Ryan, a member of our party, was responsible for highlighting this.  As a result of a delay in application a dependant was <Col N="1144" /> disqualified until such time as he highlighted the case.  The dependants of all soldiers who die in the course of duty should be notified of their rights.  Far too often Bills go through the House and the Minister and Opposition speakers might know about them but other than that they appear to be a huge military secret and people do not know anything about their entitlement or rights.  For that reason they could be disqualified, for example, due to a delay in applying for benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to advertise this section of the Bill extensively.  Like Deputy Creed I find that far too often we have time limits.  They can be very dangerous and deny to dependants a right to be cared for by the State.  It would be a grave injustice to say that because a person died from his injuries after four years and one day, for the sake of 24 hours people who would be entitled to a benefit would be denied it.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this and try, if he cannot remove the time limit, at least to extend it for a longer period.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why if the widow of a pensioner remarries the children are denied the pension which is their entitlement. There is a considerable reduction in income from 90 per cent to 40 per cent.  Such children are the children of the soldier, and if the mother remarries, which she is entitled to do, the children should not be disqualified from receiving their allocation of the pension.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider that. In my view the widow of a pensioner who remarries should not automatically lose her entitlement. There should be a continuation of the allowance for 12 months or at least six months.  The fact that a widow is automatically disqualified on remarriage is unjust.  From my reading of the Bill children are also excluded on the widow's remarriage.  As children of the pensioner they should not be victimised.  I should like the Minister to explain section 5 (2) which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> A widow, who is entitled to an allowance under this section, shall be paid an amount equal to one-half of her husband's annual pay at the date of his death or discharge and every child who is entitled to such an allowance shall be paid an amount equal to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if his mother is alive, 13? per cent of his father's annual pay at the date of his death or discharge,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(b)  if his mother is dead, 26? per cent of his father's annual pay at the date of his death or discharge:</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the 26? per cent allowance is because of a lesser number than three in a family?  Is that allowance brought up to 40 per cent in the case of three children?  I should like to know if the 26? per cent allowance applies in the case of a one-child family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed and I am glad to see that they obviously share my view that it is a worthwhile measure.  The most significant provisions contain benefits for widows.  For the first time widows of special allowance holders are being provided for under the Bill.  That is in accordance with the statement in the budget in February last.  As I gleaned from statements by Opposition speakers they regard that as a welcome development. I should like to repeat that the allowance will be disregarded in the calculation of means for the purpose of old age pensions and widows' pensions under the Social Welfare Acts and will, therefore, be additional to any payments under those Acts.  Deputy Creed referred to the limit of four years, and I should <Col N="1146" /> like to tell him that we feel it necessary to have some time limit because it could prove difficult to link the death of a former member of the Defence Forces with the wound which it is claimed was the cause of his death.  It would be difficult to establish attributability if the time limit were done away with.</P>
      <P>The same argument applies in relation to time limits generally.  It can be to the benefit of the applicant that there should be a time limit because if that were not so, the matter could be delayed by the individual concerned before applying and it would not be possible to prove in some instances that death occurred because of the injury received.  If the Bill is agreed it will be possible to extend that time limit by regulation in the future.  It would be to the advantage of the persons concerned if they recognised that it is necessary to make the application as quickly as possible.  I agree with what Deputy Creed said about the exceptional contribution made by the Defence Forces to peace-keeping at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lipper asked if we were taking sufficient steps to ensure that all those entitled to the new allowance would get it.  I can assure the Deputy that every possible step will be taken to ensure that.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the children's allowance will continue even in the event of the widow remarrying.  With regard to the Deputy's query in relation to section 5 (2) I should like to tell him that a smaller family in the event of the death of the mother would benefit to a greater degree.  The question of a means test, raised by Deputy Creed, has been mentioned on many occasions before, and I should like to repeat that at present it is far from severe.  It has been relaxed on a number of occasions over the years.  For example, the social welfare benefits are largely disregarded and the annual budgetary increases in those benefits are ignored. The means test is essential to ensure that the maximum allowance can be paid to those who are in the greatest need.  I thank the Deputies sincerely for their contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, unless we give all Stages to the Minister now it is possible that it could be the autumn before the Bill would become law and I want it to become law as soon as possible but it is not good enough for the Minister to say that it can be altered by regulation.  Those of us with experience in that regard know that we will be told that there is no accommodation in the Act to provide for an allowance of this sort once a person lives four years and a day after receiving the injury or wound.  Surely it must be within the capacity of the doctors to say whether or not death was caused prematurely as a result of the wound or injury sustained in the cause of duty.  When you establish a four-year limit you are helping the widows of those people who meet their death as a result of injuries or wounds but you make it very difficult for the widows of those people who do not die within the specified time.  I ask the Minister to look at this again.  If he cannot eliminate it, the limit could be extended even to ten years because the question here is whether or not death is attributable to an injury or wound received in the course of duty.  It does not matter whether it is four years or ten years.  If that injury was the cause of the person's death and was received in the course of duty, the allowance or award should be given regardless of whether it is four years and a day or 20 years and a day.  If the injury received was a contributory factor to the person's death, there should be no time limit.</P>

      <P>One of the major problems could relate to medical evidence.  In the investigation of this type of case the problem is that the longer it goes the more difficult it is to link up with the original injury.  I shall have a look at this in the context of the regulations.</P>

Surely in the certification of death they must be able to say whether an injury or wound received in the course of duty contributed to the death of the person concerned.

    <Title>Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1980: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1980 which I made on 23 May 1980 under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>This order extends for a further six months the currency of a statutory ban on the operation of new company-owned motor spirit stations by oil companies, created by the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972.  That order, as amended, is due to expire on 18 July 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> The 1972 order was made following an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, requested by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1970, into the growth of the number of retail outlets directly operated by the petrol companies. In its report of the inquiry the commission argued that the growth of the control by the oil companies over the retail market needed to be halted for a time in the public interest as it felt that this development would lead to dominance over the retail market by the oil companies and increase the risk of such restrictive practices as price fixing and market-sharing.  The 1972 order halted this development for a trial period of three years.  It was reviewed by the commission in 1975 and on their recommendation extended for another three years until the summer of 1978.</P>
    <P>During that review the commission also received representations on matters relevant to the orders which their terms of reference did not allow them to consider. The commission had suggested, accordingly, that when they next reviewed the ban they should also review the other aspects of the orders relating to the motor spirit trade.  I decided, therefore, to ask the commission to hold an inquiry into the operation of the orders as a whole, into any matters germane to the operation of those orders and also into the conditions which obtain in regard to the agreements under which stations, which are company-owned but not company-run, are operated.  This latter aspect was included because I was anxious that concern expressed by, and on behalf of, persons who were operating company stations without the security afforded by employee or tenant status should be thoroughly explored.  Pending the receipt of the commission's report I extended, by way of orders in 1978 and 1979, the ban for a further two years to 18 July 1980.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to receive the commission's report in time to have action taken in relation to its recommendations before the expiry date of the current order.  However, before the commission <Col N="1151" /> had completed their report a certain development occurred which I regarded as being very relevant to the inquiry. This was the announcement by one of the petrol wholesalers that supplies of petrol would be withdrawn from uncontracted retailers who could not take a specified minimum delivery of petrol. The commission considered that this was an issue which would affect their consideration of the question of the future status of the ban on new company stations and was very relevant to their inquiry.  They decided, therefore, to re-open the inquiry and hold further special sittings to deal with this issue only. These sittings were held in March last. This development of necessity has delayed the submission by the commission of its report of the inquiry.  I hope to receive it shortly, however, and I am confident that it can be examined and action taken in relation to its recommendations before the end of the year.  To facilitate this I have extended the currency of the statutory ban on the operation of new company-owned motor spirit stations for a further six months.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the order.  The order, however, may not be amended but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.</P>
    <P>This is an uncontroversial measure and I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has just said this is an uncontroversial measure and I welcome it on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  It extends the ban on the extension of oil company-owned retail outlets. The announcement this year by a petrol company in relation to minimum deliveries seemed to me, the public at large and obviously the Minister, be cause of the action he took, to be restrictive and to be in abuse of the powers which those people seem to be able to wield in the case of tenants of <Col N="1152" /> petrol filling stations.  I am glad to hear the Minister will be receiving the report of the commission very shortly in relation to the extended terms of reference which considered the conditions under which tenants work in company-owned filling stations.</P>
      <P>During the past 18 months I raised this matter in the House in relation to specific cases where one petrol company had issued notices to quit to certain tenants of filling stations.  Those people have spent a lifetime in the service of that particular company.  Their business is selling petrol on behalf of that company. It seems that the normal tenancy arrangements which apply to normal tenancies did not apply in this case. Those people had apparently no established rights to fixity of tenure.  They could be thrown out without any trouble by the company for alleged failure by them to comply with regulations laid down by the company.  Some of the alleged failures were nothing short of an excuse by the company to get rid of those tenants.  I am glad to note that the commission have looked into this aspect of the trade.  I am sure the Minister will act in a way worthy of him when the details of the commission's report are made available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What percentage of the retail outlets are company owned, run by the companies themselves and worked by tenants?  Company-owned stations run by tenants are an Irish phenomenon. This figure will give an indication of the power which oil companies wield at retail outlet level.  The Minister mentioned the inherent danger in this preponderance of power in the production end, which could lead to market sharing and price fixing.  I expect the agreement between the companies up to this has led to the overall price of the product being similar in all areas of the country.  Recently there have been some minor differences between prices paid for petroleum products of different companies. There is a much different scene in the UK retail trade where there are large differences in price levels.  This is probably due to a much more competitive <Col N="1153" /> atmosphere and a much more competitive line taken by different companies. This has not been the case here, and the consumer at the end of the day is the victim of this approach.  I hope that the recommendations of the commission will be far reaching enough to ensure that there will be no reverting back to this position and ultimately the Minister will accept the recommendations furnished to him by the commission. I welcome this Bill on behalf of this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and I would like to compliment the Minister for bringing it before the House today.  The inquiry of the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission was complete but was reopened on 12 and 13 March to take further evidence in relation to the operation of certain companies concerning minimum drop proposals.  The results of the inquiry have not been announced yet and have not been submitted to the Minister. I ask him, in advance of this finding, to exert every influence within his power on particular companies, who are now in the process of increasing the hire charge and rent of company-owned stations to tenants throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I have got evidence of how Irish Shell Limited now propose to increase their hire charge by up to 300 per cent from the charges which have operated up to this.  It seems they are not covered under the Prices Commission and they have not to apply to them for approval for such increases.  They are not covered by the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1980. They are free to pursue their own approach in relation to the hiring of equipment to their tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 485 company-owned stations throughout the country, 400 of those are not company-operated and 85 are company-operated.  I am particularly concerned about the company owned but not company-operated stations.  I have here an agreement sent to a particular tenant within the last few days which proposes an increase of the hire <Col N="1154" /> charge from £50 per month to £131 per month from 1 June next.  They are exerting great pressure on this particular tenant and many other tenants to sign in advance of the findings of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  This is very unfair and is a Rachman type approach to those particular people, who have given lifelong service to this company.  Irish Shell Limited had a profit of £5.9 million last year.  I do not wish to name firms but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your concern about that but I have named them outside the House and I do not see why I should not name them inside this House. I was not concerned about my own position when I exposed the type of operation they had earlier in the year.  In one company in Salthill, Galway, a 70-year-old man has been given until 24 June, this month, to get out.  He is not allowed to renew the lease which he has had up to now.  He has been ordered to get out. This again is in advance of the findings of the Restrictive Practices Commission inquiry.  The Minister is considering this matter and I will submit to him the evidence in my possession.  I will put to him that he should instruct these companies that no such change in their agreements should be made before the findings of the inquiry are published.  Are they afraid of the findings of this inquiry? Are they afraid in advance that they will not be allowed to increase the rent on these stations after the findings of the inquiry are made known and when the Minister in due course will implement the findings of the inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I welcome the Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1980.  I have pointed out anomalies which exist at present and which are being taken advantage of by two major oil companies in this State.  All the other companies will follow suit as fast as they can to ensure that they will get in ahead of the inquiry and with a view to making the maximum profit will exert the maximum <Col N="1155" /> pressure on these people who are not protected in law.  Such people have given life-long service and dedication to these companies and now they are being told quite bluntly that they are required no longer if they are not prepared to pay those exorbitant increases of up to 300 and 400 per cent on their letting agreement. Again I emphasise the seriousness of this situation where 400 tenants and their families require protection.  The Minister already has shown his concern by having the inquiry reopened when those companies were limiting their drops.  I am confident that when this evidence is brought to his attention he will take whatever action is appropriate to ensure that no change will come about in advance of findings of the inquiry being made known which should take place very soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Restrictive Practices Commission to which I referred in my opening speech will, I understand, be given to me on Tuesday next, 24 June, but of course it will take some time after that to publish it.  As I indicated in the speech, the conditions under which company-owned stations are operated will be dealt with by the commission in their report, presumably in some detail.  There is not much point in my giving any exposition of my views on this at this stage because I will have to consider what is in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole inquired about the details of ownership of the petrol stations around the country.  In 1979 there were 4,033 petrol outlets, as they are described.  Of these 476 or 11.8 per cent were owned by oil companies and 3,557 or 88.2 per cent were independently-owned. What in the context is perhaps more significant is the throughput of both of them.  Of the total throughput of 281,020,000 gallons, 102,709,000 gallons or 36.54 per cent was sold at company-owned stations and 178,311,000 gallons or 63.46 per cent was sold through independently-owned stations, from which it would appear that the volume of throughput in company-owned <Col N="1156" /> stations is very substantially higher than in the independently-owned ones inasmuch as 11.8 per cent of the stations sell 36.54 per cent of the petrol.</P>
    <P>The question of higher charges, which was referred to by Deputy Leyden is, I understand, being considered at the moment by the prices division of my Department in consultation with the Attorney General in response to some complaints that have been made about this matter.  It is contended, I understand, by the oil company concerned that the existing price control mechanisms do not apply to this form of charge, but that is a matter which is being examined at the moment.  Whether it does apply or not, I would regard it as regrettable that very substantial increases in these charges are sought to be imposed at a time when it is known that a report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on these kinds of matters is about to issue.  I would have thought it would have been better business practice, perhaps, not to be trying to push things at this stage, but apparently one oil company at least take the view that they should push.</P>
    <P>These are the main points that have been raised in the course of the debate.  I will have an opportunity during the Summer Recess to consider this report that I will get on Tuesday.  I propose to introduce legislation here in the autumn which will take into account whatever of their recommendations I decide to agree to at that time, and I would hope that we might have what I might call more permanent legislation rather then have to be coming back every 12 or six months as the case may be, as we have been doing over the past few years pending this report.  The legislation would, of course, deal with broader topics than just the question of company-ownership alone.  I would hope that it would deal in some fashion with the method of operation of company-owned stations and perhaps the methods of control which companies exercise over independently-owned stations also which sometimes give rise to difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points.  The Minister stated that he intended to introduce more permanent legislation to replace this statutory instrument system, which obviously is not satisfactory.  Regarding what has been mentioned by Deputy Leyden and the Minister concerning jumping the gun by companies pending legislation, can anything be done to restrict the activities of companies in the interim or to curtail this kind of approach by them?  Secondly, is it the Minister's intention to publish the recommendations of the commission prior to this legislation being introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the activities of the companies concerned and the matter raised by Deputy Leyden, subject to the advice of the Attorney General, I may have powers under the Prices Acts to control those particular charges and am awaiting that advice at the moment.  If I have powers, I shall make an order under the Prices Act, independently of this legislation.  I hope to have the situation clarified in that regard in the next day or two.</P>
      <P>So far as publication is concerned, the report would, of course, be published, either prior to or simultaneously with the publication of the Bill.  It would, therefore, be available for consideration and discussion in the course of the discussions on the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the situation where a person is given a monopoly in relation to using a particular variety of plant.  The section is concerned with the situation where he has already used the monopoly for the minimum period, which is 15 or 18 years, and still has not got enough money out of exercising his monopoly, that he should be entitled, according to the section, to apply to have his monopoly extended for a further period.  If the controller is satisfied that this person has not got enough money out of it, he can grant an extension of the monopoly.  If the person has failed to get enough money out of it, it is mostly his fault, and there should be no requirement on the State to extend his monopoly for a further period, unless it is in the interests of Irish agriculture to do so.  We are proposing to add to this section the provision that the monopoly may be extended if it is in the interests of Irish agriculture, but that that must be taken into account.  To be perfectly honest, I cannot understand why the Minister has refused to accept this sensible addition to the section.  I do not believe that the only consideration which should be borne in mind in extending a monopoly is whether the person concerned has made enough money out of it, having had it for a minimum of 15 years anyway.  That does not make sense to me.  The broader considerations of the benefit to Irish agriculture deriving from this should also be taken in to account. The amendment is reasonable and the Minister should accept it.</P>

The notice of the decision having been taken may not be published in sufficient time within the 30 days to allow someone to become aware of it and to lodge his appeal within the 30-day period.

This is necessary so that users will know that the reproductive material will still be subject to royalties.  Granting the extension would be a matter between the controller and the holder of rights and will be given only where the holder had not got a reasonable return on the work done in developing the variety.

      <P>In regard to amendment <Col N="1162" /> No. 19 in the name of Deputy Bruton I should say that in view of the amendment I have moved to subsection (1) of this section and an amendment I propose to move on Article 5 of the Second Schedule I feel certain the Deputy will agree that I am providing for adequate notice to be given to any party who might wish to lodge an appeal against a decision of the controller.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 21, as I mentioned when discussing an amendment to section 14, I will be proposing that the period within which appeals must be served on a controller be extended. This amendment is necessary to keep in line with the thinking in the amendment I will be proposing to Article 5 of the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>The next amendment is No. 27 in regard to which I should say that, in line with what I have said already concerning amendments to sections 14 and 17, I propose to extend the time scale within which notice of appeals must be served on the controller.  The proposed amendment should allow any interested parties sufficient time to lodge their appeal.  It will be noted that the period of 60 days commences on the date of publication of the notice in the journal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the vast bulk of the amendments put forward by the Minister and the points he has made. However I have some reservation about the attitude he has adopted in regard to amendment No. 15.  Perhaps I did not follow fully what he was saying.  As I understand it, this is concerned with the position where somebody is applying to have their monopoly right extended for a period.  The Minister is saying that this is something between themselves and the controller and that there is no real need for anyone else to know that they are seeking to have it extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it I am interpreting what the Minister said correctly&mdash;if I am not I hope he will be kind enough to correct <Col N="1163" /> me&mdash;but I feel that the question of the extension of anyone's monopoly from, say, 15 to 25 years is a matter of interest not only to themselves and the controller but to everybody who may be dealing with them.  If somebody is applying for a monopoly right extension anyone who might object should have an opportunity of so doing.  If, as I understand it, my amendment is not accepted there would not be any requirement on the controller to publish the fact that he was considering a request by someone to have their monopoly right extended.  There would be no way in which that would necessarily become known to the public.  Am I correct in what I am saying?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case there is then very strong ground for accepting amendment No. 15.  All the amendment requires is that the controller publish the fact that he was considering an appeal from X to have his monopoly right extended from 15 to 25 years, or whatever. The number of cases in which this might be relevant could be considerable.  For instance, if farmers felt that the monopolist was charging too high a price for seed, they might not have been able to apply for a compulsory licence under the existing procedures we discussed yesterday because none of them would be in a position to take on the monopoly to maintain the variety of seed and so on.  Therefore, they would have no recourse.  Unless they could get some other seedman to apply for the compulsory licence to be granted to him, there would be nothing they could do in relation to the overcharging for the seeds but to pay up.  But if they discovered then that this monopolist was deciding to apply for an extension of his monopoly beyond the 15-year period to 25 years on the grounds that he had not got sufficient profit out of it&mdash;even though he might be overcharging&mdash;the farmers or their organisations should have an opportunity, firstly, to be aware of the fact that such an extension was being considered and, secondly, to lodge an objection <Col N="1164" /> to the controller, because the controller will not have all knowledge. Probably it will be a very small section in the Department of Agriculture that will be performing the functions of the controller.  Indeed, he may not know of instances of overcharging by a particular monopolist or be able to prove it.  He might have an idea that it was the case but be unable to prove it.  He might feel that if he turned down the extension without having definite knowledge he might be challenged in the court by the monopolist on the grounds that he had acted unreasonably.  Therefore, he would err on the side of caution and grant the extension.</P>
      <P>The only way in which that situation could be avoided would be if the fact that he was considering the extension were to be publicly known by means of the procedure contained in amendment No. 15, and other people outside the Department and the controller's office who might be aware of facts of which the controller would not about the behaviour of a particular monopolist would have an opportunity to object to the extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been so reasonable in the attitude he has taken to all of the amendments we have put forward so far&mdash;and I will be paying tribute to him more fully on Fifth Stage for the attitude he has adopted throughout this Bill, which has been exemplary&mdash;I do not fully understand why, if I am stating the case correctly, he cannot see the point of accepting amendment No. 15, which seems to me to be a reasonable one.  It may not be perfectly drafted.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate that he would be prepared to consider this as something that might possibly be introduced in the Seanad.  I do not want to press this to a division but, on the basis of what I said&mdash;and it has not been controverted by the Minister&mdash;there is a very good case for this amendment.  I would like to see the Minister accept it.  The Minister had a very constructive approach to everything we have been saying so far, but at the same time, this principle <Col N="1165" /> should be upheld.  I know the Minister cannot speak again, but can he give me any indication of his attitude on the matter?</P>

      <P>In page 18, line 41, after &ldquo;variety&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> This amendment is concerned with a matter raised on Committee Stage which deals with the requirement imposed on anyone who has a monopoly to maintain a variety.  The section as it stands says that every holder shall ensure that throughout the period for which the plant breeders' rights held by him are exercisable, he is in a position to supply the controller reproductive material which is capable of reproducing the variety to which the rights relate with the morphological and physiological characteristics which were taken into account when the rights were granted in respect of the variety.</P>
    <P>The only change we are proposing is that he should be capable of supplying the controller with reproductive material which is capable of reproducing the variety in Ireland.  It is possible to maintain a variety in such a condition that in the most favourable circumstances it would be capable of reproducing itself but it might have deteriorated to such an extent that it would no longer be capable of reproducing itself in Irish conditions. For example, some things will grow much better in warmer than in cooler climates but at the time the variety was originally patented it might have been capable of reproducing itself in both Ireland and the warmer climates of, say, France, Germany or Italy.  Because it was not properly maintained it might have deteriorated to the extent that while it could still be reproduced in very favourable environments, it would no longer be capable of being reproduced in Ireland.  In other words, so far as Ireland is concerned the protection would be of no value.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is at present framed, if the monopolist can prove to the controller that he can reproduce this plant anywhere in the world, that is sufficient. The insertion of the words &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo; will ensure that this requirement means something here and is not merely a matter of pure abstraction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not essential nor could it reasonably be required that all varieties be maintained in Ireland.  This, <Col N="1167" /> in my opinion, would impose an impossible condition on the breeder, one which no other UPOV country requires.  If breeders were required to maintain the varieties in Ireland, it is on the cards that some would decide against applying for rights and consequently might not be prepared in the absence of protection to make the variety available here.</P>
      <P>The Bill requires that the holder of the rights must be in a position to supply the controller with reproductive material conforming to the description of the variety at the time of grants of rights. The reference sample of the variety would be stored by the controller.  After a number of years when the germination of the particular seed starts to fall, the controller would require new reproductive material.  Before such material would be accepted as representative of the variety, it would be compared in controlled lots with some of the old sample. If the new sample did not conform to the description of the variety the right would be revoked.  In this way, the controller would have the possibility of periodically checking on the maintenance of the variety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment does not require them to maintain the varieties in Ireland.  All it requires is that the plant be capable of being reproduced in Ireland.  It can be maintained anywhere so long as the controller is satisfied it is capable of being reproduced in this country.  In my view the Minister is overstating his case when he says that every person who has a plant breeders' right will have to keep a plot in Ireland and maintain it.  That is not what my amendment is saying.</P>
      <P>If the controller is satisfied that breeding stock from the variety, already sold to Irish people was capable of being reproduced in Ireland, that would be enough to meet the requirements of the proposed amendment.  While I have no great scientific knowledge, the situation I have outlined of a variety deteriorating is not unreal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are enacting legislation for Ireland.  We are not merely concerned with reproducing the terms of the UPOV <Col N="1168" /> convention any way we can so that we can say we have adhered to yet another international convention.  We are concerned with making specific legislation to meet the needs of this country.  A requirement about being able to maintain reproductive material so that it can be reproduced in New Zealand, Italy or somewhere like that, being enough to enable a person to hold on to a monopoly in Ireland is not finding an Irish solution to an Irish problem&mdash;to coin a phrase used in another context by a man of great knowledge.  Perhaps the Minister should have another look at this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) such information as is available to him that would be relevant to determining whether reasonable prices are being charged for the plant varieties in respect of which plant breeders' rights have been granted by him,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with the information which the controller is required to publish in the journal.  The section already states that he must publish information on all applications which he receives involving the exercise of his various functions.  It does not include the extension of monopolies and I believe this omission should be corrected.  It is required that the name of the plant variety being granted be mentioned and any alteration or correction made in the register and also any objections the controller has received to any decisions he has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the controller should also be required to publish in the journal such information <Col N="1169" /> as is available to him relevant to determining whether or not reasonable prices are being charged for the plant varieties in respect of which plant breeders' rights have been granted by him.  I feel very strongly that the grant of a monopoly will <i>prima facie</i> lead to increased prices and perhaps in some cases unreasonable prices.  The inherent quality of a monopoly is that it allows people to charge higher prices than would be possible if they did not have a monopoly.  It is, therefore, inherent to the whole function of the controller that he should be required to monitor the situation to ensure that excessive prices are not being charged.  One way of ensuring this is to require the controller to publish in the journal all the information he has about the subject.  If he does not publish anything of great moment about prices it will be obvious to anybody who reads the journal that the controller is not doing his job in regard to unreasonable prices being charged by monopolists.</P>
    <P>Most people in farming organisations share my concern that this legislation may lead to substantially higher prices for seed.  That is not to say that there are no benefits in having legislation covering the rights of plant breeders; most of us will agree that there are such benefits and that they probably outweigh the higher prices which will be charged.  This However, we must make sure that excessive prices will not be charged.  This amendment will ensure that the controller keeps an eyes on prices and ensures that no person with a monopoly is enabled to charge excessive prices by virtue of the fact that he has a monopoly conferred on him by the State.  In this Bill we have the very unusual procedure whereby the State decides to give an individual a monopoly.  There are not many statutory monopolies in existence and the effect of this Bill will be the creation of a whole new set of statutory monopolies.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission have expressed the very strong view that their price control should be directed at monopolies.  They feel they should <Col N="1170" /> become involved in receiving full and formal application in support of a request for a price increase and rejecting or accepting the application.  It has been clearly accepted by the NPC that the area in which increases in price are more likely to take place in an unreasonable way is where monopoly or semi-monopoly situations have been created. This is precisely the kind of situation which this Bill deliberately sets out to create.  Therefore it is only right that one of the functions of the controller administering the system should be to ensure that although higher prices may be charged they will not be unreasonably high.  Of course farmers will be affected, but so will anybody who keeps a garden because as a result of this legislation gardeners will have to pay higher prices for plants.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that there is virtue in this legislation and many varieties which might not otherwise be available will now become available.  However, it is necessary to ensure that excessive prices will not be charged and this is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned during the debate on Committee Stage, we are adopting a format for the journal which has been suggested by UPOV.  All member countries are working towards a uniform administrative system and the information which Deputy Bruton is suggesting be contained in the journal would put us out of step with other countries.  In any event the controller would be most unlikely to have information at his disposal which would enable him to determine whether reasonable prices were being charged.  He has no function in the fixing of prices for seed. His only function would be in deciding if the level of royalties and the terms generally in the case of an application for a compulsory licence were reasonable.  The price of seed is dictated by market forces.  As I mentioned earlier, the royalties of a holder of rights represent only about 5 per cent of the retail price of seed.  The farming press is, perhaps, a better place for obtaining information on the price of seed.  In <Col N="1171" /> the circumstances I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that UPOV are not recommending that we include this section is no reason for not doing it.  We are still a sovereign country and we are entitled to require whatever we like in our legislation on this matter.  Beyond meeting the basic terms of UPOV, there is no requirement whatever regarding the inclusion of the provisions contained in this amendment.  We can still adhere to UPOV and require this information.  We should act on our own and not be influenced by any recommendation of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> If the controller does not have information on prices it will be very difficult for him to consider reasonably whether a person should be granted an extension of a monopoly.  If he does not know whether reasonable prices are being charged, how will it be possible for him to decide whether a person who has enjoyed a monopoly for, say, 15 years should be given an extension?  It is a matter of concern to me that the Minister has now admitted the controller will not have information regarding prices of seed in the market place.  There is every reason for including this amendment and no reason for not doing so.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) Any regulation or order made under section 2 of this Act shall only take effect after its terms have been approved by resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment dealing with the power of the Minister under section 2 of the Bill to enter into new conventions.  If a new convention on plants breeders rights is introduced in the UPOV Convention with a range of new powers and requirements, under the section as it stands it will be possible for the Government to make an order which need never be discussed here agreeing to the convention.  In that event all the things we have done here today and in the last few weeks in ensuring that various sections are reasonable will be shortcircuited. It will be possible under this section if there is another UPOV convention to incorporate it in our law without discussion in the Dáil.  This is unreasonable.  This amendment asks that wherever such an order is made we do not have to incorporate it into out law until a resolution agreeing to it has been passed by both Houses.  That does not mean that each section of the Bill could be debated.  It merely means that an affirmative resolution be passed and that there will be an opportunity for some debate on the subject.  As the Bill is now framed discussion need not take place at all and the only safeguard is that if this is lodged before the House, within 21 days a Member of the House may put down a <Col N="1175" /> resolution seeking to annul the order and Government time may be made available to discuss it.</P>
    <P>In recent cases the Government have not given their time to discuss motions to annul orders.  Until about four or five years ago if an Opposition Deputy put down a motion to annul a Government order, the Government invariably provided the time, usually about an hour-and-a-half to discuss it.  Under the Government led by the former Taoiseach.  Deputy Lynch, time was not provided to debate orders in this way.  I do not know if any case has arisen under the new Taoiseach.  The present Taoiseach is perhaps more concerned with the dignity of the House than his predecessor may have been, and therefore may be more receptive in providing time.  As I understand it, there is not requirement on the Government to provide time, and unless a Deputy's party are prepared to use some of their precious Private Members' time for a debate on a motion, the motion will not be discussed and consequently under this section a treaty can be entered into by this State without any discussion in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We are all very much aware of the jealous way in which the US Congress preserve their treaty-making powers and will not allow the Executive to make treaties on their behalf without those treaties being accepted by the US Congress.  We should be equally careful of our rights in the matter.  The amendment I am putting forward is reasonable in that event.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Bruton has in mind is that any important changes in the UPOV Convention should not be able to be implemented here simply by making an order under section 2 of the Bill.

      <P>That is just the Minister's assurance.  All section 2 proposes to do is to enable by order nationals of countries with a similar plant breeders' rights system to be given the same opportunity of applying for rights and so on as are provided for Irish nationals.  The purpose of the Bill is to set up a system of plant breeders' rights here.  The system proposed is in line with the UPOV Convention and accordingly reciprocal rights can be given to breeders in all convention countries.  If in future the UPOV system were significantly changed to the extent that the system provided for in this Bill needed to be changed to keep in line, the legislation would have to be amended. The section also enables us, where it is to our advantage, to make reciprocal arrangements with non-UPOV countries. In the circumstances the Deputy will agree that his amendment is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate a question was raised as to when precisely we would become members of UPOV after this legislation is enacted.  Once we have enacted legislation which provides for a plant breeders' rights system conforming to the UPOV Convention it is open to us to ratify the convention.  Accordingly, the next step after the enactment of this legislation will be the ratification of the convention by Ireland.</P>

      <P>Nothwithstanding the Minister's assurance, which I value as his own personal one, and I have not the slightest doubt that he means what he is saying, it is still the case that any subsequent Minister would be free to agree to a substantial alteration of the UPOV Convention imposing new and perhaps more onerous obligations on the country and incorporate that agreement into an order without any opportunity for it to be discussed in the House.  The fact that the Minister gives an assurance that he will not do it is not sufficient, because this legislation will exist long after the Minister has either ceased to hold the office he has or has moved to a more august one.  With all due respect to the Minister an assurance from him is of no <Col N="1177" /> more value than the length of time he holds office.

    <Title>Fishery Harbour Centres Bill, 1980: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1178" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with five different centres that have been passed where major catches of fish would be landed around the coast of Ireland and particularly with Rossaveal in County Galway.  The Minister rightly said that fishermen fishing into Rossaveal would save a lot of time and fuel if it were made the major port instead of Galway.  I welcomed this and said it was about time it was nominated as one of the top five ports in the country.  Neither the Minister nor I have anything against the port of Galway, but Galway is that little bit too far inland and is a city.  I do not think fish could move as freely out of Galway as we hope they will do out of Rossaveel.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister the last day if he would tell the House if the new harbour board for Rossaveel has been nominated and, if so, who the members are.  If it has not the Minister should take into account the fishermen, the co-operative movement in the area and someone who would deal with the expectations we have regarding the oil rigs.  It is only fair to state that we expect there will be major oil fields off Rossaveel.  They should have some say in this harbour.  It is important that the fishermen should nominate somebody to the board and that the co-operative movement in the area should have a nominee.  I suggest also that people from the Aran Islands should have a nominee.  I am sure the Minister has given thought to nominees from Government Departments such as the Department of the Gaeltacht, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Fisheries and so on, but these other sectors should also have a voice on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rossaveel, as far as oil is concerned, could become one of the greatest ports in decades.  If, as expected, there is a lot of oil off the west coast, Rossaveel seems to be in the centre and we want to safeguard their interests as well as fishermen's interests.  I visited Rossaveel a few months ago and a lot of development has taken place there recently.  I do not know if the Minister has visited it and, if not, I suggest he does so.  A lot more development is <Col N="1179" /> needed in this harbour.  I should like the Minister to tell us how much money has been allocated for this harbour in the next few years, when the work will commence and when it is hoped to complete it.  An extension to the harbour is needed at present, and there are a lot of rocks in the entrance which need to be taken away.  Part of the entrance needs to be dredged to make it a feasible major harbour.</P>
    <P>When we talk about one of the top five harbours in the country it is worth remembering that within the next few months we will be talking about boats over 100 feet coming into harbours like Killybegs and Rossaveel.  Now is the time not just to plan but to see that the plans are executed.  The greatest fault with the Department of Fisheries is that we hear plenty about plans but little about action.  For whatever plan there is money should be made available immediately and the work should be started and finished as soon as possible, if we are sincere about making Rossaveel one of our five major ports.  One thing that strikes one going to Rossaveel is the deplorable state of the roads.  They are worse than the road to Killybegs.  If we are serious about processing more fish and setting up more plants for that purpose we should be prepared to cater for many more juggernauts on those roads.  The road leading to Rossaveel harbour is not suitable for big lorries that can be expected to travel on it.</P>
    <P>In line with the development of the harbours I hope the Minister proposes to develop the roads leading to them.  The last three or four miles from Galway to Rossaveal is certainly in need of repair. Two big lorries are not able to pass each other on that road.  In my view the Department of Fisheries should be working in conjunction with the Department of Energy in relation to the development of our harbours.  I should like to know if the Department of Energy has been asked to subscribe any money to the development of Rossaveel to cater for our fishermen and those involved in oil exploration.  Has the Department of Energy been asked to subscribe any money for the back-up <Col N="1180" /> services needed at that port?  I have been told that the Department is committed to spending £5 million on Rossaveel and I should like to know if that information is correct.  I should like to know if that figure is the £5 million allotted for the development of all our ports this year.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that Denmark, which has a population just double oúrs, spend in the region of £15 million annually on the development of their harbours, slips and piers.  We should be thinking of spending a lot more annually on the development of our harbour and berthing facilities and our fish processing plants.  Until there is a firm commitment and determination by the Minister to do this work, every day we speak about it and do nothing is another day wasted. Our five major ports are Howth, Dunmore East, Killybegs, Castletownbere and Rossaveel and I should like to know if it is too late to add a sixth port to that list.  It should be remembered that there is no major port between Castletownbere and Rossaveel and it is amazing that a place like Dingle was not developed properly.  The Minister should give us his reason why Dingle was not considered for major development.</P>
    <P>We have been talking for many years about an auction hall and a syncro lift at Killybegs.  I recall that five years ago they were promised to Killybegs.  We have had promises for years but a brick has not been laid yet.  I understand that the Minister has been giving some thought to restricting the hours of auctions at our ports.  A restriction of those hours would be a backward step.  When dealing with fishermen we must remember that we are not dealing with people whose hours are restricted to 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and auction halls that close up at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.  We are dealing with people who cannot say when they will return home.  At times they return at midnight but on occasions they do not return until the early hours of the morning.  It would be to the benefit of the entire industry if it was left to those involved to decide on the hours to operate the auctions.  Naturally, if there are no fish available the auction halls will not <Col N="1181" /> open but when there are fish in the ports we must be realistic enough to permit the auction halls to open.  It should be left to the people running the auctions to decide on the hours.  Those involved in running other auctions only hold them when they have objects to dispose of.  I hope the Minister is not considering restricting the hours of fish auction halls.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are major development plans for Howth.  The middle pier, however, needs to be replaced urgently.  I am bearing in mind that most of the major development plans will not take place for about 18 months but that pier should be replaced before that.  I am pleased to note that at last a premises has been given to the fishermen in Dunmore East. When I visited that port recently the fishermen told me that they were not happy because the harbour there needs to be dredged urgently.  We cannot expect some of the super ships to go to Dunmore East unless the harbour is properly dredged.  The same applies to Burtonport in County Donegal.  For up to seven years Deputies on all sides have been asking different Ministers to dredge that harbour but nothing has happened. If we are serious about the fishing industry we must spend money to provide the proper facilities to our fishermen.</P>
    <P>I realise that major development work is in progress at Castletownbere.  I hope to visit that port shortly and I am anxious to meet all the fishermen who use that port.  I am anxious to learn of their problems.  As I told the Minister last night, when he visits Killybegs on Saturday night, even though his visit is for a political dinner-dance, he should make arrangements to meet the different fishing interests.  The Minister is aware that Killybegs is the major fishing port in the country and it is strange to think that he has not made arrangements to meet the different organisations operating from that port.  As I tour around the ports I hope to meet local fishermen and listen to their problems.  If the Minister did something similar he would be in a position to make up his own mind as to what should be done for the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> Some pressure has been exerted recently on the Minister to see to it that the Bulgarian boats are not withdrawn from Donegal Bay.  Before the Minister reaches a decision in relation to this he should consider carefully the people who benefit from the presence of those boats in Donegal Bay.  He should bear in mind that before those boats arrived the fishermen were getting 11p per lb. for their herring but today they get in the region of 22p per lb.  That shows that local fishermen have benefited from the competition.  Deputy Deasy has just informed me that the figures should have been £22 per box, but it is the same thing.  Surely we all agree that what fishermen and the fishing industry need is more competition, more processing, more markets abroad and, eventually, a better price for our fish.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have been as distressed as I was last week when he told me that £6 million worth of fish is being imported back into the country.  We must be all concerned about that when we realise that it is estimated we are exporting £36 million and £40 million worth of fish per annum and importing back about one-sixth of our total export. There is something wrong with the fishing industry when we are not processing that fish at home.  Top priority at present must go to markets abroad and secondly to processing our fish within our shores.  Until we deal with these matters we are bound to have gluts and shortages, high prices and low prices. We should endeavour to see that there is a constant supply of fish and that we have permanent markets in which we can sell them.</P>
    <P>I noticed a heading in this morning's <i>Irish Press:</i>&ldquo;Fishing Laws Challenged in Luxembourg&rdquo;.  The article states:</P>
    <P>The Government's right to legislation on fishing activities in Irish waters, and to impose a fine if these laws are broken is being challenged in the European Court in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The important thing it goes on to say is this:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> The case has been referred to the European Court by the Co. Cork Circuit Court, which has asked Luxembourg to rule whether a conviction under Irish law for the fishing offence was contrary to EEC law.</P>
    <P>I mention this because it is very important that we should be able to define exactly our fishing rights.  I do not want to hark back but even now I would insist that when the Minister talks to his partners in Brussels there must be a major distinction between our Irish fishing rights and the EEC fishing waters.  Last year we saw in Deputy Deasy's area that the south-east fishermen were not allowed to fish for herring in their own area.  We could come up against this again.  It is rumoured that the Celtic Sea may be opened next September.  If it is, and if we have all the EEC boats descending on the Celtic Sea it is only a matter of time before the entire Celtic Sea will be closed again because of overfishing.</P>
    <P>We must come back to a limit even if it is only 20 or 25 miles.  We must have an exclusive limit for Irish fishing waters.  Outside that you can then talk about EEC waters.  It has been proved by questions in this House that when we ask about quotas we can get the information as regards Irish quotas but we cannot get information as regards EEC quotas.  So long as quotas are concerned and so long as you have foreign fishermen fishing in Irish waters we will not get a true position in regard to quotas.  The fight that the Minister must take on his shoulders when he goes to the EEC fishing council is to secure first an exclusive zone for Irish fishermen. After that we can talk of EEC waters.</P>
    <P>I should like to say one more thing, and I do so with all respect.  I was disgusted last night by the Minister's performance as Minister for Fisheries and I hope we shall never see such a display again from a senior Minister.  I expect the Minister for Fisheries to lead and act responsibly and not have, as we had last night, the Minister and another Deputy mudslinging at each other across the House.  The fishing industry demands a responsible Minister.  It needs a constructive <Col N="1184" /> approach because there are challenging times ahead and unless we have that approach it is the industry that will suffer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill.  I support it fully and I am 100 per cent behind any move to develop our harbours.  I look forward to the development of Rossaveel as one of the five primary fishery harbours together with Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Howth and Killybegs. Harbours are an essential part of the infrastructure, for the fishing industry.  Unfortunately, we have been deficient for far too long in this area and most harbours up to recently were remnants of the British regime dating back 100 or 150 years.  Many of these&mdash;they are fine harbours&mdash;are still being utilised but they are outdated and we need modern techniques and methods.  We need greater areas not only in the harbours themselves but in the back-up areas, land for processing facilities behind the harbours.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the developments in the five areas mentioned in the Minister's speech have been extensive and appreciated by the people and they are doing much good for the industry.  I should like to see an extension of the forward thinking we have had in the past 12 or 15 years to further development, not necessarily on the same scale but to provide safe moorings and berthings at all times and facilitate entry and exit from harbours at all times so that fishermen could earn a good living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics on fishing and harbours do not make good reading.  The last Bord Iascaigh Mhara report says that there are almost 8,600-9,000 fishermen in the country of whom approximately 3,000 are full-time and some 6,000 are part-time or seasonal.  Those figures tell their own story.  We have 6,000 part-time fishermen because they have not facilities to put to sea at all times and at all tides.  They operate from inferior harbours and cannot get in or out in stormy weather.  We should tackle and solve that problem.  I should like to see the bulk of our fishermen as full-time fishermen who could put to sea at all <Col N="1185" /> times independent of weather conditions. If harbour development reached its full potential we would not have 9,000 fishermen but more likely 90,000.  The present figure could be multiplied by ten. The raw material is there.  We are a maritime nation.  We have the opportunity but we have never attempted to exploit it to its full potential.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a national fisheries policy with that very object, full utilisation of our fisheries.  We see the tremendous development in Killybegs, one of the five centres the Minister mentioned. This is an example of what can be done elsewhere.  There are numerous processing plants around Killybegs harbour. Unfortunately, the same is not true of the other centres that have been developed.  In Castletownbere and at Deenish island there is a large industrial estate adjacent to the pier, but this estate has never been developed.  What has been done is only a drop in the ocean compared with what could be done.  It is no advantage to have excellent harbours unless we have the processing facilities that should go with them.</P>
    <P>The same situation arises in Dunmore East.  The processing facilities are only a tiny percentage of what they could be. That brings us back to the very important point of processing and our lack of facilities in that regard.  I believe the ratio of people involved in the processing industry here is less than a one to one basis.  There are 9,000 fishermen in the country and I believe there should be at least the same number involved in the processing sector.  The number involved could probably be measured in hundreds rather than in thousands.  That compares very badly with our EEC partners.  All the maritime EEC countries have very strong processing industries.  I am told that in Denmark there are seven people engaged in the processing industry for every fisherman at sea.  If we were to compare on that ratio we would have 63,000 people involved in processing. The Minister and his Department should see that we get the fullest value out of our fisheries and that we do not export the bulk of what we catch in an unprocessed form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Anybody who goes into a supermarket, where tinned and packaged fish are for sale, can see that the bulk of the processed fish we buy is from foreign countries.  It is a scandalous state of affairs for a maritime nation to import £6 million of processed fish when we should be a large net exporter.  We seem to import an extraordinary amount of fish for a country surrounded by the sea.  The amount of fish we import is undermining our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>All the maritime countries in the world are claiming a 200 mile limit. Countries with rich fishing grounds such as Canada, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway have far more fish than they need and they have now become huge exporters of fish.  Now that the Russian, American and British trawler fleets have been withdrawn from their waters they can catch huge quantities of fish, and they are flooding the world markets with their excess catches. We are one of the countries suffering because of that.</P>
    <P>The EEC have been negligent and have not done us justice They have allowed the third countries I have mentioned plus Argentina, Peru, Brazil and other South American countries to export large quantities of processed fish to the EEC countries.  This has had a very depressing effect on our fishing industry. Will the Minister see that this practice is stopped and that we are allowed to develop our fisheries under the terms of the Hague Agreement of October 1976? This agreement said that we were to be allowed double our catch within three years and we were to be allowed a progressive development of our fisheries thereafter.  The terms of that agreement have not been fulfilled.  We have not doubled our catch.  In fact, it has almost remained static.  If it has increased at all it is only because other EEC countries have discovered vast quantities of fish which have not got a great commercial value but which look good in the form of statistics.  I refer to horse mackerel, better known as scad, of which we have got huge quantities off the west and south coasts, and blue whiting, which exists in unlimited quantities in the Porcupine <Col N="1187" /> Bank about 100 to 150 miles off the west coast.  Those areas are producing vast catches of fish for the British, who have been purse seine netting for mackerel on a very large scale off the west coast.  The people who formerly operated in the Cornish mackerel fisheries and before that operated in the North Sea have now turned their attention to our west coast.  The greatest industrial fishing nation in the world is reputedly Denmark, and I am told they are catching enormous quantities of blue whiting in the Porcupine Bank.  Those are all within our 200 mile limit.</P>
    <P>It seems incomprehensible that we can have foreigners catching huge quantities of fish while our fishermen are not equipped to utilise the same fishing grounds.  The fish caught in those areas are being processed and are being sold back to us either as tinned or packaged fish or fishmeal.  It is quite obvious that some of this processed fish is returning here as part of the £6 million processed fish we import each year as well as fishmeal and animal foodstuffs.  I do not know if a figure has yet to be put on the amount of animal foodstuffs which originates from the fish which we import.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the fish are there. The declaration by the EEC of a 200 mile limit whether it is for Ireland, Britain, Denmark, France or any place else has had beneficial results and has meant that the fish stocks around our coasts have been greatly replenished over the past five years.  Our fishing stocks had become very depleted by the Dutch in particular, the French with their small mesh nets, the Spanish with similar nets, the Russians with their factory ships and huge catching powers and their purse seine netting.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry was in the trough of despair about five years ago but is now arriving back at the situation where the fish are there to be caught but the price is being grossly depressed because of imports from third countries. Many of those imports are being processed and frozen by our EEC partners. When the good quality fresh fish comes <Col N="1188" /> on the market those people deliberately depress the price by saying to the fishermen.  &ldquo;We will take this at the price we quote and if you do not accept this we will sell the processed fish and you can go to blazes&rdquo;.  That is the type of threat used against our fishermen by large international concerns who have been importing on an unprecedented scale from third countries who have fish to spare.  It will take hard work and tough bargaining by the Minister for Fisheries at the EEC negotiation table to see that this stops.</P>
    <P>We have the fish supplies now but the fishermen are not getting a just reward.  I have never seen more fishermen in financial trouble than there are at present.  I would like to see the Minister doing something about it.  It is sad to see in the BIM Report which was issued last week that France caught more fish off the south coast of Ireland than we did ourselves.  They caught 27,000 tons for 1977.  Next in line came the Dutch with 21,000 tons caught off the south coast of Ireland.  This is the Celtic Sea at our own back door.  Next came Spain with 17,000 tons.  The Spanish are not even members of the EEC and they caught more than the Irish fleet, who caught a mere 16,000 tons off our south coast.</P>
    <P>We should be the primary fishcatchers in Europe because together with Britain we have the bulk of the EEC fisheries waters.  I ask the Minister to see that the development of our fisheries is uniform in every respect.  It is no good our having the fish if we cannot catch them, and we cannot catch them unless we have the harbour facilities and the boats.  After we have caught them we must have the processing facilities, and this area has not been developed.  Fianna Fáil in their manifesto said that they would develop processing facilities but there has not been any development.  I have seen a number of processing centres in this country close down and I have not seen any new ones.  A plant for Youghal to employ 250 people has been planned for the past two years and last week I read in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> that the plans have been shelved and it is not going ahead.  I do not see any new effort <Col N="1189" /> to provide processing facilities.  It is a national disgrace that the fish are there and we are not in a position to catch them or to sell them.  They are having to be dumped physically on an increasing scale because of third country imports. The fishermen are becoming despondent because they are getting give-away prices.  They are getting the same price for their fish now as they were getting in 1973-1974, whereas their costs have doubled or trebled.  The cost of boats, gear and fuel has multiplied.  We are slowing down on this job.  I appeal to the Minister to see that there be a rational development of fisheries in every regard and that the fishing industry does not go to the wall.  If that type of importing is allowed to continue there is no future for the fishing industry in this country.</P>

      <P>I considered that this Bill was a fishery harbour Bill but it is no harm to have a rather comprehensive discussion on the fishing industry such as I understand is taking place.  My first plea to the Minister will be centred around my own constituency of Cork South-West.  We have developed Castletownbere Harbour as a major fishery harbour and we hope to move along to Schull this year.  I want to make a particular plea for Union Hall and Baltimore.  Union Hall could be described as a major fishery centre in this country and for years and years they have been crying for improvements to the pier and harbour there.  I am making a special plea to Deputy Power, Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, that he will try to have some finance made available for the development of Union Hall pier.  A similar case can be made for Baltimore.  Then we have numerous small piers and harbours all around the coast for which the State makes available grants of 75 per cent and the councils give grants of 25 per cent subject to maintenance by the county council subsequently.  We would require more moneys for such smaller schemes.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is this concluding at 1.30 p.m.?</P>

      <P>I would like to know also whether the money allocation for harbour development is expended.  I recall that for some years allocations for harbour development remained unspent. In one year as much as 60 per cent of the total allocation was never expended and went back to the Exchequer again. Therefore, in the Book of Estimates figures were set down for harbour development which were never, to my mind, meant to be expended.  It would be no harm for us to have information not only of the allocations in past years but of actual sums expended.</P>
      <P>I want to complain also about the problems of selling fish.  There is an obligation on the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to try to help people who have problems in selling fish.  I know one fish merchant in Castletownbere who has had on his hands for months more than £100,000 worth of fish that he cannot dispose of.  This fish have to be pickled, preserved and so on, and this man was giving good employment in Castletownbere.  He was buying the fish from the local fishermen and for the past year he has not been able to sell it.  In such circumstances there would be an obligation on the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to come along and give a helping hand.  The Department are in a much better position to find markets abroad than an individual fish merchant. I make a special plea to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to try to find a market for this man's fish.  It cannot last forever even though it is well pickled and preserved.  Unless a market is found, naturally he will go out of business, possibly he will go bankrupt and with his bankruptcy will fall so many jobs in Castletownbere where employment is so scarce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing I have to say is for God's sake&mdash;and seldom I use that expression <Col N="1191" /> here&mdash;stop dumping of fish. People read in the papers about and see in their locality boxes of fine fish being dumped in the sea.  I have raised this here before and it has been raised by other Deputies.  I ask Minister Power for Heaven's sake to try to do something to stop that.  It can be done and by doing it we can still keep within EEC regulations. Everybody here would like to see this industry being developed, and there is a great future for the fishing industry if it is managed properly and if it gets the attention which it should get at departmental level.  I am not reflecting in any way on Deputy Power and his capacity and capability, but I am surprised that the Fianna Fáil Government did not select a member of their party from a maritime constituency who would be associated more closely with particularly sea-fishing people than the present Minister. I feel sure that they could find other berths in the Government that would measure up to Deputy Power's capacity. A Minister who is removed from the sea is at a disadvantage, and it is unfair to him to get that kind of portfolio.</P>

      <P>The commission report, yes.  To warrant a Deputy in this House, the range is from 20,000 to 30,000.  Deputies have a very difficult task, particularly in regard to local matters and exceptionally so in scattered constituencies such as my own in south-west Cork.  After reading the report from the commission, I wonder are we justified in increasing the number?  Will <Col N="1193" /> we make this Parliament a bit too unwieldy, in proportion to our population? I would not agree with increasing the membership of the House by 18 seats, as is happening under this Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The five-seater constituency may be all right in built-up areas such as Dublin and some of the more populous country areas, but certainly in rural districts or in scattered areas the three-seat constituency is, to my mind, better.</P>

      <P>I am rather doubtful if there is justification in increasing the number to 166 but am not viewing this from the point of view of the cost of increasing the number.  It is just as costly to have 16 senior executives, and possibly more costly, and they would not be giving the same type of service as the Members of this House give. However, the number of members should remain as it is.  That would not change the areas to that great extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the terms of reference given to the commission by the Government was that the commission should work within the numbers 164 to 168.  On Second Stage, most members who referred to this question were in favour of 166.  In the report, Chapter 4 gives different years of revision.  The average per member worked out at 20,521 in 1923, 21,536 in 1935, 20,103 in 1947, 20,127 in 1961, 20,028 in 1969 and 20,123 in 1974.  The average works out at 20,290.  This has been consistent through all the revisions.  They have kept between one of the terms of reference, between 164 and 168.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Government see it as imperative that we should stick to the lower figure of 20,000, when the Constitution provides for a variation <Col N="1194" /> between 20,000 and 30,000?  There is no need to be so rigid in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some slight move, but is it the Government's opinion that there is a need of 18 seats?  I certainly do not think that there is a public demand for 18 extra seats.  I cannot see the logic of having to stick to the lower figure.  A little more latitude should be allowed in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a dog that barked at every other dog that passed the road. Usually he remained quiet until the other dog had passed.  When the other dog had gone down the road a good bit my dog went out and kicked up an awful row at the gate, knowing quite well that it was safe to do so.  This reminds me of this Bill.  On Second Reading we had an indication from all parties that they were prepared to accept what the commission had reported.  It seems somewhat odd to me that we should have an objection to the change being effected at this stage.  I feel the commission were given a job to do.  They did that job and, whether it was in favour of us or against us, once we accepted it, that was that.</P>
      <P>I know there are areas in practically every constituency that will not suit the people in those new areas.  There have also been traditional areas taken away from people who perhaps have been Members of this House for a long number of years, and that may affect their electoral support.  The facts are that the commission was set up, and while neither the Government nor the House had to accept their report the facts are that the Government accepted it and the House indicated here the last day this was debated that the political parties were supporting the view of the Government. That being so I would suggest we are now talking about something in regard to which we can do nothing and in fact do not want to do anything except make comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I agree in substance with what Deputy Tully has said that the commission system has been accepted in principle by all sides of the House. Indeed the report of the commission which acted within its terms of reference, with whatever shortcomings those terms of reference may have had, has also been accepted in principle by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>We are dealing now with Committee Stage.  That does not mean that we are not at liberty to raise any points or make any comments that are relevant, section by section, or section by section of the Schedule.  That does not mean that we will have a very long discussion or that we will talk for the sake of talking.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the commission were to have regard to the fact that membership of the next Dáil should be not less than 164 and not more than 168.  Those were the numbers that would be justified by the population and the Constitution.  The commission recommended two less than the maximum which the Constitution would permit.  It is worthwhile placing on record again that Article 16.2.2º of the Constitution provides that the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.  If we did that, as I understand it, the number recommended would be 168 but the commission recommended two less. That article goes on to say:</P>
      <P>...or at more than one member for each thirty thousand of the population.</P>
      <P>It is worth placing on record that that provision is identical with the provision in the 1922 Constitution which was followed absolutely by the Constitution of 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Second Reading that I thought the increased number of Deputies was justified.  Had I not thought that the increased number was justified it would be my duty to oppose such increase, But until such time as the work load is reduced for Deputies, until such time as matters are ordered and <Col N="1196" /> organised in a way in which Deputies will be enabled to spend more time as policymakers, as legislators and as Members of Parliament, properly so called, then this number of Deputies is necessary.  For example had we the minimum number of Deputies, 113, how would anybody have any chance at present of getting a farm modernisation grant?  No farmer would receive such unless he first approached his local Deputy and got him to kick up a row on his behalf in the Department.  Again, if the number of Deputies at present was reduced to 113 how would any applicant for a home improvement grant have any chance of getting a hearing from the appropriate Department?  I could go right across the board and deal with old age pensions and the whole field of social welfare where it could be maintained that it is the squeaking wheel only that is greased.  Unless people can contact their local Deputies now they get no hearing from any Department because the various Departments, certainly the paying-out ones, listen only to the people on behalf of whom representations are made.  Until such time as we have a proper citizens' advice bureau, a proper ombudsman system of a meaningful nature&mdash;not the toothless monster being put through the Dáil at present&mdash;then we need this number of Deputies, and I make no apology for so saying.  If the time comes when we have a proper citizen's advice bureau and a proper ombudsman's system then, at some future revision of constituencies, we can consider a lower number.  Those are my views on that, and I wanted to put them clearly on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify the point I was making.  I totally agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick in much of what he said.  But in regard to this Bill it is a case of putting the cart before the horse.  I do not see why we have to increase the number of Deputies to the maximum, or almost the maximum, while the facilities for the existing number remain so inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot <Col N="1197" /> go into that at this stage.  It does not arise under this code.  This is the electoral code.  Facilities for Deputies and so on come under another code completely, under the allowances to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of Deputies permissible under the Constitution could be as low as 113 and as high as 168. Public interest would be better served had we 113 Deputies with proper facilities available to them rather than having 168, as at present, whose facilities and secretarial services are so terribly limited.  Therefore the Government should take a hard look at what they expect of a Deputy and consider giving him a proper status with proper services in order to perform his functions properly.  That is why I raised the issue.  I do not necessarily agree that we should increase the number of Deputies to the maximum permissible under the Constitution. I am saying we should give existing Deputies a better deal.</P>

      <P>I have never believed in farming out work.  Through the years the Dáil has been anxious to farm out what have been termed &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; tasks.

What will be the position if the next census does not show an alternation in the number of people or in the size of the Dáil, if there is no further change in the constituencies and the Ceann Comhairle does not happen to come from Donegal?

A question I have had in mind for many years is why that should reduce the number of Members to be <Col N="1206" /> elected from the constituency.  The Ceann Comhairle cannot engage in politics or participate in political activities. He must keep his impartiality intact. My view is that the Ceann Comhairle should be given a seat without specifying any constituency.  He should be given a seat as representing Ireland.  In this case, why should Donegal South-West be deprived of the privilege of electing three Deputies at the next election?  The same situation applied to Clare for a number of years.  The Ceann Comhairle should be returned to the next Dáil but a constituency should not be specifically named.  If he accepts the position of Ceann Comhairle he must also accept that a vacancy will not be retained for him in the constituency that originally elected him.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I want to make it clear that there is nothing personal in all of this. The point raised has given rise to a rather interesting discussion.  It is only right that the Ceann Comhairle should be returned unopposed and that he should not have to fight a general election to retain his seat because during the previous Dáil he would have been deprived of the opportunity of participating in political activities or in activities that keep a Deputy in touch with his constituents.  The point that has been made is a valid one, that a constituency is being deprived of the services of an active Deputy.  I have not the Constitution before me but, subject to what it may say, I think the point raised by Deputies could be got over by saying: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann shall, after the dissolution thereof which next occurs after the passing of this Act, consist of 166 Members elected to represent the constituencies in the schedule and the Ceann Comhairle who shall be returned unopposed.&rdquo;  A constituency for the Ceann Comhairle need not be specified.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am in favour of giving everybody an adequate chance to get on the register and of giving political parties an opportunity to get them on the register.  There is ample chance to a certain extent.  The draft register is published on 1 December and alterations can be notified to the county secretary up to mid-January.  Revision courts are then held at the end of January and February and one can go to the Circuit Court after that. Drastic action should be taken with people who do not compile the register properly.  An instance which shows the type of default that the Minister is talking about is where three well known political figures were left off the register by another well known political figure.  The matter was brought before the revision court and the well known political figure justified his action and because the people concerned were not there they were left off again.  When the matter was brought before the Circuit Court the people who were wrongly omitted from the register for wrong reasons were able to get on the register. This must be one of the very few cases <Col N="1211" /> since the foundation of the State that were brought before the Circuit Court in an informal way by writing a letter to the county registrar.</P>

The people who prepare that list should ensure that when it is prepared it is printed by someone responsible who will ensure that the list will be genuine when it comes out.  There was an instance a couple of years ago where the voters list was sent outside the area to some printer miles away from the area where it is normally printed.  The result was that they did not leave me off the list but they left my wife off along with a lot of other people and the whole thing had to be printed again.

      <P>In relation to the compilation of the register the Minister should explore with the registration authorities the idea of having the registers set up on computer, throughout the local authority areas.  That is done in Dublin city at the moment and I understand that it will be introduced in my authority next year.  At present huge physical effort is involved in amending the draft register when the amendments come in, and the genuine errors that can occur are easily understandable.  A person who is registered as No. 921 can be discovered to be dead and when his name is removed from the register everyone on the rest of the register is moved up one place.  That pyhsically requires moving up on the card index every name on the rest of the register and giving them new numbers.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I want to make a point about the postal voters list which I think will be helpful to the Minister and his advisers. It is the benefit of my experience. After the postal voters list, which at the moment consists largely of members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána, is drawn up, it very often happens that some members of the armed forces are discharged from the Army for one reason or another.  When that happens and letters are addressed to them through the Defence Forces&mdash;this happened on the last occasion in any case&mdash;the letters were sent back through the dead letter post.  I know the matter was complicated on that occasion by the postal strike but were it not for the co-operation of the returning officer and the town clerk in my area a number of ex-soldiers would not have been able to vote.  They were on the postal voters list but because they were discharged from the Army they did not get their ballot papers and would not be allowed to vote as ordinary voters because there was a &ldquo;P&rdquo; opposite their names.  With the co-operation of the county registar and the <Col N="1214" /> town clerk, on the county registrar's direction these people were allowed to go either to the county secretary or the town clerk and collect the ballot papers that had been returned as undelivered, mark them in the ordinary way and hand them in.  Something should be done to prevent that happening again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, in the first column, to delete &ldquo;Dublin North&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dublin Fingal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very simple amendment which I believe will meet with the general agreement of Deputies representing the present constituency of North County Dublin and of the people of the area generally.  The area which is now to be designated as Dublin North in the Bill is one of the few areas in the county that has an identifiable name.  It is a region that has carried the name of Fingal for 1,000 years, since the time the Danes first came to this coast.  They first invaded Dublin in the area of Fingal.  They carried their banners to the high point of land which is still known as and has the townland name of Man-o'-War.  From there they claimed all territory they could see from that point and that is the territory since known as Fingal.  The emblem of the area was the black raven which was also brought to the area by the Danes.  The historic connections of that area are well known and would be well known to Members of the House. The Black Raven Pipe Band which is still a very famous band in piping circles was formed by the late Thomas Ashe and the late Willie Rooney, once a Member of this House and whose son, Eamonn Rooney, also served in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of Fingal is a very identifiable area and is known as such by the people within it.  They would identify better with a constituency termed &ldquo;Dublin Fingal&rdquo; than with the constituency termed &ldquo;Dublin North&rdquo; which they might expect to be in some part of the inner city.  The local newspaper is the <i>Fingal</i><Col N="1216" /><i>Independent</i> and a headline in it this week is: &ldquo;TD in Fingal jail storm&rdquo;&mdash;none of the three Deputies representing Fingal, merely another one who wants to move a jail from a constituency he hopes to represent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apart from the name of the paper the headline published in this edition refers to the word Fingal because that is the area identified as Dublin North.  The people living in that area would better understand their constituency if it were to be described as Dublin Fingal.  Also, it would be an interesting gesture on the part of the House to recognise this name that has applied for over 1,000 years in the area of north County Dublin and give it recognition in legislation by assigning that name to what the Bill proposes to describe by the rather unimaginative name of Dublin North.</P>

      <P>I am not objecting to the points Deputy Boland has made but I should like to point out two things.  First, from the top of Man-o'-War you can see County Meath and the Danes did not come in there.  Second, as regards the name of the constituency, if we make the change suggested, Meath should be &ldquo;Meath-Westmeath&rdquo; because we have portion of Westmeath included in it. Cavan is &ldquo;Cavan-Monaghan&rdquo; but previously they had portion of Meath. How would you name that?  I do not object to Fingal; it is a distinctive area, I agree, but the constituency which the Deputy represents and which we are talking about here covers more than Fingal.  I have no objection to the change, however, if the Minister agrees to it.</P>

      <P>There is obviously a cohesion in the naming scheme selected and it would be wrong to detract from that cohesion by re-naming one or more of the constituencies.  The Government accepted the recommendations of the commission in their entirety and it has been made clear that the House approves of that decision.  Some Deputies were unhappy about some aspects of the Bill but they are disposed to accept them as part of the total package.  This seems to be the proper and sensible approach. The report should be regarded as a package and accepted in its entirety including any parts we may not particularly like.  This applies to the names as well as the shapes of the constituencies. I trust the Deputy will see it this way, as part of a package, and accept the package in its entirety.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's approach.  He talks about a package.  This is a report.  This very minor amendment would at least have indicated that this House had the courage to make some change in the report.  Apparently, it has not the courage to make any change whatever and is accepting <i>in toto</i> what is in the report.  It augurs badly for the future that it can be used as a precedent that those reports should be accepted.  The acceptance of this very minor amendment Deputy Boland has put down would at least show that we have made a change in this report.  It is a technical detail whether the constituency is called North County Dublin or Dublin Fingal.  Obviously the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.  He spoke about a package but the House is not interested in packages.  The House is interested in legislation.  If a report comes before the House it is up to the House to examine it, make recommendations and not accept it blindly, as appears to be done in <Col N="1218" /> this case.  Acceptance of this minor amendment would prove that the House is capable of amending a report from eminent people who were chosen to do a job.  Apparently, Deputy Boland is crying out in vain to have this change made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude on this amendment.  As Deputy O'Brien said, it is a minor amendment as far as the package is concerned.  The Minister is creating a rather dangerous precedent in his reply to the suggestion that Dublin North should be called Dublin Fingal. Most public representatives who sit on local authorities agree that over the last two years the powers of those local authorities are being whittled away.  If we are to accept a package simply because we do not want to interrupt the package, the follow up to that is not to break the seal in case we might be tempted to change it.  I ask the Minister to have a little more courage and consult his party in Dublin North and I do not believe he will find any opposition to this change.</P>
      <P>It is no argument to say that the Government accepted this as a package. The Government are not infallible and they can have a rethink about this.  If the Minister were to inquire among the ranks of his party, particularly those in the North Dublin area who might be deeply interested in this, I believe they would be as anxious as Deputy Boland to have this change made.  Perhaps the Minister would have a consultation with his party.  I cannot see the Government disagreeing on it.</P>

The Bill has been accepted and the report of the commission has <Col N="1220" /> been accepted, but Deputy Boland seeks to identify this ancient area of Dublin with its traditional name.  That is a reasonable proposition.  Residents of this area of Dublin seem to be able to identify more with their area than with other parts of the county.  Deputy Boland has made a very strong case praising this ancient area of Dublin over 1,000 years.  It would perhaps in some way make restitution to the Vikings for the wrong which has been done to them in another part of the city if this amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We are right on the amendment. I would not like to think the Minister is weak but it is a sign of weakness coming into the House and not being ready to yield an iota one way or the other in relation to a Bill, particularly when there is nothing at stake.  The Minister said it is part of a package, but names do not give or take anything from the package.  If he wants justification for changing this and leaving the rest of the names of the constituencies as they are, the obvious one is that this is the only amendment before the House and the only request which has been made to him.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been mentioned.  I remember when I was on the other side coming into the House with a Bill and in response to a request from the Fianna Fáil Party, who were opposing the Bill, I yielded on one particular issue, although I was handling the Bill for another Minister.  I remember the present Taoiseach went out of his way to be complimentary in saying what a fine thing it was to see a Minister bringing in a Bill and being prepared to accept an amendment even when he was handling it for another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> The Minister for the Environment is in control of this Bill.  I ask him to exercise his discretion and not feel he is bound by his Department or by anybody else.  It is not going to alter the substance of the Bill one iota, and if he does that he will bring the Bill out of the House here with added kudos rather than any reduction in its stature.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a brief comment as one who has accepted numerous amendments.  I am a great believer in a Bill being discussed and agreed on as representing what the House thinks and not what the Government think.  I suggest that perhaps the Minister is not a free agent here and it may be necessary for him to consult somebody else.  I also think that if that is brought back to the Taoiseach it will almost certainly be agreed on.  We are moving to Question Time at 3 p.m.  Is there a possibility of having a quarter of an hour's discussion to finish the Bill some time later this evening rather than attempting to finish it now with perhaps the wrong result?</P>

      <P>This is not going to change the Bill one iota, but it is going to make the point very nicely, as Deputy O'Brien said, that this House is capable of amending an Electoral (Amendment) Bill if it thinks that that will improve it and if there is all-party agreement for it. I am sorry that the two Deputies who represent Dublin North County are not here this afternoon.  Possibly they did not realise that I intended entering this amendment.  I feel certain that both Ministers of State Burke and Deputy Fox would be in support of this as I feel equally certain that the Taoiseach would be not only in support but in enthusiastic support of this proposal in view of the fact that he lives there.  I went to the trouble of raising this matter with my party yesterday and I received the permission of the party to enter that amendment. I was given the express support and authority of the leader of our party, Deputy FitzGerald, for the suggestion that the constituency of Dublin North be changed to Dublin Fingal in view of its historic connections.  I do not see why a fellow with as much ability and discretion as I know the present Minister for the Environment has cannot just say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this and tell the other fellows, &ldquo;That is all right, I think is is an improvement&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Tully said, the Minister does not seem to be a free agent here and some order has come from above that this must not be changed under any circumstances.  We are talking about a very minor and innocuous amendment, changing the word &ldquo;North&rdquo; to &ldquo;Fingal&rdquo;.  The point was made that this is known historically as Fingal, a traditional part of North <Col N="1223" /> County Dublin.  Deputy Boland, who represents that area so ably, is in touch with the people's views as to what they would like to have it known as.  He is coming into this House to represent their views, and this is what we are about.  Our business in the House is to represent the point of view of people.  For some strange reason a decision was taken that under no circumstances must this be changed.  It is not that two honourable Members from the same constituency, Minister of State Burke and Deputy Fox, are under orders not to say anything. The silence <i>in toto</i> about this Bill on the other side of the House is a clear indication that the Minister is not his own man here.  He has been instructed that under no circumstances can he accept any amendment.  God knows, a change in name is a technical amendment and still the Minister is reluctant.  I am at a loss.  I am disappointed that the people of the Fingal area of North County Dublin are not going to have this area called what they would like to have it called.</P>
      <P>I hope that as a result of these commissions we will not have changes every other year.  However, we should make this change for no reason other than that the House should have the courage to make some change.  The Minister is failing in his duty to this House if he does not accept this amendment.  Again I appeal to him earnestly to do that.  Deputy Boland has indicated that he will bring it forward on Report Stage.  If it is agreed now there will be no further comment on it and we can proceed in an orderly fashion about concluding the Bill.  The Minister is obstructing the passage of this Bill by not accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> To accept this amendment would make this Bill look more human. It is a soulless sort of Bill with the points of the compass, north, east, south and west referred to.  To accept this little amendment would put a bit of body and soul into it.  It is very difficult to understand <Col N="1224" /> why the Minister refuses to accept it.  He has not given any good reason&mdash;he has not given any reason at all&mdash;while, on the other hand, Deputy Boland has gone back in history and geography to establish a good case.  It makes one give up any hope of getting any change made in legislation in this House when we find a very appropriate and meaningful amendment argued and put forward so well by Deputy Boland being refused by the Minister.  The Minister just sits there and does not say anything.  Obviously he has no convincing or meaningful argument against it. Perhaps he will have another think about it.  If he thinks that there is any political kudos to Deputy Boland in accepting this amendment that is a most unmeritorious reason for not accepting it. He should consult with other Deputies in the constituency and maybe with some of his colleagues if he feels that he must, and if he does so he will come back here after Question Time if the Bill is resumed then and accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>A total of 68 naval recruits (6 classes) of the 239 who enlisted in the Naval Service in 1979 received their initial military training at Collins Barracks, Dublin and Custume Barracks, Athlone.  A total of 34 naval recruits (one class) received their initial military training at Custume Barracks this year.</P>
      <P>It has not been the normal practice to give initial military training to naval recruits in army posts but, as a large number of recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service in the last year, the Army authorities undertook the initial military training of some of them.  The Naval Service carried out the sea training of all of these recruits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The expansion of the Naval Service to enable it to cope with the surveillance of the expanded sea fisheries area of the State by the introduction from time to time of new patrol vessels underlines the <Col N="1227" /> emphasis placed on fishery protection, which is the primary peace-time function of the Naval Service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department undertook a study in 1974 to review the benefits to be derived from providing additional hydrographic data for Irish waters and to estimate the associated costs.  The study revealed that the benefits were not quantifiable.  The costs, at that time, of establishing a hydrographic service were estimated at £1.36 million in capital expenditure and £76,000 a year in running expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1975, the Organisation for European Co-operation and Development published a searching review in relation to Marine Resource Development in <Col N="1228" /> Ireland, in which it was recommended that a National Institute of Oceanography with two major components&mdash;one for hydrography and Oceanography and one for pollution research&mdash;should be established.  The National Board for Science and Technology, to whom consideration of the wider issues in the OECD report has been referred, now has the question of the future development of hydrography plans under examiniation.</P>
    <P>In recent years, all available resources of the Naval Service have been required for the expanded fishery protection task.

      <P>My Department's policy for the protection of the public in the event of nuclear attack is based on the idea of domestic refuge rooms which would give protection against radioactive fallout, the most likely hazard for the country in a nuclear war.  Refuge rooms would be prepared by householders themselves to cater for that hazard.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance is not provided for the construction of such refuge rooms.  Continuing research into the feasibility and effectiveness of refuge rooms is being carried out by my Department and, to date, no factors have emerged to warrant a departure from the advice on this aspect as set out in the Department's booklet, Bás Beatha, which is available free of charge to householders.</P>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to maximise the state of preparedness of the civilian population against all hazards of nuclear war, and, to this end, it is concentrating its efforts on providing information and guidance to the public on protection against fallout radiation.

      <P>The membership of the Industrial Development Consortium is drawn from my Department, the Departments of Finance and Labour, the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the Industrial Credit Corporation, Fóir <Col N="1241" /> Teoranta, An Chomhairle Oiliúna, the Irish Goods Council and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The membership of the consortium is, however, flexible and representatives of other bodies may attend as required.</P>
      <P>The consortium held plenary meetings on seven occasions: 25 January 1978, 23 February 1978, 30 March 1978, 14 June 1978, 20 July 1978, 29 November 1978, 24 January 1980.  There were also many additional meetings of special sub-groups established by the consortium.</P>
      <P>The work of the consortium, which I dealt with in some detail in reply to questions on 13 November 1979, brought about a high level of cohesion and co-operation among State agencies to maximise the contribution of these agencies to industrial development.  This was one of its main objectives.</P>
      <P>The consortium established ten sub-groups to deal with specific matters.  At its last meeting the consortium decided that its work could be more effectively carried out through such sub-groups and at meetings of smaller groups of the people directly involved from within its membership.  It is not expected that the consortium will meet again in its original form but the work which it initiated will be carried on through these smaller groups.</P>
      <P>As I have chaired all the meetings of the consortium, the question of reporting to me does not arise.  Where, however, reports have been prepared by or for any of the sub-groups of the consortium these have been submitted to the relevant Departments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism if his attention has been drawn to the urgent need to provide a suitable industry for Westport, County Mayo, to alleviate the hardship caused by the recent closure of the textile factory there; and if the IDA has any plans to provide an industry in the near future to cater for male employment in the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully alive to the urgent need for new industry in Westport following the recent closure of a textile project located there.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, a US firm announced their intention to establish an industry in Westport which would employ 140 persons.  This company have now decided to defer implementation of the project.  The company have informed the IDA that they will review the position later this year.  If it should transpire that the project is not to go ahead, the IDA will, of course, promote the advance factory in Westport for an alternative industry.</P>
      <P>I would add that as part of its build up to full production, an existing project in the town plans to increase employment over the next few years by about 70. About half of these additional jobs will be for men.  Meanwhile, the IDA are actively seeking a new project to locate in the premises formerly occupied by the failed textile project.</P>
      <P>The authority are also promoting the area generally for industrial development. A 3 x 3,000 square feet cluster unit is to be constructed at Westport and the authority's 13.2 acres site in the town continues to be promoted for industrial development.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Bruton</b> asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism if he has received complaints of low cost carpet imports from the USA disrupting the UK carpet market to the detriment of Irish carpet exports; if he will raise the matter with the EEC authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received specific complaints from industry about this matter but I am aware that Irish carpet exports to the UK have declined because of difficulties on that market, which have been attributed to some extent to imports of American synthetic tufted carpets.  I do not believe that an approach to the EEC authorities on this subject would achieve any useful result. The EEC Commission recently authorised the United Kingdom to impose quota restrictions on imports of polyester yarn and nylon carpet yarn from a number of sources including the USA, but refused a similar British request in respect of synthetic tufted carpets.</P>

      <P>The volume of imports of tufted carpets from the US to the UK market is very small and, according to information we received from the Commission, amounted to only 3.7 per cent of the UK market in 1979.  The evidence available to the Commission seems to indicate that the sale price of US synthetic tufted carpet is at a higher level than other imports to Britain from Community countries.  While undoubtedly the US manufacturers have certain advantages, it seems that the common external tariff plus, presumably, the cost of carriage outweigh these advantages and they do not create major difficulties on the UK market.</P>

I feel, however, that imports would have been far greater but for the efforts of the Irish Goods Council supported by the retail trade.

      <P>The target of the programme for the promotion of Irish goods was to channel the equivalent of an additional 3 per cent of personal consumer expenditure to Irish goods with a similar increase in industrial purchasing. As this target was to be achieved over a three-year period a final assessment of the effectiveness of the programme cannot be made until some time after the completion of the three-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as personal consumer expenditure is concerned it will not be possible to quantify the effects of the programme because consumers' decisions are influenced by so many different factors. However, surveys have indicated that the campaign has been very successful in <Col N="1251" /> increasing consumers' awareness of the importance to the economy of buying Irish goods and of the value for money which Irish goods represent for the consumers.</P>
    <P>In so far as industrial purchasing is concerned it is for obvious reasons easier to quantify the results of the campaign. The Irish Goods Council have identified a wide range of industrial components which were being imported and have succeeded in having such components to a value of £27 million obtained from Irish suppliers in 1978 and 1979.  These orders would represent approximately 1,300 jobs and there is considerable scope for further development in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism if he will make a statement on the dramatic increase in the fuel variation element in ESB charges, as reflected in accounts recently issued; if any price control exists in relation to any aspect of these accounts; and, if not, if he has any proposals for such controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a recommendation by the National Prices Commission, the Government approved an increase in the fuel cost variation surcharge on ESB bills with effect from the February/March 1980 billing period. The increase in the surcharge resulted in an increase of 20.5 per cent on average on electricity prices.  The increase in the surcharge was a result of the continued increase in oil prices in the latter half of 1979 and also in other fuel costs.  During 1979 oil prices to the ESB doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that all increases in ESB charges, both in basic tariffs and in the fuel surcharge, are subject to very detailed examination before being allowed.  Applications to increase <Col N="1260" /> charges are firstly examined thoroughly by the National Prices Commission. Their recommendation is considered by the Government, who take the final decision on any increase in electricity charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it satisfactory that he can get up and announce a price increase in the fuel variation surcharge of over 25 per cent in one period of a few months?  Surely that is not adequate and some effort must be made in accordance with the promises made in the manifesto.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister if an effort must not be made to do something about that.  It is not good enough to come in here and talk about a 25 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a 20.5 per cent increase. I would refer the Deputy back to July 1979 when the National Prices Commission were considering a proposal by the ESB to reactivate the FCV surcharge.  The ESB incurred fuel cost inflation in 1979 and sought the reintroduction of this surcharge as the most appropriate means of achieving a break even position for the accounting year to 31 March 1980.  The commission made recommendations that the ESB be allowed to reactivate the FCV surcharge and that the surcharge be reviewed at four monthly intervals.  The point facing the ESB and the taxpayer was whether the board would be allowed to achieve a break even position for the accounting year ending at 31 March 1980.  If Deputy Keating wants it otherwise he will have to go back and get tax from the taxpayer to pay for the subsidy.</P>

      <P>Under the Tourist Traffic Acts, Bord Fáilte have statutory responsibility to encourage and promote the development of tourist traffic in and to the State.  In the 1980 budget Bord Fáilte were allocated £13,656 million for general administration and marketing and this compares with the sum of £12,465 million allocated in the 1979 budget, £11.0 million in 1978 and £9.337 million in 1977.  In addition to this the national air and sea carriers also spend substantial amounts promoting Ireland.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte launched a massive marketing campaign for 1980 in the main overseas markets and they have recently followed this up with a range of new initiatives in conjunction with the carriers and the many sectors within the industry.

For the first time last year, and the trend is showing up again this year, many people who come to our shores as tourists do not book their holidays now until very late in the season.

Would he not seek to resolve the Aer Lingus dispute as quickly as possible so as to help the tourist trade and would he outline for us the relief he proposes to alleviate the burdens now placed on the tourist trade by the Fianna Fáil Government in the case of fuel and in the case of the 20 per cent inflation rate?

We had a Government before the present Government which imposed a higher increase per gallon than any other Government ever imposed.  Petrol is dear.  We also have to bear in mind that fewer American tourists are coming to Europe now than there are Europeans going to America. That is the situation that must be faced when you go to sell abroad.  When the financial situation in countries abroad is not good, when they are at war or there are rumours of war, they are in a state of unrest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At present Bord Fáilte operate two grant schemes for hotels, one to encourage the upgrading of bedrooms through the addition of private bathroom facilities and the other to meet estimated bedroom requirements over the next couple of years as to numbers and location.  Small hotels in rural areas are benefiting under both schemes. In addition, accommodation providers benefit very substantially from Bord Fáilte expenditure on marketing and promotion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if there were any plans for financial assistance.  There are and I thought he was aware of them.  The last grants for bedroom requirements were on what could be described as a selective scheme. <Col N="1271" /> They are not being channelled to the larger built-up areas but to the smaller hotels.  In regard to the future, I am quite well aware of the situation.  I have met a lot of those people.  There will be a report coming to my office in the not too distant future and I will be looking at this. In the meantime, I do not want to say what will be in the report.

If the Minister met them I am sure they must have told him, the same as they told me, that they are in difficulty at the moment.

Would he accept that the number of tourists, small as they are, who come here seeking accommodation can only get it at a price within their reach in family hotels?  Day by day it is becoming more obvious that the family hotel is more in line with the type of tourists who come here.  Would the Minister make sufficient money available <Col N="1272" /> to ensure that family hotels are kept in the industry?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Dogs Act, 1906, the Garda are empowered to seize stray dogs.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Area, however, stray dogs are dealt with on behalf of the Garda by the Dublin Branch of Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  The Garda give as much attention <Col N="1274" /> to the enforcement of the law in this area as is possible having regard to the demands made on their numbers and resources.  Where there is evidence to sustain charges, and where the owners of the offending dogs can be identified, prosecutions are taken.  Prosecutions are also taken against the owners of unlicensed dogs where ownership can be established. In addition, the Garda exhort dog owners to exercise control over their dogs and point to the damage that dogs can do to sheep flocks.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, empowers planning authorities to provide shelters for stray and unwanted cats and dogs and to assist bodies providing such facilities.  Any extension of the powers of local authorities in this area would be primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  Naturally I, as Minister for State at the Department of Justice, would have no objection to any change that would relieve the Garda of duties in this area.</P>

      <P>The ISPCA held a conference in April 1972 to discuss the problem of stray and unwanted dogs. Subsequently a working committee were formed and they drew up a scheme copies of which were forwarded to my Department and the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Local Government as it was at that time.  The scheme <Col N="1277" /> proposed that dog licence fees be increased to create a fund which would finance a dog warden service and to provide vans and animal shelters for collecting and accommodating stray dogs.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána was consulted about the scheme and agreed that it was both practical and desirable but he did not consider that the garda should be involved in it in any way.  Particularly he was opposed totally to the dog wardens operating from or dog shelters being set up at Garda stations, as proposed in the scheme.</P>

      <P>The special purchase scheme came into operation on 1 August 1978.  From that date to 17 June 1980, 5,210 vesting certificates were issued through the Land Registry under that scheme.  The monthly breakdown of that figure is set out in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.  There is no figure available for the total number of domestic ground rents in the State.</P>
      <P>It is of course, a matter for each owner-occupier concerned to decide for himself or herself whether to take advantage of the exceptionally favourable scheme now available or not to do so. Over 32,000 application forms have been issued and inquiries continue to be received at a steady rate.  The evidence suggests that the existence of the scheme is widely known and also suggests that people are interested but are in no special hurry to proceed to the acquisition of a freehold.  There is another factor, namely, an organised public campaign, with attendent publicity, designed to persuade people not to avail themselves of the scheme.  I can only say that I think that that is bad advice and will in time be proved to be so, though the people who are giving that advice will not, of course, be accountable to anybody for the consequences.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Number of ground rents purchased to date in each month since the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, came into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the much heralded scheme, which was alleged to lead to the abolition of ground rents in fact has resulted to date in the abolition&mdash;if one could call it that&mdash;of approximately 5,000 such ground rents, leaving many thousands still in existence, does the Minister consider that the pledge which his party made that they would introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents has been honoured?  If so, how can he justify the massive public apathy which exists to a scheme which clearly does nothing whatever to abolish ground rents altogether?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever view the Deputy may wish to take as to how the present scheme measures up to any undertaking my party gave, he cannot be in any doubt about the fact that the scheme is much more favourable to owner-occupiers than the scheme promoted by the previous government.  That cannot be denied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister said.  But is the Minister aware that the relative attraction of the scheme has nothing whatever to do with it?  The question I want to ask him is: does he accept that his party's election manifesto made a promise that the Government would introduce a scheme which will lead to the abolition of ground rents? There the words &ldquo;will and &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; are quite categoric and clear.  To date 5,000 have been abolished&mdash;if one can describe it as such&mdash;but many thousands of others have not.  I want to know when legislation will be introduced which will, without equivocation, hesitation or ambiguity, lead to the abolition of ground rents because legislation to date has not done that?</P>

    <P>Under the Juvenile Liaison Scheme, which is operated by the Garda Síochána, juveniles are encouraged by juvenile liaison officers to avoid getting involved in crime.  The function of an officer under the scheme is to maintain contact with any juveniles assigned to him.  The juvenile may be one who has committed an offence and, having been warned, has been informally committed to the care of the officer.  An officer may also be given the care and guidance of a juvenile who, though not known to have committed an offence, may be regarded as a potential delinquent by reason of unsatisfactory behaviour such as persistent truancy, frequenting undesirable places and so on.  Such cases would come to notice through parents, teachers, school attendance officers and other police officers.  Since the commencement of the scheme in 1963 over 13,000 juveniles have come under the <Col N="1291" /> care and supervision of the juvenile liaison officers.  The scheme now operates in Dublin and in 21 major centres of population outside of Dublin.</P>
    <P>A person charged with an offence before a court may be dealt with by that court under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907.  This involves discharging the offender on his entering a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of time.  The bond would normally require the accused to be supervised by a probation and welfare officer of my Department for that period.  There are at present about 1,600 persons under such supervision. The bond could, and frequently does, contain a condition that the offender attend a centre for treatment.  This may be, for example, a drug centre or a centre for the treatment of alcoholism.</P>
    <P>The court may, in certain circumstances, dismiss the charge under the 1907 Act.  A court may also impose a prison sentence and then suspend implementation of the sentence.</P>
    <P>Last year a new scheme was introduced&mdash;the intensive supervision scheme&mdash;which involves suitable offenders being released from custody well in advance of their normal release date. They are released to serve the balance of their sentences under the supervision of probation and welfare officers of my Department.  The supervision is intensive to the extent that each probation and welfare officer would have only five or six offenders to look after.  The indications so far are that this scheme is quite effective.  I intend to expand this scheme as soon as existing vacancies in the probation and welfare service are filled.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering the possibility of introducing some form of community service scheme whereby courts would be empowered to order an offender to do a certain number of hours work for the benefit of the community rather than deal with him in any other way.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons recommends in its report that, where mentally disordered persons are charged before the courts, the courts <Col N="1292" /> should be empowered at the earliest possible opportunity to have the situation medically investigated and to make the appropriate order.  The implementation of the committee's recommendations would mean that many persons who would otherwise be detained in a prison or place of detention under the control of my Department would in future be detained in designated psychiatric centres approved by the Minister for Health.  The report is currently being considered by the various interested Departments.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that comprehensive reply does the Minister see any possible room for consideration of a detoxification centre for people who are clearly, as the expression has it, hooked on drugs or alcohol, which centre could wean off them off these, as it were?

The purpose of the present study is to obtain a reliable estimate of the incidence of permanent job loss in the figures of gross changes in employment thrown up by employment surveys.  As these surveys are conducted on a confidential basis, the results of the study will not be published.  The outcome of the study will not provide a definitive set of statistics of job loss but is expected to <Col N="1304" /> add significantly to existing departmental information for the purposes of analysing changes in manufacturing employment.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement setting out the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The statement will show that the ratio of exports to imports expressed as a percentage showed a decline from 1977 onwards relative to 1973 but up to and including 1975 there was a net excess of exports over imports.  Although exports increased consistently in the period referred to in the Deputy's question, they did not after 1976 grow at the same rate as imports.</P>
      <P>The figures for employment also show reductions by comparison with 1973 but, since 1977, employment in the clothing area has been building up again.</P>
      <P>These sectors were adversely affected, as they were in Europe generally, during the recession in the middle of the 1970's.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

As Minister for Energy at the time, I asked the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to carry out an investigation to determine the cause of the problem and to make recommendations on how best to avoid a recurrence.  The report on this investigation was published by the Stationery Office in December 1979.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the three year period, July 1977 to June 1980, the price of electricity has increased by 46.9 per cent on average.</P>
      <P>Price increases were granted only after detailed examination of ESB applications by the National Prices Commission and following consideration of the commission's recommendations by the Government.  These increases were the minimum necessary to compensate the ESB for unavoidable increased costs.  In this regard I would like to point out that, if price increase proposals by the ESB had been accepted in full, the price of electricity would now be about 6 per cent higher.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw attention to the fact that in the period in question there were two reductions in the price of electricity.  In October 1977 the price of electricity was reduced by 2½ per cent on average and in April 1978 a further reduction of 5 per cent in electricity prices was made.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that in the same period there has been a 100 per cent increase in the cost to the ESB of fuel oil, a product on which the board is heavily dependent and which accounts for a significant portion of the ESB's cost input, the 46.9 per cent increase reflects the sustained effort to keep electricity charges to a minimum.</P>

      <P>With the permission the Ceann Comhairle, <Col N="1311" /> I propose to take Question Nos. 87 to 90, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There has been full compliance with the provisions of section 84 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as regards consultation with the planning authority and with the Minister for the Environment in respect of the prison for women and the place of detention for male juveniles which are to be provided on lands owned by me, as Minister for Justice, at Wheatfield, Clondalkin, County Dublin.  All information required in this connection was made available when consultation took place.</P>
      <P>For obvious reasons it is not the practice to make generally available outside my Department material which discloses particulars even of the general design and plan of any place of custody. Nevertheless, within reason, I am prepared to make information available to the local community.  When I saw the residents' representatives on 17 January last I showed them drawings and illustrative material and their representatives could now be shown a model and have it explained to them.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the acquisition of the lands at Wheatfield, an area of about two-and-a-half acres was exchanged with Dublin Corporation for a slightly smaller area of adjoining land owned by the corporation.  This exchange was made to straighten a very irregular boundary and it was to the mutual benefit of both parties.  No lands owned by Dublin County Council were acquired.</P>
      <P>As regards water and sewerage services, my information is that improved and augmented services are already envisaged for the whole area.  It is intended that these developments will be coordinated with the development of custodial facilities on the Wheatfield lards and that they will materialise in conjunction with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards housing in the area, apart from one or two isolated houses, the housing estates nearest to the site are those known as Ballyfermot Upper, Neilstown and Rowlagh.  They are all about a quarter of a mile away and the <Col N="1312" /> Neilstown and the Rowlagh houses will be even more separated from the site than this distance indicates when the proposed new motorway materialises between them and Wheatfield.  My information is that this motorway development also involves the relocation of the itinerant housing settlement which currently adjoins the property.</P>

    <P>There are no obstacles to loans to the private sector.  However, the types of project eligible so far&mdash;energy and infrastructure investments&mdash;are normally carried out by the public sector.

      <P>The time available does not permit the inspection of all the buildings in the care of the Commissioners of Public Works with a view to the compilation of the comprehensive list requested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is Government policy to facilitate the disabled and for the past five years the Commissioners of Public Works have provided for ease of access for the disabled in the planning of new <Col N="1315" /> buildings.  In general it is proposed to provide access for the disabled in existing buildings in conjunction with maintenance and improvement works as opportunity offers, but in certain existing buildings, where there was a pressing need for such facilities, they have already carried out the necessary adaptations. It is often not possible in older buildings, because of planning difficulties to provide suitable access. Similarly in large office buildings where the State has a leasehold interest of part only of the building and has not direct control of the entrances it is not always possible to insist on access for the disabled.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of buildings to be dealt with and most of them have still to be adapted.  As there is a limit to the resources of personnel and finance that can be made available to this purpose it is likely to be some years before the desired objective of access to all public buildings for the disabled can be achieved.</P>

Reports are still awaited in respect of Counties Louth and Wexford and Limerick City.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the circular letter was to obtain general reports on the position in each area to enable the extent of the problem to be assessed in advance of the finalisation of proposals.  The circular letter did not invite applications for assistance and accordingly full details including names of individual estates were not supplied by all authorities. Similarly not all authorities specifically sought assistance in respect of individual estates.  Accordingly full details on the lines requested by the Deputy are not available.</P>
      <P>Proposals are at present being considered to assist planning authorities to take in charge and complete those estates where insuperable problems have arisen in achieving their completion. When details of a scheme are approved local authorities will be notified.

      <P>With the advent of digital exchange technology, the opportunity is now being taken to instal that type of equipment at Kells.  It is expected that this digital exchange, which has already been ordered, will be in service in the third quarter, 1981.  It is now planned to convert the other exchanges in the Kells group around the same time, also by means of digital equipment.</P>
      <P>Conversion of Kells by means of a mobile automatic exchange had been envisaged as an interim arrangement to facilitate earlier change-over but this could not now be effected until the second quarter of 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> The marginal gain in time that would result would not warrant the extra cost and staff resources which will instead be devoted to the conversion of the Kells group of exchanges as a single project.</P>
