    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> Since this is the first Estimate for the new Department of Energy to be the subject of a full debate in the House, I am sure that Deputies would wish me, in presenting it, to outline the role which I see for the Department and, in very broad terms, the objectives which we should set ourselves.  I shall endeavour in the time available to me to cover as much of the ground as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like first to comment briefly on minerals exploration and development and then to outline in more detail the circumstances which gave rise to the specific provision which is made in the Supplementary Estimate before going on to deal with energy issues.</P>
    <P>The promotion of minerals exploration and development is an important sector of the area of my responsibility.  I intend to continue to facilitate and support the prospecting and mining companies in their efforts to find new deposits and to maintain operations at existing mines.  There has been comment from time to time on the fact that no new minerals deposit has been established as commercial since the discovery of the Navan orebody.  This is certainly not due to lack of interest or endeavour by the companies engaged in exploration here&mdash;prospecting activity throughout the country continues at a high level. Certain deposits of potential interest have been identified.  The possible development of these depends on the outcome of further exploration and delineation work and on the trend of world trade in the minerals concerned or on a combination of these factors.  If the general pace of exploration and prospecting can be maintained at satisfactory levels I think there are reasonable prospects for the discovery and development of new commercial production in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Production continues at the lead and zinc mines at Navan, Silvermines and Tynagh and at the copper mine at Avoca.  Within the next month or so a stage will be reached at Tynagh where the underground ore reserves will be exhausted but it is expected that work will <Col N="564" /> continue there for a limited period on the treatment of tailings and of stock-piled ores at the mine.</P>
    <P>In the present situation of economic recession throughout the world the base metals markets for zinc and copper particularly have been depressed.  A number of mines around the world have been closed in recent years.  Others have been kept going only through State subvention of their operations.  The current low level of copper prices on world markets has been one of the factors which has given rise to fresh cash flow problems at the Avoca mine which necessitate further State support.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that a Supplementary Estimate was approved on 3 April, 1979 to provide State support amounting to £4.35 million for Avoca Mines Ltd.  This followed consideration by the Government of a report on the Avoca Mine operation by a firm of international mining consultants which concluded that, making certain assumptions about future copper prices and other critical factors, a mining programme over a period of about four years would hold out the prospect of recovery over that period of all, or a significant part of, the State funds amounting to £4.35 million which would have to be committed up to the end of 1979.</P>
    <P>The mining programme was based on forecast copper prices which seemed optimistic at the time but were, in fact, exceeded during 1979, with the result that the operating loss for the year was £133,000 as compared with an anticipated loss of £250,000.  The result would have been even better were it not for a sharp rise in operating costs, a deterioration in the grade of ore mined and difficulties encountered in maintaining ore output at the desired level of 65,000 tonnes per month.</P>
    <P>Operations at Avoca have been kept under constant review and an independent study of the copper market has been obtained from a London firm of consultants.  It is clear from trends in copper prices and the adverse elements I have mentioned, which have persisted in <Col N="565" /> 1980 to date, that it is unlikely that the relatively favourable outcome hoped for at the beginning of 1979 can now be achieved.  The current break-even price per tonne of copper for the company would be about IR£1,300 compared with the current market price of about IR£920, which means that significant losses are being incurred.  A further major problem is that the ore reserves available may now not extend beyond about September 1981.</P>
    <P>The Government have carefully considered the position in the light of the economic and social consequences which should arise from closure of the mine and the dis-employment of the 246 men involved directly in mining and the other ancillary employment involved. Prospects for new jobs in the area from IDA projects are reasonable but it would take some time for these projects to come onstream.  In the circumstances, the Government have decided to provide additional finance, as indicated in the Estimate, to maintain mining operations for the time being.  My Department will continue to monitor very closely the situation at the mine.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from my remarks so far that the development of our mining resources is an area of my responsibility which must continue to receive close attention. One of the most heartening developments of recent years is the practical proof we have seen that the older schoolbook picture of Ireland as a country seriously lacking in minerals resources was far from true.  Today, the great cause for concern is our heavy dependence on imported, expensive energy sources.  I believe&mdash;and indeed it will be the major, broad objective of my Department to realise that prospect&mdash;that before the end of the present century we will have achieved breakthroughs in the development of indigenous energy sources no less emphatic that what has been achieved in relation to minerals.</P>
    <P>During 1979, particularly about this time last year, we all witnessed&mdash;and indeed contributed to&mdash;the reaction of the oil-consuming countries to what was, in <Col N="566" /> fact, a relatively moderate shortfall in overall supplies.  In the past year oil and energy prices generally have escalated dramatically.  In common with other consuming nations we have taken a severe knock to our balance of payments and more generally to our economic prospects.  This year we have been fortunate that supplies have so far been adequate to meet demand but this is occuring against a background of continuing political tension and uncertainty in the middle East and a sharply increasing price trend.  There is no certainty, therefore, that the supply problems of last year or even worse cannot occur at short notice.</P>
    <P>It is only within the past few years that the concept of an integrated national energy policy has become a preoccupation of governments.  In the days of cheap and plentiful energy it was a relatively easy burden to support an economy which was wasteful, indeed profligate, in its use of fuel and power.  In the narrow context of those times it seemed economic silliness to allocate any substantial funds to saving or substituting other fuels for oil which was in abundant supply at $2 a barrel, at least $30 a barrel less than the present average price of crude oil.  After the supply and price crisis of 1973-74 there was a flurry of activity, nationally and internationally, on proposals to reduce the vulnerability of consuming nations which the crisis had so painfully highlighted.  Within a year or two, with oil once again readily available and with prices dropping in real terms, a lot of the edge had gone off this earlier resolve.</P>
    <P>But the recent crisis carried a more forceful message that the days of cheap and plentiful energy were dead and gone. There will again be periods such as now when adequate supplies&mdash;some people even talk of a surplus&mdash;may seem to emerge.  Nevertheless there is now general consensus among market observers that, even leaving aside the impact of political upheavals in producing areas which seem all too likely to occur, the long-term prospects point to recurring <Col N="567" /> acute pressures on supplies and prices.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the development of certain long-term policies in the energy field is not just prudent but is essential for our economic and social well-being. The principal dilemma which we face can be very simply defined.  Irrespective of the success or good fortune we may have in developing or discovering substantial domestic sources of energy, the plain fact is that for a number of years to come the great bulk of our energy requirements must of necessity continue to be imported at increasing cost in terms of internal prices and the strain on our balance of payments. This is an inescapable consequence of the length of time necessary to bring new resources, or additional production of existing resources, onto the market.  This fact of life must be reflected in our energy planning.</P>
    <P>A major objective of policy will be to ensure that our import dependency will be spread over as many fuel types as possible, that these imports will be used in an optimal way and that our ability to cope with interruptions of supply will be improved.  We must have effective contingency plans to meet import shortages of various dimensions.  The stocks of fuel immediately available in this country to meet any serious disruption of supply are not adequate and steps are being taken to put them on a more acceptable footing.  We must continue the process of securing firm, government-to-government arrangements for a certain proportion of our oil supplies and we must see to what extent comparable arrangements could be made for other fuels.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation have, in the short period since they were set up, made very good progress towards achieving their initial objectives.  Like my own Department the corporation have had the problem of getting down to business while at the same time providing themselves with the staff and other resources necessary for <Col N="568" /> their work.  By the autumn the corporation will be handling a substantial volume of crude oil arising from government-to-government contracts already concluded.  The possibilities of obtaining supplies on a similar basis from other quarters continue to be pursued actively.  There remains the question of the long-term, corporate strategy for the corporation and this is something that I will be discussing with them in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The foregoing measures are designed to secure an improvement in the security of our imported supplies but the use of these energy sources, and indeed of all energy forms, in various sectors must be critically examined so that we will have a realistic plan&mdash;not necessarily an inflexible nor an immutable one&mdash;for the optimum use of energy forms and fuels. This involves conservation, substitution and, perhaps, some specific measures to influence demand for certain fuels.</P>
    <P>When the Department was being established, I provided for a new section in the organisation specifically to deal with energy conservation.  This section is working on an overall energy conservation programme which will be an integral part of my strategy, co-ordinating the many initiatives taken in recent years, giving a new focus to conservation and the opportunities which it presents and drawing up new proposals in which specific targets for conservation on a sectoral basis will be set.</P>
    <P>The key element in conservation is to make more effective use of the fuels available to us.  I have already announced a major initiative which, if certain important conditions can be met, could over a period of years bring about a major change in our present pattern of energy use.  I refer to the possibility of constructing a pipeline to connect Dublin and possibly other towns near the selected route to the natural gas supply in the Kinsale Head field.  If this project goes ahead on planned lines the result would be to transfer a very substantial proportion of the heating and cooking load in a number of major population centres from oil or oil-based fuels <Col N="569" /> to a native gas supply and to use that supply in a more energy-efficient way.  I have asked the Dublin Gas Co. to produce a development plan aimed at eliminating identified inefficiencies in management and work procedures which is intended to plot the transition to a modern, efficient gas company.  Bord Gáis Éireann would have a big role to play in the planning and development of such a major national undertaking as an extended natural gas system.  The first phase of the board's operations in the Cork area was completed well on time and with commendable regard to the financial aspects of the project.  This work will have enabled the board to get expertise and practical experience of a kind which should prove invaluable in the planning, construction and management of an extended grid.</P>
    <P>The next main objective must be to reduce our excessive import dependency by development of alternative, home-produced energy sources.  This involves expansion of existing production of indigenous energy resources and the search for new native resources.  At present about 80 per cent of our energy requirements are imported and this ratio has been increasing as a result of the growth in the economy and related demand for energy.  This is far, far too high.</P>
    <P>I have already taken steps to have our known limited supplies of native coal examined. Planning is proceeding for the design and construction of a new electricity generating station which will apply the very latest technology to the burning of low grade coal deposits in the Arigna area.  Research work on the extensive use of this technology for utilising other low grade fuel sources is under way.  The potential of our admittedly limited reserves of untapped hydro resources is being urgently reviewed.</P>
    <P>I have recently had the opportunity, during the course of the debate on the Turf Development Bill 1980, of outlining in very considerable detail to the House the immediate and longer-term plans for Bord na Móna.  It will suffice now to remind the House that these plans call for <Col N="570" /> a very substantial increase in the board's output, particularly of milled peat, to be used for new electricity generating stations and for new briquette factories, the first of which should be in production next year.</P>
    <P>There is also substantial annual production of peat by a small number of private producers and co-operatives, by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and by individual farmers.  I am most anxious to encourage private development on bogs which are not suitable for méchancial large scale commercial exploitation by Bord na Móna.  With this in mind my Department are currently considering the formation of schemes to co-ordinate and promote bog development by private interests.</P>
    <P>World wide there is now a substantial concentration of research and development on new energy systems and I am ensuring, through my Department and their agencies, that we are fully conversant with the programmes in this area which seem of most interest to us.  Our geographical position and our climate suggest that wind and wave energy are likely to be possibilities of considerable interest.  The commercial production of power from wave energy is inevitably many years in the future.  The present state of research is at the classical initial stage where the design and testing of quite a variety of systems is in progress. We are keeping in close touch with the most promising areas of research and when the range of options and potential performance of systems become better established I intend to examine the possibility of having pilot work done here.</P>
    <P>The wind has been harnessed to provide power for centuries but the specifications in today's world for the manner and scale in which this power must be delivered have necessitated a completely new look at this very old technology.  It is quite clear that there is considerable potential for developing wind power systems in Ireland.  There have been two extremes of opinion on this and I can assure the House that I regard both with some caution.  There can be no assumption&mdash;and certainly <Col N="571" /> not until suitable pilot schemes have been developed and tested over a period of time&mdash;that the development of wind power can largely solve our current dependence on imported fuels.  Claims of that kind will only result in disappointment if results are obtained which seem limited in that context but may well be very acceptable in realistic terms. Neither do I accept that the potential of this source is insignificant in national terms.  The answer to that one is that to date we simply have not tried.</P>
    <P>I announced the preliminary steps of a new wind power programme at the end of March last when I indicated that I had commissioned the National Board for Science and Technology to examine the steps necessary to set up four pilot wind energy projects.  I mentioned on that occasion four project types on which the views of the NBST were sought.  These were a coastal/mountain project, a midland located project, an island project and a wind energy machine linked to an agricultural co-operative or small rural industry.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I announced on 19 May that I had agreed to the appointment of a firm of consulting engineers who had been given the specific task of picking a site on Inis Oirr for the island demonstration project machine.  The consultants were also asked to indicate the most appropriate type of machine to erect.  The aim is that the installation will supply about one-third of the island's current needs.  I chose Inis Oirr because I have been very impressed with the detailed work on the advantages of windpower to an island community which has been carried out by the enterprising local co-op on the island.</P>
    <P>I expect to have shortly the report of the NBST on the other projects.  It is my intention to ensure that all wind machines that were installed as part of this programme are comprehensively and uniformly instrumented so that the data can be centrally and economically analysed and that the results of the experimental programme can become <Col N="572" /> available at the earliest possible date.  To ensure that this will be achieved I intend also to circulate the NBST proposals to a number of State agencies and in particular to the ESB, which is one of the most highly regarded electricity utilities in the world.</P>
    <P>One further point which I would like to repeat from my announcement on 19 May is that these projects are only part of a broader programme which I am preparing aimed at assessing in a complete fashion the potential contribution of wind energy.</P>
    <P>I have asked the ESB to take a more active and positive line on research into alternative forms of energy.  I appreciate the work which the board have carried out into, for instance, low grade &ldquo;crow&rdquo; coal from Arigna, biomass conversion and timber combustion and their contribution to research into wind, wave and tidal power.  I am confident that they will step up their efforts successfully in this field.  I have asked them to co-ordinate their efforts with those of other interested bodies in view of the importance of the role which the board can play in the development of viable indigenous resources.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to dwell on the importance which must be attached to our offshore exploration programmes.  The discovery of a commercial oil field would bring about such a change in our future energy position that it overshadows all the other possibilities which I have mentioned.  Offshore exploration over the next couple of years will be crucial and it is an area in which I intend to apply all the effort and resources necessary to ensure that exploration is pushed ahead as vigorously as possible.</P>
    <P>Fifty-six exploratory wells have been drilled in our offshore territory since operations commenced and every effort is being made within my Department to encourage the exploration companies to maintain the exploration momentum so that the existence of a commercial deposit of hydrocarbons will be established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> The results to date and, in particular, those from 1978 and 1979 have been very promising and they have established that hydrocarbons do exist in our offshore territory.  The flow rate of 730 barrels per day from a 1978 well in the Porcupine, together with a flow rate of over 5,500 barrels per day tested last year, also in the Porcupine, have encouraged us to hope that within not too many years we will be producing Irish oil.  These recent results have stimulated an interest in our offshore to such an extent that a number of companies have entered into arrangements for the allocation of further acreage.</P>
    <P>There will be further exploration and appraisal of the prospects in the Porcupine this year.  The two companies who discovered the sub-commercial deposits will shortly commence drilling further wells in the area.</P>
    <P>Whether oil finds in the hostile environment of the Porcupine will be developed will ultimately depend on the size of the discovery, the amount that can be recovered, and the availability of the technology at a cost which will make the undertaking a commercial proposition. Based on recent advances in recovery methods from conditions similar to the Porcupine, we are confident that the technology will be available when required.  However, even if significant deposits are discovered, and if the technology is available to exploit them, it would be some time before the oil would begin to flow on shore.  The great water depths at which oil is likely to be found would inevitably slow down operations. Thus, even if a potentially commercial oil find were identified quite soon, we would be talking about the mid eighties before this oil would begin to be landed.</P>
    <P>The frontiers of our exploration have recently been pushed forward with the allocation of additional acreage on an option basis to two major companies in the Goban spur area.  They have undertaken to carry out extensive seismic surveys over the area during the period of the option.  This area is about 170 miles <Col N="574" /> to the south-west of Ireland in water depths ranging from 2,000-5,000 feet. Obviously, these companies would not invest heavily in terms of money and effort if they did not feel the area had potential and also that the necessary technology would be available to exploit any finds made.</P>
    <P>I have outlined four of the major planks of national energy policy.  These are, efforts to improve the security of imported supply arrangements and stocks, conservation and more effective use of all energy forms available to us, in particular those fuels which must be imported, the maximum development of our existing sources of energy and a strong emphasis on the search for new indigenous sources.</P>
    <P>The next major objective of policy I would like to mention is that we must develop flexibility in the use of various energy sources so as to achieve a better spread of the import dependency which we cannot avoid in the medium term. This would, in time, permit a better response to changes in supplies and prices.  In this area the ESB have a major role to play.  About one-third of our energy consumption is in the form of electricity.  Electricity is now our one absolutely essential form of energy which can be derived from a variety of primary energy sources but this vital resource is at present heavily dependent on imported oil.</P>
    <P>For the immediate future, the board can do little to change this heavy dependence because of the lead time required for the construction of new generating stations.  However, the board are constantly endeavouring to maximise use of existing plant utilising indigenous resources&mdash;mainly peat, hydro and natural gas, with a small contribution from native coal.  For future plant, they have taken steps to diversify a large part of electricity generation from, for instance, imported coal instead of oil. Discussions I had recently with the board members showed that they were fully aware of the vital importance of diversification, both of fuels and of <Col N="575" /> sources, in the interests of security of supplies.</P>
    <P>The Board have also assured me of their willingness to play an increased part in the national campaign to eliminate the wasteful use of energy.  The board offered their co-operation in any measures which may be necessary to avoid a significant demand transference to electricity, and in measures which will serve to ensure that different forms of energy are used to the best economic advantage having regard to national circumstances.</P>
    <P>Industry too can play a vital role in this area.  There is a renewed interest by industry in the use of coal rather than oil both on grounds of cost and diversity of sources of supply and this must be encouraged. Liquid petroleum gas&mdash;LPG&mdash;is a widely used fuel for heating and cooking, particularly in rural areas and it is used by industry and transportation.  Within the past year or so there have been quite conflicting views about the medium to long-term supply prospects for this fuel.  Recent reports suggest that these prospects are now considered fairly good and I believe we should continue to regard LPG as a major element&mdash;with solid fuel&mdash;in planning diversification of our energy imports.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the last major option in diversifying sources of energy supplies.  I refer to the question of nuclear power which has been&mdash;and remains&mdash;a complex, controversial and emotive issue. Since I took office I have on a number of occasions indicated my general attitude on this.  It is obvious that nobody, and I can say least of all myself, is anxious to pursue the nuclear issue simply as a matter of principle.  The great majority of people would regard it as a very acceptable outcome if it were to be established that our national energy requirements, both in supply and economic terms, did not require an early decision to construct a nuclear power station.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention, at this time, to prejudge either way the ultimate decision <Col N="576" /> on the desirability or need of a nuclear power plant.  Certain factors&mdash;the principal one being the slowdown in the world economy which has affected our rate of economic growth&mdash;have arisen which give us some additional time to assess the position.  I intend to use that time for two purposes.  Firstly, as I have already outlined in detail, we must thoroughly investigate the extent to which our future energy needs can be met by expansion of our current resources, a more effective use of all energy forms and, most importantly, the development of new indigenous resources.  Secondly, we must assemble as much information as possible and benefit to the maximum extent from experience elsewhere about the safety aspects of nuclear power.</P>
    <P>The analysis of our future energy needs and of the latest developments affecting safety will emerge, in the first instance, from a detailed and factual review of all the parameters involved. When this data base is available and taken account of in the work being done by the inter-departmental committee, their report will be published and we will then reach a stage at which an informed public debate and inquiry could proceed. It will obviously be essential that, before it reports, the committee will have had an opportunity of studying all the crucial information in relation to the Harrisburg incident and I understand that some of this information is unlikely to be available for a considerable time.  It would be premature to bring the committee's report to a conclusion before this information is available and do so would be contrary to my conviction that the future public debate and inquiry into this issue must be conducted with all the relevant information available.</P>
    <P>The initial timetable envisaged that the committee would report in time to enable the necessary legislation to be prepared and the public inquiry to be commenced during the present year.  It is clear that this timetable will not be adhered to.  There have been suggestions that a date should be set for the inquiry or at least that the necessary legislation <Col N="577" /> should be introduced.  I fail to see the logic of those suggestions in present circumstances. While the timetable envisaged in the original proposals will not now be observed, the sequence of events set out in these proposals should stand. There is a validity and logic in the relationship between progress on the committee's report, the introduction of the legislation and the holding of the inquiry which have not been affected by the changed timetable.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on the nuclear issue by saying this.  What is really crucial in this matter is that, at the end of the day, when all the factors such as energy demand projections, alternative sources, the economics and security of supply parameters, the environmental and safety aspects have been first examined and reported on objectively and then reviewed in a public forum&mdash;after that long and painstaking process&mdash;the decision which emerges, whatever it may be, should be seen by the great majority of reasonable people as justified and prudent.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined represents a many-sided and, in certain respects, an ambitious role and programme of work for the Department of Energy.  The achievement of satisfactory progress towards these objectives will require assistance and co-operation from many quarters.  I intend to make full use of the experience and expertise available within existing State agencies, particularly, but not exclsively, those associated with my Department.  The relationships between the new Department of Energy and these agencies are therefore extremely important. The effective development of such relationships is central to the task I have set myelf.  I have already initiated, through discussion with the boards of semi-State bodies under my aegis, a dialogue which I hope will develop and contribute to policy formation and implementation. There are also important sources of knowledge and competence in the private sector and in the universities and other higher educational centres.  It will be an important function of my Department to tap these resources <Col N="578" /> so that the best use can be made of all our talents natinally.</P>
    <P>In order that effective policies can be devised and implemented I have concentrated on developing a structure for the new Department appropriate to its important task.  Central to this structure will be a properly staffed Planning and Finance Division which will concentrate on the policy priorities.  The new Department will also develop its own technical competence.  This is essential if the Department of Energy is to be in a position properly to evaluate and co-ordinate the programmes of State energy agencies.</P>
    <P>There are obvious constraints.  Time is needed.  People must be recruited, motivated and, if necessary, trained to handle and co-ordinate the work.  A great deal of the data and information on energy supply and use which we need to review and develop policy options is either incomplete or not available.  This has to be assembled and put in usable form.  Funds have to be provided.  On top of this there are urgent day-to-day problems which cannot be left aside while the medium- and long-term programmes are being developed.</P>
    <P>But it would be wrong to emphasise the constraints without also pointing to the very positive factors from which I take considerable encouragement.  The work to be done is of the highest national importance.  There is widespread recognition of this with the public generally and among the people in industry, agriculture, transport, commerce and other sectors on whose help and co-operation we must rely.  I believe that there is a very substantial consensus on the main objectives which we should adopt.</P>
    <P>The great uncertain factor is, unfortunately, outside our control.  It is one I have already mentioned&mdash;the time factor. Despite the current easing of the supply situation, the international outlook is fraught with uncertainties.  If we could be reasonably assured that the next two or three years will be relatively free from major supply crises, then we <Col N="579" /> could feel a lot more confident of getting under way the kind of major adaptations in our energy posture which are essential to meet the inevitable difficulties which will arise in the later eighties and beyond.</P>

I hope the Minister will not think I am saying this in any condescending sense but I thought his speech an extremely good and useful one and the best Ministerial speech I have heard from the Government side on this subject since 1977.  I hope the Minister will not mind if I draw attention to the fact that he is describing, as I said yesterday during Question Time, a delicate but very pronounced U-turn in energy policy.  He has had the task of taking over from a Minister of somewhat different temperament, whose heart I know in a general way is in the right place but whose temperament, unfortunately, very often obstructs that heart in such a way that what comes out is in an unpalatable form and very often wrong also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> The Minister who preceded the Tánaiste in the energy responsibility did not have the Tánaiste's open mind on nuclear development.  He frequently said here and outside also that we had no option but to go for nuclear development and the White Paper called &ldquo;Energy Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;let me put in a word of protest here against these ghastly titles for papers and discussion documents, official and otherwise, those who think it is modern and acceptable to produce two nouns or noun-phrases in apposition as though they mean anything.  What does &ldquo;Energy Ireland&rdquo; mean?  I think I know what it means because we have had so many examples of it but that document, &ldquo;Energy Ireland&rdquo;, if we must call it by its official name, is also saying that there was no option but to go for nuclear development.  So, it was not simply Deputy O'Malley, it was also his advisers who took that line about it.</P>
    <P>In addition, I think it is not unfair to Deputy O'Malley's Ministerial memory &mdash;to put it that way&mdash;to say that he was fairly lukewarm on the subject of conservation. He would throw it a crust every now and then but that was all.  It emerged here under questioning in 1978 that whereas the publicity budget for energy conservation in the last year for which Deputy Barry was responsible has been £70,000, the amount allocated in the first year of Deputy O'Malley's governership of that part of Kildare Street was £80.  I am sorry&mdash;I think that was the amount spent up to the time I asked the question.  I concluded that the £80 represented not an independent estimate but just a bill that had been mis-laid and left over from the previous year and which was being paid a bit late.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure if mere exhortation on television or in the media in regard to energy conservation is that effective.  I hope it is.  I am willing to make an act of faith in it, I am willing to urge that it be continued and I am willing to praise the Minister for intensifying the campaign which Deputy Peter Barry first inaugurated. I am not too sure if it is all that effective compared with the money and effort which goes into it.  But at least <Col N="581" /> we have to start somewhere and try by an operation, which is like letting drips of water fall on stone, to make an impact on people's minds in this regard.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister in charge of energy had not a lot of time, at least to judge by some of his actions as distinct from his words, for energy conservation and did not think there was a lot to be gained by pursuing it.  He was also very dismissive about alternative sources of energy&mdash;wind, tides, biomass, solar cells and so forth.  I agree that he may have been provoked into such a stance by the exaggerated claims made for those alternative sources by well meaning groups who took no heed of economics.  At the same time I am glad to see that the Minister has now acknowledged the long-term and even the short-term possibilities inherent in some of these newer sources.</P>
    <P>It also has to be said that the previous Minister would not hear anything said in favour of the construction of a gas line to Dublin to take the product of the Kinsale field.  This Minister seems to have put that policy into reverse.  I welcome the changed direction.  I bid farewell to the former Minister.  I hope we will part friends, but I thought his tenure of this section was not helpful.  So far as the management of petrol supplies went in spring of last year, I thought it was a disaster. I have to say, quite frankly, that the former Minister, Deputy O'Malley, would be the first to despise any form of compliment and no man was ever worse at concealing his contempt than that Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changed direction of the new Minister for Energy and I do not want to harp unduly on this matter because it must be difficult for him to do this to a valued colleague.  Naturally it is welcome and so far as this party are concerned he will get nothing but constructive support from us, at least for as long as I am in charge of this spokesmanship and I believe at any other time as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to give this party credit in some measure for the changed direction <Col N="582" /> the Minister has shown.  I believe it has been in part the reiterated urgings from this side of the House that have led to a change of heart in the Department and perhaps in the Minister's mind.  I do not complain about this because that is what politics is about.  I will even go so far as to say that our written contribution on this subject, our policy document published last May, has been responsible&mdash;though perhaps in its pre-published form&mdash;for a good deal of the Minister's very welcome recent pronouncements.  I do not expect him to either confirm or deny that, for I suspect that a fair number of our recommendations had filtered through to his Department. More power to him if he was able to get hold of them and more power to him if he made speeches emphasising points which we are glad to see emphasised, whoever makes them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to strike a critical note but I would like to point out to the House, in spite of the Minister's evidently very welcome and very praiseworthy general attitude towards this problem, that so far we have had from him in the very short time he has been in this office very little more than talk and exhortations. Perhaps I should say that I very much admire the spirit with which he has accepted the burden of this new Department and is determined to make a success of it.  I would like to say to him that more will be needed than the exhortation and the good advice which he dispenses daily in the newspapers.  I would like to remind him that there are measures literally within his reach, either within his existing statutory range, within the statutory range of his colleagues or within the legislative power of this House and the other House to confer on him.  These are measures which his colleagues in Government could activate.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of examples but there are a few examples which will give an idea of what I mean when I say there are things he could do this minute without any more exhortation to anybody else.  I will give a very simple example.  About two years ago, in 1978, <Col N="583" /> the EEC issued a directive in regard to the labelling of electrical appliances.  We should all know by now that a casually plugged in electric fire is a grossly wasteful form of electricity consumption and ultimately of oil consumnption, because four-fifths of our electricity is generated from that source.  This is very wasteful.  I believe the EEC are right in saying that the consumer should be made aware of the relative consumption implication of an appliance by it being clearly labelled before he buys it.  The EEC even went to the length of describing the colour in which those labels were to be affixed so that there would be a standard orange label on every electric appliance to which the customer would eventually grow accustomed and at which he would look before buying.</P>
    <P>It is true that the average layman may not be able to make much sense of watts and kilowatts let alone megatons or any of those other symbols to which we have become accustomed.  I suggest, in the rather simpler context of the Irish population, that orange label might be made contain a further dimension&mdash;a rough computation, without being in any sense binding, of how much it costs to run the thing for an hour at current prices.  I know prices go up very frequently, but let us say as of 1 January of a particular year, I cannot see that it would be much of a problem for the Minister to exert the power which the EEC requires him to take onto himself, and perhaps automatically requires him to exercise, of requiring the compulsory labelling of new electric appliances to show how much it will cost the customer in money&mdash;he will understand that far better than the megaton&mdash;to run this appliance for five minutes, an hour or any length of time.  An electric immersion heater should carry and ordinary label saying: &ldquo;To heat this up to bath heat costs 60p&rdquo; or whatever it is and an electric fire should carry an orange label saying: &ldquo;To run this appliance with one bar for half an hour will cost 40p, with two bars cost 70p&rdquo; or whatever it may be.  That will make more sense to the <Col N="584" /> customer and I believe will be more of an incentive not to buy the appliance at all or to be very guarded in its use than anything else which could be devised in the way of advertising.</P>
    <P>This could even stretch down to electric light bulbs, which I know do not use very much power.  When I pass Government buildings, very often at a time when their daily occupants have long since gone home and are looking at television, putting their feet up or helping their children with their exercises, I find that those buildings are blazing with light.  I presume this is in order to facilitate the cleaners who are operating at that time.  I cannot believe the cleaning operation requires hundreds and sometimes thousands of light bulbs to be in operation. Even the humble 40 watt or 60 watt electric light bulb should carry a little orange ticket when it is being sold telling the consumer how much it will cost him if he goes out of a room and leaves it on needlessly for half an hour.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's mind appears to be working in regard to this topic in the very same way as mine.  I am not trying to persuade him as I believe his mind is open to this sort of stuff, but the cumulative effect of a relatively simple measure like that would be enormous.  It is not even as though it were something we had to think up for ourselves.  The EEC thought it up for us two years ago and told us to do it.  All I am suggesting is that the EEC's idea should be extended by the addition of the price which it will cost the consumer, rather than the wattage, which means very little to him.</P>
    <P>A second thing over which the Government have immediate control &mdash;and I mentioned this during Question Time yesterday&mdash;is to introduce effective monitoring, to use another Upper Merrion Street word, and control of energy expenditure in the State's own sphere&mdash;in other words, the use of heat in Government buildings, the use of light in Government buildings, the use of fuel in Government vehicles.  These things may not seem a lot, but the actual proportion of office space in this city rented by the Government, and for <Col N="585" /> which they are responsible in regard to running costs, is gigantic.  If you throw in the various offices which they have throughout the country, if you throw in on top of that the local authorities, who presumably are susceptible one way or another to Government pressure, and if you add the semi-State bodies, in other words, if you lump the public sector together&mdash;although I recognise that the degree of control which the Minister exercises over them diminishes as one moves over to Bord na gCon and Bord na gCapall and An Coimisiún Dumpála, and is not perhaps as immediate as his power to order switches to be turned off in Kildare Street&mdash;this mass of State-owned buildings is an absolute empire.  If you put these buildings all together you would probably end up with a conurbation roughly the size of Cork.  I am not far off the mark in putting it at that size. Proper control of energy consumption in an empire of that size would make a perceptible difference in the conservation effort. If you throw into the reckoning as well all the vehicles used by semi-State bodies, in the first instance by CIE, the dent which that would make in our oil imports would be quite palpable after a year or so of effective operation.</P>
    <P>The real point I want to get at is this.  I saw that the Minister was advising the private sector and private firms the other day to carry out an energy audit.  With great respect to the man I have just been praising, that really is a case of teaching your grandmother to suck eggs.  I am never quite too sure why grandmothers are regarded as experts in the art of egg sucking and not requiring any instruction. My granny certainly never sucked eggs, or I never caught her at it.  She may have had a secret addiction to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps my granny was too long gone from the country.  I had to laugh to see the Minister advising firms, who are up to their eyes with problems of cost control and trying to meet interest payments, on how to cut down on <Col N="586" /> energy consumption.  They have to pay for it.  The office manager in a private firm, or the industrial manager who sees power being wasted, knows that he will have to pay for it, whereas the civil servant or the public servant can go out of a room leaving 47 strip lights on, go off for his lunch or his coffee and come back again and they are still burning away and not one halfpenny comes out of his pocket.  There may be no one there to see he does not do it.  I am sorry to put it in such a pointed way.  I am probably an offender in this respect.  I am a public servant of a sort myself.  I do not mean to be singling out public servants particularly. We all tend to be wasteful.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, it is ludicrous for him to be making these essentially excellent suggestions to the very sector who are most cost conscious when his own sector, the biggest in the country, are notoriously very little cost conscious, as their reckless recruitment of extra people to push pieces of paper round to one another amply demonstrates.</P>
      <P>So far as the private sector is susceptible to persuasion in this regard&mdash;and I am talking about the private business sector which the Minister addressed&mdash;I do not think they will react, if there is any scope for economy there.  I do not think they will feel in their bones that this is something they should do until they see the State doing it, any more than they will speak Irish until they find everybody in the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party, and the entire public sector, doing so at home as well as when they are under the light of public notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I agree very much with something the Minister said towards the end of his speech.  He referred to the consensus which exists in regard to the necessity for energy conservation.  He related it quite properly to the frightful hole in our trade balance which oil imports make.  The Minister might have brought that thought a couple of steps further.  He might have said to himself: &ldquo;If there is really a consensus here, might this not be an area in which <Col N="587" /> something like an all-party committee of this House or a joint committee of both Houses would be appropriate in order to de-politicise what might be unpopular energy conservation measures?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will explain what I mean by that.  As our party's energy spokesman, in April of last year I urged that petrol should be rationed.  I believed it should have been rationed then, and there would not have been the chaos at the filling stations and the half-wrecked tourist season.  Personally I am still inclined to think that, even at times of relative plenty, there might be a case to be made for rationing petrol.  Before anyone runs off with the idea that this is my party's policy, I want to make it clear that it is not.  I am in a minority on this.  I do not believe I could get my party to agree with me on it.  I know experts who are not politicians who do not agree with me on it.  I may be wrong about it, but I have a kind of hankering after the idea that, from the point of view of our trade balance alone, it might make sense to restrict oil consumption whether in the form of vehicle fuel or home heating fuel.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that any such measure, apart from the administrative costs which it would entail, would be unpopular. The people who would be the quickest to point out the unpopular features of it would be one's political opponents. We are not all archangels of moral courage.  Probably nobody qualifies for that description.  We would all like to get away with something we think is right, without having to endure politically motivated criticism.</P>
    <P>It may be that this is an area in which the national interest would be served by trying to create some kind of forum or scene in which an all-party consensus could be made effective.  Naturally the Minister tries to do the best for himself politically, and I have no doubt that he tries to do the best for the country in the way he runs his Department.  I would put aside my own ambition in order to help him if there was any sensible way in which I could do that.  I am sure the same goes for the Labour Party and <Col N="588" /> even people who are not represented in the House.</P>
    <P>There might be a case for considering a committee, perhaps not a formal committee. There might be a case for trying to construct some kind of setting or scene in which a political consensus about the necessity for certain kinds of measures might be arrived at, so as to take the fear out of the Government that a measure they considered necessary would be undermined, or perhaps even made impossible, by the mobilisation of public opinion against it for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>I have given three instances.  I want to give a fourth one, and then I will move on to something else.  I have given three instances of matters which are within the Minister's procurement, either immediately or through the Government, in connection with matters which he regards as important: the labelling of electric appliances; conservation in the Government's own sphere and in the public sector sphere; and the construction of a scene for an all-party consensus on energy conservation.</P>
    <P>The last suggestion I should like to make is a somewhat more sweeping one but, again, it is within the Government's sphere.  It is that the Minister should seek a statutory position over and above the one he has at present.  There is a very good case to be made, as the Fine Gael policy document said last month, for an Energy Minister having the right to be consulted by any public Department or semi-State body in regard to any project which has an energy dimension, not because he wants to be a busy body but because we are agreed that this economy, and therefore the Irish people and everything for which they labour, could sink or swim on the energy issue. All could fall in ruins on the energy issue if we do not watch ourselves.  It is far too important a matter to be searching over one's shoulder for tiny precedents to justify particular measures in connection with it.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for the Minister for Energy being given a statutory power to be consulted about, and if necessary to veto on efficiency <Col N="589" /> grounds, projects which in other aspects fall under the authority of his colleagues or other Departments or semi-State bodies.  It is so important and vital to us&mdash;and the public concept of that so far has penetrated so little even among politicians&mdash;that there would be a case for giving him a position of control in this area of life analogous to the position of control which the Minister for Finance exercises in the financial dimensions of his colleagues' undertakings or the undertakings of semi-State bodies.  It would have to be exercised with reason and restraint, otherwise it would foul up the whole administrative side of the State.  Nevertheless, the Minister's Department should consider putting a legislative proposal which would extend his authority in that direction.</P>
    <P>Many matters were dealt with in the Minister's speech and I have only about 20 minutes left and therefore I have no hope of covering all the points.  However, I want to mention a few things in particular. The Minister spoke about our own oil resources.  I often hear it said, when people at branch meetings of my own party talk about the terrible state in which the Government have left the country, that the Government have the devil's own luck and what is going to rescue that crowd is that they will find oil within a week of the general election. There is that general feeling in the country that if oil could be found it would be a kind of bonus for whatever party is there.  I want to create that bonus here and now.  There is oil there.  I am making the announcement here and now and whether it gets a headline is not important. I make that announcement clearly so that anybody who makes it subsequently in those terms will not be saying anything new.  The operations of the exploration companies and the stock market represent a very strong blip, to use a radar term.  We are getting a very strong blip in regard to oil.  It is there and it is only a question of discovering it in the right place, applying the right technology and waiting for a time when the operations of the world oil market will make that technology economic. The Minister mentioned the mid-eighties. <Col N="590" /> I would not trouble to put a date on it, but it is only a matter of time before this economic windfall drops on us out of the heavens.  What the State's arrangements will be in regard to royalties and so on we cannot foresee, but that there will be a very substantial bonus for the State is undoubted.  There has to be.  I do not know whether it will be possible to achieve a consensus even here but I would hope so.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, through their leader in his Ard Fheis speech in the spring, said something on this subject which should become a national consensus, namely, that that oil windfall whenever it arrives&mdash;in 1983, 1984 or 1985, it does not matter&mdash;must not be used to finance current expenditure.  It should be earmerked for some purpose over and above that and a Minister for Energy should be concerned particularly in that earmarking.  There should be a censensus just as firm as the axiom that one balances one's budget, that one did not spend more in the year than one took in. There should be a consensus that that is not to be used for current expenditure.  It should be used only for work of intrastructural development and capital investment.</P>
    <P>That has a further very important implication, and I hold this up as something about which there might be a national ambition.  If we have this windfall to finance infrastructure and capital investment of various kinds, that implies a reduced necessity to borrow.  It should imply necessarily an easing on the public sector borrowing requirement, and that reflection in terms directs attention to that borrowing requirement and to the size of the overall Government debt as it stands now.  I hope, Sir, that you will allow me to say a couple of words about that.  That debt as it stands now has reached such a staggering size that, unless I have worked the thing out wrongly, 27p in every £ of the total tax revenue taken in by the State this year is going to be spent on servicing that national debt.  Twenty-seven pence in the £ is going out of the window as soon as it comes in the door on paying interest on <Col N="591" /> what the State up to now has borrowed. When we left office the figure was only 20p.  In 1976 it was 20.4p and 1977, despite the temptations which another Government might have experienced to blow the lid off and spend money in an election year, it was still only 20.6p.  It is now 27p in the £.  About 5s. 4d. in the £ in terms of the old £ is cut out of the £ before the Government can do anything else.</P>
    <P>It is not a dream that we can get rid of the national debt altogether.  It is not only an aisling.  The Belgians do not borrow any money at all and do not have a national debt worth speaking about.  They finance their current capital investment from their current income.  It can be done.  It cannot be done here overnight, but I believe that the right thing to do with these oil revenues is to try to achieve a consensus, political and national, that they must be earmarked to finance what otherwise a continuance of borrowing would have to finance.  That implies necessarily that the national debt will phase out.  As the capital is paid off it will become smaller every year and eventually tail away in perhaps 20 years' time.  That would be a marvellous objective, a proud objective which would be explained easily to the people once they grasped the fact that that colossal slice of the £ note that they were contributing to the Exchequer would now be free for the services for which they were clamouring.  That would be a terrific and exciting ambition for the people and for every political party and the certainty that that windfall is going to be with us in a matter of years ought to lead to the formation of this consensus now.</P>
    <P>In connection with our oil resoures the Minister mentioned the Continental Shelf but I remind him&mdash;and I mentioned this at Question Time yesterday&mdash;that it has a very strong relevance to the mining scene also.  I hope that the Minister will take this to heart, as I said in a throw-away supplementary question yesterday, in regard to the vital importance to us of keeping our eye on the ball in regard to the arbitration of the division <Col N="592" /> of the Continental Shelf with Britain.  The matter has dragged on for a very long time.  Certain unfortunate events of June 1977 removed me from the position where I was able to keep the thing moving, but I do not doubt that there is as much goodwill in that direction in the Attorney General's office now as there was in my time.  I urged that the Minister would regard it as being highly relevant to the job of his own Department and the interests of that Department to ensure that we make no mistake about that arbitration, that diplomatically and technically and legally we are getting the very best possible advice and, above all, that we are getting it from people who are not distracted by ten other jobs at the same time.  I am not going to go into departmental details about this from my recollection which may be out of date but I want to remind the House that our whole offshore scene&mdash;and it is not as absurd as it might seem to include fishing in that because that takes place offshore&mdash;obviously has legal dimensions also.  I believe the whole partly diplomatic, partly legal dimensions should be under a unified control, a unified structure.  I think it should be under the control of the Attorney General but it is not important whose control it is under. At the moment it is fractured between the Attorney General, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism in some cases, the Board of Works, and the Department of Fisheries.</P>
    <P>That is a very unfortunate and bad arrangement and the Minister would be doing a good day's work for his own Department and for the country generally if he used his influence to have that situation reviewed but, in particular, if he bore in mind its immense importance for the coming generations and perhaps even for this generation of this arbitration, and that the area in dispute between ourselves and the British&mdash;we cannot measure it exactly because the lip of the Continental Shelf is not defined and we do not know how far out into the ocean it extends&mdash;may not be as big as but is at least comparable with the entire <Col N="593" /> land area of this Republic and it may have resources which are as yet unfathomed in both senses of the word and unimagined in all senses of the word.  Let us make no mistake about it; this is an area where we should not stint resources of an advisory kind and of a technical kind.  I ask the Minister, both from the oil point of view and from the mining point of view, to jack this matter up to the top of his list of priorities and make sure that this matter is receiving the best that money can buy in terms of permanent staffing and permanent assistance.</P>
    <P>The last point of my own that I want to make is that we ought to see in this energy crisis that has descended upon us not so much a threat&mdash;of course it is a threat&mdash;as an opportunity of a unique kind to create a completely new social and economic structure here.  I do not mean a political revolution but we ought to see in it something which would give us a chance to reverse some of the patterns of existence which we inherited from the British like everything else, good and bad, that the country contains. We ought to see in it a chance in particular to condition the individual and the local community into accepting more responsibility for themselves and for their future and for their children's future and into &ldquo;deresponsiblising&rdquo; the State for everything that happens to an individual or his community.  I hope the Minister does not think the idea too wild. I believe in it strongly.  He might give consideration to devising a pattern of co-operative society which perhaps could be tried out.  It may not work but what is wrong with trying something and then, if it does not work, trying something else. The Minister should try to devise a form of co-operative pattern or co-operative society in which the whole population of the neighbourhood could have a notional individual share and the primary object of which would be to conduct an audit of the energy consumption, the energy waste, at the production of energy in their own area and the indirect production of energy by the recycling of waste products which itself, of course, implies an energy saving ultimately.  I can imagine a co-operative society like that <Col N="594" /> becoming involved in small scale miniature hydro plants and wind power plants naturally in suitable locations the product of which could be sold to the ESB.  I could imagine them acquiring, on a communal basis, as a communal property, areas of marginal land which could be turned into forests, both commercial forest in the traditional sense and biomass forest for the purpose of electricity production through combustion.</P>
    <P>There are many possibilities here but the most important thing socially which I would see emerging from this structure is that there is no boundary to the possibilities.  One form of activity will suggest another form of economic activity, not perhaps immediately energy related but it would not matter if it got some distance away from the immediate energy relation.  But one form of activity will suggest another and will tend to foster in the community and in the individual a sense that he can contribute something and that small numbers of people can contribute something and can watch each other's progress and jog one another into producing more prosperity for their district and better job prospects for their children.</P>
    <P>I could have spoken a great deal longer on this topic but there are one or two things mentioned by the Minister that I want to discuss so I will have to break off what I wanted to say about energy co-operatives and go on to these detailed matters.  I should apologise both to the Minister and to Deputy Pattison because I am afraid that after I speak I have to go down the country in a hurry. But I would like the Minister to try to explain a bit better what exactly is the State's strategy in regard to the Avoca mines.  The Minister said that a further major problem is that the ore reserves available may now not extend beyond about September 1981.  If what he means by that is that the mine is going to be worked out in about 15 months' time, is it the case that the State is providing over £80 million this year in order to keep afloat an enterprise employing 236 men who may be without jobs anyway in September 1981?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> I may have misunderstood what the State's strategy is in this regard but that seems to me to be an amazing operation. Everybody in the House has sympathy with men whose employment is threatened.  Perhaps threatened is not the right word but their jobs are obviously in question once the mine has ceased to be in production.  It seems an amazing operation to put so much money into a mine when one can see the end of its useful life approaching.  I do not despise 236 jobs.  Of course it is a big number by the terms of Arklow.  But that seems to be a large amount of money for this really rather limited purpose.  I do not want to say too much about it because of the human dimensions but it seems to be, on the face of it, a fairly extravagant operation.  I did wave through here last year the last Estimate for the Avoca mines but I do not think it was explained at that time to the House that the mine might have only another 15 months of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the question of to what extent comparable arrangements could be made for the importation of fuels other than oil.  What I would like to ask the Minister to think about here is that India has got enormous resources of coal and that the Indian Government are anxious to sell coal to this country like, no doubt, every other oil exporter.  But India, I think, has a special call on us and should have a special interest for us because it is one of the countries with which we have a special relationship in connection with our overseas development aid projects in which we have tried, in whatever tiny way this country can do anything for a country with such immense problems, to make small contributions.  For a reason of that kind, over and above the supply reason, some interest in the possibility of coal from India might be shown by the Minister's Department.  It may be that this has been done already.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, on a couple of points, the ESB.  We would all like to pay tribute to the ESB without which the State's industrial development simply <Col N="596" /> would not have been possible.  He mentioned also that the ESB were anxious to combat waste but he did not say anything about this subject which I would like to have heard something about: what do the ESB propose to do about exploiting the immense quantities of waste heat that they themselves unavoidably generate?  The generation of electricity from oil sends large quantities of heat up chimneys and, effectively, all it does is heat up the chimney and sends plumes of hot smoke into the air.  There are, as the Minister knows, very advanced and very frequently and widely used technologies whereby that waste heat can be used not only for industrial and horticultural processes but also for domestic heating by piping it a certain distance.  Of course it loses heat in the transmissions but it means that water heated in this way requires that much less power to bring up to a useful temperature at its point of use.</P>
    <P>The last thing I wanted to say is that I would have wished the Minister to say a word or two about the possibilities of industrial alcohol, which is produced here as a fuel, and the possibilities which his Department might see for combining it with other fuels in order to reduce our dependence on imports.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the change in attitude on the part of the Government in regard to the energy question.  It is clear, not only from what the Minister has said this morning but from the various statements he has made since assuming his new role, that he has adopted a new and fresh approach to the energy problem.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that if he had made some of these statements, say, 12 months ago, he would have incurred the wrath of the Minister who was then responsible for energy, Deputy O'Malley.  As a follow up to this new approach, I trust that the Minister will issue either a new White Paper or a <Col N="597" /> Green Paper to replace that document entitled <i>Energy Ireland.</i>  It is more important now than ever before that such a document be issued because it is obvious that the <i>Energy Ireland</i> document is totally out of date, though, since it has not been replaced by a new document, it must be seen to remain the official position. Not only is that document out of date but it is in direct conflict with many of the statements made by the Minister in recent months.</P>
      <P>I welcome particularly the Minister's approach to the nuclear question.  This is an approach which indicates also a change in direction but whether this change goes far enough is something that we will have to decide as time goes on.  When replying to the debate I should like the Minister to spell out what he means by his remarks on nuclear energy. While the decision in this regard is being pushed into the background it is not clear from what the Minister has said who will be responsible ultimately for making that decision, that is, if that necessity will every arise.  In this regard the Minister says that the decision which emerges, whatever it may be, should be seen by the great majority of reasonable people as being justified and prudent.  By that I hope the Minister means that there would be a referendum on the issue before any decision was reached.  While that interpretation may be put on the statement I would not like to assume that that is what the Minister means and that is why I should like him to spell out what is meant by that sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is an implication in that statement that those people who have become known as belonging to the anti-nuclear lobby are not reasonable while those who are not in that lobby are reasonable.  This would be a wrong footing on which to start a debate on this important issue.  There are many reasonable and highly esteemed people among those who belong to the anti-nuclear lobby.  It is important that the Minister tells us clearly whether there would be a referendum for the purpose of ascertaining whether the people accept <Col N="598" /> the results of all the investigations and studies that he has told us will be undertaken before any decision is made.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred this morning to practically every aspect that is appropriate to his Department but there was one aspect that I had expected to hear from him on but to which omitted to refer.  I am referring to a matter about which people in some parts of the country, including my own constituency, are extremely anxious, a matter that has got to the front in the nuclear energy debate. I refer to uranium exploration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not possible for me to be here then because I had to attend a health board meeting and, consequently, I am at a disadvantage in regard to the Minister's remarks.  Perhaps he would be good enough to state the position on this issue.  I accept the Minister's word that the nuclear energy question is in the background and that a decision in that regard may not have to be made for many years.  We hope that we will never have to have nuclear energy but what is the point in having uranium exploration at this stage since, to a great extent, the two are connected and dependent on each other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been shown that there are sufficient good reasons for the concern and anxiety arising from this exploration work.  There is much secrecy, a great lack of information and much difficulty in trying to get information about uranium exploration.  Some months ago the question was raised at a meeting of the local authority in Kilkenny and even the local authority officials had no information about the situation, although exploration work was being carried out within their area.  It would appear that planning permission is not required and that the local authority need not be consulted. As well as that, the health board governing the area also seemed to have no information about this work, so that we had two bodies responsible for local administration apparently not being officially <Col N="599" /> informed and not advised as to what was going on.  We can, rightly, most highly criticise the situation of the health authority in the area not being given any information.</P>
    <P>There are reports available to us which would certainly indicate that there are grounds for the anxiety that has been expressed about this matter.  I hope that the Minister will withdraw the licences already issued for this work and allow no further licences to be issued, at least until such time as the position in relation to the possible dangers to health and to the environment is cleared up.  In countries far more advanced on this subject than we are, possible dangers to people and to the environment have already been discovered arising just from exploratory work.  There is no point in allowing exploratory work if one is not going to allow, ultimately, mining and milling for uranium.  I have a quotation here, from the United States Nuclear Regulations Committee, which states:</P>
    <P>Uranium mining and milling are the most significant sources of radiation to the public from the entire nuclear fuel cycle, far surpassing nuclear reactors and high level radioactive waste disposal.</P>
    <P>That is a rather serious statement.  I have another report, from the Royal Commission of Inquiry, entitled <i>Health and Environment Protection&mdash;Uranium Mining,</i> which concerns the province of British Columbia.  In the commissioner's <i>First Interim Report on Uranium Exploration</i> published on August 15 1979&mdash;so there is hardly a more up-to-date report available&mdash;under the heading &ldquo;Special Hazards from Uranium Exploration Activity&rdquo; paragraph 9 on page 2, states:</P>
    <P>Uranium exploration raises particular problems from three points of view.  Firstly, the possibility of contamination of water by material released as a result of exploration activity; secondly, the possibility of radon gas and its daughters being <Col N="600" /> emitted from exposed radioactive sources; and thirdly, the importance of some special protection methods needed for employees.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not know what regulations have been laid down by the Department for this work or what guidelines they have established.  The next paragraph, paragraph 10, of this document is rather long but I feel I should quote it in full.  I might be accused of taking something out of context if I were to quote selectively.</P>
    <P>An examination of the main sites of exploration for uranium in British Columbia reveals that the possible hazards occasioned by this activity vary greatly in different locations, partly because the natural levels of radioactivity are different, but more particularly because the local condition are far from uniform.  We wish to stress that some of the public fears expressed to us in testimony in relation to the possible hazards resulting from drilling for uranium do not, in our opinion, constitute a significant risk. Some members of the public have been led to believe that a single drill hole some miles from the nearest habitation could present a hazard by virtue of the leakage into the general atmosphere of gas containing radon and its daughters.</P>
    <P>Such a possibility is unsupported by data, and the physics of gas dispersion and dilution make it exceedingly unlikely that any enhanced risk could result from such limited exploration activity.  However, a more extensive program including large numbers of drill holes in a known radioactive deposit, could pose a hazard to nearby habitation unless these holes were promptly closed.</P>
    <P>It goes on, in paragraph 11, to state:</P>
    <P>A potential hazard, in our opinion, is that drill holes will disrupt the pattern of ground water flow causing a compositional change in the water and leading to contamination of a water supply previously unaffected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> As I say, there are many findings available which would certainly indicate that there are dangers inherent in this exploration work.  If, of course, uranium is not found, there is no problem but what if radioactive material is discovered and, of course, the people who have obtained licences must have some indication and knowledge of what they are about so that we must assume that there is more than a 50-50 chance of radioactive deposits being found and disturbed?  If they are found, what is the point and what is the next step?  Are we then going to be faced with pressure to go in for uranium mining and all that goes with it? I ask the Minister to withdraw all these licences and to stop issuing further licences until the picture of the effects of exploratory work becomes clearer.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that a small minority are making a lot of noise about uranium exploration, but most people are downright ignorant as to what uranium exploration is all about, and even what the substance uranium is, and because of lack of knowledge the campaign to highlight the danger is left to a few people&mdash;it is not a case of a silent majority and a vocal minority.  If people were made aware fully of the ramifications of the nuclear issue and uranium, they would have a different view of it and we would have a majority making their views known.</P>
    <P>On this subject of uranium, if it is found it is important to ask whether it would find its way into use in a possible nuclear war.  What is Government policy in relation to the control of the destination of any uranium found here?  The EEC appear to be providing most of the money for this exploratory work.  As a result of our obligations to Europe, is it not quite possible that if uranium is mined here it will be used in warheads of one kind or another?  I do not think the Irish people would willingly associate themselves in any way with a future nuclear holocaust.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the Minister in his new post has not got more powers in the <Col N="602" /> Department.  That Department are and apparently will be limited in their work.  I fail to see why the Department of Transport were not joined with the Department of Energy, because transport is one of the major issues in any energy policy.  I would like to have heard the Minister explain his views on the whole range of transport problems here.  If the Government are serious about the energy question they must give more and more powers to this new Department.  The Minister so far has exercised the functions he has got very well.  Of course in the six months since the Department were established it has not been easy for the Minister to change the direction of an energy policy and at the same time deal with all the problems involved, but we hope that as time goes on we will hear more and more from him about the issues I have been dealing with.  There are other matters involved in an energy policy, particularly transport. There was a lot to be said for the old joint Department of Transport and Power and if this new Department had been of Energy and Transport a better job could be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy should have power to fix prices for the various forms of energy.  In any energy conservation programme freedom to fix prices is important and, as well, the Minister should have a function in diverting use of certain forms of fuel to other forms.  Obviously the Minister has not got that function: he must rely on another Department to do that.  Energy conservation in buildings and dwellings seems to be a matter for yet another Minister because in the last few years that has been a function of the Department of the Environment who have been encouraging people to convert from oil home heating to other forms, such as solid fuel. A kind of conjuring trick has been done in this regard&mdash;now we see it, now we do not.  If that is the kind of conservation policy that is to be continued I can only sympathise with the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>If it is to be effective, an energy conservation policy must be consistent.  The Minister for Energy requires substantial <Col N="603" /> powers not alone to advise and to consult but to direct sections in other Departments directly involved in energy conservation.  For instance, I should like to see the Department of Education adding another subject to school curricula, energy, because a lot of energy wastage arises from lack of understanding of how fuel is used and how energy is created.  That subject cannot be covered adequately by talks, lectures, seminars.  Energy as a need is now next to the air we breathe, running neck and neck with food for our existence, and because of that a strong case can be made to have it as a school subject.  It can be argued that there are so many subjects on school curricula nowadays that it would be difficult to fit in an additional one, but at least one subject could be dropped&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might have a serious talk with his colleague, the Minister for Education, to see if that can be done because it is lack of knowledge and information that gives rise to the waste of a lot of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister also to ensure that in this search for alternative sources of energy he takes all precautions against any new element of exploitation or the possibility of a monopoly situation because that is what happened with regard to oil over the years, it became a source of exploitation and monopoly.  Unless we are very careful with new sources of energy there is the danger that they will go in the same direction.  It is the Minister's duty and obligation to ensure that that does not happen.  I hope that the guidelines laid down and agreements made by one of the Minister's <Col N="604" /> predecessors, Senator Justin Keating, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce responsible for energy, particularly his agreement with the oil companies at that stage, will continue to be the guidelines for this Government and that nothing would be done to alter that situation.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the Minister's visit to my city, Kilkenny, the other day. How he managed to go to Kilkenny without mentioning coal I will never know.  I had expected that he would, when visiting one of the great coalmining areas of the country.  I think a great many other people also hoped that the Minister would have given some indication of the Government's policy in regard to coal, the opening of the coal mines in the Castlecomer area and indeed in the other areas around the Leinster coalfields.  Alas, he did not.  I would urge the Minister to look carefully at this situation and ensure that the mines are opened as soon as possible. We have now every indication that there are still commercially viable coalfields in the area.  It was unfortunate that ten or 12 years ago the mines were closed.  At that time it could be argued that they were not commercially viable.  It was argued then, also, that the day would come when we would regret that decision. It gives me no pleasure to say that the day has come when we regret that the coalmining industry in that area was closed down.  If we can draw any consolation from the present energy crisis it is that we may again see 500 or 600 people employed in that area in the production of coal.</P>
    <P>In this regard I welcome the decision of the ESB in relation to the Arigna coal. I hope that a similar decision will be taken in relation to the area around Castlecomer.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to continue employment at Avoca.  Indeed, it would be more costly to the Government not to support the Avoca mines than to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the indication from the Minister that there is a gas grid, as it were, in the pipeline.  I hope that will reach fruition fairly soon.  There are <Col N="605" /> serious difficulties being experienced in town gas supplies in many areas. Therefore, I hope that this work can be got underway quickly and so provide that gas grid.  The Minister said in the course of his opening remarks that he was awaiting some reports on the Dublin situation.  It is now a matter of extreme urgency that arrangements be made to pipe the gas from Kinsale to other populated areas around the country. I hope the Minister will have this work expedited as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On the question of oil, I go along with Deputy Kelly.  I had intended making the remark he made in this regard&mdash;that, when oil does begin to flow it should not be used to prop up the mismanagement of the economy or to constitute part of another election manifesto.  In a sense the last election manifesto advocated wastage of energy, if anything.</P>
    <P>I was pleased also to note the Minister's encouragement of exploration work into wind and wave power.  Many other countries already have a lot of information on this subject.  Indeed, we are at an advantage in having available the results of many years study, particularly in regard to wind power, carried out in other countries.  I hope the Minister will have recourse to such information and expertise as is available to some of our EEC partners.  I know that in West Germany there is a £25 million research programme under way.  In Sweden there is a large wind turbine supplying power to a national grid just north of Stockholm.  The National Board for Energy Source Development in Sweden are committed to a programme culminating in ten wind turbines in the year 1988.  Of course, the use of wind energy dates back to approximately 2,000 B.C. when the Chinese and the Persians used it to grind corn and pump water.</P>
    <P>The 1973-74 oil crisis focused attention on future energy requirements and how they could be met.  The planning and provision of an adequate and secure supply of energy at a reasonable cost must be the priority of any government. It is important not to fall into the trap of <Col N="606" /> confusing the supply of energy with material prosperity, for energy is only a means to social ends, for example, warmth, heat, mobility and the production of goods.  It is not an end in itself.  It is not energy people want but the benefit energy consumption brings.</P>
    <P>We should try to achieve the goals for which we require energy not with the maximum of energy consumption or by acting on the naive belief that the more energy we use the better off we are, of that <i>per capita</i> energy consumption is of itself an index of national prestige, but with a maximum of energy efficiency or energy productivity, in other words, maximising the benefits obtained from each unit of scarce and expensive energy used.</P>
    <P>Low energy productivity is a recipe for poor economic performance.  High energy costs in industry leave that much less for wages and capital reinvestment.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about the element of taxation on, say, industrial fuel, which is a serious imposition not only on the number of jobs available but on our standard of living.</P>
    <P>High energy costs make our output less competitive than that of other countries which pay more attention to energy efficiency.  In short, using and supplying more energy to accomplish our social goals and sustain our chosen way of life is less a measure of the success of our energy policy than of our failures. Similarily, the amount of traffic we must endure to get to where we want to go is not an indication of our well-being but of our inability to plan a rational transport system.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note that the conservation policies of other countries have resulted in substantial beneficial results, but this problem has to be tackled in a positive way.  The Minister's present brief is not adequate to tackle this question properly.  As soon as this becomes evident to the Taoiseach and the Government, I hope the Minister for Energy will be given more statutory powers and authority to effectively fulfil the very important and crucial job which <Col N="607" /> lies before him.  I wish the Minister well and as long as he continues the job he started, he will get every support and encouragement from me.</P>

Perhaps it is not something any Minister is entitled to expect but whenever he receives it he is heartened and encouraged if he finds this kind of constructive approach to the general position he has adopted.</P>
      <P>As will be noted, I spelled out the general lines of energy policy I am developing and the priorities I believe should be followed.  I was pleased to note from the other side of the House the various comments on the different aspects of this subject and that there was no dissent from the general lines of policy or the priorities I suggested.  I read into this that there is as I suspected, and as I indicated earlier, widespread consensus on our basic needs in developing an energy policy.  Both Deputy Kelly and Deputy Pattison at the beginning of their respective contributions referred to what Deputy Kelly described as a Uturn policy.</P>

If I were in their position I would not be able to resist the temptation either. Nevertheless, for the record I have to point out the facts.  In so far as a decision on the construction of a nuclear reactor for the production of electricity in this country is concerned no decision has been made, nor will any decision be made until after the public tribunal has met, reported and the Government have considered that report.  Prior to that there are a number of other steps which have to occur, including the publication of the report of the inter-departmental committee covering various aspects of the proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  The inter-departmental committee are meeting at present and their terms of reference cover various aspects of the proposal, including safety.  Therefore, they have to be concerned with the outcome of the inquiries into the incident at Harrisburg.  Consequently their report will be delayed.  When the report is published, it will make available on a factual basis to everybody who is interested the up-to-date information on various aspects, including safety, and also the best estimates then available of likely energy consumption in future, the possible sources of energy, the financial aspects and so on.  When that report becomes available it will be followed by the public inquiry at which all interested parties will be able to put their points of view and, hopefully, will be able to put a better informed point of view than they could at present.  When that inquiry has been held and the report made, the report will go to the Government.  Only then will a decision be made by the Government of the day.  I will deal with the question of the referendum later. That is the series of steps envisaged.  I wish to stress that the Government have not and cannot have a definitive position on the question of the construction of a nuclear reactor here until that decision is made.</P>
      <P>On the basis facts of the situation there is no difference between what I have been saying and what was said by my predecessor.  There is, of course, a difference in emphasis and the principal reason is that there is a difference in the facts of the situation which now obtain and those which obtained when the document &ldquo;Energy Ireland&rdquo; was prepared; it was published in 1978 and prepared earlier.  The facts of the situation at that time were quite different from those which now obtain, particularly in regard to the projection of the amount of energy which our economy will require during the coming decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> The major reason for the change in that projection is the down-turn in the world economy and the consequent down-turn in our economy and the much lower prospects for economic growth during coming years than were projected in 1977 and 1978.  If there is much lower economic growth there will be much lower demand for energy.  That is the major change but there is another change which is consequential on that. As the price of oil and other forms of energy rises, alternative sources which were not at all economic some years ago now become economic or prospectively economic.  The scene is changing quite substantially and fundamentally and therefore the emphasis which I am putting on certain aspects of energy policy differs from that of my predecessor, reflecting the difference in the facts of the situation which now exists.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Kelly was wrong in his assertion that the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism was against the construction of a pipeline for the bringing of gas from Kinsale to Dublin.  I am open to correction on this but speaking from recollection I think Deputy O'Malley was very strongly urging the construction of such a pipeline while he was in Opposition.  Perhaps Deputy Kelly is confusing two things. Because my colleague spelled out very clearly the facts of the situation as far as the Dublin Gas Company are concerned and the impossibility of contemplating supplying natural gas to that company as then constituted, Deputy Kelly may imagine that he was opposed to the construction of the pipeline.  However, that is not and was not his position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly is also mistaken in his suspicion that some advance version of the Fine Gael policy document on energy had been leaked to my Department. The fact that the document contained a number of good points which I had been spelling out for quite some time before its appearance is, I am sure, purely coincidental.  I can assure the House that the explanation does not lie in any leak to me or my Department.  I <Col N="610" /> was totally unaware of the contents of the document until its publication.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also urged on me the setting up of some kind of all-party committee for consideration of energy conservation measures.  He mentioned rationing as the kind of unpopular measure a Government would be unwilling to take and would be more likely to take if they had all-party support.  That is all very well in theory and if one accepted the proposition it would be true of other areas quite different from energy. Difficult decisions are the responsibility of Government; that is why they are elected.  They are not the responsibility of Opposition parties and very few Opposition parties are willing to attach to themselves the odium of these unpopular decisions when they are not obliged to do so.  I could not quarrel with their approach in that regard and Deputy Kelly's suggestion, while very well intentioned, is misconceived and would not work in practice.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Kelly talking about the manner in which we should spend the revenue from our oil, if and when we get it off the west coast.  He referred to the speech made by his party leader at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  My recollection is that the party leader gave a little lecture on the danger that this Government might start spending those revenues for the purpose of re-election or some such terrible purpose.</P>

      <P>There is no point in trying to spend it now.  Deputy Kelly made certain suggestions as to what should be done and I do not want to follow him down that road except to say that as a general principle we should not lose sight of the fact that even if oil in substantial quantities is discovered off our coasts any such discovery is finite.  At some time it will run out.  We need a renewable source of energy and the first priority in the spending of possible oil revenue should be directed towards producing as far as possible renewable energy sources sufficient to meet all our requirements in future.</P>
      <P>It might be asked what kind of sources we can think of in that regard. There are various sources.  I do not want to dwell too much on this but one source that is at an early stage of development and which I referred to earlier is the question of wave power.  It has been estimated that the energy contained in the waves around our coast is sufficient to meet three times the whole energy consumption of this island at present.  Of course, it has not been harnessed and a great deal of work is going into this matter. I am simply putting forward that example as a general principle if one is to talk about the spending of oil revenues that we have not got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about Avoca Mines and his approach seemed to be almost directly contrary to that of Deputy Pattison.  Deputy Kelly seemed to think we should not spend more money on keeping the mines open and keeping the people concerned in jobs if the operation comes to an end in September of next year, whereas Deputy Pattison urged that we keep the mines open as long as possible.  Apart from the <Col N="612" /> reasons advanced by Deputy Pattison, we will continue to monitor closely the situation at Avoca Mines.  Of course, if the losses become very high the Government would have to consider again the question of continuing the subvention. So far as the Government are concerned, in any decision on this matter a relevant consideration is the amount the State would pay out by way of social welfare and unemployment benefits.</P>
    <P>Considerable interest has been shown in prospecting in the general Avoca area. It might be over-sanguine to expect that the discovery of new commercial deposits will take place there but that cannot be ruled out.  The prospects for early development of any such deposit if it were discovered would be enhanced by the existence in that locality of the crushing and milling facilities that exist in Avoca Mines as well as the presence of a large labour pool with the necessary expertise and experience in mining.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also raised the question of the position of the ESB on the use of waste heat.  The ESB have one demonstration project that is in part operation; this is at the Lanesboro generating station where at least ten acres of glasshouses are intended to be heated with waste heat from the generating station.  There are two acres in production at present.  It is a co-operative project with Allied Irish Banks, the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture all contributing.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the potential for the use of waste heat by the ESB at the Ringsend and Poolbeg stations is under close examination. They have plans to use some of the waste heat there in the generation of further electricity.  A new generating station is to be erected there that will be run by this waste heat.  It is clear there is considerable scope for supplying the remaining heat from other generating stations which is going to waste at present to factories, offices and houses and this activity is being pursued actively by the ESB.  We are specifically asking other large industries to explore the potential for the use of waste heat that <Col N="613" /> they are producing.  The IIRS, through the Energy Managers' Association, are making a major drive to initiate projects of this kind not only in the ESB but in the major industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison referred to my recent visit to Kilkenny.  Among the places I visited there were Smithwicks Brewery and the Avonmore Creameries.  In Smithwicks Brewery in particular enormous strides have been made in the effective use of what was waste heat.  One of the reasons for my visit was to see what they were doing in this area. Similar progress has been made at Avonmore and more is on the way.  I should like to congratulate both firms on what they are doing.  They are setting a headline for what we want to see done in industry generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison commented on the fact that I did not talk about coal when I was in Kilkenny.  I presume he is referring to my formal speech at the Rotary Club.  He may not know that at Avonmore when the press were present I had a quite considerable discussion on the question of coal and on an interesting project that Avonmore have in mind which is at a very early stage.  In the course of my visit I said something that I might refer to in this House.  We are having conducted at the moment an extensive survey of the coal resources available throughout the country, and in particular in the Leinster coalfields. These cover Kilkenny and Laois and I think extend to Wicklow.  The area is quite extensive.  I have noticed there is a considerable interest by people from abroad in the possibility of exploiting these resources.  We are bringing up-to-date all the information we can gather on the matter.</P>
    <P>Although I do not want to exaggerate this because it is at an early stage, there are some prospects&mdash;I put it no stronger than that&mdash;that we may have far more extensive deposits of very low-grade coal than we thought.  One of the reasons we have not been aware of what is involved is that the coal is so low grade nobody paid any attention to it.  Up to this we have been interested only in higher grade <Col N="614" /> coal, such as that produced by the Deputy's constituents at Castlecomer. The ESB are in the process of planning a generating station at Arigna for the use of low-grade coal there.  With some assistance from consultants and with a great deal of work on the part of their own experts, the ESB have further developed and altered a technique that was developed abroad and they have established that the crow coal in the Arigna area can be used effectively for the generation of electricity.  If I mention that that coal is 55 per cent stone, the House will have some idea of the kind of problems involved.  But the technique has now been developed.  If the indications that exist at the moment are borne out, that we have substantial deposits of very low grade coal, the development of this technique which will be applied at Arigna could mean that the possibilities of producing energy from indigenous resources are greater than we thought up to now.  I will not put it stronger than that.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Kelly in regard to what he said about our delimitation dispute with the UK that we are fully aware of the potential importance of this.  A great deal of effort is being put into preparation for it and we are endeavouring to reach agreement on terms of reference and so on.  From what Deputy Kelly said at Question Time yesterday I am conscious of his concern and I agree with him about the importance in the national interest of ensuring that we are fully and well represented on all aspects of that arbitration which is coming up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison expressed a preference for a referendum on the nuclear question.  In the various steps I have outlined we envisage the decision being ultimately taken by the Government of the day when the result of the tribunal of inquiry becomes available and we do not visualise a referendum. Although there is provision in the Constitution for a referendum on subjects other than changes in the Constitution it has never been used and it would require very special circumstances.  These circumstances do not apply in the question <Col N="615" /> of nuclear power.  The considerations that arise in assessing the pros and cons of the nuclear question are very complex and we are endeavouring to ensure that anybody who is interested will have the opportunity to be as fully informed as possible on the issue.  However, it would be unrealistic to imagine that the great majority of voters will be fully informed on this matter.  The issue is much too complex to expect people to be able to make a decision on it in a referendum. How would we frame the question in a way that was not excessively simplistic and would give some remote indication of the kind of considerations that people should bear in mind in making a decision on this?  This is the kind of issue on which the Government have to make a decision and be responsible, having been as fully informed as possible and having given the general public the greatest possible opportunity of being fully informed and of indicating their reaction through the democratic process to the Government and the political parties generally.  The decision must ultimately be made by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>With regard to uranium prospecting, I am advised by the Nuclear Energy Board, which is an independent body of experts set up specifically for the purpose of advising the Government on radioactivity hazards and safety hazards, that there is no evidence available to support the suggestion that there is a health hazard from uranium prospecting.  That opinion is arrived at not only through their expert knowledge but after consultations with experts in various parts of the world.  I know that some people are concerned about this matter and in an effort to allay their concern I have taken a number of steps including arranging that the Nuclear Energy Board take samples of soil and water where uranium prospecting is being carried out before and after.  The Nuclear Energy Board are monitoring the degree of radioactivity involved and are making available the information coming in from their monitoring.  So far all the information that has come in from their testing has borne out what the <Col N="616" /> Nuclear Energy Board originally advised us, that there is no hazard involved. However, the monitoring is continuing. That is the most effective way of dealing with this problem and it should be most reassuring to people who are concerned. If it happens, contrary to the advice, that the tests show that there is a hazard, then the people on the ground will be informed straight away and the matter can be dealt with there and then rather than dealing with various theories as to what might or might not be the risk, the theories of people who in many cases have no expert knowledge in this area and who make pronouncements which have no real basis and which are up-setting people.</P>

      <P>I know about that, as do the Nuclear Energy Board.  Deputy Pattison also referred to the amount of money being spent in other countries which he listed on research into the potential of wind as a source of energy. The figures the Deputy quoted simply prove that this is a matter of considerable potential that is being seriously pursued in other countries.  Many people here feel that if we do research into something such as wind it could be very silly, but if other countries are doing it it is all right.  For such people what Deputy Pattison said should reassure them and convince them that there are possibilities in it.  We are keeping in touch with developments in different parts of the world but it is essential that experimental work be carried out in Irish conditions.  I know of some private uses of wind chargers constructed abroad off the west coast which could not stand up to Irish conditions but just collapsed in winter.</P>

The data available suggests that our geographical location is one of the best in the world <Col N="617" /> from this point, but it also means that possibly the wear and tear on the machines would be greater than in many other cases.  The machines have to be designed to stand up to our conditions. We have in mind a number of different locations for this purpose, one of them, on Inis Oirr in the Aran Islands, has been announced and others will be announced shortly.  The important thing is that we are keeping in touch with the work going on and that we are trying it under Irish conditions to ensure that it can operate, if it is to operate, effectively under Irish conditions.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for their constructive contribution to this debate. There is a good deal that I was unable to deal with, and I know the Deputies who spoke were unable to deal with, because of time constraints.  Sufficient has been said to make it clear that the whole energy problem is a major one with enormous potential for the economic growth or shrinkage of the country.  It is necessary for us to bring together into a coherent whole the various elements of energy policy and define our priorities.  I have outlined our approach in that regard and there has been no dissent from that outline or those priorities, for which I am grateful.  I look forward to further co-operation from Deputies opposite in the implementation of this policy of major importance for the future of all of us and of our children.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire.  Is é seo an chéad uair ó tháinig Countess Markievitz isteach sa chéad Dáil go bhfuil bean ceaptha mar Aire Rialtais.  Aire na Gaeltachta an job atá aici faoi láthair. <Col N="619" /> Job tábhachtach is ea é agus ba mhaith liom cúpla ceisteanna a chur don Aire maidir leis an nGaeltacht agus na Gaeltachtaí ar fad.</P>
      <P>Ar léigh an tAire, mar shompla, na haltanna ó Deasún Fennell a fhoilsiú san <i>Irish Times</i> le déanaí?  Duine suimiúil is ea an t-údar seo.  Ní aontaím leis go minic ar chúrsaí poiliticiúla ach caithfídh mé a admháil gur léigh me na haltanna sin go cúramach agus to bhfuil ceisteanna cruaidh ag eirí as.  Tá na Gaeltachtaí ag neartú ó thaobh cursaí eacnamaíochta. Níl dabht ar chor ar bith faoi sin.  Ach cad é an praghas?  An bhfuil sé ró-ard maidir leis an teanga, maidir le cultúr, maidir le saol na ndaoine a mhaireann ann?  Tá gach Aire na Gaeltachta idir dhá comhairle nuair a smaoiníonn sé, nó sí, ar an deachracht sin.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire?  An bhfuil sí ábalta a rá go bhfuil an teanga ag neartú sna Gaeltachtaí? Deireann Deasún Fennell go bhfuil sí ag laghdú, go bhfuil sí ag fáil bháis. Caithfidh an tAire a rá dúinn go fírinneach an bhfuil an ceart aige?  Conaíonn sé ins an Gaeltacht.  Conaíonn an tAire i nGaillimh, cóngaireacht don Ghaeltacht agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil eolas aici.  An bhfuil an Ghaeltacht beo fós nó an bhfuil sí ag laghdú?  Má tá sí ag laghdú, an bhfuil aon phlean aici chun deireadh a chur leis an deacracht seo?</P>
      <P>Tá Údaras na Gaeltachta bunaithe, mar tá fhios againn, ach baineann obair an údaráis seo go mór mhór agus go speisíalta le cúrsaí eacnamaíochta.  Tá fhios againn anois go bhfuil contúirt ag baint leis seo maidir leis an dteanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to read into the record of the House some of the observations of Desmond Fennell in his two articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the Gaeltacht, because unlike many people&mdash;I do not exclude politicians&mdash;who advocated the preservation, maintenance and development of the Gaeltacht, he has chosen to put his money where his mouth is and to go and live in the Gaeltacht and campaign for its development, preservation and extension.  His two articles on 3 and <Col N="620" /> 4 June paint a very sombre picture for anyone interested in this area.  He describes the Gaeltacht in this article in the following way:</P>
    <P>...a crumbling archipelago of four sizeable language islands and eight tiny ones.  Twenty years ago it was larger, and 50 years ago larger still. Some islands which existed at those earlier dates have since disappeared; others have survived but have become much smaller.  In other words during the period of the State's attempts to save it, as in the previous period, the Gaeltacht has continued to be a shrinking entity.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that the present shrinkage of the Gaeltacht may not proceed at its present pace but that the Gaeltacht may effectively disappear within a very brief period of time.  The reason he adduces for this is a statement that the majority of parents throughout the Gaeltacht have decided to rear their children in English.  He comments:</P>
    <P>This turn of events has been discussed on Radio na Gaeltachta and on Irish-language programmes on RTE, and it has been commented on, and its significance perceived, by Irish language journalists.  It is no secret; but since most commentary on the Gaeltacht is carried on in Irish, people generally are probably not aware that Irish speaking Ireland is in its final crisis and will soon be gone.</P>
    <P>In his second article Mr. Fennell went into some depth and analysis as to the reason why this has happened.  I do not propose to quote his reasons in any detail but the last paragraph of his article is apposite.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Attempts to stop the erosion of shrinking language minorities are a very new thing, and nowhere yet, to my knowledge, has such an attempt succeeded.  Our attempts was the first instance in which a State and its resources were committed to the task. In the circumstances, it was probably inevitable that we would not know how to use these assets, and the <Col N="621" /> language movement, in a successful combination.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us whether she agrees with that sombre assessment of the future of the Gaeltacht.  The importance of it will not be lost on her or anybody else who believes that the Irish language should not be allowed to die.  If the Gaeltacht disappears the language will not be kept alive by a number of people, no matter how enthusiastic, living on even smaller Irish speaking islands clustered around maybe Irish speaking primary or post-primary schools in an anglicised island in which the language of commerce, generally, and increasingly of culture, is the English language.</P>
    <P>As Mr. Fennell pointed out there has been a lack of communication between people in the English speaking areas who are in favour of the revival and maintenance of the Irish language and the people in the Gaeltacht.  All the best efforts of Governments&mdash;I do not think this charge can be levelled at any particular Government&mdash;have not succeeded in building the kind of bridge that would enable the Irish language to benefit from a two-way traffic and not just from a simple process of erosion. The other problem I mentioned earlier which also has to be taken into account is the savage dilemma that must face any Minister for the Gaeltacht who is charged with the task of ensuring economic development of the area for which he or she is responsible without infringing the cultural and linguistic characteristics which have led to the call for its economic development in the first place.  I do not know what the answer to this problem is and if the Minister and I were to change places I doubt, even with all the files at my command, I would be any wiser than she is.  However, above all else this is a time for honesty and an assessment of where the policies of the past have led us, whether there is a need to change those policies and communally to decide on new policies that might be pursued.  I wish the Minister well in that task and she will have the support of all sides of the House as she attempts it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> The only other thing I should like to mention in the brief time available to me is to appeal to the Minister not to make the future of the Irish language or of the Gaeltacht areas any more hazardous by continuing in the extraordinary blinkered manner which she has chosen to deal in this House with questions addressed to her other than in the Irish language.  It is not long ago since a Deputy on this side of the House put down a question to the Minister in the English language and received an answer to it in the Irish language.  To the best of my knowledge the Deputy did not object to receiving that answer in the Irish language but when he asked a supplementary in English he was answered in an extraordinary arrogant way by the Minister in Irish.  The Minister refused to talk to that Deputy in the language in which he had addressed her and quoted precedent to justify her action.</P>
    <P>We can all quote precedent when it suits us.  It has been said often enough that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds but the irony is that to the best of my knowledge there is not the precedent the Minister said was there.  I can remember being in the lobbies of this House during the period of the previous administration and listening to her predecessor but one, Deputy Tom O'Donnell, answering questions as Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I can recall Deputy O'Donnell replying to supplementaries put to him in English in the Irish language and following that up with a translation in English of his answer for the benefit of Opposition Deputies.  A rigid adherence to the kind of policy that the Minister seems to have adopted will not help the Irish language; it may indeed well harm it.  There are a lot of people with a lot of goodwill for the Irish language who would have been depressed and put off&mdash;to put it no more strongly&mdash;by an attitude which implies that if one does not have an adequate command of the Irish language one is not entitled to discuss the affairs of the Gaeltacht in this House with the Minister and expect a response from the Minister in the same language in which one has addressed her or him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> I believe that was shortsighted on the part of the Minister but it is not by any means too late for her to change her policy on this matter.  I believe that if she does she will get more co-operation in the essential task which she is about, not just from Deputies on all sides but from people of all traditions on this island.  To adopt the rigid approach smacks of whatever the linguistic equivalent of sectarianism is.  We have been bedevilled enough by that here in the past not to wish it for our present or, indeed, our future children.  Some of my contribution was critical, as it had to be, and some of it supported the work the Minister is doing. I support the Estimate.</P>

      <P>Aontaím le Deputy Horgan.  Níl aon dabht go mbeadh sé ar fheabhas ar fad dá mbeadh an tAire in ann an t-airgead atá ag teastáil uaithi a fháil chun na nithe eagsúla a dhéanamh sna Ghaeltachtaí.  Mar sin fhéin, cé go raibh morán bladair i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta le dhá bhliain anuas, tá sé soiléir tar éis cúpla mí nach bhfuil in Udarás na Gaeltachta ach cleas a d'imir an Rialtas ar mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí. Chun an fhirinne a rá, muna bhfuilimid in ann slí bheatha muintir na nGaeltachtaí a ardú agus a leasú agus rud fónta a dheanamh dóibh, ní bheidh Gaeltacht ar bith ann i bhfad eile.  Aontaím le Deputy Horgan ar sin.</P>
      <P>Seachtain ó shin chuireas ceist ar an Aire i dtaobh na monarchain sna Gaeltachtaí agus fuaras freagra ón Aire á rá go raibh 22 cinn acu imithe chun bóthair.  Ach níor thug sí aon fhreagra dom i dtaobh na monarchain go léir sna Gaeltachtaí, ó Dhún na nGall go Contae Ciarraí, i nGaillimh, Portláirge agus i gCorcaí&mdash;cé mheid dóibh súid a raibh i gcruachás i dtaobh airgid?  'Sé an leithscéal a bhí ag an Aire nach mbeadh sé ceart é sin a dhéanamh.  Táim ag rá leis an Aire go macánta go bhfuil fhios ag muintir na Gaeltachta, ag na hoibritheoirí atá sna monarchain sin, go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó acu ag dul chun bóthair roimh dheireadh na bliana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le déanaí chuir an tAire Cathaoirleach lán aimseartha isteach <Col N="624" /> san Údarás.  Chuir mé ceist ar an Aire an tseachtain seo caite cén fáth gur cuireadh an bainisteoir ó Chontae Mhuigheo, fear macánta, isteach san Údarás agus cén fhaid a bheadh sé sa phost.  Bhí an tAire chomh glic le héinne a tháinig as Contae na Gaillimhe sa freagra a thug sí ar an cheist sin.  Tá mé ag fiafraigh den Aire anois ann bhfuil sí ábalta a rá linn cad tá ar siúl in Udarás na Gaeltachta. An bhfuil trioblóid ar siúl idir an bainisteoir ginearálta agus an cathaoirleach. Ciocu acu an &ldquo;Boss&rdquo;?  Tá mé, thar ceann an taobh seo den Teach, ag tabhairt lán-tacaíocht don Aire má tá fonn uirthi a rá linn go poiblí nó go príobhaideach cad tá ar siúl san Údarás faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Caithimid go léir cloí le chéile má tá na Gaeltachtaí chun neartú agus má táimid chun an teanga a choimeád láidir. Tá sé in am don Aire an £10 deontas a ardú.  Tá a fhios aici go bhfuil cásanna speisialta, go mór mhór na daoine a thagann abhaile ón Bhreatain nó na Stáit Aontaithe agus atá ag maireachtáil san Ghaeltacht, daoine go raibh an Ghaeilge go líofa agus go láidir acu féin agus gur phós an bhean nó an fear, cibé cás é, duine nach raibh an Ghaeilge go líofa acu.  Ba cheart don Aire gan bheith róghéar nuair atá na daoine sin ag lorg deontais chun teach nua a thógáil.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire, muinteoir scoile, go mbeadh an Ghaeilge go líofa ag na páistí agus tá ar na daoine sin maireactáil i mbóthán uaireanta go dtí go mbeidh an teach nua tógtha.  Ba cheart do na cigirí, má tá obair ag an bhfear agus má siad cinnte go bhfuil an sprid ag an gclann an Ghaeilge a neartú agus í a úsáid san Ghaeltacht, an deontas a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on her appointment.  Even though there was a lot of ballyhoo about the new Gaeltacht Authority, it is now obvious to everyone after a few months, that the authority was just a trick by the Government on the people of the Gaeltacht.  The plain truth of the matter is that the members of the authority have not even the power to buy a box of matches and if the matches were bought, <Col N="625" /> the executive side of the authority would decide the colour of the said matches.</P>
    <P>If all of us are not able to revive the spirit of the people of the Gaeltacht and to be seen doing positive things for them, whether it is in industry, education or development of the natural resources, the Gaeltacht will be no more in a very short time.  I am very glad that Desmond Fennell did the study on aspects of the Gaeltacht to which Deputy Horgan referred.</P>
    <P>A week ago I questioned the Minister about how many industries in the Gaeltacht were in financial difficulties.  I was informed that 22 had closed altogether since August 1977, and the Minister would not tell me how many were in serious financial trouble.  The Minister knows that the people of the Gaeltacht and particularly the workers in the factories that are in trouble know that they will be redundant before the year is out.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the Minister appointed a full time chairman to the Gaeltacht Authority in a temporary capacity, we are told.  When I questioned her on the appointment, the Minister was vague in the extreme and when I asked her to spell out how long this appointment was for she refused to answer.  She may have a reason.  Is it because the factories are closing and is it because the elected members of the authority are so disillusioned that they are thinking of resigning from the authority?  The members are not told what is happening; they must read it in the newspapers first.</P>
    <P>Did the general manager of the authority know that a full-time chairman was being appointed?  Are there now internal difficulties within the executive side of the authority?  People are asking questions, particularly the staff.  Will the real boss stand up?</P>
    <P>On behalf of this side of the House I am prepared to give the Minister full co-operation in what she is doing if she is prepared to take us into her confidence, whether publicly or privately, and tell us what is happening within that Gaeltacht Authority.  Every party in this House has <Col N="626" /> the same objective, to keep our Gaeltacht and keep the Irish language virile.  I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of this offer.</P>
    <P>I think it is about time the £10 deontas was increased and substantial increases given for new houses with special concessions for Gaeltacht men or Gaeltacht women who come back to the Gaeltacht, after spending years of their lives in Britain or the US.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the children of those people, or perhaps the wife or husband, will not have fluency in the Irish language for a few years and the Minister should not deny those people a chance of building a new house for themselves immediately they arrive in the Gaeltacht.  It is fine to say they will get a grant in three year's time.  This should be done straight away as it would encourage them to stay.</P>
    <P>I often wonder what power the Minister for the Gaeltacht has at Cabinet level, particularly in view of the fact that so many projects which affect the lifestyle of the people of the Gaeltacht are held up by different Ministers.  This is particularly true as far as the Department of Education is concerned in regard to new schools for which tenders have been submitted but which have not been sanctioned for erection. The same is true in the Department of Fisheries and in the Department of the Environment for other projects.  Perhaps the Minister will become more vocal at Cabinet level particularly on Gaeltacht projects.  She should be concerned especially with the Department of Fisheries who are denying the right to fish to our Gaeltacht fishermen and as a result of that they are dragged before the courts and depicted as common criminals for catching a few salmon whether in Galway, Dingle or down around Waterford.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister knows that the natural resources offer the best prospects for the west of Ireland and must be developed.  The land and the sea are the best natural resources we have.</P>
    <P>I could go on at length but as this is a short debate, I hope the Minister will accept <Col N="627" /> the message I have given in the spirit in which it is offered and that we will all work together for the common good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an dá Theachta a labhair ar an Meastachán do Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Tá mé faoi chomaoin acu mar tuigim gur ag cabhrú liom féin mar Aire na Gaeltachta agus obair na Roinne atá siad nuair a deireann siad na rudaí b'fhéidir ag cáineadh ní na Roinne ach polasaithe áirithe de chuid Rialtas éagsúla.  Tá roinnt ceisteanna ardaithe ag an dá Theachta agus b'fhéidir go ndeileálóidh mé leo sin ar dtús sula ndéarfaidh mé ráiteas ginearálta faoi chúrsaí mar atá siad sna Gaeltachtaí ar fad.  Luaigh an Teachta Horgan na haltanna a bhí i gceann do na páipéir laethúla le gairid. Caithfídh mé a rá gur léigh mé na haltanna sin, go bhfuil aithne agam ar an údar agus go naontaím go bhfuil a lán ama caite aige ag cuairt agus ina chónaí sna Gaeltachtaí, go mór mhór i nGaeltacht Chonamara, ag cur aithne ar agus ag caint leis na daoine a dhéanann chuid mhaith oibre thar ceann muintir na Gaeltachta.  Mar sin, bhí suim faoi leith agam ins an méid a bhí le rá aige faoi na Gaeltachtaí.  Bhí a lán den fhirinne aige, aontaím, agus tá sé chomh maith an fhírinne a inseacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thug mé cuairt ar na Gaeltachtaí ar fad, beagnach, taobh amuigh de na hoileáin, le roinnt seachtainí anuas agus feictear dom i gceantracha Ghaeltachta áirithe nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge chomh láidir agus a bhí sí.  Fiú amháin sul ar thug mé cuairt ar na Gaeltachtaí, ón méid sin litreacha a fhaigheann mé ó na Teachtaí Dála a bhfuil Gaeltachtaí ina nDáil cheantair, feicim, mar a dúirt an Teachta Begley inniu, go bhfuil daltaí ag freastal ar scoileanna sna Gaeltachtaí nach féidir leo an t-oideachas ceart i nGaeilge a fháil go minic toisc nach í an Ghaeilge a bhíonn mar ghnáth theanga teallaigh sa mbaile acu.  Ní deirimse le muintir an Gaeltachta gur ceart dóibh Gaeilge amháin a labhairt sa <Col N="628" /> mbaile&mdash;sílim go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbéadh an dá theanga ag chuile pháiste sa tír seo&mdash;ach bheadh an-díomá orm dá gcrothófaí dom go raibh furmhór de thuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta ag labhairt Béarla lena gclann.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil fáthanna éagsúla leis an gcaoi a bhfuil rudaí ann faoi láthair, agus b'fhéidir an fáth ba mhó atá ann, agus glacaim leis, ná nach raibh ag Gaeltarra Éireann nuair a chuaigh siad i mbun forbairt eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta an béim mar ba chóir acu ar úsáid na Gaeilge ins an monarchain i measc na noibrithe, fiú amháin i measc foireann Ghaeltarra féin.  Ba chóir dóibh go mbeadh, agus mar a deirim, sin b'fhéidir an fáth ba mhó gur cuireadh alt speisialta isteach ins an Acht um Udarás na Gaeltachta chun go dtabharfadh Údarás na Gaeltachta tús áite, nuair a chuirfí monarcha ar bun, nó nuair a bheidís i mbun fostaíocht a chur ar bun do muintir na Gaeltachta, do úsáid na Gaeilge agus caomhnú na Gaeilge, go mbeadh sé mar phríomh aidhm chumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht go ndéanfaí caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge; go mbeadh an tÚdarás freisin ag spreagadh na Gaeilge, agus go gcinntódh an tÚdarás gurb í an Ghaeilge a úsáidfí chomh fada agus ab fhéidir i mbun gnótha sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bheadh níos mó dóchas agam ná na Teachtaí a labhair i dtaobh cúrsaí eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachtaí agus an chaoí ar féidir forbairt eacnamaíochta a cheangal go dlúth le úsáid na teanga sa Ghaeltacht.  Aon uair a raibh deis agamsa labhairt le foireann mhonarchain nó le foireann an Údaráis nó le Bord an Údaráis, chuir mé béim an-mhór ar an úsaid ba cheart a bhaint den Ghaeilge agus an béim gur cheart a leagan ar an teanga i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta agus forbairt sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Deir an Teachta Begley go gceapann sé go pearsanta go bhfuil deacrachtaí san Údarás faoi láthair.  Mar atá a fhios aige, agus mar léirigh mé dó ag freagairt cheist uaidh an tseachtain seo caite, cheap mé le déanaí Cathaoirleach an <Col N="629" /> Údaráis go lán-aimseartha go dtí an chéad lá de Dheireadh Fómhair seo chugainn.  Dúirt mé ar an ócáid sin go bhfuil súil agam nach mbeidh gá go leanfadh sé taréis an tréimhse sin mar chathaoirleach.  Is í an fáth is mó go ndeachaigh sé isteach ná go raibh post aige mar Bhainisteoir Chontae Mhuigheo agus ag an am chéanna mar chathaoirleach Údarás na Gaeltachta. Thuig sé go raibh deacracht mhór aige an obair atá ar siúl ag an Údarás a thuiscint, an obair ó thaobh eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn, agus cheap sé, chun go mbeadh eolas níos fearr aige ar an obair atá ar siúl ag an Údarás agus ar na deacrachtaí atá acu, gur cheart dó dul isteach go lán aimseartha.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Teachta Begley an cheist díreach, an raibh eolas ag an bpríomh fheidhmeannach mar gheall ar an cheapachán sula ndearnadh é?  Bhí eolas aige faoí, pléadh leis é agus ghlac sé go fonnmhar leis.  Teastaíonn uaidh freisin go mbeadh eolas cruinn ag baill a bhfuil freagrach dó faoí chúrsaí forbairt eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta, agus mar sin, níl aon deacrachtaí ann agus ba mhaith liom é sin a léiriú go soiléir.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an deontas £10 a árdú, níl sé i gceist, mar d'fhreagair mé don Teachta céanna cúpla seachtain ó shin, é a ardú faoi láthair, ach tá mé ag breathnú air&mdash;os rud é go ndearnadh a lán cainte faoi agus mé ag taisteal na Gaeltachta&mdash;idir seo agus tús na bliana seo chugainn.  I gcás gur diúltigh oifígí mo Roinne an deontas deich bpunt a thabhairt do aon pháiste, beidh seans agam aithbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar sin agus b'fhéidir scrúdú eile a chur ar an bpáiste.  I gcásanna deacrachtaí áirithe, bíonn seans ag oifígí mo Roinne glaoch ar thuismitheoirí na bpáistí agus an rud a phlé leo, ach beagnach i gcónaí is fíorannamh nach dtugtar seans iomlán do pháiste atá lag in úsáid na Gaeilge nó i labhairt na Gaeilge, agus nuair a thagtar ar ais chun an scrúdú a dhéanamh an dara bhlian bíonn sé le feiceáil go soiléir sa chuid is mó de na cásanna go bíonn feabhas íontach, mar a dúirt an Teachta Begley, ar an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an-áthas ar an Teachta go bhfuil sé i gceist agamsa Scéim na nDeontas Títhíochta a athrú ar mhaithe leo siúd a thagann abhaile, b'fhéidir ó Shasana nó as Mheiriceá nó a thagann as ceanntracha eile ar fud na tíre le tithe a thógáil sa mbaile agus go mbíonn deacrachtaí acu ar dtús ó thaobh an choinníoll sin go mbíonn orthu gnáthchónaí a bheith acu sa Ghaeltacht nó go mbíonn deacrachtaí acu i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge mar ghnáth theanga theaghlaigh.  Faoi láthair, mar atá a fhios ag chuile dhuine, ní féidir an deontas a cheadú go dtí go mbíonn an cigire agus mise sásta go bhfuil an t-iarratasóir cáilithe i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus gnáth chónaí sa Ghaeltacht aige.  Sin iad an dá choinníoll go mbíonn an deacracht is mó fúthu.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liomsa dul i gcabhair ar dhaoine den tsórt sin, agus séard tá beartaithe agam san scéim nua gan teach a dhiúltú dóibh ach gur cheart dóibh brostú ar aghaidh le títhe a thógáil le cúnamh ón Roinn Comhshaoil&mdash;go gcuirfeadh siad isteach iarratais ar an £1,000 deontas ón Roinn sin. Iarratasóirí den chineál seo a mbeidh ar a gcumas leiriú taobh istigh de chúpla bliain go bhfuil ghnáth-chonaí acu sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge curtha i réim acu mar ghnáth theanga theaghlaigh, beidh deontas speisialta suas go dtí £800 le fáil acu thar bharr an deontais £1,000 ón Roinn Comhshaoil. Sílim go mbeidh roinnt mhór de mhuintir na Gaeltachta sásta go bhfuil mé ag teacht i gcabhair ar dhaoine den tsórt seo a thagann abhaile, de bharr feabhas eacnamaíochta sa bhaile agus go bhfuil seans acu post a fháil sa mbaile, agus a thógann a gclann le Gaeilge.  Tá mé cinnte go rachaidh an scéim seo cuid mhaith den bhealach le réiteach a fháil ar na fadhbanna atá ann faoi láthair a bhaineann leis na deontais títhe atá le fáil ó mo Roinn.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Horgan faoin chaoí a fhreagraímse Ceisteanna Dála anseo.  Bheadh an-aithbhéal ormsa dá gceapfadh aon duine gur chreid mise, go pearsanta nó mar Aire, nach raibh cead ag aon duine sa Teach seo nó taobh <Col N="631" /> amuigh de nach raibh Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu ceisteanna faoi chúrsaí eacnamaíochta nó cultúrtha a phlé i leith na Gaeltachta nó i leith na Gaeilge.  Ní sin an chreidiúint pearsanta atá agamsa. Creidim go bhfuil sé ceart agus cóir ag chuile dhuine sa tír seo a bheith ag plé agus ag caint faoi chúrsaí na teanga agus na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach gur féidir iad seo a phlé istigh i nDáil Éireann.  Mar a deirim, má táimid i ndáiríre faoi cheist na teanga, má táimid i ndáiríre mar Bhaill den Teach seo, toghtha ag muintir na hÉireann, faoi dul chun cinn na teanga mar ghnáth-theanga urlabhra ar fud na hÉireann, tá sé de dhualgas orainn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn taobh istigh den Dáil agus an Seanad ar dtús.  Ní dóigh liomsa gur ceart do aon duine, mé féin ina measc, sa Teach seo a bheith ag cur faoi deara do phobal forleathan na tíre seo an Ghaeilge a úsáid lena bpáistí, ina measc féin ina gcuid dualgas gnó agus tí, mura bhfuilimíd féin sásta iarracht a dhéanamh sa Rialtas agus i measc na Teachtaí Dála agus na Seanadóirí an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn inár measc féin.  Dar liomsa go fada&mdash;agus tá mé cinnte go n-aontódh an Teachta Horgan liom&mdash;an rud is fearr ná dá bhféadfadh na trí pairtíthe polaitíochta sa Teach seo teacht le chéile agus socrú deimhníoch a dhéanamh iad féin faoi céard is mian leo a dhéanamh nó céard atá siad sásta a dhéanamh le dul chun cinn na Gaeilge i measc a gcuid Teachtaí Dála féin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Faraoir, agus is oth liom é a rá, ní rabhamar in ann teacht ar réiteach den tsórt sin leis na páirtíthe polaitíochta ar fad.  Táimidne i bpairtí Fhianna Fáil ag dul ar aghaidh leis linn féin agus beidh mise sásta é a phlé le haon duine dena Teachtaí Dála ar an dtaobh thall nó leis na ceannairí pairtí, nó beidh Bord na Gaeilge sásta é a phlé leo, go bhfeicimid céard is féidir linn a dhéanamh le féabhas a cur ar an gceist sin.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua go mbeidh cuid de Roinn na Gaeltachta ag aistriú go Gaeltacht Chonamara, go dtí Na Forbacha, i gceann coicíse nó mar sin.  Mar <Col N="632" /> atá a fhios againn tá an oifíg nua tógtha agus is cuid de phlean an Rialtais seo dílárú a dhéanamh chomh fada agus is féidir é sin a dhéanamh ar Ranna Stáit. Tá 30 oifígeach nó mar sin i gceist ins an dílárú de chuid Roinn na Gaeltachta agus sílim go gcuideoidh sé lena thaispeáint do mhuintir na tíre go bhfuil an Roinn lán-dáiríre i dtaobh forbairt eacnamaíochta agus forbairt chultúrtha na Gaeltachta, gur cheart duinn brú ar aghaidh chomh tapaidh agus is féidir leis an dílárú sin.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann Teachtaí gurb í an Ghaeltacht foinse agus tobar na teangan agus gurb í an Ghaeltacht agus a slánú ar sin a chaomhnós chugainn an chuid is luachmhaire dár gcultúr nó dár n-oidhreacht.  Is tuar dóchais domsa an dea-thoil atá ann anois don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge atá le n-aireachtáil go forleathan sin ar fud na tíre agus is gnó é a bhaineann linn uilig an bhá atá ann anois don Ghaeilge, don teanga agus don chultúr a shaothrú ar bhealach go mbeidh siad fonnmhar iarracht phearsanta a dhéanamh iad féin iarracht leanúnach le go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-mhéan cumarsáide.  Ba mhaith liom a rá chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liomsa mar Aire na Gaeltachta mar bhall den Teach seo go mbeidh mise sásta aon chomhoibriú nó aon chabhair a thabhairt agus nár mhaith liom go rachadh éinne amach as an dTeach leis an dtuairim nach bhfuil mé sásta cur suas le duine nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a thoil, go dtugaim chuile chabhair gur féidir liom don té sin.  Mar sin, mar a deirim, beimid ag brath orainn anseo, ar mhuintir na tíre, ach go háirithe ar Bhord na Gaeilge agus ar an Údarás le forbairt na teangan agus forbairt eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn san bhliain atá amach romhainn.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £7,112,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of <Col N="633" /> payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and of the Public Record Office, and of the Keeper of State Papers and for the purchase of historical documents, etc., and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Cheann Comhairle, I propose that all the Votes for which I am responsible be taken together but I shall endeavour to answer any questions on any particular Vote.</P>
    <P>The total Estimate for all the votes for which I am responsible is £144,128,000 made up as follows: Vote 22&mdash;Office of the Minister for Justice, £7,112,000; Vote 23&mdash;Garda Síochána, £110,554,000; Vote 24&mdash;Prisons, £188,255,000; Vote 25&mdash;Courts, £4,723,000; Vote 26&mdash; Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, £3,384,000; Vote 27&mdash;Charitable Donations and Bequests, £100,000.  This total of £144,128,000 compares with a total Estimate for these six Votes of £101,910,000 in 1979.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me I would like to take the opportunity to say a few words concerning the various areas for which I, as Minister for Justice, have responsibility.</P>
    <P>The safeguarding of the security of the State and the fight against crime places a very heavy and ever-increasing burden on the Exchequer.  I am sure, however, that Deputies will agree with me that this expenditure is essential.  This year, for the first time, the overall provision in the Vote for the Garda Síochána has topped the £100 million mark.</P>
    <P>It is my job as Minister for Justice to see that the force have sufficient resources of men and equipment to respond to the demands that society is making on it.  As regards manpower, the House will already be aware of the substantial increases in Garda strength which have taken place since I took office as Minister for Justice.  In July 1977 the strength of the Garda Síochána was <Col N="634" /> 8,485 people.  By 1 June this year the strength of the force had been increased to 9,607, or by approximately 13 per cent.  In all, a total of 1,560 gardaí have been recruited since July 1977 but allowing for wastage, due to retirements and deaths, the net increase in strength is 1,122.  Recruitment of additional gardaí is still continuing and another recruitment campaign is at present under way with a view to bringing the overall strength of the force to 10,000 by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>To ensure that all the manpower provided for the force is utilised in the the most efficient way possible, studies are being conducted in provincial Garda districts and in the Dublin area, to see what combinations of patrol cars, cycles and foot patrols, with the assistance of modern radio communications, can provide the best service to the local communities. The Garda authorities accept that some experimentation is desirable in these matters and pilot schemes are planned for selected areas to see whether long-standing methods of providing Garda coverage can be improved upon. These pilot schemes will be conducted in full consultation with local communities and I am hopeful that they will produce very worthwhile results.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Garda authorities, at my instance, are working on details of plans for new measures intended to provide stronger and more effective Garda coverage in Dublin and other major cities.</P>
    <P>A number of Garda areas of work are already being aided by computer systems, that is, work related to the registration of firearms, stolen and suspect vehicles, crime reporting and recording, missing persons, and so on. Some of these systems are being developed and others are planned.</P>
    <P>The Forensic Science Laboratory of my Department is only in its fifth year in existence but already it has established itself as an important aid to the Garda Síochána in their efforts to apprehend wrongdoers and obtain convictions in court.  The staff have been substantially <Col N="635" /> increased and, in addition, the very best and most up-to-date equipment has been provided for use in the laboratory.  This is a concrete example of this Government's commitment to assist the Garda.</P>
    <P>Work is also going ahead on the planning of a modern, national radio network for the force and I want to take this opportunity to thank a number of the foremost experts in the country who are acting as an advisory committee to oversee this work on my behalf.  A consultant has been engaged to do detailed design work and it is hoped that the force will begin to experience the benefits of the new system in the coming year.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Garda radio maintenance and repair service be expanded and improved in preparation for the new radio network which I have referred to and negotiations on this matter will commence shortly with the Garda Associations concerned.</P>
    <P>The crime situation continues to give cause for concern.  As the recent debate during Private Member's Business on the topic of violence and vandalism ranged over the crime situation generally, I shall confine myself today to some brief remarks.  The crime statistics for 1979 which I propose to give are provisional figures only.  The final figures will appear in the Commissioner's Annual Crime Report for 1979 which will be published in a few months time.</P>
    <P>The number of indictable offences for 1979 is provisionally 64,051 which represents an increase of 3.3 per cent on the 1978 figure.  A total of 26,310 of these offences were detected in 1979; this is a 41 per cent detection rate, which is about the same as the rate for 1978. Statistics for 1980 obviously have to be treated with some caution but provisional figures in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan Area for the first four months of 1980 indicate an increase of 21.5 per cent over the corresponding period for last year.  This worsening crime situation is of course very worrying.</P>
    <P>In common with societies the world <Col N="636" /> over, we have experienced a serious rise in crime in recent years.  As in the case of other countries, we have experienced an upsurge in violent crimes and in organised crimes.  Armed robberies, for example, which increased rapidly during the seventies have been of particular concern.  There are varying opinions, even among experts, as to the causes of this development.  Whatever the causes, the Government are resolute in their determination to take all reasonable steps to maintain standards of law and order.</P>
    <P>Substantial Garda resources have to be allocated to combat the activities of subversive organisations and to safeguard the security of the State.  A high level of Garda manpower is maintained in the Border areas to ensure protection of the public there and to prevent the use of those areas for the mounting of attacks in Northern Ireland. The measures that have been taken and that continue to be taken in allocating Garda and, indeed, Army personnel in substantial numbers to the Border areas involve a high cost.</P>
    <P>I would like here to compliment the Garda Síochána for the work they are doing in this area.  They have had some outstanding successes.  During recent months they have seized large quantities of arms, ammunition and explosive materials.  These seizures will have contributed to the saving of lives.  I would also like to thank the Army for the continuing assistance they give to the Garda in the fight against terrorist crime.</P>
    <P>Calls for the abolition of the Special Criminal Court are again being made by persons some of whom have consistently opposed the existence of the court.  The House will be aware of the kneecapping in Donegal recently of a witness who gave evidence before the court.  I am aware that other potential witnesses in Special Criminal Court cases have been subject to intimidation in recent times.  I can give the House an assurance that the Special Criminal Court will remain in being for as long as the Government are satisfied that the need for it exists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> In August 1978, I received representations from the associations representing the ranks of the force up to and including chief superintendent to establish a committee of inquiry to examine and report on their pay.  After some negotiation with the associations I was able to establish a committee of inquiry with broader terms of reference than those envisaged earlier by the associations. Copies of the report of this committee were laid before this House on 11 May 1979.  I am sure Deputies are well aware of the various recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>The pay increases recommended in the report were substantial and were implemented from 1 March 1979, as recommended by the committee.  Taking pay and rent allowance together the increases varied between 12 per cent for a recruit in training and 26 per cent for a garda with 15 years service.  The increases for other ranks up to superintendent were also of the order of 26 per cent.  The chief superintendents' increase was 21 per cent but these had already got a 5 per cent increase in 1977.  The annual cost to the Exchequer is £14 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increases in pay resulting from the recommendations of the Ryan Committee, the force have also benefited from the increases under the national understanding.  Taking all the increases into account, the remuneration of a recruit garda has gone up by 35 per cent in the past 15 months and the remuneration of a garda with 15 years' service has gone up by 50 per cent.  The increases for sergeants and higher ranks have also been of the order of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the volume of court business continues to increase and the court structure generally has been under great pressure but, I am pleased to be able to tell the House, the district and circuit courts have coped well with the increased flow.  This has been accomplished with the assistance of one temporary Circuit Court judge and two temporary district justices who were <Col N="638" /> appointed in 1978 to help with the increased work-load.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to say that the extremely serious arrears of business, especially criminal business, that existed in the Dublin Circuit Court in 1977 have been completely wiped out and, since this is the first opportunity I have had of doing so in this House, I want publicly to pay tribute&mdash;in which, I feel sure all Members of the House would wish to join&mdash;to the President of the Circuit Court and his colleagues who achieved this remarkable success.</P>
    <P>The situation in the High Court is not so satisfactory, but I hasten to add this is not the fault of the court.  Two additional High Court judges were, however, appointed in October 1979, following the enactment of the Courts Act, 1979, and arrangements are in hand for the provision later this year of two additional jury court rooms in the Four Courts, one of which will be for use by both the Circuit Court and the High Court, and the other by the High Court.  I am hopeful that arrangements which the President of the High Court has made for the disposal of court business over the coming months will help to bring about a substantial and lasting reduction.</P>
    <P>In the area of the provision of court resources, a serious problem is accommodation. Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation, with certain exceptions in the Dublin area, is vested by law in local authorities.  It is accepted that there are some venues where the court accommodation is less than satisfactory and I am at present having an inquiry carried out to establish the level of improvements required at the various court venues throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The accommodation problem is most acute in Dublin where the steepest increase in court business has been experienced. Plans are now well advanced for the building of a new court office block on the site of the old Four Courts Hotel and when this is built and ready for occupation staff at present housed in the Four Courts proper will be transferred to it, thereby releasing accommodation <Col N="639" /> suitable for adaptation as additional courtrooms which should ease the court accommodation problems of the High and Circuit Courts in Dublin for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The accommodation at the Children's Court in Dublin Castle has been the subject of criticism in recent times and I am glad to be able to inform the House that substantial improvements and redecoration have been carried out there by the Office of Public Works.  However, the long-term solution is to move this court away from its existing premises and planning to this end is in train in consultation with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Over £18 million has been estimated for expenditure on prisons in 1980. There are at present nine institutions operating under my Department as prisons and places of detention and the special school at Loughan House.  The estimate for the Vote was based on an average daily population of 1,355.  The total net estimate for the Vote exceeds the corresponding figure for 1979 by £4.964 million&mdash;an increase of 37 per cent.  The main increases occur under subheads A, D and G.</P>
    <P>The increase under subhead A, salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;£3,423 million or 38 per cent&mdash;is due to the fact that it is intended to increase the number of serving prison staff to 1,500 by the end of 1980.  This means that 400 staff will be recruited in 1980 representing a net increase of about 350 or 30 per cent on staff numbers at the end of 1979. Taking into account the period required for recruitment and training of new recruits, the majority of them will not be on effective duty until well into the year. Even with additional staff, however, overtime will still be necessary especially to cover prisoners' evening recreation period.  This overtime cannot be substantially reduced without changes in the rostering arrangements and discussions are continuing with the Prison Officers' Association on this topic.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of uniforms and other miscellaneous allowances, which <Col N="640" /> are also accounted for under this subhead, has increased from £0.417 million in 1979 to £1.101 million in 1980.  This is due partly to the proposed increase in the number of prison officers and partly to a reduction in the replacement period for some items of uniform.</P>
    <P>Under subhead D, £3.8 million is provided for building and equipment.  Of this £3 million is for &ldquo;sites, new works, alterations and additions&rdquo; and represents an increase of £1.2 million on last year's estimate.  The balance of the subhead, £800,000, is attributed to maintenance and equipment and to the rental of storage accommodation&mdash;the corresponding figure for last year was £650,000.</P>
    <P>Major capital building works are being carried out at Mountjoy, Arbour Hill Training Unit, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  Initial site works have begun for the new high security prison at Portlaoise.  The first phase of the development of the Wheatfield, County Dublin, site will commence in 1980.</P>
    <P>For some years past successive Ministers for Justice have expressed their dissatisfaction with the custodial accommodation for women.  I am determined that during my term of office tangible steps will be taken to build a new women's prison.  I have already publicly announced that Wheatfield will be developed, starting in 1980, to provide the long awaited replacement for the women's prison.</P>
    <P>On another part of the Wheatfield lands, work will also commence this year on the provision of a place of detention for 120 male juveniles between 16 and 21 years of age.  This new accommodation for juveniles, together with a similar provision located in Cork city, will replace the present St. Patrick's Institution and enable St. Patrick's to be phased out of use as a place of detention for male juveniles.</P>
    <P>The prison service training programme is being expanded and improvements are being made.</P>
    <P>The question of legal aid&mdash;particularly legal aid in civil matters&mdash;has <Col N="641" /> been the subject of considerable public interest and comment during the current year.  Deputies will be aware that I laid the Government's scheme of civil legal aid and advice before the House in December 1979 and at that time I also set up the Legal Aid Board to administer the scheme.  The Government's scheme goes well beyond the manifesto promise which was:</P>
    <P>Legal aid will be extended to civil proceedings where this is necessary; as a first step it will be introduced in the area of family law.</P>
    <P>The increasing cost of providing criminal legal aid has become a matter of concern to me and I am looking forward to receiving the committee's recommendations on this and other aspects of the scheme in its final report which I expect to receive in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention now certain important legislative proposals that I confidently expect to bring before the House by the end of the year and, in some cases, before that.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their latest report to me recommended a substantial extension of the civil jurisdictions of the district and circuit courts and the conferring on those courts of new jurisdiction in family law matters.  A Bill based on these recommendations is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated in this House that I have legislation in relation to the law of rape under preparation.  On 27 March 1980, I stated that I confidently expected to introduce the necessary Bill on this subject within the present year. Since then, consideration of the very complex issues involved has advanced considerably and as a result I expect to be shortly presenting my proposals to the Government.  Although a considerable amount of drafting work has yet to be done, I now expect that I may be in a position to introduce the proposed Bill much earlier than the deadline I had already given.</P>
    <P>Finally, I know that the Law Reform Commission have every hope of being <Col N="642" /> able to present their final recommendations in regard to the tort of criminal conversation and certain other torts quite soon.  On that basis I can confidently predict that by the end of this year I will be introducing a Bill to abolish the tort of criminal conversation and certain other torts, while at the same time indicating, by the presence or absence of other proposals in the Bill, what the Government's attitude is on the question whether a new form or forms of action should be recommended to the Houses.</P>
    <P>My other areas of responsibility include the Land Registry, Registry of Deeds, Public Record Office, Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, Adoption, Censorship of Films and Publications, Aliens' Control and Charitable Donations and Bequests.  Unfortunately in the time allotted to me I cannot comment on them now but I shall endeavour to answer any questions that Deputies may wish to ask.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to welcome what the Minister has to say about the different matters, courts, jails, rape and everything else.  We do not have time at our disposal to deal with these.  I also want to put on the record that I think the arrangements made by the Whips are unacceptable to the House when dealing with an Estimate as big as the Department of Justice and the fact that the Minister did not have sufficient time to deal completely with his brief emphasises the point I am making.  In future we will have to deal with this with more time to spare.  Let me say that I sympathise with the Minister on that point.</P>
      <P>Let me say bluntly to the Minister that he has been more vocal about crime, crime detection and crime prevention in opposition than he has been successful in relation to those matters in Government. Some of the promises made in the manifesto were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> 6.  Satisfactory negotiation procedures for the Garda Síochána will be set up to investigate such areas as work conditions, disciplinary complaints, transfers and promotions.</P>
    <P>7.  Whatever technical equipment, foot patrols or overtime is required to combat the serious increase in urban crime will be provided, as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>That is the point that I am going to take. The phrase &ldquo;as a matter of urgency&rdquo; is used.  What is urgent about serious crime at the moment?  Every Thursday and Friday night people wonder which bank is going to be broken into next and which garda is going to be held up.  At the moment we have not sufficient gardaí on the streets to deal with urban crime.  It is an indictment of the Minister and the Department of Justice and, indeed, the Government that they are not combating this and are not listening to the crying voices of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Both Garda representative bodies have continually called on the Department of Justice, through the Minister, for certain things and they are not getting them.  Last week there was comment about it.  But what do we get?  We have the Minister attending a Garda representative conference and lecturing them on the way he is combating crime.  But the facts are different.  Are the figures given by the Minister in a report in the paper in the last couple of days correct?  Will the Minister clearly state to the general public which figures in relation to increase in crime are correct, the ones put forward to the Minister and the Department of Justice by the Garda, or the ones put forward by the Minister?  The people have a constitutional right to safety.  They should be able to go to their beds at night to sleep in peace knowing that their property is not going to be interfered with.  That is not the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>Bad as urban crime is, it is equally bad in rural Ireland because now, with the concentration of gardaí in the centre of the city, crime has moved out to the <Col N="644" /> suburbs and the property of the people living in the suburbs is now threatened. It is a system of robbing Peter to pay Paul that the Minister is operating to combat crime and it is not good enough. About two years ago, in September 1978, I made an impassioned plea to the Minister to negotiate with the Garda, to ask them to do more duties.  I know I made certain recommendations which were not acceptable to all gardaí but they were acceptable to a large majority in the Garda.  The position is that if we are to combat crime we need more gardaí.  The Minister does not have facilities to train sufficient gardaí, to have them out on the beat and give them the experience they need to fight in the war against crime.  Furthermore, the number of gardaí on the streets at the moment is three-quarters of the number we had at the time of the Conroy Report when the working hours of the gardaí were reduced.  God knows, this was needed because when I was in Donegal I did not know what a garda looked like in civilian clothes; he always wore his uniform except for a family wedding or a funeral or holidays because he was all the time on duty.  That was an absolutely antiquated, Victorian age and the Garda had to be updated.  The Conroy Report resulted in the updating of their conditions and their working hours.  It did not give us more men on the beat but then we had no bank robberies at the end of the sixties and the beginning of the seventies.  It was only after trouble broke out in the North, which coincided with the Conroy Report, that the trouble started and we find now that virtually every week there are bank robberies and gardaí being held up.  It is a ludicrous situation to have an unarmed garda protecting a bank with robbers coming in and pushing him to the floor and treating him as if he were a dog.  Would it not be quite easy for the Minister, as part of a back-up force, to have armed police officers on the streets in civilian clothes so that the raider would not know which person in the street was the detective?  It is just not good enough to expose unarmed gardaí who are protecting the funds of the wealthy rich <Col N="645" /> here in these banks to these risks.  It is not good enough to have security officers being paid far more for transporting this money than the gardaí who are giving them the security and the Army that are backing them up.  There is unrest in the Garda at the moment because of this.  The security officers in Dublin Airport are paid far more basic pay than the Garda are being paid at the moment.  They have unlimited overtime, any amount of overtime they want and that is a very necessary part of living today and the Garda are not getting this. The Minister cannot run away from the problem any longer.  He cannot ignore the plea from the Garda representative bodies that there is a need for more gardaí on the beat and he cannot ignore the fact that he has got the power to put the number of gardaí on the beat that we require.  If we want to combat crime we have to have gardaí on the streets.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why experienced gardaí who are knowledgeable in the war against crime are not allowed to work longer hours.  I am not talking about something that would be permanent.  I am speaking in the context of the emergency situation that exists.  The Minister should consult with the Garda representatives at all levels and endeavour to find a base for overtime pay. If the people who elect us want security, there is an obligation on the Government to provide that security.  The Garda are willing to co-operate in this whole area of security but they must be paid properly for any overtime that is involved. Like any other section of the community they are prepared to work if they are being paid for that work but they cannot be expected to work more than a 40-hour week if they will not be paid for the overtime involved.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the war against crime can be stepped up substantially if we are prepared to negotiate a new deal with the Garda.  There is no reason for gardaí being deployed on prison work and neither is there any reason for their being engaged in the work of escorting security vans especially when the security men are being paid more than <Col N="646" /> the gardaí.  That is a dangerous situation. I have been told there are many men in senior positions in the Garda who are considering resigning from the force in the knowledge that they will be able to get more lucrative pay from security firms.</P>
    <P>According to figures supplied by the Garda Representive Body, the crime rate has increased by 25 per cent.  The Minister must do something about this very serious situation and the only way in which he can act is by ensuring that there are sufficient gardaí on the beat and that there is a back up of better communications and better car patrols. There is no point in substituting patrol cars for men on the beat when the men in the cars are not familiar with the areas they are patrolling.</P>
    <P>I have been living in Raphoe since my marriage in 1953 and if I wished to contact a garda there I would not be able to recognise one of these young men out of uniform.  The same situation applies in every other area and it is due to the fact that gardaí are no longer allowed to remain in districts in which they have become known and respected.  What is the reason for the change in policy in this regard?  If a garda is known and respected in an area he will be given willingly any information he seeks.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply to some of these remarks by saying that garda strength is to be increased by 500 and that when we were in office the force was not increased.  While that is correct, there is an explanation for it.</P>
    <P>At the outbreak of the troubles in Northern Ireland and following the bombing of the customs post at Lifford, I telephoned the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, to tell him that there was a good deal of anxiety in that town and that I wished to speak to him about arranging for more gardaí to be sent to the area. Subsequently I met the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, and the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Cronin, on the matter.  When I asked Deputy O'Malley about more gardaí for the area I was told that they were not available and when I replied that we would have to <Col N="647" /> train extra men he replied that not only was there not the time to train them but that we could not get men to train.  At that time the strength of the force was embarrassingly low, consisting of about 8,000 people.  I turned then to Deputy Cronin and said that if we could not have gardaí, we must have military police but his reply was that we did not have sufficient men in the Army to secure Army installations.  That was in 1971 when we were talking about securing the Border but it was a situation that was no different from the situation that existed when Fianna Fáil left office in 1973.  The Coalition did their best to increase the strength both of the Army and of the Garda and it is unfair of the Minister to act as if he had a box of Smarties, saying, &ldquo;Look at how many there are in the force now.&rdquo;  The Minister is doing a great deal of good but he should not try to demonstrate the good he is doing by exposing what other people did not do without giving the full facts.  All previous Fianna Fáil Governments share the responsibility for allowing the Army and the Garda to be depleted to an all-time low.</P>
    <P>To give an example of how Garda strength has been weakened let us have regard to the changes brought about as a result of the Conroy Report.  The situation up to then had been that in a station in this city in which there was a garda strength of 36, those 36 men were divided into three groups of 12, each group working eight hours per day, but the situation after the implementation of the Conroy proposals would have been that those 36 men would have been broken into four groups thereby leaving nine men on duty instead of 12.  In saying that, I recognise that Conroy was necessary in terms of up-dating Garda conditions but the changes resulted in fewer men being on duty at any time. The only way of coping with the present emergency system is for the Minister, in consultation with the Garda representative bodies, to reach agreement on a proper rate of overtime pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Estimate for the <Col N="648" /> Department of Justice should be concerned primarily with a basic attempt at trying to understand how society can cope with the task of instilling improved standards of justice throughout the community and with a better way of coping with crime.  Any such Estimate should contain some basic provision for the kind of society we must have if crime is to diminish and to be tackled at its roots. Unfortunately, the Estimate before us is little more than a litany of stereotyped reactions, of increasing sums of money payable in accordance with a formula that is enacted year after year but with little success in coping with crime or in bringing about improved standards of justice.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the whole concept of justice in our community is becoming increasingly disrespected, a situation for which there are very deep roots which should be dealt with at least in passing by the Minister on this Estimate or on the occasion of a similar opportunity.  Instead, we find that the major preoccupation in the Estimate is to claim, almost triumphantly, that somehow it is progress to be able to inform the House that, for instance, the estimate in respect of prisons has increased by 37 per cent and that the estimates for other areas of detention are mounting beyond levels that are acceptable.  While all of this may be necessary, it must be necessary also to try to ensure that next year the Estimate for the Department will not have to be doubled.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte has dealt with the concern being expressed about the failure of the Government to deal with the present situation.  At the more basic level, there is not only abject failure but apparently there is not even sufficient consideration to justify a reference to the whole concept of justice in either of two successive Estimate speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were forthright and committed in their election manifesto in the area of justice.  In this regard they gave seven explicit commitments.  More in sadness than in anger, I am suggesting to the House that not one of these commitments has been implemented.  The <Col N="649" /> first one was that the existing legal aid system in criminal cases would be improved and extended.  I have not heard a word since about that.</P>
    <P>The second promise was that legal aid would be extended to civil cases where this is necessary and that as a first step it would be introduced in the area of family law.  The Minister claims in his speech that he has gone beyond that.  The reality is that the scheme is not yet in operation and, despite all the huffing and puffing over the last two years, this extension of the scheme&mdash;heralded by experts in the area as being doomed to fail, in any event, bound presumably by the strictures of the Department of Finance who would be afraid that it might cost too much to ensure that justice operated in the community&mdash;is still trying to limp and flounder into existence.  That is the level of success in that area.</P>
    <P>The third promise was that new, informal and less institutionalised procedures and tribunals would be established in relation to family law and child offenders which would have expert remedial and social back-up services at their disposal, not to mention the informal Consumer Tribunals.  Let silence be my charity about the progress in those areas.</P>
    <P>No. 4 promised the acceptance of majority verdicts in criminal cases where agreement is reached by at least ten jurors.  I am not completely convinced of the merit or otherwise of that proposal but presumably those who made it believed that they would implement it.  It does not seem one which would require major consideration and I wonder why it has not been done, if it was promised.</P>
    <P>No. 5 was that the 1908 Children's Act would be amended to bring it into line with modern social thinking, that the age of criminal responsibility would be reviewed and that the criminal capacity of the child would be assessed at informal hearings.  One of the shames of this House is the manner in which it has ignored the children of this country.  Its abject failure to do anything about reform of children's legislation is one of the sadder chapters of the increasingly tatty history of this House.  I consider it <Col N="650" /> to be particularly sad when it is about children who, by and large, are inarticulate and cannot fight for themselves. That is a complete and abject failure on the Minister's part.</P>
    <P>No. 6 was that satisfactory negotiation procedures for the Garda Síochána would be set up to investigate such areas as work conditions and so on.  Deputy Harte has mentioned this and has shown that, in fact, what has happened in the meantime clearly indicates that the Garda are far from satisfied that any improvement has been carried out here.  Indeed, for the first time in my memory, the implication has been made that there has been a new and increased level of political interference with the manner in which justice is dispensed, an allegation which should be dealt with in a very fulsome manner by the Minister in the interests of everybody in this House.</P>
    <P>No. 7 was that whatever technical equipment, foot patrols or overtime was required to combat the serious increase in urban crime would be provided&mdash; mind you, as a matter of urgency.  In a Dáil question to the Minister for Justice some weeks ago, I discovered that the number of gardaí in the inner city of Dublin, about which the Minister waxes so eloquent and is so concerned, has increased in the last three years since he became Minister for Justice by a total of three gardaí, a decrease in real terms, if taken as a percentage of the population. That says enough about the concern there.</P>
    <P>The whole area of justice is a very difficult and very challenging one.  The Minister has made mistake after mistake and has shown himself not be to truly and deeply concerned about justice in the community.  Indeed, if he were even concerned about the basic matters, about consultations with communities, he would have been able, by adequate and proper consultation to have ensured that his plans for prisons in the Clondalkin area, about which Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Harte and others in this House are concerned and about which many people in the community are concerned, would have got off to a better start.</P>

      <P>Instead of that, he makes a lame and weak appeal for our support when he has made his mind up on the matter.  This side of the House would be responsible and responsive to a Minister's request if we were asked in a dignified way at the beginning of such a decision-making process.  These residents should have got a better hearing from the Minister than they got.</P>
      <P>We also want to know if the blue-print which he has talked about and promised in relation to crime, and which of course is the most vaunted and most talked about proposal in recent times, has anything at all to do with the proposal submitted by the Garda bodies, comment on which was notably absent from his speech.</P>
      <P>Finally, and I do not say this with any great degree of glee or joy because the Minister has a difficult job, his career in the Department of Justice since I have come to take an interest in it in parliamentary terms has been marked by the response which we get when we ask about crime in the community or about standards of justice, or about court facilities, or simple matters like the delays in High Court judgments which are an increasing scandal and about which the Minister appears to be unable to even comment.  His reaction on all occasions has been to say that we must spend more money to build more jails, to build bigger cells and to make stronger keys and locks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recognises, as anyone in this House who is a responsible public representative does, that the origins of crime run deep in our community and will not be solved merely by massive doses of expenditure in reactionary responses to crime.  We must have security in the streets and secure and good prisons, a contented and well-equipped Garda force and so, too, with the prison officers.  But we must have more than that and the Minister knows it.  There has not been one word of a deeper concern in any speech the Minister has made in this House since I <Col N="652" /> came into it, and I am saddened by that. If this were the operation of a private company and if the Minister were chairman of the board in this area, he would be asked to resign, and he should seriously consider doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking, before the Minister tenders his resignation.  The Minister has a thankless job, but he would not be surprised if that were the last bouquet which travels in his direction from this side of the House this afternoon. He is over 21, he took the post with his eyes open and he cannot turn around and tell us or anybody else that he would have thought differently about it if he had had longer to think about it. The reason why the Minister's job is a thankless one is not just because there is a law and order problem and a crime problem.  It is especially thankless because he is a member of the Fianna Fáil administration.  The Minister finds himself in a position of having to mop up many of the consequences of the social and economic problems created largely by the overall economic and financial policies of the administration of which he forms a part.</P>
      <P>I am not so naive as to argue, as some people might, that every time a 16 or 17 year old person hits an old age pensioner over the head with a lump of wood and steals a handbag, it is the 16 or 17 year old who is the victim of society. However, I do believe that the pressures, the strains and the constraints in society as a whole, and particularly the economic ones, have far more to tell us about the incidence of crime, its nature and its geographical distribution than any over-simplified analysis of criminal actions, whether they take place in the inner city or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one long-term answer to the law and order problem and it has two aspects, as anybody who listened recently to the compelling series of radio documentaries about the Sheriff Street area will believe.  The first is employment, the second is a fairer distribution of the good things of this life.  Why <Col N="653" /> should we wonder at the existence of a law and order problem under an administration which has so consistently failed to provide either?</P>
    <P>One of the ironies, of course, and I am presuming for the moment a degree of personal culpability&mdash;is that the underprivileged in our society rarely, if ever, go about preying on the wealthiest members of society.  It is not the ordinary householder who can afford a house with a couple of acres of garden, a 10 foot high wall with glass on top, an electronic alarm system, alsatian dogs, the private security services to keep him and his property safe from the depredations of people who believe in a slightly unorthodox transfer of resources in society.  It is the ordinary householder who, by and large, has to suffer the consequences of, among other things&mdash;and I would not underestimate the element of personal culpability in any of these areas&mdash;the failure to find employment and the failure to provide an adequate and fair distribution of the resources of society.</P>
    <P>The job of the Minister and of his Department is a mopping-up one.  Unfortunately it is also one which can tend to legitimise a society which fails to provide for many of our young people the jobs they need, which fails to provide structures which redistribute wealth in society to those who need it most.</P>
    <P>A lot has been talked here this afternoon about prisons and the Minister spoke of them in his introductory remarks.  I am sure at least a part of the Minister will agree with me when I say that if he and the Government were doing their job properly they would be closing down prisons and not opening them up.  I am particularly upset by the proposal to build a new women's prison in this country.  I cannot see the logic for it.  We are told, not directly in the Minister's speech, that he intends to provide more than twice the maximum number of cells that have ever been occupied by women in the recent past in this country.  Not only that, but surely the Minister will admit that the main crimes for which women are imprisoned <Col N="654" /> in our society&mdash;crimes connected with prostitution and shop-lifting&mdash;are crimes which many people believe should be totally de-criminalised and which many other people believe should be remedied by means other than custodial sentences? We must ask the Minister here and now to state whether or not he will reconsider this proposal, not least because a new women's prison of this size and type could be a most expensive white elephant and a very ill-fitting monument to his tenure in this department.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to a number of other areas, some of which were covered by the Minister's speech and others which were not.  The first is in connection with ground rents.  During the last election campaign spokesmen for the Minister's party were going around doing their best to give the impression that the Fianna Fáil Party, if returned to Government, would abolish existing ground rents.  I, and other speakers from my party, as well as speakers from the Fine Gael Party, did our level best to warn people that what was involved here was a major confidence trick, that there were substantial constitutional problems involved and that the phraseology of the Fianna Fáil manifesto&mdash;a promise to introduce a scheme leading to the abolition of residential ground rents&mdash;was not necessarily what it seemed to be and that the commitment it appeared to express might prove to be a very tenuous one indeed. Now, three years later, the people have realised that they were unwise to have accepted that commitment at face value.  Many of them must be bitterly regretting that they did not pay more heed to the warnings issued at public meetings by speakers from the Labour and Fine Gael Parties about the deviousness of the approach then being adopted to this question.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I put down a question to the Minister for Finance in relation to ground rents paid on Government property.  I did not do so with any intention of wasting civil servants' time.  I was astonished to get an answer that must have been one of the longest in the <Col N="655" /> history of the State, containing over 30 pages of information about premises the Government owned and on which they paid ground rent&mdash;indeed, they had actually bought premises on which ground rent was payable.  So much for the reality behind the rhetoric.  We remain unaware so far of whether or not the Government have even decided, or inaugurated, the buying out of ground rents under their much-vaunted legislation.  We still do not even know whether Fianna Fáil, the party of reality, the Republican Party, have even set a priority of buying out the ground rent on the GPO.  People will be regarding that kind of rhetoric and those kinds of promises coming from that party with a much more jaundiced eye when the next election comes around.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of security and in particular of the Border area security problem.  It is obvious that Border security is a problem which concerns all of us in two ways.  First of all, it concerns us because it is in everybody's interest to reduce the level of violence by para-military organisations, of whatever hue, in this country.  Secondly, because the cost of the Border operations in general and of security operations attributable to the Northern problem has escalated so hugely in recent years.  We had the Minister for Finance's word for it during the debate on Northern Ireland in recent times that the security cost directly attributable to the Northern Ireland problem has risen by a factor of 40 over the last ten years, from £2 million in 1969-70 to £82 million in the current year.  When we think of how many primary schools, how many universities even, could be built with those £82 million, we must seriously worry about that.</P>
    <P>There is one specific question I should like to ask the Minister, that is, in relation to overflights.  Has the incidence of overflights by British security forces from the Northern side of the Border into the territory of the Republic increased or decreased since 1 January this year?  I believe that if this information could be made available to the <Col N="656" /> House by the Minister it would put a lot of the rhetoric over the last six months into a very different perspective.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the question of the Garda in general and to ask the Minister to re-consider his total and out-of-hand refusal of the request of the Garda for some kind of structures which would remove from them the accusation of any form of interference from outside, which would create a representative body structure, or a Garda Authority structure which would ensure that the exercise and administration of justice&mdash;would be not only above suspicion but seen to be above suspicion at all times.</P>
    <P>In this connection there are a couple of instances I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  I anticipate that he would not be able to deal with them in his reply.  They involve a certain amount of detail.  They also involve detail I cannot use in this House but which I will be happy to give the Minister if he asks me for it.  It relates to the fact that in the County Cork area there is at present considerable apprehension among members of the Garda about the apparent non-enforcement of the law.  In relation to one licensed premises&mdash;I shall call it licensed premises A and I will not identify the town in which it is located&mdash;the Garda carried out an inspection there at 1 a.m. on 4 November 1979 and found about 100 persons on the premises.  The superintendent directed a prosecution, summonses were made out and served but, a few days and before the court hearing, the superintendent directed the sergeant involved to withdraw the summonses. We want to know why that happened. At the same licensed premises, at 11.53 p.m. on 9 February 1980, again after-hours trading was going on, with about 65 persons on the premises.  Again the superintendent directed the prosecution, summonses were made out and sent to the sergeant's office.  Those summonses were later taken possession off by the superintendent and, to the best of my knowledge, have not since been served or seen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> In relation to another licensed premises&mdash;which I shall call licensed premises B&mdash;a similar set of circumstances was involved. In relation to a third licensed premises in the same town an inspection was carried out on 3 February 1980 at 10.45 p.m. when about 200 persons were on the premises. Again the superintendent directed prosecutions, summonses were made out and sent to the sergeant, but later summonses were taken possession of by the superintendent and were not served or seen since.  There was another incident in relation to the same licensed premises but I will not take up the time of the House by reading out the facts because they are exactly the same.  This is the kind of thing that has the morale of the Garda in bits in this area and, for all we know, in other areas as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the powers available to the Minister under the 1933 Public Hospitals Act.  Under that Act the Minister for Justice has the function of sanctioning any scheme for a sweepstake either without modification or with such modification as he may think fit to make therein.  When next given the scheme for the promotion of the sweepstake by the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes, I appeal to him to satisfy himself on a number of very important questions before he sanctions such a scheme.  I ask him to satisfy himself about the method of transportation of sweeps tickets.  Are tickets smuggled into the United States and Canada smuggled out of Ireland in a way which breaks the law?  Is he satisfied that adequate and full customs declarations are made in respect of any sweeps tickets which leave this country? I ask him to satisfy himself that profits from the sweeps operation are not being creamed off by middlemen outside this country, who get free tickets or who break our law indirectly and in other ways by selling tickets at premium prices.</P>
    <P>I would like him to satisfy himself that, as guaranteed on the sweeps ticket, all receipts which buyers get are issued in Dublin and not in other countries.  I <Col N="658" /> ask him to satisfy himself about the role of transit agents.  These people receive mail from North America, send it to the sweeps office and get money back with receipts from the sweep and send the receipts to the sellers in North America and Canada.  I would like him to satisfy himself that all such transactions and payments are fully notified to the Revenue authorities.</P>
    <P>I would also like him to satisfy himself that he has adequate powers under section 6 of the Act to work out the money paid to promoters for the sweep, because under section 2 of the 1933 Act there are very substantial sums which I believe do not come adequately to his notice.  When doing this the Minister might reflect that regardless of the money paid to the hospitals, which has been very useful over the years although it now forms a decreasing percentage of the total amount of money spent on our hospitals, this sweeps operation basically was started by three men with a capital of £4,000 on the basis of which they and their families have made an ascertainable profit of at least £9 million and, at the same time, are threatening massive redundancies on women workers who have very little alternative sources of employment. I ask the Minister to bear all these matters in mind.</P>

The percentage of women imprisoned within the last six or nine months for those two crimes was about 9 per cent, no more.  Women have been imprisoned in recent times for their parts in armed robberies, muggings and fraud.  One fraud involved a sum in the region of £70,000.</P>

I thought I had convinced them that in the interests of society they should do everything they possibly could to get a women's prison under way.

      <P>I must ask somebody on this side of the House to put down a question on that matter.  Deputies opposite need a little touch of truth and reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Harte has gone because there is nobody whom I like better to hear.  He suggested that when I was in Opposition my comments about crime were more hopeful than they are now.  Of course I played an important role in this House when we were in Opposition. Crime rates were soaring then even higher than the rate for the first four months of this year.  Not once did Deputy Harte voice his support within <Col N="663" /> the House for his Minister who was handcuffed in his efforts to get money from the Coalition.  Deputy Harte did nothing to help my predecessor, Senator Cooney, who was in dire straits looking for aid to do a job he was not able to do. The Deputy says that the situation now is urgent.  As I said in my opening remarks, I am informed by the Garda that present indications show that the crime rate for the first four months of this year has increased by about 21 per cent over last year.  This is not the first time we have had an increase of this nature; an increase of that size took place in 1975 when the Deputy's party were in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am truly concerned at the recent upswing in the crime rate about which I have been informed by the Garda authorities.  There has been an increase <Col N="664" /> so far this year of 21 per cent, but last year the overall increase was 3 per cent and there was a decrease the year before.  Deputy Harte was bleating about more manpower on the streets and I would point out that during my time in office the Government have already provided an additional 1,560 members of the Garda.  In the 18 months before the Coalition lost office the total increase in Garda strength was less than 200 at a time when there was a very steep increase in crime rates.</P>

      <P>I believe I have the right to defend myself when I am asked to resign and told that if I were the chairman of a company I would be asked to resign.  Am I not to be given that right? The increase in the crime rate is a matter of great concern and about five or six weeks ago on my initiative I called in the Garda Commissioner and discussed the crime situation as I believed it to be following representations by Deputies and particularly after meetings with members of my own party.  Following that meeting I discussed the situation at meetings with the Garda Representative Association.  Since then I have had a number of meetings, without any urgings from anybody on the other side of the House, with the Garda Commissioner, his deputy commissioners and his full team of assistants.  I have put to them the fears expressed to me by community leaders and asked them to draw up a blueprint which they considered would <Col N="665" /> be effective in combating crime.  This blueprint is almost ready and I will present it to the Government when it is available.  I know my Government will support me and I will not suffer the experience of my predecessor, who was denied help from his Government when he sought support from the Exchequer to implement certain improvements in police work.  Deputy Keating was not then a Member of this House but I will remind him of matters which he would wish to forget.</P>

      <P>In 1975 the increase for the country as a whole was 20.7 per cent.  The Deputy will see a completely different figure if he compares the increase at the end of this year for the county as a whole with the situation in 1975.  The percentages about which we are talking now are in selected Garda districts and are not related to the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I deliberately accuse Deputies Harte and Keating of trying to cause a panic and undermine the morale of the Garda Síochána.  They want to say that the Garda cannot compete against the present crime wave.  I believe they can and I have every confidence in them.  Because of that confidence and the help of the Government the crime wave will be overcome.  At the end of this year I will have the greatest satisfaction in answering any parliamentary question the Deputy may care to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity Deputy Harte is not here because there are some things he needs to understand.  I have no role whatsoever in deciding that gardaí should live in the areas where they work.  I have nothing to do with it.  I have not changed any rules which the Deputy seems to believe were in existence that would insist that members would have to live in the towns and villages in which they worked.  There is <Col N="666" /> no change of policy.  If the Deputy thinks otherwise I can only tell him he does not know the facts.  Deputy Harte stood up in this House, representing Fine Gael, and said there should be no gardaí in the prisons.  He made a bald statement without giving any reasons.  I should like to tell the Deputy there is a need for gardaí in the Portlaoise Prison as there is in Limerick Prison.  Deputy Harte seems to think it the proper course that the gardaí should not be in the prisons, but people who give me professional advice regarding security in the prisons have told me that there is need for a Garda presence there and as long as that advice is given they will remain there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte also said that gardaí should not be involved in the escorting of money.  That is true of his party because when they were in government there was the great train robbery at Sallins, County Kildare.  The Fine Gael Minister for Finance and Minister for Justice decided in the interests of economy to take the armed guard from that train bringing money from Cork to Dublin. Perhaps Deputy Harte still believes that policy should be followed, that there should not be an armed guard escorting money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Of necessity this will be a short debate.  Personally I regret the manner in which it is being dealt with.  I should much prefer the Minister to make an opening statement of policy and explanation of the various items in this Vote.  However, as there was an agreement between the Whips I accept the procedure we are adopting.  There are some questions I wish to put to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Estimate before the House is a little different from that contained in the Book of Estimates.  The Estimate for 1980 is £88.5 million.  In 1979 it was £84.5 million&mdash;there is a small increase of £4 million for this year.  When one considers the total amount in the Book of Estimates it is a very small amount to deal with such important matters as transport and the tourist industry.  Of that £4 million&mdash;a 5 per cent increase and in my view a very inadequate one&mdash;some £2 million is in respect of salaries and wages and there is another £2 million for holiday accommodation. Perhaps the Minister in his reply will tell the House what that means; personally I do not know what is involved here.</P>
      <P>I presume it is as true today as it has been for a long time that the tourist industry is second only to agriculture in importance and value to the economy. One wonders why the Government could not afford to spend a little more for that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the Minister has not much time in which to reply but I should like <Col N="670" /> him to expand on the transport policy enunciated in the Fianna Fáil manifesto. The Minister has made a commitment towards the establishment of a transport authority for Dublin and I should like to know what action, if any, has been taken to establish that authority and, if it has been established, I should like to know what progress has been made.  I should like to remind the Minister that the rest of the country also have problems with regard to transport.  He is a provincial man and I know he is aware of the situation. I trust that, following the establishment of a transport authority for Dublin, he will consider an overall authority.  I realise Dublin has special problems but there should be a commitment to have an authority for the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>So far as the amount provided for tourism is concerned, everyone will agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That will curtail my speech but I do not blame anybody but myself for that.  As far as the Transport Vote is concerned I note that the CIE grant of £56 million is similar to the amount provided last year out of a total vote of £88.5 million.  It is not sufficient when we consider that wage, oil and other costs are rising rapidly.  There will be no improvement in the transport system if we relate that allocation to the amount of money provided this year. Will the Minister let us know if there will be a further increase in fares to bring in the extra money required by CIE?  If so we should know now.  The Minister may <Col N="671" /> contemplate a cutback in services which have already been curtailed over the last number of decades.  Any further cutback in public transport services would be a bad blow to the economy.  In view of the money needed by CIE, perhaps the Minister will consider the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister should give us his reply to these questions now because we will adjourn in another few weeks and we will not have an opportunity to question the Minister until September or October.</P>
      <P>All CIE's rolling stock needs to be replaced.  I am informed that the commuter trains in Dublin frequently break down.  That is detrimental to the people here and to the tourism industry.  Our long distance trains are often overcrowded and shoddy.  Many people would resist an increase of funds to CIE and would suggest that the transport system be given over to private enterprise. My party do not believe that that is the solution as private enterprise would take the profitable end or potentially profitable end of the transport system and would leave the residue in the hands of the Minister to be paid for by the taxpayer.  I am informed that the same problem in relation to cutbacks of service has occurred in Cork.  In relation to the replacement of all the rolling stock, the Minister for Transport should consult with the Minister for Energy in an effort to get rid of the old buses and trains which are eating up energy in the form of oil or other energy powers.  The Minister for Transport could in that way contribute towards the conservation of energy.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to replace and modernise the rolling stock?  There is no evidence of an efficient public transport policy but perhaps the Minister is waiting for the report of the transport authority who were to be established for the city of Dublin.  There is no evidence of any action or of any concern for the rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and his two Ministers of State, Deputy Flynn and Deputy Killilea.  I am disappointed with the capital allocation to CIE for rolling stock.  There will be a drastic cutback in services in the near future because of this.  Already the radio trains which used bring large numbers of day-trippers to the west have been cut back, the service from Cork to Cobh has gone by the board and the service to Mullingar and some services to the west are also in danger.  This is very serious for the western seaboard and I appeal to the Minister to do something about it.  If these services are curtailed the people in the west will feel it more than anyone. There is no doubt that some of the carriages on the trains are a disgrace. One would not put a bad greyhound to sleep in some of the carriages that are used to bring the Kerry people from Killarney to Tralee.  The Minister should do something about that rolling stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the carriage of goods by road hauliers it is a well known fact that the restrictions on these hauliers were lifted in Great Britain and Northern Ireland many years ago.  I cannot understand why the same thing has not happened here.  No road haulage licence was issued since 1932.  The people who held existing licences were allowed to increase their fleets to six lorries instead of one.  There is a monopoly by certain firms of that aspect of trading and it is about time the Minister allowed other people to apply for licences as well.  I am also worried about the tachograph proposals which are unduly harsh as far as Irish road hauliers are concerned.  The vast majority of EEC road hauliers can do 40 miles per hour on average but here they can only do 25 miles per hour due to the condition of the roads on which not enough money has been spent.  I appeal to the Minister to have these proposals amended, as the Minister <Col N="673" /> knows these hauliers will not be able to compete if the proposal is enforced as it stands.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us if the bus lane in Dublin has been a success?  Does the Minister intend to extend this?  If it has been successful the Minister should have no hesitation in extending it.  As the Minister knows, the buses are down to seven miles per hour and sometimes three miles per hour in the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned the consultative committee report and pointed out that it was a very good committee as far as Dublin is concerned.  However, there is more to the country than Dublin and perhaps the Minister might set up a transport authority to give us a comprehensive report about every county.</P>
    <P>We should have a national policy on transport.  We have not had such a policy since the foundation of the State and it is about time that we had such a policy.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new office and would ask him to look at the restrictions on the road hauliers where the problem is that when they deliver a load they cannot get back to the city again on the same day.  The Minister might take a look at that in view of the fact that we are in a fuel crisis situation and that energy is supposed to be conserved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the rail service is concerned the one I have most experience of is Cork to Dublin and that is a good service. I am very pleased with it but that opinion may not be shared by everyone. However, I am appalled at the bus service we have between provincial towns. My experience here is in relation to Cork city.  Deputy Corish mentioned, in relation to the conservation of energy, that <Col N="674" /> anyone who would see CIE buses on the road would be ashamed to take a seat on them.  It is a regular feature of the service being provided in the southern capital to have breakdowns every day.  The buses are positively filthy.  They are not even washed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the school transport system.  I should like the Minister to take note of that.  The only way this can be dealt with is by a massive injection of capital into CIE to replace these buses, which are only fit for the scrapyard.  I have been informed by people who use the service regularly that it frequently happens that a passenger will have to keep a door closed or a gear in place.  When one has a semi-State body providing that kind of service it is time to bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to indicate what he proposes to do to improve the service.  It is of concern to many people. Deputies Corish and Begley mentioned the fact that tourists use this service, as do workers, students and so on.  I live 25 miles from Cork harbour, where there is a large concentration of industry.  People who live 30 miles out are using cars to take them to and from work.  If they had a dependable service provided by CIE it would be more economical for them to use it and it would conserve energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies as regards transporting children to school.  Can the Minister give some indication as to what steps he proposes to take to improve that service?  I have made inquiries before about it and I do not want to be fobbed off by saying it is a matter for CIE.  It is a matter for the Minister for Transport, who is responsible.  It means the Minister must provide the wherewithal to provide a satisfactory service.  It will probably be expensive initially, but in the long term it will serve the useful purpose of conserving energy.  More people will avail of it if it is reliable.  If one travels the road from Cork to Macroom one will find buses <Col N="675" /> broken down on the side of the road and passengers who paid the fare thumbing a lift.  That is just not on and I would be grateful to the Minister if he gives me some indication of what he proposes to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome the opportunity of having longer than 15 minutes to go into all the various aspects covered by my Department.  I will deal with the points raised and give some indication of where we are going and the various semi-State boards under my control.</P>
      <P>As regards the question raised by Deputies Begley and Corish on the national transport policy and this Government's answer to it, we have taken very definite steps in that direction. The Transport Consultative Commission reported to me on the first task set to them: to look into the very serious problems in the Dublin area in relation to urban transportation and the traffic chaos.  There was a very quick response from the Government and we announced a decision to set up a Dublin Transportation Authority.  In the interim I decided to set up a task force, which I have done, and the various Government Departments involved in this area are represented. They have held four meetings and their operational group have held two meetings.  I am pressing ahead with arrangements for the introduction of four more bus priority measures.  The first one has been a success and I look forward to keeping the timetable that I set the task force of the introduction of four more within one year of their being set up.</P>
      <P>On the broader aspect of transport policy we hear the catch cry about a national transport policy.  What does this mean?  If I spent my time working out a big blueprint my time would be gone in my term of office and I would not have seemed to have done anything.  I prefer to deal with the immediate problems and take action on them.  That is a better way forward than trying to work out a blueprint.  What we are doing is part and parcel of an overall transport policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> In relation to the concern of Deputy Corish for rural areas, the Transport Consultative Commission are carrying out an in-depth study into road freight haulage.  They will be reporting to me in double quick time.  They carried out the other one very quickly and I have no reason to believe this one will not be as quick.  I will be acting on that.  There has been a significant amount of liberalisation in the road freight transport area.  In 1971 all the area restrictions were removed and livestock was exempted.  In 1978&mdash;this was referred to by Deputy Begley&mdash;if a man had a haulage plate he could have it six fold.  When I receive the report from the commission I will be investigating that area.  The policy of the Department in that area is well as known. We are going for a quality transport system more than a quantity one.  We want to see the best cost-effective transport policy introduced here for the benefit of consumers, industry and everybody else.</P>
    <P>I was asked to outline what we were doing in regard to buses for CIE.  That has a bearing on the transport authority we decided to establish.  We are pressing ahead with the legislation which we expect will be introduced soon.  Side by side with this must come a new bus fleet for CIE.  I should like to tell the House that CIE have concluded arrangements for a bus-building operation at Shannon to supply their future bus requirements.  I understand that production arrangements are well in hand.  It is expected that 50 new buses will be ready by the end of this year.  The plan is to give CIE 200 double-decker buses for urban operations in 1981.  The new factory will employ 200 people, a definite step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problems mentioned by Deputy Creed about Cork.  I should like to reiterate what he said about the CIE rail service from Cork.  It is an excellent service and I found it so when I travelled on it on Friday morning.  With regard to the future investment policies of CIE I should like to tell the House that as soon as I am presented with the McKinsey report I will take it before the <Col N="677" /> Government.  We will then define the investment policy for the future.  The capital allocation to CIE this year was £25.125 million, including £1.125 million for the Rosslare project.  The electrification of the Howth-Bray line will make a significant contribution towards the Dublin situation.  It is going ahead.  Deputy Kelly questioned me before as to the stage of development and I informed him that the preliminary work on the signaling aspect was in progress.  The alteration to the line is proceeding and tenders have been received for part of the electric equipment. The design work is going ahead and already 100 people are employed on the project.  That figure will be increased to 280.  It is expected that this work will be completed by 1983.</P>

      <P>£53 million.  Originally it was estimated that it would cost in the region of £46 million.  Other points were raised about the possibility of further increases in CIE fares but there is no such proposal before me.  The subvention to CIE is set at £56 million.  The out-turn for the year will largely depend on the new pay agreements entered into this year.</P>

      <P>The tachograph is under the Department of Labour and that Department have already applied for a late introduction of the system.  We hope they are successful.  I should like to avail of this opportunity of commenting briefly on some of the semi-State bodies under my control.  The very successful B &amp; I company introduced their new Jet-foil service this year.  Forecasts are being fulfilled and their passenger-carrying numbers are ahead of target.  The new service from Rosslare to Pembroke introduced a few weeks ago represents a further commitment to the tourist industry. The roll-on roll-off service is being fully developed by the company and, <Col N="678" /> although it had a loss of £1.1 million, that cannot be attributed to operations within the company.  That loss was largely due to strikes at Liverpool docks and the strike of road hauliers in England.  When allowance is made for those strikes the company had a good year.  It is expected that the company will return to profit in 1980.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping Limited had a successful year and it is expected that their results will be published soon.  I am sure the House is pleased to hear that.  That company is making a valuable contribution, through their subsidiary, Irish Continental Lines, with the Rosslare-Cherbourg and the Rosslare-Le Harve services.  We are fully committed to a harbour development programme and we believe it is of paramount importance to an island economy such as ours.  A total of £4.5 million is provided in the Estimate for such work, compared with £3.6 million last year.  Most of this money will go towards the harbour development works in Cork which was initially given an allocation of £3 million. The figure was increased recently by £2.7 million.  That is further evidence of the Government's commitment to that fine development in Cork harbour. When I visited that area last week I was very impressed by the work being carried on.  That should make a major contribution to the development of the economy of the Cork area.</P>
      <P>I was glad to learn of the ambitious five-year development programme of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Harbour development is taking place at New Ross, Drogheda, Wicklow and Foynes which is about to come on stream.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Aer Lingus, I should like to state that I will not engage in a system of reducing fares where it will undermine the economic viability of our national airline, our national flag carrier.  I dealt with questions from the Opposition recently and I got the impression that they were not <Col N="679" /> concerned with the economic viability of our national airline.  They were constantly harassing for a reduction in fares.  I do not subscribe to that policy.  We are all aware of the real economic problems that were created on the North Atlantic route this year and we are aware of the huge increases in Aer Lingus costs attributed to the significant increase in oil prices.  I should like to tell the House that £17 million was the Aer Lingus fuel bill in 1978-79 and in 1979-80 it is expected to be more than £30 million.  It is expected that it will reach £42 million in 1980-81, an increase of about 250 per cent. How any Member could advocate a reduction in air fares which would put the company into a disastrous economic situation I do not know.  Over the next ten years the company must engaged in a fleet replacement operation.  The company had a good year and its ancillary services contributed largely to this.  We subscribe to expansion in that area because we know that Aer Lingus operating on its own would not be a viable economic proposition.  For that reason their ancillary services must be kept going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta produced excellent results for the year with a return of £5.05 million.  The House should consider that no provision was made for capital or interest because Aer Rianta gets its money directly from the Vote.  The total traffic through airports in 1979 increased by 7.5 per cent over the 1978 figure.  We are all aware of the difficult problems that exist at our three airports at present in relation to the work stoppage involving craft workers.  I should like to take this opportunity of again appealing to those craft workers to consider, in the national interest, the damage that can be inflicted on a tourist industry, which will find it very difficult this year.  They should consider the damage that can be inflicted on our international contracts and the damage that can be done to our international image, the great image that Aer Lingus has built up abroad in carrying passengers and servicing aircraft.  Those workers should consider a good solid response to the leadership of the trade <Col N="680" /> union movement and return to work. They should realise that the negotiation table is the place to solve problems.  As a small nation in this difficult economic year we cannot suffer any more as a result of such stoppages.  I earnestly appeal to them to consider, in the national interest, a return to work and get to the negotiating table.  That is where the national interest will be served best and that is where they will ensure their own jobs for the future.  If those international contracts are endangered the jobs of those workers will be at risk.</P>
    <P>I was asked for an extension of the recommendations in the report of the Transport Consultative Commission.  In that report you will see that when the recommendations that are made in relation to the Dublin situation are carried out similar solutions could also be applied in our other major urban areas, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and so on. The traffic chaos in Dublin is of prime importance at the moment.  We are pressing ahead with the setting up of a transportation authority.  The task force is already discussing the make-up and format of that transportation authority and they are preparing legislation to set it up.  In the interim the task force are continuing their job and monitoring progress with monthly reports.  I am very pleased with the progress they have made and we look forward to seeing the introduction of more bus priorities in the next 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to record our appreciation of the Army both at home and abroad.  It is significant that we use the term &ldquo;Defence Forces&rdquo; to describe the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps.  It expresses what we expect of their contribution to society in their primary role not only at home but also now abroad in the peace-keeping organisation of the United Nations. For their endeavours they deserve our best thanks.  They deserve also the best in wages, accommodation, conditions of service and equipment.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing when one looks at the Estimate to find that it is totally inadequate if one takes inflation into consideration. No Member of the Dáil or indeed any citizen would deny our Defence Forces operating on Border duty a decent and adequate wage and compensation.  Currently, it is in the region of £1.50 a day for the enlisted member and £1.75 for the officer.  To expect members of the Defence Forces, which I classify as displaced people, to move from their home areas and operate in Border areas doing excellent and outstanding duty to ensure that our people can live in safety with that type of compensation is an absolute insult.  If one were to relate this to industry one could well imagine how many people would volunteer to move from their wives and families and be thus displaced for £1.50 a day or £1.75.  The Minister will have to reconsider this matter.  He would have the full support of the House and of every citizen if he accepted my suggestion to compensate these people adequately for the duties they perform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see many decreases where one would expect increases in these Estimates.  How does the Minister expect to attract the best young boys and girls into a profession which could be and should be one of the best in the country on the present basis?  For some mysterious reason young boys, and girls I suppose, now that we shall have a women's army, go to the local station to join the Defence Forces.  Most of these have a certain amount of pride.  They appreciate what their mothers and fathers tried to do for <Col N="682" /> them and they want to have the same independence as any industrial worker or other worker.  They like to be able to bring home every Thursday or Friday their contribution to the family.  They cannot do that.  They join the Army and they have to go 40 or 50 or in some cases 100 miles away from home.  Living away from home on the kind of salary they are paid they can afford very little to show their appreciation of what their parents have done for them.  That right is denied to them because of the foolish and ridiculous system that applies in many cases to Army recruits.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine this matter so that where possible any boy or girl anxious to make a career in the Army can be accommodated at home.  It is understandable that when certain duties have to be performed these recruits will have to go away from home on a temporary basis.  That is what we have in mind when we talk of the subsistence allowance.  Generally, recruits must be encouraged to join and the best way to do that is to give them a right to remain as near as possible to home.</P>
    <P>Some of the Army buildings can be described as nothing short of derelict. They are dull and old and there are very few new buildings.  There is little provision in this Estimate for the construction of new buildings.  It should be the Minister's policy to provide a modern, up-to-date standard type of military barracks which will attract young boys and girls to adopt what should be a very lucrative and worthy career.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  If this situation were to apply to industry it would be completely unacceptable and everything would grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>Fortunately for us, because of the dedication and loyalty of the Defence Forces to the nation the enlisted members and their officers are ready at a minutes' notice to defend the nation if necessary.  We have only to think of other nations whose governments cannot even sleep at night wondering if they have that type of loyalty and dedication from their defence forces.  There is never any fear of a military coup here and the <Col N="683" /> Minister for Defence and the Government are assured of loyalty and dedication from our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>There is very little appreciation shown for this loyalty by way of remuneration. Our Defence Forces are often regarded as the poor relations of the public service. They do not get any overtime pay because when our Army was founded in 1922 that was the system that was adopted. Why should our Army personnel have to engage in very responsible and dangerous duties in comparison with other members of the public service?  In all grades of the public service overtime is paid but no overtime is paid to members of our Defence Forces.  There is only a very small subsistence allowance paid to them.</P>
    <P>There is no provision made in the Estimate to bring the rolling stock up to modern standards.  The Army have only obsolete, broken-down trucks and vehicles. If this was in private industry they would be prosecuted for having such obsolete vehicles, but apparently they are good enough for our Defence Forces. This position is not good enough for me or for the Labour Party.  There is no provision made for the purchase of new vehicles.</P>
    <P>It should be the policy of the Minister to change with the times.  The trend in clothes in general changes every six months but our Army personnel have the same type of clothing year after year. There is no provision in the Estimate for providing new clothing for them.  I am glad that some small provision has been made for enlisted men to graduate to the highest posts in the Army.  This is long overdue.  More provision should be made for our young men and women, who intend to make a career of the Army, to aspire to the highest posts.</P>
    <P>Living quarters are provided in many barracks.  I imagine if a health inspector went to inspect them he would condemn them as unfit for human habitation.  The Minister should get away from the idea of having houses inside military barracks.  If such houses must be <Col N="684" /> provided they should be modern, new type houses.  I am sure the Minister will try to do some of the things which I have suggested so that we can show our deep appreciation to the members of the Defence Forces for their wonderful loyalty and dedication.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to consider seriously changing the old policy in relation to remuneration of our Defence Forces.  Something must be done in a positive way rather than merely paying lip service in the House, going down to open new barracks and to passing out parades.  All the people in the Defence Forces must be adequately paid.  If we want to attract people into the Defence Forces we must also ensure that the whole system is changed from the policy which has been in operation since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Lipper I would like, on behalf of my party, for which I have the honour of being spokesman for the Department of Defence, to pay tribute to our Defence Forces at home and abroad for their dedication and loyalty.  I would like also to take this opportunity of placing on record my appreciation of the courtesy and co-operation I have always received as spokesman for this Department from members of the Defence Forces and officials of the Department. During the time of the very dangerous situation in the Lebanon when I sought information it was very freely given to me.  I want to place on record my very deep appreciation of that co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points I want to make to the Minister.  I take it that the Estimate is geared at providing the full establishment strength of our Defence Forces.  As we have not realised the establishment target which, as far as the Defence Forces are concerned, is 17,409 men, there is a saving.  This was the establishment figure on 31 March last.  As a result of a parliamentary question and information which I received I was told on that occasion that we had 12,623. The figure set by the Minister for the Army is 15,157 during the same period <Col N="685" /> and we have 11,219 officers and men. The indications are, even though there is an increase in the estimate, that there is a saving in relation to that aspect of it.  On 30 September 1977 we had 13,412 men in the Army, which is a drop of 2,200 now.  During that time we recruited 4,272 men so the net loss in trained men is 6,500.  That indicates a trend I am very concerned about.  What does the Minister propose to do about this?</P>
    <P>I had discussions recently with some of the personnel involved.  I tried to ascertain from them and from people who had the experience of what the problems were and why this trend is so obvious.  I gather from a remark made to me that there is a change in their duties which have been arduous and long.  As somebody put it to me, they were busmen, binmen and bank men and this is a complete change from the purpose for which they joined the Army.  Also they have very long hours of duty.  This is an area which the Minister could examine and probably improve.</P>
    <P>We have a reserve force, the FCA, of approximately 20,000, as was stated in reply to a recent question.  This figure would be inflated because a number of them are not active.  However, we have a force here whose activities we could extend. We have assigned to the FCA 1,000 officers.  I hope they will do a good job and that the Minister will consider the possibility of extending their role and examining the overall situation to find out how they can be employed better.</P>
    <P>Under subhead H there is an increase for this year.  This is something in which I have some concern.  It is in relation to defensive equipment, motor transport vehicles, aircraft, helicopters and ships, all imported.  During the past few months I was trying to get information by way of parliamentary question to the Minister to ascertain the situation in relation to the Timoney armoured car and the prospect of having this sort of equipment manufactured at home and so help the serious balance of payments situation. This would be a major contribution.  I am afraid that the information I got from the Minister did not get to the root of the <Col N="686" /> situation, but beidh lá eile.  Last year the Minister's predecessor stated in the estimates that he had provision for a down payment on a twin-engined helicopter. This would mean that the delivery of this was imminent.  I was informed in answer to a parliamentary question that consideration was being given to the leasing of such an aircraft.  It takes so long to get this and that is why I am questioning about it.  Considering that between leasing, loaning and buying an executive jet such an aircraft can be provided by the Government with all haste, I want to know exactly why it takes so long to provide these other aircraft.</P>
    <P>I am glad that an attempt is being made to modernise the Air Corps.  Here, as in other areas in the Defence Forces, we have casualties.  I take this opportunity to sympathise with the relatives of the pilots who were killed in Gormanston in the course of their duty.  The Air Corps are also suffering a loss of manpower, with 650 instead of 1,155, which is the full establishment strength. Here again the trend shows clearly.  We are very inadequate as far as long-range rescue aircraft are concerned and over the last year the RAF had to be called on to provide such a service on no less than nine occasions.  In the course of that year we had 61 air and sea rescue missions. I put to the Minister that the Army and the Air Corps in that regard provide a very valuable and useful service to the public at large.  In their work in, for example, providing services for the health boards, transferring patients from places far removed from central hospitals and so on, they have provided that sort of service.  The charge is quite expensive.  I think, subject to correction, that it would be somewhere in the region of £160 per hour.  Our Defence Forces provide a security service for the banks without charge or fee.  That is wrong. Some institutions in this State make huge profits&mdash;it was quoted recently that one of them made approximately £40 million in one year&mdash;and the State is asked to provide a service for them.  I compliment the Army and the Air Corps for the service they are providing to the State in the cases that I have mentioned.  They are <Col N="687" /> being paid for it and other organisations in the State have to pay for the security, and the banks do not.  I would like the Minister to comment on that because it is difficult to get all the information through parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>When I expressed concern at the dwindling numbers in the Naval Service the Minister said that the numbers were the highest ever.  I was glad that, at the launching of a vessel at Haulbowline recently, the Minister at least accepted and realised that there was a problem here, that the numbers are difficult to keep and that it is difficult even to reach the establishment figure.  This problem must be attended to immediately.  The strength of the Naval Service is well below the establishment figure and the duties have increased since we became members of the EEC.  From 11 January 1977 their activities will have taken them over 130,000 square miles, which is about four times the size of this island. The Minister certainly could examine the conditions in this area, their duties, pay and so on.  Since the establishment was increased by the Minister since he came into office, what have we achieved?  Is there any increase in real terms?  As far as the Naval Service is concerned we have not any advanced planning or programme.  Due to the technical nature of the Naval Service you cannot walk out on the street and just pluck the people with the technical qualifications and land them into a job.  It takes long-term planning rather than instant recruiting of naval personnel.  Last year, 1979, the service was 36 officers short.  In June of this year what is the improvement in that position?  I understand that six officers have been recruited and four have left or retired from the service.  Equally serious is the position regarding men.  We are 150 short and the Minister recruited 161 this year but in the same period 102 left the service.  In addition the Minister has increased the establishment by 240.  The gap is getting progressively worse.  In 1977 the difference in real terms between the number of personnel we had and the establishment figure was 98.5 per cent. In 1978 it was 81 per cent and in 1979 it <Col N="688" /> was 78 per cent.  The point which I am making to the Minister is that that trend goes right through the forces.</P>
    <P>The Minister's commitment is shown quite clearly in the number of apprentices he has.  The establishment says there should be 72 qualified engine room people.  Actually he has 23.  As an emergency measure, 26 are being pushed through in the AnCO training centres.  I am subject to correction, but I believe the salary paid to one of those qualified engineroom artificers represents an increase of £7 per week.  That seems a very small difference in remuneration for somebody who is qualified as against somebody who is not qualified.  It takes a considerable length of time to attain the necessary qualifications.</P>
    <P>The debate is confined through no fault of anybody.  There is an agreement between the Whips.  I do not want to go into that in detail.  I want to comment on our armed forces and I want to deal specifically with the Army.  It was a retrograde step for any Minister to discontinue the ceremonial parades we had and the displays by our Army personnel. If we had something like an Easter parade, we could show our armed forces on the streets and the people would see and realise that this is a noble career. Parents could take their children to see these parades and people would get to know more about the Army and Army life.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said this is not possible for security reasons.  That could be overcome by the suggestion I made earlier about the FCA and the reserve forces.  I am very concerned about this aspect of recruitment.  It would do more good than all the advertisements in the papers and on television.  Those advertisements are a bit misleading.  They do now show exactly what people joined the Army for.  They do not show the duties which are assigned to them which they did not join to do.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Women's Corps and to wish them success.  Progress is slow and that is a difficulty.  I should like to have time to <Col N="689" /> pay the tribute to the people in Civil Defence which they deserve.  I see a very serious and dangerous trend so far as our Army and our Defence Forces are concerned.  People who are being recruited are not staying in the force. The Minister said the attractions of civilian life are too great and people are being attracted out of the Army.  If that is the case, the Minister has a duty to make the Army equally as attractive, and to provide careers which will attract young people to join the armed forces. Could I ask the Minister to excuse me?  I have to go.  I do not intend any reflection on anyone.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Lipper and Deputy Creed for the very well-deserved tributes they paid to the Irish Defence Forces.  Before dealing with the individual questions raised, I should like to refer to a number of general matters. Any questions which I am unable to deal with in the time available will be considered fully in due course.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the Defence Forces for the financial year 1980 is a net sum of £144,283,000 of which a sum of £105,284,000 or almost 73 per cent, is provided for pay and allowances. Deputy Lipper suggested that the amount of money being made available was not sufficient.  The fact of the matter is that this Estimate is, in effect, £26,154,000 more than the provision for last year.  Of this sum, increased pay and allowances account for £23,588,000 and the balance of £2,566,000 is the net increase in the remaining subhead.  The estimate provides for an average strength of 1,500 officers, 95 cadets and 12,400 other ranks, a total of 13,995 in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Creed complained that the money being made available was not sufficient in respect of the establishment.  I do not think there has ever been a time when the establishment and the actual strength were equal, and the estimate is based on the expected strength and not on the establishment.  This has been the practice for a considerable number of <Col N="690" /> years.  For a number of years past very great demands have been made on the officers and men of the Defence Forces. I know I am reflecting the feeling of the House in again expressing the appreciation of the Government for the magnificent way all components and elements of the forces, both the permanent and reserve, have responded to the demands made on them.  As well as their security duties, the Defence Forces have assisted the community in a variety of ways.  For instance, over 60 search and rescue missions were made by Air Corps aircraft during 1979, and a total of 105 ambulance missions were flown conveying seriously injured patients to specialist hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be all too well aware of the tragic events of recent months in which some members of the Defence Forces serving with the United Nations interim force in Lebanon lost their lives and others were injured.  Diplomatic initiatives following the recent meeting in Dublin of representatives of the troop contributing countries are continuing with a view to bringing about conditions in the mission area in which the force can operate safely and effectively.  The Secretary General of the United Nations and the force commander are using their best endeavours to achieve this objective. I should like, once again, to pay tribute to the excellent work in very difficult circumstances which is being carried out by the personnel of the Irish contingent serving with UNIFIL in the cause of peace.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to pay and conditions in the service.  The pay and conditions generally of the members of the force are maintained at a high standard. The weekly pay of a recruit is now £74.13 a week.  A fully trained soldier is paid over £83 per week, rising to almost £90 after three years' service.  Following a special review of the pay of senior officers, the Government decided recently to grant substantial increases in the rates and scales payable.  The increases are effective from 26 June 1979 and they apply to the ranks of commandant and upwards.  All allowances, including those <Col N="691" /> payable for duties of a security nature, are kept under regular review, as are conditions of service generally.</P>
    <P>I have already referred on a number of occasions to the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, including special measures to enable the Naval Service and the Air Corps to meet their increased responsibilities.  This has been put into effect and recruiting to bring the new establishment up to full strength is proceeding.  There are vacancies in all elements of the Defence Forces and I ask Deputies to encourage young men to enlist for service, in the knowledge that they will be serving their country in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lipper referred to the living accommodation.  I am giving very high priority to improving accommodation and facilities for members of the Defence Forces.  This is reflected in this year's allocation of over £4 million for building works.  It is intended to replace unsuitable married quarters for noncommissioned officers and privates by modern housing and £557,000 is being provided this year for the construction of new quarters.  A scheme of 14 houses at McGee Barracks in Kildare is nearing completion and a scheme of 20 houses at Galway is well under way.  A contract will shortly be placed for a scheme of 12 flats at Cathal Brugha Barracks, the first phase in the replacement of old married quarters at that barracks.  Initial planning is also in hand for the erection of 12 houses at Kilkenny, at least 48 houses at Collins's Barracks, Cork, and 100 further houses at the Curragh Camp.</P>
    <P>The living accommodation of single soldiers is also receiving attention.  New billet buildings have recently been completed at Finner Camp, Gormanston Camp and Galway and others are under construction at Dundalk Barracks and at Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy.  Work on a new billet for the Naval Service at Haulbowline will be commencing this year.  In other locations existing billets continue to be improved, where practicable, by dividing large rooms into cubicles, the provision of individual <Col N="692" /> bedhead lighting, installation of central heating and improvements to sanitary and ablution facilities.</P>
    <P>Extensive building works are planned for Casement Aerodrome to cater for the increased needs of the Air Corps.  In the current year it is hoped to have work commenced on an extension to the apprentices' hostel, a new technical stores and a cookhouse and dining-hall complex. Plans have also been prepared for further development works at Gormanston Camp, including accommodation for the headquarters of the new Border Brigade and a cookhouse, dining hall and men's club.  It is hoped that these works will be started this year.</P>
    <P>Major improvement works are being carried out at the Curragh Camp.  They include a new cookhouse and dining hall complex to cater for all ranks at Pearse and MacDonagh Barracks.  A transport maintenance complex has recently been completed and work is proceeding on a Curragh Command vehicle workshops to cater for major overhauls.  It is anticipated that work will be commencing in the near future on the first phase of new Ceannt Barracks and this phase will include accommodation for the Women's Service Corps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying mainly to points made by Deputy Lipper.  It is expected that work will begin this year on a number of other projects throughout the <Col N="693" /> country including new cookhouse and dining facilities at Kickham Barracks in Clonmel, at Murphy Barracks in Ballincollig and Finner Camp, new accommodation for the Army School of Music at Cathal Brugha Barracks, and a new FCA Headquarters at Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>The 1980 provision for defensive equipment has been substantially increased over that for 1979 and will cover the purchase of new mortars, artillery, computer equipment, new field guns, anti-tank missiles, surface to air missiles and additional tanks.</P>
      <P>In relation to the matter mentioned by Deputy Creed, arrangements are being made to lease a large twin-engined helicopter capable of flying at night or in reduced visibility.  The Army has not had this type of helicopter previously and it will add substantially to their capability.</P>
      <P>A new patrol vessel, <i>LE Aoife,</i> was commissioned last October and another new vessel, <i>LE Aisling,</i> was handed over to the Naval Service in May this year, thus bringing to four the number of fast modern patrol vessels especially suited for all-weather operations in Irish waters available to the Naval Service.  Two further vessels of a new design are to be ordered and it is intended that the new design will incorporate a helicopter-carrying capability.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Civil Defence.  It is a voluntary organisation which plays a vital role in the overall Defence arrangements.  It is deserving of special thanks and encouragement and I gladly pay tribute to their excellent and very worthwhile work.  Without the fullest co-operation of the local authorities, however, Civil Defence could not be made to work and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to state that the Department have received every co-operation from these bodies.  I wish also to express sincere appreciation of the active co-operation of the Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John's Ambulance Brigade with the Civil Defence organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made very little allowance for the Civil <Col N="694" /> Defence and little or nothing for the Red Cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making a certain amount of money available.  These organisations are doing an excellent job and I just want to pay tribute to them.  I also want to refer briefly to the Army Pensions Estimate, although we will have more time to deal with it later on.</P>
      <P>The Army Pensions Estimate is for a net sum of £20,751,000 for the year ending 31 December 1980, representing an increase of £3,527,000 on the provision for last year.  The increase is related mainly to increases in pensions granted during 1979 and to the inclusion of provision to cover increases in pensions and allowances from 1 July 1980 in accordance with the principle of maintaining parity in public service pensions. Special allowances are also being increased.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the new Army Pensions Bill which was introduced yesterday to provide for, among other things, the payment of enhanced allowances for the widows and children of personnel killed on duty and the new allowance of £185 a year for the widows of special allowance holders. The Bill is to be debated next week.  Arising out of the introduction of the allowance of £185 a year for the widows of special allowance holders, the minimum rate of special allowance is being increased to £185 a year.  The new allowance of £185 a year was announced in the budget, as well as the extension with effect from 1 July 1980 to the widows of veterans of the War of Independence of the free electricity allowance and the free television licence. In addition military service pensions and the allowance payable to their widows are to be free of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that the education and training of the officers and men of the Defence Forces are continuously improved to keep abreast of modern developments.  A total of 77 officers are undergoing various full-time courses at third-level educational institutions.  In 1978 a cadet scheme was introduced for <Col N="695" /> the purpose of providing the Naval Service with qualified Marine Engineers.  To date ten cadets were appointed under this scheme and are undergoing full-time training in the Cork Regional Technical College.  Discussions have also taken place between officials of my Department and the college on the question of the provision of suitable courses at the college for navigation cadets.</P>
    <P>It is the practice to assign a number of personnel to courses of training in foreign military establishments and during 1979 such courses were attended in Britain, India, Luxembourg, Germany and the United States.</P>
    <P>Members of the Permanent Defence Force who, in their own time, attend approved second-level and third-level courses of education are refunded the tuition and examination fees involved. Non-commissioned officers and privates who undergo courses leading to the Department of Education day group certificate are refunded the cost of books and examination fees.</P>
    <P>A scheme exists whereby personnel are registered with AnCO as apprentices in various trades such as fitter, motor mechanic, sheet metal worker, bricklayer, plasterer and painter-decorator. These personnel attend either <Col N="696" /> full-time off-the-job training courses or day-release courses.</P>
    <P>With a view to assisting Army personnel in finding civilian employment on discharge, I have arranged for a number of resettlement courses to be run in Army workshops on a pilot basis.</P>
