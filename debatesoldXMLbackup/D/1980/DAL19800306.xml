      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I might ask the Taoiseach whether he is now or will shortly be in a position to make a statement on the position in Erin Foods.  He will have seen, no doubt, in the papers a report that at one stage in very recent days there was a suggestion of an imminent arrest.  If that happens the matter would be <i>sub judice.</i>  I think he will agree that this House is entitled to hear something before that happens.  I would ask him, therefore, whether he can now say when such a statement can be made and assure us that there will be a statement before the matter becomes <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I gave notice that I wished to raise on the Order of Business this morning the question of whether or not the Minister for Labour would make a statement on the action he proposes to take to solve the unofficial dispute at Dublin docks.  First of all, I want to protest that the Minister is not here, having given my notice in his presence yesterday, and I want to ask the Taoiseach now if it is proposed to make a statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter at the end of Question Time yesterday in the Chair's presence.  Again I want to protest at the Minister's absence.  I want to know from the Taoiseach what action the Government propose to take to solve this very serious dispute.  Is it the intention of the Government to make a statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has no notice of any question.  Deputies are well aware of this device of seeking to raise matters on the Order of Business which is not in order and which must not be encouraged or allowed.  The Chair will not allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that the <Col N="1515" /> Minister replied to me yesterday to watch the evening papers?  There was nothing in the evening papers or this morning's to show what the Minister's intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice yesterday of my intention to raise this matter this morning and I want the Taoiseach to say whether there is any intention to make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that getting up in the House and stating that he intends to raise something the next day is not giving notice.  The Chair has no notice of this matter.  The Chair cannot and will not accept matters being raised on the Order of Business which are not relevant.  If this gets out of hand we could have any Deputy getting up raising any matter he thinks of.  That is not permissible.  Matters raised on the Order of Business must relate to the business of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">

      <P>May I ask the Chair for guidance?  How can we give notice to the Chair that we intend to raise a matter if we cannot know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A Deputy can ask the Chair's permission to raise it by means of Private Notice Question and the Chair will judge whether or not it falls within that category.  The Deputy does not need to be told that; he knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>When I was speaking yesterday I was dealing with taxation and more especially farmer taxation. There has been a lot of talk about this. Last year we stated what we intended to do on farmer taxation.  We brought in some amendments to that in the budget. Now a farmer who improves his land by reclamation or improves his farm buildings will be allowed for this in his income tax.  That is a step in the right direction.  He is also allowed a concession on his rates.  There has been a lot of talk about the resource tax but, as the Taoiseach pointed out, this is a short-term measure and will be looked into.  It is hope that the commission on taxation which is to be set up will look into this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The finances of the nation must be put in order.  This is not easily done but we expect the full co-operation of the people in this matter.  We expect it from management, employees and trade unions. Unofficial disputes are not helping our economy.  It is not right for any individual to stand outside any company and disrupt services.  I do not wish to be taken out of context here.  I was in a trade union for a number of years before I entered the House.  As I knew trade union rules there was always a ballot and, whatever the decision, it was accepted by the workers.  If a dispute was to take place the company was notified.  That was the procedure we followed.  It seems that that has all changed.  I am not saying this happens everywhere.  It is only in a minority of cases but it can have a damaging effect on the economy and on investment coming into the country.  We are endeavouring to encourage industry, particularly foreign industry.  If it appears that we are disruptive they will have a hard look at us before coming in. Nobody owes us a living.  We have to stand on our own feet now and we must be able to show that we can produce <Col N="1520" /> goods and put them on the market at a competitive price.  This is the reality of the situation and we must face up to it.  If we get into a position where we are unable to deliver the goods we produce to foreign markets on time, we will be brought into question.  I do not wish anyone to think that I am anti-union or anti-employee.  I am not.  I always agreed with the trade union movement and most unions are responsible.  There is only a tiny minority who set out to disrupt the public in a few matters.</P>
    <P>In the budget we brought about greater equity in taxation and in the protection and improvement of the position of those on lower incomes.  That was to be welcomed.  There is a lot more to be done, but with an expanding economy we have to do this with the resources available to us.  We must reduce our borrowing commitment.  While protecting economic growth we must see to it that we do not borrow for items that are non-essential.  It must be for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>As regards PAYE it must be admitted that we have gone a long way in alleviating a lot of problems in this field. The splitting of the allowances has been a great help as has been the fact that the tax bands have been brought into line with the lower income group.</P>
    <P>I dealt with housing yesterday in some detail.  We will continue to erect the same number of new houses as we did last year.  We have increased the new house loans, reconstruction loans and also the income limit.  Deputy Fitzpatrick stated that while we had increased the loans the repayments on these were over £30 a week.  I agree they are but there is no cheap way that anybody can borrow this kind of money.  The loans given out by the local authorities are under 13 per cent.  I do not know where, in Ireland or anywhere else, one could get money so cheaply as that.  In England it could be much higher.  We may have to look into this matter before the end of the year and see, with the resources available to us, if we can increase the loans even more.  That will depend on a number of factors, for example, the price of houses. At the moment there seems to be a levelling <Col N="1521" /> off in house prices.  I have instructed my Department to examine all CRVs on new houses and ensure that applications are scrutinised to see that they are not priced too highly.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the number of applications received for the first two months of the year for new houses is much higher than for last year, which shows that there is a lot of new house building going on.  I am confident that the increased mortgages announced a month ago will be a great help here.</P>
    <P>In the industrial end, the IDA have received a substantial increase for the coming year.  I congratulate them on the work they are doing.  Some say that they could spend their funds more equitably across the board but, taking everything into consideration, they are doing a very good job.  The erection of advance factories and cluster units has been a great help and I should like to see more of these small units, which have been of great benefit to industry in rural Ireland. According to the industrialists I have spoken to, the position looks reasonably good, provided that we are able to control our costs.  These costs in any type of operation depend very much on how they are controlled and some may be due to factors outside the control of the companies and the Government.</P>
    <P>We are now depending heavily on oil imports and must examine other means of energy.  There has been some criticism of nuclear energy.  I am of the opinion that that will have to be looked into to see if it would be practical for us.  With the demands created by expansion in industry, I am not happy that we should be solely dependent on oil.  As the Deputies know, we are at the mercy of the tycoons and the Arabs.</P>

      <P>People may have been hit rather hard by the increase in the price of petrol.  I admit that this increase was high but if we look into the package that we have delivered, we had to look at the whole position and to take into account the high price for importing oil.  This now is around £800 million a year, which is extremely high.  Some luxury motoring could be cut out or greatly reduced. When you consider the income tax reliefs and other incentives which have been created in regard to employment, it was the only option open to us.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about the increase in the price of drink but, judging by the high life, cabarets and so on, especially at weekends, there is a lot of this type of entertainment.  I am not antidrink, certainly not, but am greatly worried about the effect of drink on our younger people.  Owners of places where cabarets and functions involving drink are held should scrutinise more carefully the age of their young clients.  Drinking among the young can have an adverse effect on their future life and work.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the mobile tax advisory scheme which will be provided shortly.  It is a good idea that people who have any difficulties will be able to go to these mobile offices if they are not able to go to the Revenue Commissioners. I see no reason now why anybody in any type of employment should not have to complete an income tax form.  It is only right that if you earn the money you pay the tax and if you do not earn it you will not have to pay the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A welcome thing is the mobile unit that will go around to explain the differences in the tax system and the type of taxation in which a person may be involved. It will be a help regarding farming taxation.  I have said frequently that farming taxation should be on accounts only.  There seems to be a difference of opinion among the farming organisations as to whether it should be on valuation, <Col N="1523" /> on accounts or by another means. When the budget was coming near they decided what they wanted.  I have spoken to a number of them who would be happy to remain on the national system, nevertheless I would say that over half of them want the accounts system.  Under the national system the amount of tax is decided by the multiplier.  I am in favour of the accounts system which in any line of business is the proper way.  With that system a businessman knows how he is going, he knows the state of his finances and he knows what he has to pay out. He knows his income and he knows his balance at the end of the day.  Therefore, I am happy that farmer taxation is now to be on the accounts system.</P>
    <P>In concluding what I have to say about taxation let me add that we have a long way to go yet to bring about equity there.  I hope that the commission will be able to bring about the situation when all in the community will be asked to pay only their fair share of taxation.  I admit that some people were paying very little income tax and others were being asked to carry a great part of the burden.</P>
    <P>I spoke yesterday evening on unemployment. I have not been happy about the register of unemployed.  How true is the register?  How many have been looking for employment?  How many have refused employment?  How many are the State propping up&mdash;in other words, how many are using this system and outside of that doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; and other work and getting away with this?  We are going to make an effort to clamp down on this and I warn any of these people who are using the system to draw the money and who are refusing jobs and doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; that we are not going to tolerate this.  It is something which has aggravated the PAYE and other taxpayers in this country who say to me and to many others that they are propping up people who are using this system and drawing money from it.  I give warning now that we are prepared to carry the people who are genuinely unemployed, but we are not prepared to carry people who are sponging on society and on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> In conclusion, I am happy that in the framework of the budget we have now put the economy on the right road, provided that we get the co-operation of each and every one, that we are able to cultivate our industrial relations and that we can bring about harmony in that line between management, employees and trade unions.  Everybody is involved in this and I hope that in this year we will see industrial peace.  We are depending on that now and if we get it I will be satisfied that this country will make further progress.  If we do not get that, then we as a Government may have to look at the position to see what can be done to rectify it.  As I have stated, the greatest problem that we have when we are bringing investment into the country is to decide how stable a country we are. I am glad to say that we are a stable nation. We have the manpower, the technique and the ability to take on any project in this country now provided that we get full co-operation from each and every one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to describe briefly this budget and its consequences as a time bomb the main ingredient of which is a substantial and highly explosive petrol increase which in time will create a massive conflagration in the cost of living, an erosion of living standards, substantial unemployment and industrial unrest.  That is my summary of the budget and its consequences for 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1977 the cost of living rose by approximately 40 per cent despite all the promises in the election manifesto.  This year will be no better, in fact the cost of living is expected to rise by 22 per cent.  I listened, as did many others, to the Taoiseach's appeal through the media, advocating the need for national concern, industrial peace and reasonable national understanding, they being the essential ingredients for the well being of the people and continued industrial development.  How can this be taken seriously?  Where is the genuine Government concern in the savage increases in the petrol taxation which can best be described as a vicious attack on the living <Col N="1525" /> standards of the commuting worker and his family?  The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>Because the international recession has had a particularly damaging impact on our energy dependent open economy, there is a new burden to be carried today.  We must all ensure that this new burden, unwelcome though it may be, will be shouldered evenly by all who can bear it.</P>
    <P>That rings hollow when we think of the petrol taxation on commuter workers. Nowhere in the tax allowances is there a travelling allowance for workers.  There is a very serious imbalance in this tax. Because of the lack of local industrial development throughout the country hundreds of peoples from towns and settlements must travel to the city centre, many of them covering about 300 miles per week.  These are the people who will contribute most through this excessive taxation to the tax benefits being given to the higher income group although they will have the least to gain from the tax revision.  These men and women will not tolerate any serious erosion in their living standards because of escalating cost and they must be adequately compensated in this year's proposed national understanding.</P>
    <P>We cannot blame the OPEC group for this serious escalation in the price of petrol.  Our own Arabs put on 20p a gallon and it is an excessive burden on the workers.  In a party political broadcast on the wireless on Tuesday a Minister of this Government described the taxes introduced as luxury taxes.  Surely the tax I referred to cannot be described as a luxury tax on the workers affected.  A car is a vital necessity in many cases for a person's wellbeing and continued employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance asked that both the capital programme and the taxation programme should be taken together before any criticism is made. The combination of the two show a very well defined anti-rural bias.  In relation to the roads allocation this year £48½ million <Col N="1526" /> was allocated for road capital programmes for development, improvement and construction of roads as compared with £45½ million last year.  That is an increase of £3 million, a paltry 7 per cent on the 1979 allocation despite an accepted inflation rate of 20 per cent. What has happened to the road transportation plan for the eighties which received such a national fanfare in the media and the press last year?  How can this year's allocation be described as the first stage of development in this plan when at least £100 million should have been allocated in this area?  Has this plan been shelved or postponed?  Are we really genuine about improving roads? Because of neglect of the roads system over the last two years roads have been reduced to the standards enjoyed in the days of Bianconi and the days of the gold rush in the Yukon.  We have a network of potholes and duckponds. That aspect of the capital programme is working contrary to the needs of the rural people.</P>
    <P>In addition, the environmental works allocation has been slashed by 65 per cent.  Over the last couple of years that programme achieved tremendous results in town and country where carparks, playgrounds, open spaces, better town approaches and indeed substantial employment were provided.  Other worthwhile projects have been slashed, local improvement group water schemes, for instance.  Where can we see genuine Government concern in such drastic cutbacks?  Where is the interest in providing the necessary employment for our young people especially?  Rural Ireland will suffer severely from these cutbacks this year.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that will have a detrimental effect that will not be acceptable in rural areas is that in the agricultural allocation of £146 million something short of only £6 million has been allocated for arterial drainage, that is only 4 per cent of the allocation.  That is somewhat down on last year and it was explained last week that we bought machinery last year that would not have to be bought this year.  However, my <Col N="1527" /> criticism is that this allocation will have a minimal effect on arterial drainage. Many schemes have been waiting for years to be implemented.  Thousands of acres of good land are in need of urgent drainage and the fact that this has not been done is not an indication of priority.  Surely 4 per cent of the agricultural capital programme is a small amount.  Agriculture is one of the prime industries in our economy and I would have expected, taking into consideration that land can be improved, incomes increased and a better living standard given to the farming community, that a greater amount of money would have been allocated for arterial drainage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that we are about to commence work under the arterial drainage system on two major rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation in the capital programme and the developments outlined will be poor consolation to the thousands of farmers who are hindered in their efforts to develop their land in the Suir and Mulcaire catchment areas in my constituency.  Farmers in that area have been waiting for years for work to commence but, apparently, they have many more years to wait.  Surely the Government realise that any money spent on drainage is well spent.  Money spent on arterial drainage is an investment in the future, in good land and in our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our people were shocked at the apparent about face in relation to the Land Commission.  A nominal £10 has been included in the Estimate for this year. Does this mean that we have reached the stage in our agricultural development that a deathknell has been sounded in relation to the Land Commission who work to acquire land for small holders? Such a move represents an insult to the many fine Land Commission officers who are conscious of the needs of our smallholders.  It represents a blow to the farmers who urgently need land.  I should like to know what has happened to the much promised report on land policy. Has it been shelved as was the Minister <Col N="1528" /> who advocated its adoption so loudly?  I am sure that the Land League who are so actively concerned about the needs of the smallholders were shocked when they read in the budget that the Government had decided that they no longer needed to acquire land.  They must have been shocked to learn that smallholders were being ignored and that the Land Commission, by the stroke of a pen, was being eliminated.</P>
    <P>Where is the Government concern for the development of smallholders?  If that represents permanent Government policy it indicates a lack of concern by them for the improvement of smallholders.  If it represents permanent Government policy thousands of smallholders will be driven from their uneconomic holdings.  The Land Commission must be allowed develop but they cannot do so without money.  Are we to take it that we are still being influenced by the Mansholt theory of eliminating the small farmers from our land?  It is sad to think that this is happening one year after we celebrated Michael Davitt's anniversary.  In the first budget following those celebrations there has been a complete turnabout with regard to land policy and the needs of our smallholders.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with this year's allocation for private housing.  We have been told that the substantial sum of £59 million has been allocated for this purpose.  I welcome the decision to increase loans from £9,000 to £12,000 and the raising of the income limit.  However, those increases are not sufficient because building costs have escalated but I welcome the statement by the Minister of State that the Department will have another look at the income limits and the maximum loan during the year.  The most serious aspect of house building is not the availability of money for house building but the lack, if not the nonexistence, of bridging loan facilities due to the continuing credit squeeze.  As a member of a local authority I am aware that many young couples are suffering because of this squeeze.  We have reached a crisis situation in the private <Col N="1529" /> building sector.  There will be a big reduction in the number of houses built this year unless the Central Bank, as a matter of great urgency, relax their policy on bridging facilities and allow banks to assist young married couples to provide accommodation for their families.  If that development does not take place soon a considerable portion of the allocation for housing this year will not be utilised and there will be serious unemployment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I am aware that the situation is getting worse. I know of young couples who have gone through the academic exercise of being approved by county councils for loans but then found themselves unable to obtain a bridging loan.  This matter should be tackled by the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and the Taoiseach. The credit squeeze on bridging facilities should be relaxed immediately to enable young couples to get accommodation. Grants for private houses will be decreased by £7 million this year.  The saving in this regard will amount to £20 million because of the confusion caused by the unexpected guillotining of these grants in January.  The huge increase in the number of applications will mean that it will be two years in many cases before many of them are paid.  I understand that O'Connell Bridge House is under seige and I hope the officials survive it.  It is unfortunate that many of those who received approval for house improvement grants last year will have to wait up to two years for money which they urgently need to meet the bills in connection with those improvements.</P>
    <P>A further £10 million has been allocated for local authority housing, an increase of 11 per cent, but that is insufficient because of rising costs.  The output of local authority housing for last year fell and unless adequate funds are made available to county councils that trend will continue.  I should like to refer to the long awaited circular from the Minister for the Environment in connection with a new system of financing house improvements for local authority <Col N="1530" /> houses.  That scheme is important for tenants who occupy old local authority houses which do not have facilities that are in modern houses.  We were promised in October 1978 that the circular would be issued shortly but it has not emerged.  Some of the tenants of those houses have lived in them for 40 years and they are entitled to assistance towards improving their facilities. Without Government finance, tenants or the local authorities cannot carry out this work.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the budget proposals was the change in the income tax code.  I have heard it said on many occasions that the change was greeted with a fanfare of jubilation and acclaimed as a great breakthrough.  In fact, the budget was described as a landmark on the road to tax equity. When all the excitement has died down and the dust has settled one will be able to see the actual results of those changes. Lest we forget, it should be remembered that prior to the budget it was estimated that the PAYE sector, without the changes in taxation, would this year be paying £1,080 million to the Exchequer in income tax.</P>
    <P>This year there will be a net saving of £131 million to the taxpayers of which £70 million will be as a result of a recent court case and for which the Government may not take any credit.  This means a net outcome of this review of £61 million.  Despite this improvement in the situation the PAYE sector will be paying £200 million more than they paid last year.  What, then, is the reason for the fanfare and the jubilation?  While what is being done is a start, it is but a minimal improvement.  It is what might be described as a con job to get the workers off the streets.</P>
    <P>Having regard to some of the income tax allowances provided for in the budget, one might well quote the dictum that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  The revised system is still inadequate. I suppose it may be said that one may find fault even with a papal encyclical, but I should like to indicate one aspect of this revised taxation system <Col N="1531" /> which affects many thousands of workers.  Let us take as an example, a one-salary family of husband, wife and three children with a gross income of £5,000 per year.  As a result of the amended tax situation that family will be better off this year to the extent of £184 or £3.50 per week but if we take as an example the same size of family with an income of £15,000, the net benefit in their case will be £1,706 or £33 per week.  In other words, the family with the income of three times greater than the other family will be nine times better off in terms of tax benefit.  The reason for my taking as an example a £5,000 income is that thousands of commuter workers are in this income bracket and for them the increased petrol prices will be substantial and will be utilised to make this upward adjustment in the tax liability of the higher-paid worker.  The Minister said in his budget speech that direct tax cuts must be financed by other taxation.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to know why there was not a greater examination of the proposals before any organisation such as the ICTU rushed in to welcome the package as they did within 24 hours of the changes being announced.  They should first have examined the effects of the proposals on the lower-paid workers, those people who comprise the bulk of that organisation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that additional taxation is needed to ensure the continuation of essential services.  I should like to make special reference to the question of the future vitality and independence of our local authorities. These bodies, if financed properly, can provide an adequate service for all our people.  In his budget statement the Minister said that if we are to cater for the pressing needs of tomorrow, we must not assume blandly that yesterday's services must remain intact.  The Minister went on to say that the Government's aim in reviewing expenditure is to ensure that taxpayers will be called on to contribute only that expenditure which is absolutely essential.  In the past couple of years, because of cut-backs in the Public Capital Programme, coupled with <Col N="1532" /> ministerial restrictions on local rates, the power of local authorities has been diminished considerably.  This year can be described as a crisis year for these bodies because local democracy has been recentralised in the Custom House with the result that decisions cannot be made locally in respect of such matters as road programmes, employment or other essential services.  Indeed, local authorities cannot be considered any longer to be democratic and independently elected bodies.  We cannot any longer control our destiny because of the necessary financial decisions being made at central level.  This year county managers will have to adopt revised estimates as a result of lack of finance and this will be reflected in employment and in the standard of services that will be provided.  Local democracy is being eliminated in an overt manner.  The predictions are that because of the sharp fall in financial allocations to the local authorities this year there may be serious cut-backs in services and in employment. This is of great concern to all those of us who are members of local authorities. We are no longer entitled to cut the cloth to the measure we consider proper.  Instead, we must cut our cloth on the basis of grants decided in Dublin.  That is not good planning and it is not good from the point of view of the people we represent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in social welfare payments, increases that were needed badly because of the deprivation suffered by the people concerned in recent years as a result of escalating food prices.  Despite the increases this year, however, the situation will be even worse for these people.  Perhaps in October or thereabouts the situation should be reviewed with a view to increasing the allowances further.</P>
    <P>I am concerned regarding the estimate in the capital programme in respect of social welfare.  There has been a substantial cut-back in this area from £379 million to £354 million.  This raises the question of where the cut-back is being made.  Are the workers to be asked this year to make additional contributions to <Col N="1533" /> the service?  It is important that the situation be explained at this stage.  I appeal to congress to seek clarification of this deficiency in order to ascertain where the cut-back of £25 million is to be made.</P>
    <P>The increase in the Public Capital Programme for hospital development is only of the order of 2 per cent.  This leaves no room whatever for any major improvement in this very important social area.  There are many county hospitals that are urgently in need of capital investment in order to be able to provide the maximum and modern facilities required to meet demand.  Many submissions have been made to the Minister for Health in this regard.  The need for maternity units in county hospitals has been stressed.</P>
    <P>We hope that the minor capital programme to be announced later in respect of the health boards will include money for much needed extra facilities such as better dispensaries and outpatient facilities.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the allocation in the Public Capital Programme for the Department of Labour.  Again, there is a serious cut-back in the allocation for employment maintenance and employment experience programmes.  The cut-back has been from £10.8 million to £5.3 million, a 50 per cent cut-back.  Surely at a time when our clothing and textile industries, two of our oldest traditional industries, are being bombarded out of existence, the Taoiseach, if he were concerned with the employment situation would ensure the survival of these industries and that these allocations would be increased substantially rather than reduced to such an extent.  From this aspect and in this area of employment support alone, there is ample proof that the new Taoiseach at one fell blow declared economic planning and development as heretical, publicly burned his party's 1977 manifesto and turned his back on the priorities for national objectives and job creation in the eighties.</P>
    <P>While there has been some improvement in the tax code, there is still a great <Col N="1534" /> deal more to be desired.  We have only started bringing equity into the system. Once again I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Ministers concerned to ensure that sufficient finances are made available for local authorities to survive the eighties and enable them to give a service worthy of the people they represent and support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few remarks on the contents of the budget, the purpose of the budget, how it should be seen in the light of circumstances this year, and to deal with some of the Opposition's criticisms or, in some areas, lack of criticism.</P>
      <P>The first point to emphasise is that a budget is one component of Government policy and has to be seen in conjunction with other actions and other programmes of government.  I make that point at the outset because listening to the more exaggerated Opposition comments one would get the impression that they had some mysterious formula by which a single budget could be used to cure all the ills, real or imaginary, of a population in one single stroke.  That is nonsense.</P>
      <P>A budget at the best of times makes some adjustments in the pattern of economic activity and can take some positive steps to bring the economy along a desired path.  That is the approach which has been put forward over the years by Fianna Fáil and it has been the pattern continued by the present Government.  Since the 1977 election our three budgets can be seen as part of the same coherent overall policy for tackling the various needs and problems confronting the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to begin with one example of that, namely, the changes in the area of PAYE taxation.  We heard from a number of Opposition speakers implying that these PAYE changes were made reluctantly, grudgingly or that they were forced on the Government by a court decision. That is simply not so.  It is true that the court's decision would have required part of these changes to have been made at some early date, but it was equally <Col N="1535" /> clear that the changes made last week go far beyond what was necessary to implement the court's decision and, much more importantly, it can be demonstrated even more clearly that the changes made last week are consistent with the policy adopted by Fianna Fáil at the time of the 1977 election and before it.</P>
    <P>The frustration, the sense of grievance, the consciousness of an excessively heavy load of taxation on the PAYE category built up during the Coalition years.  Let us nail that first.  It will be recalled that in the years 1975 and 1976 the income tax rates were increased substantially and no adequate provision was made to adjust those tax free allowances and the tax bands in an adequate way to take account of inflation. As a result, by 1976 Ireland had the doubtful distinction of being the country that imposed the heaviest burden of income taxation on the ordinary wage earner. The fraction of the ordinary wage earner's pay packet taken from him in income tax reached its peak in 1976 and placed Ireland in the unenviable position of being the country which inflicted the heaviest burden of any country in western Europe at that time.  That is where the problem began.  That is where it built up.  That is where it festered.</P>
    <P>The first movement away from this crushing burden on the PAYE taxpayer came with a publication not in 1977 of our manifesto but in an earlier document published by Fianna Fáil in September 1976 when in opposition titled &ldquo;The Real Emergency&rdquo;.  It was designed to draw attention to the real difficulties confronting the country at that time.  The reason for having to do this was that an attempt was being made to whip up false hysteria on security issues which were quickly demonstrated to be irrelevant and largely non-existent.  We were concentrating on the real problems&mdash;unemployment, inflation and taxation.  That was the stage at which we first enunciated the need to introduce substantial cuts in income taxation and more importantly to say that the main component of those PAYE tax cuts should be aimed at <Col N="1536" /> married couples because they had suffered most and had the greatest need of an easement.</P>
    <P>Members will recall that in the wake of that first publication of our policy in regard to income taxation, there was a very remarkable shift of approach on the part of the then Coalition, almost as dramatic as Saul falling off his horse. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, initially reacted to our approach by denouncing it and saying it was totally impossible to implement, it could not be afforded, it was irresponsible and so on.  The Coalition quickly tore up their own draft of an alleged programme for economic and social development, although they managed eventually to turn out a pale imitation of one&mdash;&ldquo;Economic and Social Development, 1976-1980&rdquo;.  It was a masterly production of 38 pages which had to be so butchered as a consequence of our proposals that it became a laughing stock.  In their haste to alter its contents to take account of our policies, we had the unprecedented spectacle of a document being published on a Sunday evening and a press conference being hastily summoned for that evening.  The haste had been so apparent that the contents page&mdash;it was corrected in the copies distributed to the public at large&mdash;was for the original document and did not coincide with the text.  Why?  Because there had to be a hasty movement away from the then policy, which was that we would have to face up to cuts in public expenditure and that there would not be any prospect of a reduction of the taxation burden.</P>
    <P>Very quickly in the wake of the Fianna Fáil approach we had an ability to introduce some limited tax cuts, and in the last Coalition Government budget of January 1977 there was a belated limited effort to give some easement of the taxation burden.  There was some improvement in the tax rates and some lowering in the top rate of income tax. However, that by no means dealt with the problem because the reliefs were very limited, halting, grudging steps in the direction of tax reform in the PAYE <Col N="1537" /> system.  They were changes which were forced on them by the approach Fianna Fáil had adopted.</P>
    <P>We followed up our September 1976 commitment by boldly announcing at the time of the 1977 election that if elected we would take the first steps towards equity in the treatment of married couples by doubling the tax free allowances for them so that they would be equal to twice those of single taxpayers.  That commitment was honoured in our first budget of 1978.  There were further improvements in 1979 and in the course of that year, as the discussions on the national understanding proceeded and in the aftermath of the march by the PAYE taxpayers, there was much examination of this issue.  A working party were set up as part of the groups preparing the national understanding specifically to examine the taxation question, and various points were clarified.  In the text of the national understanding is a paragraph which states:</P>
    <P>The Government, for their part, considered that the 1978 and 1979 Budgets recognised the need to keep the absolute burden of taxation as low as possible and are also concerned that taxation is equitably distributed.</P>
    <P>The document gave details of the changes made up to that time and then stated:</P>
    <P>The Government will continue this approach with the intention of achieving an income tax system based on full income splitting.</P>
    <P>So all the Opposition talk to the effect that this move towards equitable treatment of married couples had been forced on the Government by court decision is not true and can be demonstrated not to be true.  Equally, any suggestion that the budget in this area indicates a marked shift in policy in the taxation field is not true.  On the contrary, we can see quite clearly a positive clear direction of policy since the autumn of 1976, a policy which was given its first expression in our first budget of 1978 and which has been continued since.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> That is one feature of this budget which I welcome and which has been the subject of widespread welcome throughout the community because there has been this degree of progress in the production of a tax system that is not only equitable but is being seen to be fair to all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The second feature of the budget is the improvement in social welfare allowances.  Various attempts have been made to suggest that in some way or other Fianna Fáil have been grudging or limited or reluctant in giving social welfare improvements, that in some sense they have been attempting to favour the wealthy at the expense of the less privileged.  That is not so, nor is there any substance in the suggestion that there has been a shift of policy.  The fact is that there has been a substantial real improvment in social welfare benefits this year as there had been in the two previous budgets.  That approach of providing the maximum possible real improvements in social welfare benefits has been and continues to be a consistent feature of Fianna Fáil Governments, in marked contrast to the miserable improvements made during the Coalition years.</P>
    <P>Despite all the flowery language and pious expressions of concern for the lot of the under privileged, when in Government the present Opposition did precious little about it, and the record is there to indict them.  It can be demonstrated beyond all doubt that their recognition of the lot of the weaker sections was grudging. When you look at what happened during their four-and-a-half years in office you can see that the aggregate improvement in social welfare benefits during the period was 10 per cent or less, working out at about 8 per cent&mdash;2 per cent a year.  That was the measure of the Coalition's concern for an improvement in the position of the lower paid.</P>
    <P>How does that contrast with Fianna Fáil, alleged to be the hard-faced party concerned only with the position of the wealthy?  The two budgets of 1978 and 1979 produced an improvement of 15 per cent in the two-year period&mdash;in other <Col N="1539" /> words, 7½ per cent a year&mdash;and because we do not yet have the rate of inflation in the course of 1980 and therefore cannot say exactly what will be the real improvement in social welfare benefits this year as a result of last week's budget increases, there cannot be any doubt that the real benefit this year will be of the same order of magnitude, and I will be very surprised at the end of this year if we do not record at least another 7½ per cent improvement in the real position of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>For three years running we can see a record of substantial improvements in the position of social welfare recipients, a three year aggregate that will go down as one of the best records in the history of this State.  The reason I have to say &ldquo;one of the best&rdquo; instead of the best is because if we go back to earlier decades we would be begining from a situation where there were not any social welfare benefits and it was a Fianna Fáil Government which introduced them. Therefore, in percentage terms there would be a picture of more dramatic progress.</P>
    <P>Having spoken about the PAYE and social welfare aspects of the budget we come to the logical point that these improvements must be financed, and naturally one other element of the budget that requires attention and that ought to provide a better base for Opposition attack is the imposition of the tax increases needed to finance the improvements.  The tax increases were concentrated in three main areas: cigarettes, alcohol and hydro-carbon fuels.  Although, of course, these tax changes had the undesirable effect of adding to the overall measured rate of price increases this year, nevertheless in the circumstances they can be demonstrated to contribute to other desirable objectives and to help the overall economy through the difficult international climate of the early months of the eighties.</P>
    <P>The way in which I would argue that they do this is twofold.  First, I want to make the point, which appears to have escaped speakers from the Opposition <Col N="1540" /> benches&mdash;although I suppose if they had noticed it it would not have been to their advantage to have drawn the attention of the House to it&mdash;that if they are concerned about the distribution of the overall tax burden, if they want to see PAYE taxpayers paying less and therefore other groups paying more, may I point out to them that this shift in tax burdens helps to produce precisely that result?  I can illustrate that fairly easily. The House will recall that many of the placards carried by PAYE taxpayers during the various marches had slogans to the effect that they had only 70 per cent of the income but that they were paying 88 per cent of income tax; so, 70 per cent, then, for that group.  That means that if one imposes £100 million extra taxation on oils, petrol, tobacco, alcohol or whatever, approximately £70 million of that £100 million will be paid by those PAYE taxpayers.  We have no great reason to believe that their pattern of use of each of these items is markedly different from that of other sections of the community.  Therefore, the PAYE group will pay £70 million out of any £100 million extra in indirect taxation. That means £30 million will be paid by the farmers and the self-employed.  If you use that £100 million of extra taxation to reduce the PAYE tax burden by £100 million then naturally they are to that extent better off.  The net position is that they gain £30 million at the expense of the self-employed and farming taxpayers because everybody will have made his tax contribution when he spends part of his income on each of those items.</P>
    <P>Therefore the shift from direct taxation and PAYE taxpayers to the greater use of indirect taxes is appropriate in the present conditions of our economy and can make its own useful contribution to bringing about a better distribution of the overall tax burden as well as, of course, in the case of cigarettes and alcohol, perhaps helping to curb somewhat any tendencies towards excessive consumption of these products. Certainly, in the case of oil&mdash;given that we have moved into a much more difficult period in history with regard to its availability and price&mdash;there must be <Col N="1541" /> national concern to ensure that we make the greatest possible economies in the use of oil products.  As we know, this is a requirement not merely in Ireland but in the whole of the civilised world. Therefore in my view there can be no objection, looked at in national terms, to a programme which emphasises the need for maximum economy for forcing us, through one of the most effective means known&mdash;namely, higher prices&mdash;to think twice and carefully when we set about using any form of oil product. Any adverse effects higher oil prices may have, whether on the weaker sections of the community or on industry, can be dealt with through appropriate adjustments in the spending programme of the Government.  As we have seen, these adverse effects have been dealt with in the case of social welfare beneficiaries by the provision of generous increases in the various benefits.  On this question of the overall tax burden I see no justification for any attempted Opposition criticism.</P>
    <P>The next point with which I should like to deal rather briefly&mdash;but since it has been the cause of some comment from the Opposition benches, with some attempts made to imply a shift in policy, it is no harm to clarify it and state the position carefully&mdash;is the approach to reducing the Government's borrowing requirement.  The implication is that there must be some form of split in the Fianna Fáil Party or that there must be some clash on the right policy to be pursued and that this is demonstrated in the way in which there is now a reduction or cutback in the overall level of borrowing, that in some sense there is to be a movement away from or a change in policy from the two previous years.  Naturally, when Opposition speakers make this point they regard it as a statement of changed policy in the last year.  Again the record shows quite clearly that there has been no such change or shift of policy.  In my view there has been no shift in policy because the commitment to reducing the public sector borrowing requirement was made three years ago, prior to the 1977 election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> The position can be summarised at that point by showing that there were three major economic problems confronting the country&mdash;unemployment, inflation and the state of the Government's finances.  Not even Fianna Fáil could solve all three simultaneously.  The sequence for action would be to tackle unemployment, inflation and then, as sufficient momentum was built up by way of faster economic progress, by way of growing employment, by way of heavier volumes of investment, this faster growth and increased employment would provide conditions in which we could set about bringing down the Government's borrowing requirement. Indeed, as we know, the budget of last year was framed to achieve that kind of movement.  The fact that the outturn in 1979 did not achieve the desired result is not to suggest that the policy has been changed or that it failed but rather that it reflected short-term influences at work last year which we know about and which were repeated again in the course of the debate yesterday by the Taoiseach, when he pointed out the way in which the impact of disrupted oil supplies and higher oil prices, as well as the impact of domestic events knocked budgetary arrangements off course last year.  What is being done this year then is an endeavour to re-establish the momentum towards bringing down the borrowing requirement to a manageable and realistic level.  If there is to be any dispute in this area, as I see it, it can only be a dispute as to the precise scale of and speed at which any such reduction in borrowing level should be made.  Here, in so far as one can discern any coherent policy from the Opposition benches, I have to say that they appeared to be speaking with false tongues.  On the one hand, some speakers have been saying that there has not been sufficient done to reduce the level of Government borrowing in order to protect our currency, to ensure that we can preserve the value of the Irish punt in the EMS.  Indeed, we had one Opposition speaker going so far as to allege that the budget arrangements would create the risk, or the threat that the Irish punt would have to be <Col N="1543" /> devalued.  At the same time we had other speakers&mdash;indeed, the same speaker&mdash;going on to complain and lament the fact that there had not been more spending on various desirable proposals or greater tax concessions given to PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, on the one hand, to say that we want Government borrowing reduced and, on the other, to say that we want the Government to spend more on tax cuts.  That is the classic case of the Opposition trying to run several horses and ride off in different directions. That explains why they could never arrive at any coherent policy.  Trying to say that borrowing should have been reduced while at the same time advocating more spending or more tax cuts is trying to have one's cake and eat it.  If one looks at the figure which is struck in the budget, 10.4 per cent of GNP, it can be seen to strike a reasonable balance. We must bring down the level of Government borrowing.  That was a view expressed four years ago by Fianna Fáil and was part of their overall approach to policy.  It is a view that has been repeated in the present budget.</P>
    <P>There is no point in setting about restoring order to Government finances in a way that would make the cure worse than the illness.  If one is to go for a drastic type of deflation which would cut out Government borrowing in one single budget, almost inevitably the consequence would be massive deflation of the economy, large scale reductions in employment and almost certainly all kinds of disruptive influences at work in industrial relations.  The situation one would face if one were to attempt a savage reduction in public sector borrowing would be to worsen the state of the economy and weaken its ability to expand in future years.  There is no way one can achieve a savage cut in Government spending without damaging the level of investment.  It is that level of investment which must be seen as one of the underlying sources of growth and therefore the underlying element that would cure our economic ills.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers are trying to <Col N="1544" /> have their cake and eat it, trying to argue that in some sense the policies of the previous two years were mistaken&mdash;that is when they usually stand up and wave copies of the manifesto&mdash;and are now implying that the country has to pay for the mistakes and that the Government have embarked on a different policy. When they attempt that approach they are demonstrating clearly that they never bothered to absorb or understand Fianna Fáil policy in the first instance or, if they did, it suits their convenience to forget it. I will spell out what the approach has been to tackling the restoration of order to the public finances while, at the same time, ensuring that we can provide adequate employment opportunities and improvements in the overall standard of living.</P>
    <P>One can view the process as having three elements.  The analogy which I have used before and will use again is that of the three stage rocket that will put one into orbit.  One needs a short-term policy to get one off the ground, to make a quick immediate impact.  Secondly, one needs a meduim-term programme that will run over a few years, that will produce enough momentum and enough by way of visible output to carry one through into the third stage where, hopefully, it has now built up sufficient momentum so that one can switch off any boost the Government were giving in the first two stages of getting off the ground and flighting one onto one's final orbit path.</P>
    <P>What were the three stages so far as the Fianna Fáil approach was concerned? The long-term stage was to build up a sufficient level of private investment so that it would, over the indefinite future, be sufficient to provide the jobs needed for a growing population.  Moving back from that, the medium-term programme had to be one which would create the right environment in which this private investment could take place. The creation of that environment can be thought of as having two main components. On the one hand, one must have the right taxation and financial incentives and on the other one must have the <Col N="1545" /> right physical environment.  One must make good the deficiencies in telecommunications, transport systems and so on.  As the initial programme to get one off the ground in the first instance one must make a dramatic, decisive impact and be seen to make it quickly on the high levels of unemployment and inflation. Those three stages were spelled out when we were in opposition from autumn 1976 onwards and was implemented by Fianna Fáil in Government over the last three years.</P>
    <P>The short-term programme, that of the quick dramatic impact on the problems, was the one illustrated by the crash programme to create 20,000 jobs and also by the initial programme of tax cuts.  The reason for needing that short-term programme was that the climate of confidence in investment had been so shattered, so weakened and undermined during the years of Coalition that we felt there was little prospect of building adequate growth in investment in a sufficiently short period of time.  It is hard to put precise numbers on these kind of things but nobody in the early months of 1977 could have believed that the volume of private investment would rise in 1978 to almost 20 per cent.  It had fallen during the years of Coalition and people were talking in terms of, at best, increases of 6 to 8 per cent. Such increases would have been grossly inadequate to make any worthwhile impact on the employment needs of the economy.  We would have been struggling on with massive levels of unemployment and, with a growing population, they would have added to the dole queues or they would have been driven back to the traditional remedy of the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>If you wanted to turn that situation around, you had to make a very quick, dramatic impact and that was the justification for the short-term programme of tax cuts and job creation, which, of course, meant a temporary increase in Government borrowing.  Once that initial injection had been made you are then moving on to the medium-term <Col N="1546" /> programme where, having demonstrated that progress was possible and having spelled out enough of your policies to illustrate clearly the direction in which the economy was to move, you could then set about making good the medium-term requirements and, hence, the preparation of a five-year programme to modernise the telephone system, a ten-year programme to modernise roads and other measures to deal with the needs of a growing industrial sector as well as action on the fiscal front by way of guaranteeing the type of taxation arrangements which would operate for manufacturing industry in the years ahead.  Here I illustrate one example, the arrangements to introduce a 10 per cent rate of tax on profits from manufacturing industry, to operate up to the year 2000.</P>
    <P>A second very important illustration is the introduction of the enterprise development programme operated by the IDA, which was specifically designed to encourage Irish people with ideas, enthusiasm and some belief in their own ability to make a contribution to their own country and to come forward and launch their own small industries, with the maximum amount of financial and other support services.  That programme, as the House knows, has been working satisfactorily, the combination of those elements creating the right kind of medium-term amendment.  As these would build up, with greater native growth of industry through the success of the enterprise development programme, as the climate of a better, more modern infrastructure and stable tax arrangements was more widely perceived and recognised throughout the international community, so one would expect an increased flow of external investment to Ireland.  As we know, this has been happening.  The influx of new industry into Ireland has more than doubled over the last three years so that, in combination, the increased inflow of external investment, coupled with a growing tide of investment encouraged among our own people, would build up to the point where one could enter into the long-term path, where the private sector would develop sufficient investment <Col N="1547" /> momentum to meet the employment needs of our population without any requirement for regular boost or support from the public sector.  That was the pattern quite clearly perceived, that was the one introduced and that is the one being continued.  When people start criticising the movement towards reducing the borrowing requirements and the reduced emphasis on employment creation programme, it is important to point out that unemployment is not the major problem today that it was three years ago.  Indeed, in many parts of the country employers will say that the difficulty is not one of lack of jobs, but the opposite&mdash;a lack of workers available to fill the existing jobs.  In those circumstances it would be pointless to pursue a programme of artificially boosting the number of job opportunities when those already available are not being fully taken up.</P>
    <P>The policy being consistent and, more important, being successful, I was reminding myself, listening to some of the Opposition speakers, of what they were saying at the time.  I suggest especially, if I may, to the people in the media&mdash;because I do not expect the people on the Opposition benches to take these points to heart&mdash;not to be too caught up by what people say today, yesterday or tomorrow.  If you want a better appreciation of the apparent views held by people you should go back and see what they were saying at the time. When I hear people like Deputy FitzGerald coming into the House and talking about the marvellous recovery that was under way in 1977 and how it was totally unnecessary for Fianna Fáil to come in with a programme that artificially boosted the economy at the time when it did not need this boost, I scratch my head and say &ldquo;Where was I in 1977 that I was not aware of this marvellous recovery that was under way&rdquo;? Was it only myself?  Where was everybody else that year?  I do not recall anybody talking about massive recoveries in the economy, being on a growth pattern or anything else.  Quite the contrary, I can recall people expressing <Col N="1548" /> real concern.  One matter was engaging me at the time and I was able to find quite easily some papers by Brendan Halligan, Secretary of the Labour Party and one of their more articulate spokesmen on those issues at that time. What was he saying at the end of 1976, when he was talking about the need for radical new policies&mdash;to tackle what? The unemployment problem.  Why? Because he opened one of his papers by saying &ldquo;In 1926 there were one-and-a-quarter million people at work in this country.  Fifty years later that number has fallen by almost 200,000.  Such failure is without parallel in the industrialised world&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that even in the apparently successful decade of the sixties the picture had not really altered.  Why? Because in 1960 the total number of workers was 1,055,000; in 1970, the number was 2,000 fewer, so during that decade total employment actually fell despite the heavy successes in raising living standards.  He goes on: &ldquo;The truth is that our past economic performance when it came to providing jobs has always been abysmal&rdquo;.  He talks about it holding out a positively frightening future.  Why?  Because he draws attention to the studies made by the ESRI about the growing population and the dramatic needs there will be for additional jobs.  I enjoyed one of the paragraphs in this paper, because the author was talking about what might or might not be done.  He felt that it would all have to be done through additional State investment, but went on to say:</P>
    <P>The provision of an answer is the most important central issue facing policy makers today.  The answer must be an immediate one.  It must be capable of instant implementation and for that reason must take into account existing political and economic realities.  There is absolutely no point in putting forward doctrinally pure solutions in circumstances where the majority will reject them.</P>
    <P>I could not have written that paragraph better myself.  Because, of course, that was exactly what we did in 1977.</P>

      <P>I could not have expressed that paragraph better myself.  There the author was identifying the magnitude of the problem the country faced with unemployment and the failure to tackle it in the previous half century and how much more serious the problem would become because of our growing population unless something was done about it.  Despite his own view and suggestions he was saying that, however it is done, it must be done quickly; it must be immediate; it must be capable of instant implementation, but taking account of existing political and economic realities.</P>
      <P>The programme put forward by Fianna Fáil at the election did precisely those things.  The results are there to demonstrate it clearly.  For the first time in our history since independence there has been a massive increase in the number of people employed.  Despite all the gloom and doom that has been preached about this year, I do not hear anyone suggesting that the numbers at work are going to fall.  There may be a slower increase in employment this year but no one has suggested that there will be a fall in employment in 1980.  That turnaround was achieved by putting into practice the first two phases of the approach which we laid down and we are now somewhere in the middle of the second phase, the medium-term approach, and also well into creating the right kind of long-term situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most encouraging features of the Irish economy in the last few years has been the extraordinarily rapid buildup in private investment, increasing by about 20 per cent in volume in 1978 and increasing again last year by something <Col N="1550" /> of the order of 15 per cent.  If we can sustain that type of rapid growth in private investment we need have no fears about our longer-term ability to solve the employment problems and to provide the employment opportunities for our own people in our own country.</P>
    <P>Also we need have no fears about being able to reduce gradually the scale of Government intervention or support in the area of employment creation.  As I have said, those programmes of Government-created employment were to be seen essentially as measures designed to make a quick impact on the problem and to provide the necessary safety net or underpinning for the programmes that we were operating to encourage private sector employment. The reason I quarrelled with former Deputy Halligan at the time about his intended solution, which was to call for a massive wave of State investment, was that, quite apart from the fact that no one appeared to be able to identify the particular investment opportunities which the State would undertake and which could create these employment opportunities, even if they were there&mdash;which is highly suspect and certainly was never demonstrated&mdash;was because I wanted to know where would the money have come from to finance these.  The scale, which would have needed extra injections of funds by the Government, would have been colossal and would have made our present-day concern about Government borrowing appear trivial.  We would have been talking about an investment programme that would require several billion pounds to finance it, not £100 millions.  Since in 1976 we were already in the position that the level of Government borrowing was too high and that the correct movement in the future had to be to get that borrowing level down rather than up, clearly it did not make sense to talk or think in terms of trying to embark on any programme that would call for several billion pounds of additional State expenditure.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt on that aspect at some length and in some detail because some <Col N="1551" /> speakers from the Opposition side have tried to suggest that there has been a shift or change of policy or approach on the part of Fianna Fáil to these economic problems.  I have demonstrated clearly that I can discern no such shift from any of the information available to us.  On the contrary we have seen consistent application of an approach which has produced the most positive results ever witnessed in the history of the State.  For the first time since independence we have seen a massive improvement in employment. More important, we have seen the creation of a climate where we can feel confident of our ability to continue that type of momentum and growth in employment in the years ahead.  We have seen also that that type of progress can be made without any hardship being inflicted on the weaker sections of the community, despite the mistaken allegations from Opposition speakers.  On the contrary I have demonstrated clearly that, far from there being any worsening of the position of the underprivileged, there has been the most substantial improvement in the real level of social welfare benefits in the course of the last three years that has been recorded in modern times.  Therefore, it is possible to have the necessary rate of economic progress take place while also ensuring adequate social development.</P>
    <P>To imply, therefore, that Fianna Fáil are in some sense a party concerned only with economics and not seriously furthering the social progress of the community is a downright travesty of the facts. I have given examples of facts which show that the reverse is true, namely, that the faster progress has taken place during our period in office.  If you want to look at paltry improvements and relative failures to make social progress you must look at the wasted years of the Coalition Government.  That is the basic direction in which the economy has been moving and is moving.  It is true that there are some short-term, temporary setbacks which have to be dealt with, but these should be seen in their proper perspective as just that.  They are short <Col N="1552" /> term.  There is no reason why they should inflict any permanent damage on the community, unless through our own mistaken behaviour and actions as a community we should insist on inflicting that damage on ourselves.  Unhappily, in the course of last year we demonstrated a certain ability to do just that.  If we were to have any regular repetition of that type of behaviour we would indeed undermine our longer-term development prospects.  I would like to think that, as is so often the case, what appears initially to be an irreversible trend of behaviour can be influenced and eventually turned around by systematic, sustained reasoned approaches.</P>
    <P>The national understanding which was brought about last year was a clear example of the way in which it is possible to produce an orderly, reasonable mechanism for resolving what are undoubtedly complex problems afflicting not just Ireland but all modern societies. We should look along that path to make further progress in resolving these tensions and problems within our society rather than rush off and lock ourselves into further localised combats which ultimately can only create damage.  One of the points that many groups in our society have to learn is that, while they all possess power, it is power of a negative kind.  It is the power to prevent, to stop, to harm, to disrupt.  None of these sectional groups possesses the power itself to produce positive progress. They simply do not have sufficient command of resources to be able to produce positive progress in living standards for the people whom they represent.  If they want such real, permanent, lasting advance, they must work with other groups in the community to bring that about.  If we face some temporary difficulties, we need to achieve a greater degree of realism in the face of changing circumstances.  If people are impatient for further progress, that perhaps is understandable.  Given the very dramatic improvements that have taken place in the last three years, it would be natural that people would see and then say &ldquo;Well, if so much why not more?&rdquo;  Part of our longer-term success must lie in encouraging people to do <Col N="1553" /> things they have not done before so that we will indeed have an Ireland which will make us proud, which will be an inheritance for all our children, an Ireland where we will see not just employment opportunities, not just a taxation system acceptable without placards and protests, but one in which we will indeed demonstrate our ability to care for all of the community.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy O'Donoghue's version of the budget and I can only describe it as a tongue-in-cheek speech.  It beats me how the ex-Minister for Economic Planning and Development can speak for a whole hour without mentioning inflation.  This is a highly inflationary budget and raises serious doubts as to our economic future.  It will create a series of price increases with resultant unemployment and inflation and with the resultant difficulty of reaching future national understandings or wage agreements.  Consequently, we will have a great deal of industrial unrest.  The ex-Minister's insinuation that the budget is an indication of the continuation of his policies is at variance with the truth.  The Taoiseach has obviously thrown out Deputy O'Donoghue's policies which have brought us such problems over the last two years.  The Taoiseach has absolutely dimissed Deputy O'Donoghue and has adopted a new line of approach.  Deputy O'Donoghue is being made a scapegoat for the disastrous consequences of his policies but everybody on those benches was a partner to those policies as outlined in the 1977 election manifesto.  It is unfair to disown Deputy O'Donoghue and his policies now as every Fianna Fáil Deputy must share in what we were told repeatedly by the last Taoiseach was joint responsibility, collective responsibility in government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The give-away manifesto in 1977 has probably caused the unpleasant economic situation in which we now find ourselves.  We could not live up to those expectations; the people were fooled and they reacted in a rather virile manner in recent elections, whether local or European, <Col N="1554" /> and in the Cork by-election.  They showed their displeasure and the backbenchers in Fianna Fáil obviously decided to change course and to discard the people who had led them into this electoral disaster situation.  There is no doubt that this is the Taoiseach's budget and not Deputy O'Kennedy's budget. The Taoiseach decided to throw overboard the policy of job creation and to cut back on a huge scale on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>One relevant point in Deputy O'Donoghue's speech, which should not be lost to either Members of the House or to the public, was that there is no real cutback in borrowing, particularly foreign borrowing.  Because of this there can be no hope of improvement in the near future.  In fairness to Deputy O'Donoghue, he must be given credit for the creation of 20,000 jobs annually, which he outlined in the manifesto.  That was quite an achievement on his part but now that policy has been abandoned and we will find quite large-scale unemployment as the year progresses.  That is bound to happen with the cutback in public expenditure.  Deputy O'Donoghue virtually agreed with this when he pointed out that there was no cutback in borrowing.</P>
    <P>The public were not sufficiently informed about this budget and initially the tax concessions and the social welfare benefits seemed to be extremely generous.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach had the idea in the back of his mind that were the budget received sufficiently well, he could opt for an early election.  However, the reality of the budget is now seeping through and it looks as if now it will be seen in its true light so there will be no early election and the Taoiseach will hold on until the spring or early summer of 1982.  The inflationary effect of this budget will ensure that there will be no improvement in the economy in 1980, which is expected to be a year of zero growth and little in 1981.  As the year progresses we will see a huge number of Supplementary Estimates introduced.  The budget may look fairly hairshirt in regard to public <Col N="1555" /> expenditure, but I cannot see how huge public bodies like CIE can be tied to the same type of financial commitment they had in 1979.  As the increase in the price of petrol and other fuels begin to bite there will be huge increases in prices and huge amounts of additional public expenditure will have to be poured in. There will be a resultant price spiral, inflation and industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>The tax and social welfare benefits appear to be quite generous now but they will not be very generous in six or nine months time when the 75,000 people who are now out of the tax net will find themselves back in because of wage increases which will accompany inflation and price rises.  This budget was referred to by a number of speakers from this side as a rich man's budget, and that is true.  The real benefits accrue to people earning £8,000 a year upwards and the people in the £15,000 to £18,000 bracket will gain as much as £1,500 or £2,000. The single people in the lower tax brackets will not get any benefit eventually from this budget.  Inflation and price increases will overtake their short-term gains within six or nine months. Dissatisfaction will grow during the year when working class people realise that they are the real victims when it comes to price increases and inflation.  That was brought home to me when I read that income tax receipts for 1980 will increase by 33.5 per cent over the 1979 figure. The budget was said to have given enormous tax benefits to our people but the figure I have just given proves that the PAYE sector who campaigned so strongly for concessions will find that the improvements in the tax code they got in the budget will be temporary and will soon be eroded.  They will find that their income tax payments will be on a par with those of recent years.  They will not benefit in the long term.</P>
    <P>I do not know the long-term policy of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance&mdash;I refer to the Taoiseach because it is primarily his budget&mdash;but it appears that he is hoping for a bonanza of some kind whether it is in the form of an oil gush off the west coast or a <Col N="1556" /> lucrative agreement with the Arab states as a result of recent speeches by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Taoiseach is hoping for a great improvement in our economy but that improvement is not visible in the budget.  The budget is inflationary but is only one of a series of budgets that will be introduced in the coming weeks.  The best thing that can be said about it is that people were conditioned to expect a very harsh budget.  Since Christmas we have had a series of budgets by instalments in the form of increases in CIE fares, ESB charges, the price of bread, flour, milk, coal and bottled gas and we will hear shortly of increases in postal and telephone charges.  Those increases point to a huge rise in the cost of living.  The budget may not have been as severe as people expected because the increases were phased over a number of months.</P>
    <P>The budget may appear to have favoured the majority of our people but it hit an important sector of our community very hard, the farming community. It had a devastating effect on them and their reaction was predictable. I am not a farmer&mdash;I am a school teacher by profession&mdash;but I come from a rural constituency and I am aware of the problems of the farming community. If one is to be fair and broadminded one must take everybody's position into consideration but the budget added more tax on the farming community.  That decision does not stand up to good reason. Last year was the worst experienced by the farming community since the Economic War and the outlook for this year is not much better and for that reason it is hard to understand why the Taoiseach imposed an extra tax burden on farmers.  He should have shown greater understanding.  We are all aware that the 2 per cent levy last year had a great deal to do with the setback in agricultural growth.  It was also responsible for a lack of confidence in the agricultural sector and led to a reduction in investment and a fall in prices.  Farmers have not recovered from that.  I would have thought the prime object of the budget would be to see to it that our main industry was put back on a proper <Col N="1557" /> footing but the severe taxation is to continue. We expected that the notional system of taxation would be abolished sooner or later.  We introduced it in 1973-74 and it was retained up to 1977. In their election manifesto in that year Fianna Fáil promised to retain it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years referred to the next three years in connection with the reduction of the threshold for farmer taxation.  The notional system was of immense benefit to developing farmers, particularly those involved in milk production, the area where there has been great prosperity in recent years.  It was a retrograde step to remove that notional system because it will lead to a cutback in investment.  In County Waterford, the most advanced milk producing area in the country, it is common to hear of farmers getting out of milk production or cutting back on the number of cows they keep.  The accounts system is reasonable.  It will involve a lot of bookwork for those who are not accustomed to that but it is fair in that people will be taxed on their profits.  The restriction on depreciation allowances announced in the budget are not acceptable because they are not comparable to the allowances granted to private industry. Taxation on accounts gives the notion of equity in that a farmer will pay tax on the clear profit he makes.  The 2 per cent levy or the resource tax do not give the idea of equity.  The resource tax of 3½ per cent in not related to a person's ability to pay; it is a fixed tax comparable with the 2 per cent levy which does not take into consideration whether a farmer is making a profit or loss.  A taxation system should be based on extracting money from those who make <Col N="1558" /> handsome profits.  For that reason it is apt to describe the resource tax as penal. The Taoiseach yesterday acknowledged that the decision to introduce it was inconsiderate.</P>
      <P>There is a climb down on this issue. We are told that it is only a temporary measure pending the outcome of the committee to be set up to investigate the taxation system.  But on budget day the Minister for Finance failed to mention that the measure was temporary. Therefore, one can only ask what has happened in the mean time to bring about the change.  Has it resulted from the very strong reaction generally and in particular from the Opposition to the proposal?  The measure is one that should never have been introduced, just as the 2 per cent levy on farm products never should have been introduced. When we should be planning to abolish rates as a form of taxation the Taoiseach lays the blame for such forms of taxation at the feet of the leaders of the farming organisations on the basis of their not being able to reach agreement on a tax system.  One would have thought that the task of formulation a just tax system rested primarily with the Government, that they should devise a proper system so that account would be taken of a person's ability to pay and that he would be taxed on the basis of the profit, if any, he was making.  Last year was very bad for farmers.  When they suffered a 4 per cent drop in their real incomes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any system is bound to lead to resentment among some people who may consider themselves to be getting a raw deal compared with other workers within the same system.  It has been obvious for many years that the premise on which taxation is based here is antiquated.  Is it not time, then, that the situation was rectified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> In this regard I would take to task the leaders of the farming organisations for their failure to come to grips with the problem of revising land valuations.  In some cases valuations on land are in excess of £1 per acre while in other cases valuations are as low as £5 for 100 acres.  In recent years reclamation of what was considered previously to be unmanagable land has become a widespread practice with the result that there are vast tracts of land now which, though very lowly rated, are much more productive than land which is rated very highly.  The time has come for a reassessment of land valuation.  I am aware that an Foras Talúntais have the facilities necessary to undertake an assessment of the quality of land and that within a limited number of years they could, if given the task, assess the entire amount of agricultural land in the country.  Of course, they would need extra staff for this work, but there can never be equity in relation to the taxation of farmers until that job has been done.</P>
    <P>Naturally, people with large tracts of land that are valued lowly will have a grievance if that land is to be assessed at a much higher valuation, but this must be done because the present situation cannot be tolerated any longer.  I suspect that the farm leaders are afraid to tackle this problem lest there be a backlash from people whose valuations are fixed at unrealistically low levels.  But in the interest of honesty all concerned must agree with the necessity for changes in valuations.</P>
    <P>The big fear is that the low valuations may be raised but that the high valuations will not be reduced.  I would suggest that this problem be overcome by the overall valuation of land in the country not being changed.  This would go a long way to convincing the people concerned that they had nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the limit for taxation from £50 to £40 was expected.  Some concessions had been given in this regard.  The compensations are to be welcomed, but something I do not welcome is the elimination of the agricultural grant in this area.  This grant <Col N="1560" /> has been eliminated in respect of valuations ranging from £60 to £40.  This means that for farmers within that range there will be a doubling at least of their rates bills for 1980, a fact that has not been publicised very much and which seems to have escaped the notice of many public representatives.  Indeed, the majority of the farmers involved would seem not to have realised what this change means for them.  In effect, the change will mean that people who have been paying, say, £200 or £300 in rates annually will now have to pay £500 or as much as £700.  Together with taxation this will represent a considerable penalty for those affected, especially having regard to the collapse of the cattle trade and to the very poor harvest of last year.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the budget may be regarded as very unfortunate in respect of the imposition of extra taxes on farmers.  This situation will affect not only the farming community but the community as a whole.  It is not always appreciated by other sectors of the community that their prosperity and standard of living is dependent largely on the success or otherwise of agricultural productivity.  Very often there can be a good deal of vindictiveness towards farmers. This has been illustrated in the comments we have had from some politicians who have indicated their desire that farmers be taxed to the hilt.  People in the various sectors are all seeking equity in taxation matters, but very often on the question of taxing farmers they are prepared to deny fair play.  The attitude that farmers could not be taxed sufficiently is both uncharitable and unfair. Most likely the problem arises from the fact that farmers were not taxed until 1973 although they paid rates and other forms of taxes indirectly.  Taxation measures should have been planned in a more ordered manner.  We should not have the sort of change in types of taxation we are enduring.  The uncertainty of the future with regard to taxation must be doing a great deal of damage to the agricultural industry.  It is long overdue that we should have a fixed system based on the real valuation of land and not based on the Griffiths recommendations <Col N="1561" /> which came into effect in the middle of the last century and which are no longer a true criterion of land potential.</P>
    <P>Under this budget the social welfare increases have been generous and look like keeping ahead of inflation and price increases for 1980.  This is to be welcomed.  Those of us who are regarded as constituency politicians know the hardships endured by old age pensioners, by people living on unemployment benefit, widows' pensions and do on. Nobody could but welcome any increase in these areas and these people got a reasonable increase in this budget.</P>
    <P>Members of Fianna Fáil are unfair when they say the Coalition did not look after social welfare recipients.  The Coalition extended the range of social welfare benefits by reducing the qualifying age for the old age pension from 70 to 66 years, by bringing in benefits for single women over 58 years, for handicapped children, for prisoners' dependants, for unmarried mothers and so on.  During the past two-and-a-half years we have not seen an extension of any benefits. We have nothing to be ashamed of.  Our social welfare record was extremely good and was appreciated by the public at large.</P>
    <P>I come from a coastal constituency.  I was sorry not to be in the House when the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry made his speech but I read reports of what he said.  He gave the impression that everything about fisheries and forestry is fine.  That is not the case and I do not believe this budget improves that situation.</P>
    <P>In the 1977 manifesto we were told Fianna Fáil would improve matters tremendously, particularly in regard to employment in the fishing industry, and that processing facilities would be increased. That has not been the case.  In the last two-and-a-half years there has been stagnation in the output of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I will not refer to the 50-mile limit.  We will leave that to another debate but I want to put on record that our fishermen cannot get a fair return for their catches. <Col N="1562" /> It is a scandalous state of affairs that every day for weeks and months past we have been reading in our national newspapers about large quantities of fish, some of it prime fish, being dumped. Our fishermen get paid under the intervention agreement for such dumping but is it not a retrograde step that this dumping is taking place while millions of people all over the world are starving?</P>
    <P>I noticed in the budget statement that capital investment for 1980 by Bord Iascaigh Mhara is being cut back from £6 million to £5 million.  Surely that is an indictment of a Government who promised expansion, not just of the fishing fleet but of the number of jobs available in the fishing industry.  What a situation to arise in an industry which is ripe for vast expansion and development when catches have to be dumped and when restrictions are being imposed on our fishermen to such a degree that many of them have to abandon fishing as a livelihood.</P>
    <P>In the budget, excise duties were imposed on the fuel oil fishermen use.  In other words, their overheads are increasing while the value of their catches is being reduced.  This is primarily due to the fact that the EEC members are allowing the importation of vast quantities of fish from third countries, in particular Canada, Norway and Iceland, without any regard to the livelihood of the Irish fishermen.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry should urgently raise this matter in Brussels.  It is a serious blot on us as a nation that we have to destroy good sea food and that we are endangering the livelihood of our fishermen because third country imports are allowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry referred to the Forestry Division of his Department.  He gave the <Col N="1563" /> impression that everything in the garden is rosy, that output is excellent and that the future is bright.  That is at variance with the facts.  Two years ago we had four timber processing plants but in the past 15 months two of them have been closed.  People engaged in the timber business tell me that a large amount of growing forests are rotting in the ground because of lack of facilities to process the timber.  Forests are not being used or developed and their growth is being stunted. Jobs are being lost in industry as a result.  The closure of the Athy plant should not have been allowed especially when we had a surplus of growing timber. Seemingly no action is being taken and I hope for a statement from the Minister about future plans.</P>
      <P>It may seem like a small item, but I welcome one provision in the budget conveyed to us by the statement of the Minister for Finance that he will intensify the campaign against tax dodgers. He was quite vehement about that and said he would increase the number of staff involved in these investigations so that tax dodgers can be brought to court. This intensification of the campaign against tax evaders is badly needed.  A lot of dissatisfaction among heavily taxed people arises from seeing people getting away scot-free.  Many of them are in the self-employed sector and any action taken against them will be supported fully by this side.</P>
      <P>Also welcomed by us is the reduction of 50 per cent in the amount allowed for entertainment.  This allowance may have helped people in their business discussions and in their pursuit of orders, especially from foreign industrialists, but it has given rise to a feeling of inequity among the PAYE sector who have no allowance when it comes to entertainment. I have no doubt that that concession was being abused and there is no great case for retaining it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry who referred to tourism and the effect on it of the increased price of petrol.  He said that the 20p extra will not affect tourism in 1980. I would debate that.  I feel the increases <Col N="1564" /> in the prices of petrol, drink and cigarettes must give rise to doubts as to the level of tourism this year.  It is bound to have an effect particularly on would-be visitors from Britain where the prices of these commodities are not so high.</P>
    <P>One cannot complain too much about the increased prices of drink and cigarettes because, as the Minister pointed out, these increases will have a twofold effect: they will bring in increased revenue and reduce consumption. However, the increased price of petrol will have a widespread effect and it is bound to give rise to a big increase in prices and consequently in inflation. Apart from that, I question whether it was prudent to impose such an increase following so closely the increase of 11p a gallon on petrol making an aggregate increase of 33p a gallon in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The increased price of petrol will particularly affect the many areas in the country not served by public transport. This has been a cause of great concern. Overall, it will increase inflation in the next 12 months and I have no doubt that the wage demands will be very large.  I do not envy the Minister for Labour in his efforts to control industrial unrest in the coming months because with rampant inflation there are bound to be huge demands for wage increases.  I hope such a situation will not arise but it is very much on the cards.</P>
    <P>Deputies who were also members of local authorities have had reason for concern in recent months because of the 10 per cent ceiling imposed on the amount by which the rates can be increased. Senior local authority officials have been pointing out that this 10 per cent limit will mean reduced employment. In Waterford County Council we have been told by the manager that there must be lay-offs in coming weeks because finances from the Central Fund will not be sufficient to enable the retention of the present level of employment. More unemployment has been predicted by many other local authorities and there is a danger that the livelihoods of tens of thousands will be in jeopardy.  If local authorities underestimate at the <Col N="1565" /> beginning of the year they have not the right, as the Government have, to come back with supplementary estimates later in the year and, of course, the laying off of workers is the only option open to them.</P>
    <P>This also means cutting back services. We know there will be a vast reduction in the number of houses being built. Already the number has come down from 25,000 per year during the Coalition period to 16,000.  Water and sewerage schemes are not being sanctioned at the same rate and we have seen from the Book of Estimates that there has been a massive reduction in the amount of money being made available for local improvements schemes.  That is false economy because, when it comes to repairing roads or houses, a few pounds spent prudently now and again is much better economics than the eventual expenditure of thousands of pounds on the same job.  In the case of house repairs a coat of paint on a door or window frame fairly regularly might maintain its condition whereas if left unattended, it will need to be replaced within a few years. That is the type of false economy that will be practised by local authorities this year, whether it be in regard to roads, house repairs, water schemes or anything else.  Eventually we may have to pay much larger sums of money to maintain these services.</P>
    <P>The budget makes provision for the same subvention &mdash;£56 million&mdash;to CIE for 1980 as for 1979.  It is difficult to see how CIE will be able to operate at the same level if their subvention is not increased. Obviously there will be further wage demands made by their employees as a result of the inflationary aspect of this budget, when £56 million will not meet their requirements.  I should like to know why their subvention was struck at this level, not that we like to see CIE having to be backed to such a degree, but that is a story for some other debate. I can foresee the Book of Estimates, as presented to us, having to be altered considerably as the year progresses, when, in all probability, the £56 million will <Col N="1566" /> have to be increased to £70 million or even more.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs indicates that the loss in that Department for 1980 will be of the order of £9 million, taking into account the increased charges in the postal services to be introduced on 1 April and in the telecommunications sector from 1 July, which are expected to yield an extra £17 million.  Going on the figure for 1979, when there was a loss of £29 million, I find it difficult to foresee that losses in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could be restricted to £9 million in 1980, even taking into consideration the extra revenue from increased charges.  The 1978 figure was probably a more realistic one, in that the 1979 figure was clouded by the fact that there were very lengthy industrial disputes within the Department with a consequent loss of revenue.  If we revert to 1978, which was a more regular year, we see that the loss incurred was of the order of £19 million.  I foresee the 1980 figure being somewhat similar.  Indeed, it would be more realistic to budget for such a figure.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the state of our telecommunications system.  I am glad the Government have committed themselves to an expenditure of £650 million over the next five-years on improving the present system which has been classified as the worst in Europe.  It is quite easy to believe that.  I remember Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, when Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, being chided repeatedly in this House on the poor state of our telecommunications. But things have not improved since this Government came to office; if anything they have deteriorated.  When we Deputies write to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on behalf of a constituent it is common to be told that delays of five years or more will have to be endured by people who have applied for telephone installation.  What worries me more even than individual applications for telephone installation is the time lag involved in the provision of telephone facilities for industry, especially new industry. <Col N="1567" /> As spokesman for the telecommunications area over the past six months I have had dozens of complaints and representations from industry throughout the country and, strangely enough, even in Dublin itself and particularly in the new industrial estates on the outskirts of this city, where industrialists cannot get a telephone installed. When they were originally allocated these factory sites promises were made that telephones would be available once the premises were occupied. But that has not been the case.  I have had to submit a number of questions here with regard to industrialists who have been awaiting telephone installation for up to two years.  Surely this is a most serious indictment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and of the Government.  In this regard I should have thought that industry would have been given priority.</P>
    <P>I know there has been an increased capital allocation in the budget to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. But it is commonplace to be told by the engineering staff of the Department that they have not got the money with which to buy the simplest and most basic pieces of apparatus&mdash;such as the telephone instrument itself, cable, wiring and other elementary pieces of equipment. I would like to see some tangible evidence of money being voted in this budget with regard to the provision of this basic equipment.  On this subject I might mention that there are thousands of vandalised telephone kiosks around the country where the equipment is not being restored because it is not available. That is difficult to believe but it is a fact and it is the standard reply one receives when one writes to the Department complaining about the delay in carrying out such repairs.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a major effort being made in the coming year&mdash;rather than having to wait the full five years&mdash;to improve the situation to a tolerable level.  We do not expect anything fantastic but we should like to see a reasonable effort being made to rectify the present position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> This is a budget which Government members have said creates difficulty for the Opposition because they are unable to find any points to criticise.  I daresay one could spend many hours criticising its defects.  Primarily it will lead to a vast increase in inflation.  Deputy FitzGerald, our Leader, said inflation would be in the region of 20 per cent to 22 per cent.  Indeed, that figure may even be conservative; time will tell whether or not he is correct.  Futher, I foresee an increase in the level of unemployment.  In that regard the Minister for Labour might spell out what he intends doing to replace the employment maintenance scheme which is to be abolished on 31 March.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this budget which has had widespread acceptance.  The philosophy behind this budget, as with the two previous budgets since Fianna Fáil returned to office, has been to promote employment and create favourable conditions for the development of the industrial sectors which were harassed and neglected under the Coalition <Col N="1570" /> Government.  There is no doubt that the restoration of confidence in the economy and the return of people to work rather than to the dole queues has become a practical reality in the two-and-a-half years since Fianna Fáil went back to office.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems facing industry today is a shortage of skilled personnel. That shortage did not exist in 1977 when we took office.  In fact the opposite applied.  We have continually moved to restore confidence in the economy, in industry, in our young people and in the unemployed who fell victim to those disastrous Coalition years.</P>
    <P>This Government are determined to protect our economy from the worst effects of the present recession and the inflationary economic climate.  We recognise that 1980 and the next few years will not be easy but if we cooperate as a nation we can survive.  With our young population and our dynamic industrial sector we can continue to keep up our industrial development momentum. The changes in the taxation system in the budget are designed to help this objective.  They take away the disincentive to work and restore the power of the wage and salary earner over his own income. People now have the choice of how and what they spend their incomes on.  That is a very important step forward in our society.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said on numerous occasions since my colleague introduced this budget last Wednesday that the tax concessions were far more generous than was expected.  We have seen demands for high wage increases over the last number of years but, oftentimes, the problem was related to net take home pay.  That is what matters most to any worker.  The incentive to work is there, the restoration of power to the wage or salary earner over his own income.  This budget put £227 million more into the hands of taxpayers to spend as they like. Now the more workers earn the more they will have to spend at their discretion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to inflation and offered lip sympathy to the Minister <Col N="1571" /> for Labour because of the industrial relations problems that would be created because of the budget.  What I have just said&mdash;the Government's concern for real take home pay, the net package that goes into the home&mdash;was expressed in the budget, appreciating the concern of people regarding the amount of money they paid in tax.  This will be a valuable contribution not only in material terms but as an indication of the commitment of a concerned Government.</P>
    <P>Governments formed from this party have always looked to and cared for the less fortunate, the less well off in our society.  Year after year we have increased social welfare for those on low incomes and those who need and deserve the caring protection of our society.  The all round increases of 25 per cent in long-term and 20 per cent in short-term benefits is a major improvement for these people.  Many were surprised at the size of the increases which again indicate the concern of the Government for that section of society.  Even when times are hard we have responded to our special responsibilities in this area and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Not only that but also in the taxation changes we have given special consideration to this sector of our community.  We have removed 83,000 taxpayers on low incomes and the old from the tax net altogether.  We have brought 280,000 taxpayers into lower tax bands.  Almost all taxpayers will now pay none or substantially less tax than they did before this budget.  Any tax reform which can achieve this is clearly a demonstration of a Government which cares for the future and for our old, our young workers and our unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that employment will remain a priority.  In 1979 it is estimated that employment rose by at least 15,000 over 1978 figures.  This is a remarkable achievement and came close to the record 17,000 employment increase in 1978. Almost all industrial sectors increased their job creation with the most significant increases in the engineering and chemical sectors.  Employment in the <Col N="1572" /> building and construction industry also continued to rise last year reflecting a high level of activity in that sector.</P>
    <P>Last year redundancies notified to my Department were considerably down on previous years at 7,650.  This compares with 9,867 in 1978.  Let me quote another figure for the record: it also compares, referring to the Coalition years, with a figure of 19,000 in 1975.  It is almost down to one-third of what it was in those disastrous years.</P>
    <P>A further indication of the improving employment situation during 1979 can be got from the 50,444 vacancies notified to the National Manpower Service during the year.  The NMS filled 30,700 vacancies during the year, again a record.  These figures are as a result of the Government's commitment to the service and in fact I increased the number of placement officers by 100 per cent between 1978 and 1979.  We now have 113 officers working in the field and at the moment competitions are being held to increase this number further.</P>
    <P>The number of offices in now 37.  This increased staffing level and geographical spread of offices has enabled the service to move towards fulfilling effectively the original role assigned to it and to meet its additional workload generated by the Government's various job creation programmes.  With a view to increasing the effectiveness of the service still further and making it more accessible to both job-seekers and employers I intend to open a number of new permanent offices this year.</P>
    <P>The provision of careers guidance for job seekers is an important function of any manpower service.  In addition to basic guidance provided by placement officers, trained guidance officers provide specialist guidance to people who need further assistance.  I have also made provision for an expansion of this role of the Manpower Service and a number of placement officers are attending training courses at present with a view to qualifying as occupational guidance officers.  This is an important aspect, not only presently, of manpower <Col N="1573" /> policy but indeed the most important policy for its future development.</P>
    <P>I have described the expansion of the service in terms of staff numbers and so on.  The year 1980 will see an important addition to the range of services provided by the Government to employers. What I have in mind is the establishment of a National Hire Agency which will specialise in the filling of temporary vacancies of employers.  I have had consultations with both sides of industry and shall be having further consultations with them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of work undertaken by the NMS in the past year was the 1978 school leavers survey which, when compared with similar surveys in 1976 and 1977, shows that the opportunities for young people have substantially improved, which reinforces the view of an expanding economy with an increasing capacity to absorb new entrants into the work force.  Sixty-seven per cent of those who left second-level education in 1978 found jobs, or had entered into apprenticeships, while 21 per cent went on to full-time education.  Only 3.6 per cent were available for employment at the time of the survey.  The corresponding survey for 1977 showed 7.3 per cent unemployed, double the figure.</P>
    <P>During 1979 we spent over £10 million on special schemes to provide employment opportunities for young people.  Over 11,000 school leavers and young people under 25 years participated in the schemes during the year. Some Deputies have suggested that there is a reduced financial allocation for these schemes for 1980.  In fact, when account is taken of the amounts allocated to the relevant Departments concerned and the amounts allocated by the tripartite standing committee on employment out of the employment guarantee fund under the national understanding for a number of these schemes, the total funds available for expenditure on youth employment schemes in 1980 will be similar to last year's provisions.  I shall come back later to where other money comes from.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> School leavers' unemployment is no longer the problem it was in 1977, but is certainly an area for concern in our growing population.  The employment prospects of our young people have been improving progressively over that period of two-and-a-half years or so.  Furthermore, of every £100 we spent on youth employment schemes, we now receive £55 from the European Social Fund as a result of a Council decision of November 1978.  So there is no cutback in real terms for these schemes.  I have had a very deep personal interest in that European assistance from my very first meeting of Council of Ministers, somewhere back in the second half of 1977.  From that meeting forward, I pushed that idea very hard and was very pleased when we did eventually get recognition of the need for such a scheme at the November 1978 Council of Ministers meeting.  The result is that now, for the entire duration of this year, such assistance will be available to us on a matching basis.  That 55 per cent means that, in real terms, we have adequate funds available for these schemes.</P>
    <P>I want particularly to mention the work experience programme which has been in operation now for over one year. The programme, Deputies will remember, commenced in the middle of September 1978 and up to the end of December 1979 about 6,700 young people were involved in it.  Under this programme young people who have left the educational system and who have not yet got their first job are placed by the National Manpower Service with employers in both the private and public sectors, to get first-hand experience of a range of different jobs.</P>
    <P>Each placement lasts for six months and during this time the young person receives an allowance of £20 per week.  It is obvious that the programme can help young people to make much more informed career decisions and, at the same time, improve their employment prospects because of the experience gained.  It also helps the employer involved, in that it gives him an opportunity at no cost to his firm to assess at <Col N="1575" /> first hand the potential of young unemployed job seekers.  This is the important message from that programme.</P>
    <P>More than 80 per cent of the participants in the programme secured permanent employment.  Of these, about half found employment with the employer who provided the initial work experience. This is an indication of, and a great tribute to, the success of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention two other employment schemes administered by my Department.  One is the employment maintenance scheme to which Deputy Deasy referred.  I did say that he had, in the part of his contribution which I heard, little criticism of the budget.  He was complimentary on a number of occasions and any criticisms which he had referred to specific areas of operation of Government services.  He went to some pains to explain problems existing in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Certain decisions have been taken by us in the Government and finances have been made available.  To my able colleague who is better equipped than I, and who obviously will be coming before the House on this budget, I shall leave the opportunity of replying to the criticisms offered.  Deputy Deasy is a sound, sensible Member of the House and in referring to the man who was in office prior to 1977 he would realise that if there were problems they did not happen overnight and that if that particular gentleman, in his role then as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, had perhaps given more attention to that particular Department than to other areas which were of more interest to him, many of the problems existing might not be there now.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the employment maintenance scheme.  For the past two years the textile, clothing and footwear&mdash;including the tanning&mdash;industries have received a subsidy, the equivalent of £5 per worker per week under the employment maintenance scheme.  This scheme was introduced early in 1978 in response to the employers and trade unions concern for action to protect these industries from the <Col N="1576" /> consequences of the British temporary employment subsidy.  This is something I want to stitch in here for the Opposition people who are now shedding crocodile tears&mdash;to protect these industries from the consequences of the British temporary employment subsidy which had been operating from August 1975.  Every Member of this House knows what trauma and difficulty the footwear, textile and clothing industries went through in those middle seventies when the Coalition Government were under pressure to introduce a subsidy of this nature and did not do it.  I referred earlier to the 19,000 redundancies in 1975.  Many of us had experience of close friends and constituents of ours losing their jobs in those industries.  It is not only mischievous but untrue for Deputy Deasy even to suggest that the decision last week by the board of Seafield Gentex had any relation whatsoever to the employment maintenance scheme ending on 31 March.  I have more to say about that.</P>
    <P>As I say, the problems in the textile industry went back long before that and were recognised by the then British Government in 1975 when they introduced their temporary employment subsidy which continued without any assistance to the Irish industry until Fianna Fáil's return to office.  Our scheme which was a temporary measure introduced in our first budget in 1978, to end when the British scheme ended, was approved&mdash;indeed, after a lot of pressure from this Government&mdash;by the EEC Commission in July 1978 for the year ending March 1979.  The scheme, somewhat modified, was again reluctantly&mdash;and I emphasise reluctantly&mdash;accepted by the EEC for the year ending 31 March 1980.  Three hundred and seventy firms involving 30,000 workers have benefited under the scheme, with total cumulative payments of over £12 million up to the end of 1979, of which £7 million was paid in that year.  A provision of £3.5 million has been made in my Department's Vote to cover payments arising under the scheme during the period from 1 January to 31 March. Reference has been made by some Deputies to the fact that the scheme has <Col N="1577" /> been terminated but the fact is&mdash;and I want to spell this out clearly&mdash;that since payments under the British scheme will cease entirely at the end of March 1980 under pressure from the Commission and other member countries, the Commission were firm on any attempt at a further extension of the Irish scheme beyond that date.  In the circumstances, the Government are precluded from providing those funds to enable the scheme to continue under EEC regulations.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, however, that an interdepartmental group representative of my own Department of Labour, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Department of Finance are examining urgently the possible measures to assist the textile, clothing and footwear industries when the present scheme ends at the end of the month.  We are concerned about it.  We are aware of the problem.  We showed our concern and awareness of that problem in 1978 although the problem had been there from 1975 and had been ignored completely by the then Government and by the people now making noises about it. Both industry and the workers are aware of that too and this crocodile weeping will not have any political benefit for them at this stage.</P>
    <P>As an inducement to employers to take on additional unemployed workers my Department have been administering the employment incentive scheme during the past two years.  The scheme provides for the payment of a premium of £20 per week, or £14 for school leavers for each additional worker recruited by employers in the manufacturing, agricultural, services, hotel and catering and construction industries.  Since the scheme started in 1977 almost £10 million has been paid to 3,438 employers in respect of 20,516 additional persons recruited.</P>
    <P>This scheme is being continued in 1980 and sums of £4.11 million have been provided in my Department's Vote, compared with £4 million in 1979.  It is significant that this scheme also qualifies <Col N="1578" /> for social fund aid for those under 25 years, the same as the youth scheme.  A portion of that is helped, funded or assisted on a 55 per cent basis for the young people covered by that scheme from the European fund.  In addition, a further sum of £2 million has been allocated from the Employment Guarantee Fund in order to provide a supplementary premium of £10 per week for all eligible employees recruited during the first six months of this year, and a further £10 per week in the case of each such employee who had been on the live register for at least six months.  This means that the total premium payable during those six months will be £24 for school leavers, £30 for other eligible employees and £34 and £40 in the case of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>As a further inducement to employers to increase their work force the Government have decided to extend into 1980 the special incentive scheme whereby manufacturers showing certain improvements in employment and output will benefit from a special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure but I would not argue about that.  It is not important.  While on the subject of manpower policy and employment I would like to mention the work of the Manpower Consultative Committee and to commend them for this work.  During the past year they examined the important areas of attitudes towards work in industry and youth employment, and the serious problem of skill shortages in the labour market.</P>
      <P>The problem of occupational shortages emerged in late 1978.  As I said earlier, what better demonstration of the change of pattern that has taken place between 1977 when the Coalition were there and now?  The shortages continued throughout 1979 and the committee assessed the extent of shortages and secured the commitment of the various organisations in combating the problem.  In particular I would like to mention the response of the education sector who within a matter of months implemented proposals to provide new educational opportunities for well over 1,000 students in new and existing courses leading to qualifications in the short supply occupations.  The first results of this measure will be forthcoming during the summer months when some 350 students who took up these opportunities in the autumn of 1979 will become qualified and available for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other measures were also adopted.  In the case of craft occupations, concerted efforts are being made to raise apprentice recruitment in the public and private sectors.  To this end special incentives are being made available by AnCo to employers who recruit and train apprentices over and above their own needs.  Last year's recruitment campaign undertaken by the Manpower Service in the UK was, of course, initiated by the committee. To date 134 workers in occupations <Col N="1580" /> of short supply have returned, and this means that one out of six vacancies in those key occupations identified in a lead up to the campaign has been filled.  The committee regard the campaign as a success.  Much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies also that the problems of shortages of highly-qualified skilled and semi-skilled manpower spring from the success of our industrial and employment policy.  They are the problems of success, of a rapidly expanding economy, of a return of confidence and of positive policies over the past two years.  The scene was so different in that first part of 1977.  It was not a question of skilled shortages and I am sure that all Deputies in this House who are honest will admit that their clinics at the weekend were haunted by people of all ages seeking employment. My experience at present as a constituency worker in Cork is the direct opposite. Rather than people coming to you seeking employment you now have the employers coming to you asking if you would have any people available who would suit their needs.  This is a firm indication of the change that has taken place.</P>
    <P>The Manpower committee have also considered a number of initiatives that could be taken to improve attitudes towards work in industry.  These initiatives are influenced by the fact that as we enter the eighties our industrial sector is growing at a rate faster than ever before in terms of production, exports, job creation and investment.  As an indication of this growth the IDA plan to continue their promotion of 30,000 new industrial job approvals in Irish and overseas industries this year and annually up to 1982.</P>
    <P>The message is clear.  Future jobs will arise mainly in industry and to avail of these opportunities our young people and their parents and teachers must be informed about the advantages of employment in modern industry.  There is, of course, also the need for industry to sell itself to potential employees as part of its contribution to future development of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> As part of the contribution to the future development of the economy, the Manpower Consultative Committee have prepared a set of forecasts for the various key occupations in short supply. These forecasts underline the continuing need for increasing the supply of key personnel, such as mechanical, electrical and electronic engineers, electronic technicians, toolmakers and fitters. While the economic out-turn for 1979 was less favourable than was anticipated in the early part of last year, the future outlook for those with these qualifications is excellent.</P>
    <P>Despite the possibility of future increases in the price of oil and other developments the employment implications of which are not at this stage completely clear, we still have every reason to expect to achieve substantial increases in manufacturing output and employment. The employment predictions for this sector which formed the basis for our occupational forecasts remain unchanged with the IDA having achieved or surpassed their job-approval targets in both 1978 and 1979.  As the growth of manufacturing, particularly in engineering and electronics, was a major cause of the expected growth of demand in the occupations concerned, I do not expect any decline in the growth of demand for these occupations.</P>
    <P>Technological change is creating an increased demand for a more skilled work force.  It is essential, therefore, that more young people at all educational levels give serious consideration to industrial employment as a career.  The Manpower Consultative Committee have been considering this matter and have identified lack of information on career opportunities in industry as one of the main reasons for the negative attitudes to industrial employment that exist among many people including pupils, teachers and parents.</P>
    <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee also recommended the setting up of a schools industry link scheme to bring industry and schools closer together at local level.  In co-operation with the <Col N="1582" /> Minister for Education I have made a start on a pilot basis with such a scheme in Athlone.  Not only are the initial results encouraging but the comments of people in the area are that it is a tremendous step forward because it gives an opportunity to the people in education and in both sides of industry, management and unions, to the manpower placement people and to the community to know what opportunities are available and what education facilities should be availed of.  It is the development of career possibilities in the community and that is very important.  The first pilot scheme started in Athlone and the second one will be starting shortly in Finglas, and there will be extensions from there.  I have been told that the scheme in Athlone has been very useful and that the community have responded well.  There are certain developments that help, for example the programme by the NCEA last year, when they launched in booklet form a whole comprehensive list of courses available in the various regional technical colleges.  A greater public awareness is needed on the choice of courses and how they are related to industry.  This is basically the aim of this scheme.  Training will be an important aspect of this new approach towards industry, therefore I am glad to tell the House that the 1980 current Exchequer grant to AnCO amounts to £16.8 million.  This is an increase of £3.4 million or 25 per cent on last year's allocation.  This illustrates a concerned Government committed to the training of young people for future needs and to the retraining of people who have been unlucky enough to lose employment.</P>
    <P>The substantially increased financial allocation to AnCO this year will allow them maintain their level of performance and, where necessary, improve on it.  The Government recognise the fundamental importance of having a highly trained and adaptable work force and of ensuring that the authority charged with the provision of industrial training at all levels are sensitive to, and are responding to the fundamental requirement of continually reviewing the relevance of their training programmes <Col N="1583" /> to the requirements of industry in an age of rapid technological change.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied with the placement rate of trainees immediately on course completion.  One hundred per cent of first year off-the-job apprentices were immediately placed on completion of that aspect of their course, while the figure for immediate adult placement was in the region of 75 per cent.  These figures are proof of the central relevance of AnCO in our modern industrial context. The substantial Exchequer grant for industrial training, which will allow for a total income to the organisation, because of the EEC contribution, in excess of £30 million in 1980, is indicative of Government resolve to ensure the availability of a highly trained, adaptable and efficient work force.  This will facilitate continued industrial expansion and the consequent increase in job opportunities.</P>
    <P>This year's capital grant to AnCO amounting to £5 million is also an increase of 25 per cent on last year's figure.  This increase will allow AnCO to proceed with their plans to build new training centres at Cork and Finglas and for substantial extensions to existing centres at Tallaght, Ballyfermot and Tralee. In addition to the employment which AnCO's capital development programmes in 1980 will generate in the services and construction industries, the additional training places provided will, when available, allow for a greater annual trainee throughput.  So, the objective of having industrial training facilities available which will allow for training and retraining of up to 1 per cent of the national work force at any given time, is now very much in prospect.</P>
    <P>If I may turn to another aspect of training for which I am responsible, 1979 saw a breakthrough for the hotel and catering industries in their efforts to attract young people to follow careers in that sector.  For several years the recruitment targets set by CERT were not achieved.  Last year, however, the number of young people recruited for training showed an increase of 40 per cent. This development reflects a growing <Col N="1584" /> awareness among the younger population of the opportunities now and which will increasingly offer in the future rewarding and satisfying careers.  I commend CERT on their progress.  By 1983 almost 3,000 new jobs will have been created in this very important industry. That emphasises the importance of training here.  Last year over 2,000 workers were trained by CERT in employments relevant to the hotel, catering and tourism sectors on 137 in-service courses.</P>
    <P>Last year also, finance was made available to CERT to enable them to convert their premises at Roebuck into a training centre.  The centre is now capable of training 200 persons per year. This year the concentration will be on the unemployed who will be trained in skills which will allow them to fill existing vacancies in the hotel and catering sectors.  The centre will also provide for those already employed in the industry but who require further training.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year CERT produced a plan which detailed their priorities and objectives over the next three years.  The overall aim of the plan is to provide a better service to the industries, to ensure that better training and operational standards prevail.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the importance of this vital economic sector to our national well-being.  The health of the hotel and catering sector is reflected to a large degree in the buoyancy of the tourism revenue&mdash;a primary source of foreign exchange income.  We have, therefore, given a very substantial increase in the Exchequer allocation to CERT for 1980 on that afforded in 1979, which showed a very large increase on previous years.</P>
    <P>When appointing the new Government the Taoiseach assigned to me the extra responsibility of the Department for the Public Service.  The two Departments of Labour and the Public Service cover broadly similar areas of responsibility in manpower policy such as recruitment and placement, training and industrial relations.  Because these are key activities for our social, industrial <Col N="1585" /> and economic development in the years ahead, it is important that we develop the right approach, the right policies for the future.</P>
    <P>Because of the sharp deterioration in the international economic climate and increasing economic difficulties at home, the period ahead will call for restraint on incomes.  I should like to emphasise that the Government are sympathetic to the concept of a national understanding, on reasonable terms.  We are, however, disappointed at the total level of increases, standard and special, which resulted from the present understanding and at the level of industrial action which continues to arise, despite commitments given in the understanding and the best efforts of responsible trade union leaders.  As the Minister for Finance made clear, any arrangement which might follow the current understanding must have regard to the requirements of the economic situation.</P>
    <P>As far as the public sector is concerned, there is particular ground for worry at the level of special increases which have arisen in the past year or so on top of the standard provisions of the 1978 National Agreement and the National Understanding Pay Agreement and at the increasing proportion of Government expenditure on non-capital supply services going on public service pay and pensions.  It is particularly disturbing that some groups who have already benefited from special increases in the current series are demanding further increases. It is not unreasonable, in the light of the economic situation, of the considerable increases already obtained and of the fundamental adjustment of the PAYE system announced in the budget speech, to ask that these claims be reconsidered by those involved. The budget taxation measures were a major commitment by a concerned Government that workers should have greater control over more of their gross wage packet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald refers to the fact that the Minister for Finance in his budget set aside a sum of £100 million <Col N="1586" /> for possible further increases in pay and pensions in 1980.  While the Deputy acknowledges that this sum would have to cover any special increases as well as any standard general increases in pay that may arise in 1980, he proceeds to calculate the carryover effect and the percentage increase on the basis that the £100 million refers exclusively to a standard general increase from 1 September 1980.  This is misleading and mischievous. Let me explain and put the matter beyond doubt.  This £100 million is the maximum the Minister for Finance could provide for any standard pay increase and for any special pay increases, including arrears, that may arise in 1980 as well as increases in pensions.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that the style of government has changed since July 1977.  What parliamentary secretaries then plucked from the air no longer continues.  We now have a co-operative, well-organised and well managed system of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has had time to make that interjection I am sure he could have found time to give me the information I sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go into <Col N="1587" /> greater detail about this matter on another occasion.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance made clear some major groups have not yet obtained a special increase in the current series.</P>
      <P>In 1979 the total public service pay and pensions bill for these purposes grew by 25 per cent in comparison with 1978. The total budget provision for these purposes in 1980 is 28 per cent up on actual expenditure last year.  By any standard, these increases are very large indeed and are of serious concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>As Minister for the Public Service, I am particularly concerned to see the highest possible levels of efficiency in the public sector and an improvement in the state of industrial relations.  Everybody employed in the public sector are PAYE taxpayers and will, therefore, benefit from the major modification in the system announced by the Minister for Finance.  I trust that will act as an incentive to all public sector employees to work harder and more effectively and to do their utmost to improve the state of industrial relations.  I, for my part, will utilise to the full my dual role as Minister for Labour and for the Public Service to the same end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to turn to our industrial relations problems.  While we have some serious economic problems ahead of us&mdash;not least of which are those caused by the high cost of energy&mdash;they are not insurmountable. By concerned effort we can and will overcome them.  In the present climate we cannot afford ourselves the luxury of frequent confrontations between employers and, equally disruptive, between workers and workers.  It is imperative that employers make every effort to create any environment which will encourage a greater work commitment and which will minimise the risk of industrial strife.  To this end it is essential that the personnel function be put in the hands of trained and skilled practitioners who will have regard to the welfare, the well-being and the aspirations of the workers.  The substantial income tax adjustments made in <Col N="1588" /> the budget will provide an incentive to workers who will, from now on, see tangible improvements in their take home pay.  In other words, increased effort will be reflected in greater financial rewards.  With the full co-operation of workers and management we can make headway towards overcoming the problems facing us and towards maintaining the record of growth of the past two years.</P>
    <P>In recent years the international reputation of Ireland has been enhanced in many facets of our national life.  Let us strive to show that we have attained the maturity to tackle the complex problems of industrial relations sensibly and realistically and so achieve a reputation second to none in that area.  We have the institutions in the Labour Court, its industrial relations service and the rights commissioner service which, if properly and fully utilised, can help to achieve this goal.</P>
    <P>I recently appointed a fourth division of the Labour Court as part of the Government's policy to ensure that the resolution of industrial disputes should not be held up by lack of resources in our dispute-settling machinery.  While the situation will, of course, require to be kept under review, I am satisfied that the court should now be able to discharge its function with a minimum of delay.  The establishment and operation of a rights commissioner service has been an outstanding success story.  There are at present three rights commissioners.  I will keep that under review with a view to appointing more where necessary.  I should like to repeat that if industrial relations services need improvement or the appointment of more people I will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>No matter what efforts are made by the Government to improve the facilities available to assist in the resolution of industrial disputes, it is clear that the main responsibility for the maintenance of industrial peace lies, and will continue to lie, with the people immediately involved in industrial relations at the level of the enterprise, the workers, the trade unions <Col N="1589" /> and the employers.  It is vital for all these people to realise the importance of having comprehensive agreements and welldefined procedures for the regulation of their industrial relations and, above all, of abiding by agreements and procedures.  It is also vital that, failing settlement of disputes at enterprise level, the services provided by the State should be utilised fully.</P>
    <P>I have on previous occasions stressed the importance which I attach to the development of a more participative role for workers in industry.  It is no longer acceptable for managers to ignore the needs and aspirations of their employees at the work place nor is it acceptable that the horizons of the worker should be limited to the specific area of an enterprise in which he or she works.  I would strongly urge that workers be encouraged by management to take a greater interest in the performance of the firms for which they work, and in which they invest so much of themselves, and to be more aware of the effect of their contribution to their firm, their industry and the national economy.  Managers are, I feel, aware of the importance of this; the time has now come for this awareness to be given practical effect through a realistic sharing of information. At the same time workers must realise that they have responsibility to the firm which employs them.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-stress the harm to the economy and to our industrial relations image abroad, caused by unofficial industrial action, especially when this action affects key industries and essential services.  Adherence to agreed procedures must replace the sudden disruptions caused by minority groups exercising industrial muscle and indulging in unofficial strikes with no thought for the hardship they cause to their fellow workers and the community.  The vast majority of workers have no time for the behaviour of these groups and the patience of the community is wearing thin at the actions of some minority groups.  It is high time for the silent majority of ordinary workers, who want to go about the business of earning their living <Col N="1590" /> and supporting their families to stand up and be counted by refusing to respect unofficial pickets which have been condemned time and time again by society at large and which tend to debase the democratic ideals which form the cornerstone of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said yesterday in this debate, this is a budget for the people by a Government which is for the people.  We have now a more equitable taxation system.  Earners have more control over their money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that the Deputy is mixing up the schemes and that the criticism to which he refers relates to another scheme.  The work experience programme is the one to which I think the Deputy is referring. However, regarding the supplementary, I have noticed some of the criticism referred to.  We investigate any criticism that is made in this way and we have found occasional abuses of the scheme. However, the success of the scheme far outweighs the few small criticisms that have been offered against it.  The scheme has been in operation only since September 1978, but up to the end of September 1979 placement under the scheme was 80 per cent in terms of permanent employment with about half of those placed being placed in the firms and companies in which they were gaining experience. The scheme has been extremely successful.</P>

Throughout 1979 the pattern was that there was a growth in shortages of skilled workers.  The projection is that we will need many more skilled people in the future than we needed in the past.</P>

      <P>As the reply includes a tabular statement I propose with the permission <Col N="1597" /> of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate a copy with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual benefits payable at retirement in the civil service and public sector generally is a pension of one-eightieth of retirement salary for each year of pensionable service subject to a maximum of 40 years' service, that is, one-half retirement salary, in addition to a lump sum payment of three-eightieths of retirement salary for each year of pensionable service subject to a maximum of 40 years, that is, 1½ times retirement salary.  In respect of those bodies where a retirement lump sum is not payable the pension is normally calculated in sixtieths <Col N="1598" /> thus yielding a maximum pension of 66 per cent after 40 years' pensionable service which is equivalent to the benefits outlined above.</P>
    <P>The amount of retirement benefits to be paid to employees of semi-State bodies are primarily a matter for the particular body concerned but, in reaching a decision as to whether a particular pension scheme is acceptable, my Department would not normally object to benefits which are not in excess of those outlined in the foregoing paragraph.</P>

      <P>In so far as the question relates to Irish civil service pension terms, the position is that established officers, other than females appointed before 13 April 1954 who did not avail of the provisions of the Superannuation Act, 1954, qualify, on retirement after at least five years' reckonable service, for a pension and lump sum.  The pension is one-eightieth of pensionable salary for each year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of one-half of pensionable salary; the lump sum amounts to three times the pension.  Where an officer had not been promoted during his last three years of service the pensionable salary in question would be the actual rate of salary payable at retirement; in other cases, pensionable salary would be a weighted annual average of the rates of salary payable in respect of the posts held during the three year period.</P>
      <P>The pensions and lump sums of nonestablished civil servants are calculated on a similar basis except that in computing the pension the pensionable salary is deemed to be the amount by which salary exceeds twice the annual equivalent of the maximum personal weekly rate of Social Welfare Old Age (Contributory) Pension payable on the last day of reckonable service to a single man without dependants.  The female officers referred to above qualify for a pension of one-sixtieth of pensionable salary for each year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of two-thirds of retiring salary; no lump sum is payable in such cases.</P>
      <P>The terms applicable to other Irish public servants are similar, in general, to those of civil servants.</P>
      <P>As regards the other member states of the European Community, I am sorry I have not got the information sought and, in any event, I would point out that I have no function in relation to the pension terms of state pensioners in other member states of the European Community.</P>

    <P>I may add that during the course of a meeting which a deputation from the Secondary Education Committee had with me on 25 October 1979 reference was also made to the deed of trust for community schools.  The committee subsequently conveyed their gratitude for the time devoted to their concerns and the close attention given to each matter raised.</P>
    <P>The procedure adopted for consultations with the different interests was related to the circumstances of the apparent degree of their involvement at the time in amendments to the draft deed.</P>
    <P>It is some time since these Questions were first placed on the Order Paper.  I may state that whatever misunderstandings there may have been at that time, based on mistaken assertions of individuals, there is at present a full consensus as to the role and function of the community school and as to the importance which the Protestant community attaches to the place of its own secondary schools in the educational system.</P>

Community schools are vested in the Minister for Education and are leased to trustees under certain terms and conditions, as contained in the deeds of trust.

      <P>As I recall, the second part of the question was what I could have said to give rise to this.  That is a hypothetical question and I would find it very difficult to answer it.  There is one aspect of the discussion which took place that day which may possibly have given rise to it but it was not because of any lack of clarity on my part or on the part of my officials.  It is a fundamental, philosophical one, how do you view the Department of Education?  Do you review it as all-controlling, as the source of the ukase?  When a discussion arose as to the activities of the Boards of management of the schools I pointed out that I did not envisage the Department's role as that of interfering in every matter with regard to appointments and the running of the schools.  I notice a slight ambivalence in attitude among people.  We have been talking for a long time about trying to involve the community and the professional people in the management of schools.  On the other hand, there seems to be a demand that the interference should come from the centre.  We would want to make up our minds as to whether we are really committed to devolution of authority with regard to schools or whether we want a heavily centralised system such as the French system.  That is the only possibility of an interpretation of what I had to say being wrong.</P>

      <P>The representatives of parents on the management board of community schools are elected by the parents of pupils of the school.

In such circumstances also it would not be unreasonable to assume that the situation would have a bearing on the selection of its representatives by the relevant vocational education committees to serve as members of the board.</P>
      <P>I would not consider it desirable that in connection with either the election or selection of members of the management board there should be an arrangement, or requirement, for persons to make a declaration as to their religious persuation or that the procedure for the appointment of members should require that formal note be taken of any such consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two comments on what the Deputy has said. First, when I took office in 1977 there was available to me under the Estimates for capital expenditure a sum of £27 million.  This year £49.3 million is available.  Secondly, I think it is particularly puerile to maintain that money spent on the salaries of teachers at various levels is money badly spent or misplaced.  There was an old Irish quatrain which talked about wooden priests and golden chalices in place of golden priests and wooden chalices. There was a time in this country when we did not have buildings to put teachers into but the light of learning was kept alive by the teachers.  That is where I would like to see the emphasis going.  I do not think anyone should run down an Estimate because the largest percentage of it goes on teachers' salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I should like to make the following statement:</P>
      <P>The position in regard to irregularities on the Erin Foods side of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta is being investigated by the company and the Garda.  The company have engaged a firm of accountants to carry out a special audit, and investigations are also being made abroad.  While certain stocks of Erin products have been located abroad, it will not be possible to arrive at any firm conclusions in regard to the nature and extent of the irregularities until the various inquiries have been completed. I can assure the House that a most thorough examination is being made but, in view of the complexity of the whole matter, as well as the geographical spread of the company's trading, this will necessarily take some time.  In the meantime, the disclosure of the detailed information available could only hamper the investigations by the company and the garda and prejudice their outcome.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party I should like to welcome the fact that the Minister has made a statement on this matter.  It is very desirable that a statement from an authoritative source should be made at an early stage in a matter of this sort.  It is also important and in the interests of fairness and justice, particularly in view of the possibility of criminal proceedings that great care should be taken by all concerned about giving names publicly of individuals who may or may not be involved. In the interests of justice, I appeal to all concerned to exercise that care.  Having said that, on the basis of the information it is indicated that this is a serious matter and we welcome the fact that the board and other responsible authorities are treating it as such and carrying out their investigations with due speed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for making the statement which does not go into detail&mdash;understandably, in the circumstances surrounding the case.  It would be most undesirable if we were to have a trial in the House on this matter. Unfortunately, this type of irregularity happens both in the private sector and occasionally in the public sector, more frequently in the private sector.  When we consider that we have approximately 90 State and semi-State bodies the rarity of an occurence such as this speaks well for the general management and operation of the State sector.  I am concerned, particularly in view of noises emanating from some prominent business interests, that this affair should not be used as a vehicle to launch a further attack on the State and semi-State sector which has served the country so well.  If one examines the 90 State and seme-State bodies objectively one sees how well-run most of them are and how beneficial they have been to our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the budget has been going on for a few days and it is remarkable for a number of things. The most important one, I think, is that some people on the Government side of the House do not seem to understand that this is not the first budget introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government since the last general election.  In fact the budget was introduced by this Government and despite what the Taoiseach has said and what a number of his Ministers have been echoing this is not a new Government, not a Government elected by the people a few months ago consisting of Members who were not members of the previous Government.  The new Government we hear all the talk about consists of ten outgoing Ministers, ten people who, if we are to believe the statements made by the Taoiseach, by his Ministers and particularly by the Minister for Finance a few days ago, were the people who put the country into such a bad state that very severe action had to be taken to bring it back on course.  It would be amusing, if it were not tragic, to listen to the way in which again and again we have reference to the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Government, and to how bad was the condition of the country before they took over and the effort they will have to make in order to straighten things out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only have the Government members been using this device but the propaganda has been fairly effective, as is borne out by the fact that the cummann menbers througout the country are now using the same terminology. Unless they are very careful, I fear that the former Taoiseach will become as unpopular as Cromwell in this country because about a half-dozen times this week I heard the former Taoiseach being described as a weak man who did not run the country properly, all of this coming <Col N="1637" /> from Fianna Fáil people trying to boost the new leader at the expense of his predecessor.  This is very unfair and wrong.</P>
    <P>The other scapegoat was the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. I had intended suggesting that he should intervene in this debate but before I could do so he did intervene.  I listened to him with great interest because it would be amusing if it were not tragic for somebody who had been the author of the success which Fianna Fáil had in the last election and who attempted to carry out the policies in which he believed, with the assistance of the Taoiseach and other members of the Government&mdash; although, as appears to be the case, a terrible mess was made of it; they just would not work&mdash;to come here and to attempt first, to blame the economic chaos we are in on the National Coalition Government and then to attempt to say that everything was all right.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue did make one comparison.  He said that the efforts necessary to get the economy into the position in which they wanted it were like a space probe in which there were three stages; the first stage was fired&mdash;it seemed to be going slowly but in the right direction&mdash;the second one was reasonably successful and the third one went off course.  He did not seem to remember that it was a manned spaceship that was sent up, that he happened to be one of the pilots, that a new director to control outer space was appointed while he was in orbit and that he was sent off into the wilderness, into empty space.  Obviously it was his voice coming back here in an endeavour to straighten out what he had done or what he felt should be done.  I felt it tragic that we should have such a situation.  While I and a lot of other people believe that his theories were all wrong, he did his best and thought he was doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>First of all, before the last general election&mdash;and I shall not bore the House with the Fianna Fáil Manifesto, a copy of which I still possess; some of the <Col N="1638" /> Fianna Fáil people say they have lost theirs and they can make a photostat copy of mine&mdash;what was suggested could be done was something which we said at the time, and which time has proved to be correct, could not be done without creating chaos.  Fianna Fáil got into power, produced their budget and believed that there was such a practice as spending money without worrying where that money was to come from. The result is that we find ourselves in a fairly sad mess.</P>
    <P>How that mess is to be straightened out is what we are now talking about. We have had the first O'Kennedy budget before the House.  I was in this House when the present Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.  I can recognise his finger on an awful lot of proposals in this budget.  I believe he is the person who was sitting at the Minister's shoulder pointing out what should or should not be done.  It is important to remember that what happened here on budget day is one small facet only of the overall economic chaos.  A typical example of what I am talking about is that during the Minister's budget speech he made great play of the fact that bottled gas in this country cost considerably less than in Britain.  If the stories we hear about the left hand of the Fianna Fáil Government not knowing what their right hand is doing are not true, then the Minister, sitting at the Cabinet table, must have been aware that an increase in bottled gas had been sanctioned to come into operation two or three days later and which completely reversed the position. It was a very bad joke to play on the many poor people who depend on bottled gas for heating and cooking.  The fact that the Minister picked out that item shows that the person who wrote the document read in this House either was not aware that this was being done or, if he was aware, could not care less. It passed for the time being and got him out of an awkward position.  It was a good political point while it lasted, two or three days.  That typifies the attitude of the present Government to what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> Since the New Year we have had so many budgets, all of them budgets, that it is almost impossible to keep track of them.  Early in the New Year the Taoiseach wisely decided not to go ahead with the proposed Taoiseach's residence in the Park.  That was a major decision.  It could have waited a couple of weeks and could have been included in the budget.  Indeed such a proposal should never have been mooted in our current economic circumstances.  Mark you, there was nothing about the executive jet costing about half or a third of the proposed Taoiseach's residence&mdash;£2 million or £2,250,000, I think, was the figure.  There were no gold taps on the £2 million one, so the £2,250,000 one was bought instead.  That should have been scrapped along with the Taoiseach's residence.  If we so short of money that we have to cutback as we have been doing, then it was wrong to have spent that amount of money.  God knows we would send an awful lot of Ministers and officials to Europe on £2,250,000.  And that is only the beginning of it because the running of the jet must be added to everything else and will be very costly.</P>
    <P>Early in the New Year cigarettes went up by 1p, coal by £3 per ton, gas in Dublin by 60 per cent, the fourth increase in eight months.  Gas in Limerick, the homeland of the Minister for prices himself, went up by 30 per cent.  The price of flour was increased.  On 18 January there was a notification to the effect that local authorities would receive only a 10 per cent rise in 1980 to carry on their activities.  I heard some people talking here today about how little would be required to carry on the business of local authorities.  It is interesting to know that one rural authority of which I have knowledge estimates that their cost this year of maintaining the level of last year will be approximately 32 per cent to 33 per cent more.  Raw materials and everything else have increased and, on top of them, wages.  Therefore, there is no way in which they can maintain services at the same cost.</P>
    <P>We have had talk in this House about <Col N="1640" /> appointing Ministers for this and that.  I honestly believe we should appoint a Minister for potholes because there are now more in this country than there ever were.  It is true that many people have had a lot of damage done to their motor vehicles.  In fact one county manager&mdash;although he was not responsible for the cutback in expenditure&mdash;had the back axle of his car broken.  And there is no point in talking about suing the local authority because apparently it has been ruled by the courts that unless some type of repair has been carried out on the road at the particular time the local authority are not responsible.</P>
    <P>In my county there are three swimming pools&mdash;I was glad during my time to be able to assist in their building&mdash;fairly well used but it has been decided now that one only will be used in any one week, leaving the remaining two closed.  This is life in Ireland under Fianna Fáil.  We built them and Fianna Fáil cannot even afford to run them.  Yet they tell us they know how to run the country and the local authorities.  There is no money available for the repair of roads or the resurfacing of roads.  Local authorities are now in a catch-22 situation in which, if they keep all their employees, they have no money with which to buy materials and, if they dismiss their employees, they will be in trouble with everybody particularly the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I read in the papers yesterday that the Minister for the Environment had announced that £50 million was to be spent on roads.  It was announced at a place and in such a way that many people who would not know the facts would be under the impression that this was an additional £50 million being found somewhere, that nobody knew anything about.  The Minister just found out and announced it.  That is a lot of cod.  What is being spent is the minimum amount which must be spent to try and keep the roads in repair.  Similarly we hear a lot of talk at present about the building of various types of motorways around this city.  I expressed my views on the <Col N="1641" /> subject when I was in the Custom House.  My view has not changed.  Apparently now some people have made the decision that they should go ahead, but they cannot because the money is not there with which to do it.  However, it looks good in a newspaper for somebody to say that they will rebuild portion of this city.  I know better than anybody else what was done about the centre city by Fianna Fáil for 16 years.  I was in the Custom House at the time.  I know there was absolutely no effort made by anybody either in the Fianna Fáil Government or in local authorities to get anything done.  The city centre was simply falling down.  I was glad to be a part of an organisation which helped to revitalise and rebuild the city centre. Now we hear talk of an expenditure of something like £800 million on the rebuilding of portion of the city when we know that that sort of money is not available.  But such statements look nice and it is hoped it will keep people happy, thinking that something is being done about it.</P>
    <P>As regards home loans, this matter was tied up with the budget and the money was not available.  I remember when I took a decision in the Custom House that we should not allow grants to people who wanted to repair their homes if they were wealthy, in other words I had a means test, Fianna Fáil were foaming at the mouth.  It was the most terrible thing anybody could do and they gave me a thousand reasonably good reasons why.  In their manifesto they said they would increase and improve grants for home owners.  Instead of that they abolished them completely.  When they did, they did it in such a way that over a period of three or four weeks about 47,000 applications were received in O'Connell Bridge House.  The average number received each year was about 15,000.  That means that a person waiting for a grant will be put at the end of a three-year waiting period because in normal times it would be three years before that number of applications would be dealt with.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of muddle the Government <Col N="1642" /> are in.  At the same time they are trying to give the impression that they are running the country properly.  They increased the number of people who could borrow money for the purpose of building houses.  That is something I would not have done.  They also increased the income limit.  What they did not say was where the person would get the money to repay the loan.  The repayments are now approximately £30 per week for a loan of £12,000 over 30 years.  They told me we were building too many local authority houses.  They proved they thought that because they built fewer houses.  The outlook this year is very bleak and more people will be pushed on to the private loan.  I do not know where they are to get the money to repay loans.  Sites are ranging between £5,000 and £7,000 throughout the country and these are not select sites.  This is the kind of mix-up we have at present.</P>
    <P>Grants for solid fuel heating were abolished.  The object of the grant was to get people using oil to switch to a different system.  It did that in a big way but what was forgotten was that grants would have to be paid.  About one-tenth of my mail every day is from people wanting to know when they will get their heating grants.  The administration of this grant was wrong because people who used solid fuel and oil were eligible for the grant and no effort was made to close that loophole.  People who had the job done and really need the money cannot get it.  I was touched by questions asked yesterday by a Fianna Fáil Deputy who wanted to know if local authority tenants who bought their houses but who had not got fireplaces would get the grant.  The Government he supports did away with those grants.  I produced them but they did away with them.</P>
    <P>On 28 January CIE fares went up by 20 per cent.  As regards the standard loaf which the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, did not hear about&mdash;he said it was not a very common loaf&mdash;obviously he does not do the shopping or he would know that the loaf on which 5p was put is a <Col N="1643" /> common one.  Milk went up to 13p.  On 1 February the ESB increased their charges by 20 per cent, that is 60p a week on a £25 two-monthly bill, and this followed on a 10 per cent increase in October last and a 20 per cent increase last June.  Coal went up by over £2 a ton.  In February the pint went up by 2p and a half glass of spirits by 3p.  On 18 February petrol went up by between 7p and 10p a gallon while home heating oil went up between 6½p and 9p per gallon. On 20 February massive cuts were announced in education, housing, health, agriculture, public spending and the Public Capital Programme cut all forms of social spending.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has just left the House and that is a pity.  I put down a number of questions for written answer to him on Tuesday as I do not believe in cluttering up the House with oral questions if I can get the information which I require for my constituents by way of written answers.  I am not in the habit of getting discourteous replies from Government Departments because they are not made up that way.  It would appear that if these are coming the officials have been told to do them that way.  The majority of the replies suggested that they were not intended to give me the information I was looking for.  What they intended to do was politely to tell me to go to hell.</P>

      <P>One of the questions I asked him was if he had sanctioned a grant for the repair or replacement of the roof of Dunboyne primary school, County Meath and, if not, when he proposed to do so.  The reason I put down the question was because of the cut-backs in education.  The school roof was leaking badly and the people wanted to know if it would be repaired or replaced.  The reply I got was that the question of a grant towards the cost of works to the roof would be considered when the necessary result had been received.  Does anybody know what that means?  To make matters worse &ldquo;considered&rdquo; is spelled &ldquo;ocnsidered&rdquo; and it <Col N="1644" /> has been typed over a couple of times.  If that is the way a Member of the House is to get replies from a Minister something must be done.  I wrote to the Minister yesterday afternoon telling him that I considered it an insult to the House and to my constituents.  I did not get a reply yet although I could have got one because we are quite close to the Department of Education.  There is no point in saying that some official slipped up.  It is not an official's job.  As Minister, replies were given to me and I approved them before they went through.  It is obvious that that was not done in this case.  Does it mean that we are so short of cash that we cannot even have questions answered properly?  Is that the situation?  I should like the Minister for Education to give me information about that as quickly as possible.  That is only one of a number which I will not bore the House with where the replies I got seemed to suggest that he was being smart at the expense of the person trying to take a reasonable way out by putting down questions for written reply rather than having them here today for oral answer as I could have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister for Education in a position to say whether he proposes to build schools this year?  He spoke about the reduction of £5 million in his Department as affecting the building of only a couple of schools.  I do not know what he meant by &ldquo;a couple of schools&rdquo;.  What is the situation?  Are the schools which were approved going to be built or will they be put on the long finger?  Are the usual stupid questions going to be sent out in order to delay them so that no one will know that there is another reason why they are not being built?  Will he tell us what the future of the school bus is? It is getting more and more chaotic as days go by.  In my area the school bus picks up children at 7.30 a.m. and leaves them outside the school at 8.10 a.m. both winter and summer although the school does not open until 9.30 a.m.  It does three runs.  In the evening the same thing happens.  If they are lucky the children who left at 7.30 a.m. arrive back at 6.30 p.m.  We should know whether the Minister proposes to continue this or <Col N="1645" /> improve it or whether the stories we hear, that because of the cuts in the Department of Education there will be no school buses except in special circumstances, are true.  It is in order to ask the Minister that and he should tell me what the position is.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the big increase of 22p per gallon for petrol and diesel.  If it was simply a question of a small number of people being involved, we could write that off as easily as the Minister and the Government seem to have done.  But surely they must realise that, if the cost of haulage of goods is increased, then the costs of goods must increase. People using diesel or petrol must get compenation for the extra money they are paying out.  Apparently this seems to have been completely overlooked by the Minister, when drawing up this budget.  One must consider the number of people using vehicles to go to work.  There was a time when people travelled only a limited journey to work and cycled or walked, but over the last 25 or 30 years the radius has been widening and people travel a very long journeys.  It is very usual for people from my part of the country, right around County Meath, to drive to Dublin in the morning to their work and to travel home again in the evening.  They will be paying the extra 22p a gallon on petrol five days a week.  As they would use two gallons a day at the minimum, that is £2 a week, which seems to be written off by the Government as not being terribly important.</P>
    <P>During the time when I was in the Custom House&mdash;and this is no secret, it is not revealing something which should not be revealed&mdash;I had a proposal that it would be possible not alone to replace road tax but to replace third party insurance. The State has made third party insurance compulsory and therefore the State should supply it, replacing it with a petrol tax.  First, this tax was set at 11p. Then the Department of Finance made it 19p and then it became 21p.  Then the general election took place and we were left paying the insurance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> What I am saying is that in 1977 it was possible to replace third party insurance and road tax by putting 21p a gallon on petrol.  Now we have the petrol price gone sky high with an extra 22p a gallon and we are getting nothing in return and we still have to pay insurance. There has been a large increase in the cost of motor insurance, which is extremely high.  There are some who are able to get insurance at a reasonable price because they have been driving for a long time.  I have a no-claim bonus on my driving record.  When I left office I bought a new car, a Mirafiori, and on my application for full comprehensive insurance I was asked for £400.75p.  I considered the sum was ridiculous and was able to get accommodation in another way.  There are many cases where people now are unable to pay insurance and it is not at all unusual to find cars being driven around this country with no insurance.  They have not the sticker on the windscreen of the car because they have not got the insurance which would buy it.  This is a terrible situation.  When Fianna Fáil abolish something they replace it with something else.  The road tax is now £5 and then it will be £10 and I would like to have a bet with the Minister that by the end of the year it will have gone even higher.  Then one must consider the cost of repairs to cars.  If you go near a garage at all you get a bill for £100.</P>
    <P>The increase put on bottled gas was absolutely disgraceful.  The Minister for Finance referred to this bottled gas as being so much cheaper than in Britain and then he decided to put a tax on it when he must have known already that it was agreed by the Cabinet to put 79p on it.  This will affect the poorer in the community. I know a lot of people who have got heaters and gas cookers.  They were able to use them when the bottled gas was 30p but now it will be over £4.  I hear Fianna Fáil members, particularly the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Michael Woods talking about the tremendous increases which he granted from his Department.  But take a bag of coal, it costs £3.70 and most old people to keep warm would require two bags of <Col N="1647" /> coal and a bottle of gas to cook and where is the old age pension gone?  Half of it is gone already.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputy O'Donoghue saying to-day that Fianna Fáil were the people who introduced many new schemes in social welfare and that they were the only people to give a reasonable increase.  I remind the Government that the old age pension in 1908 was 9s. a week and a farm worker's salary was 10s. a week.  That is very interesting.  When the war was over the old age pension was still 10s. a week and it was not until the last Coalition Government came into power that the social welfare recipients were brought up from being second class citizens and paid a reasonable amount right across the board.  In addition, the old age pension age was brought down to 66 years and following that we had the inclusion of quite a number of new recipients, particularly those now receiving single women's benefits.  Under those a single woman who stayed at home looking after her parents and who on their death, having been dependent on their old age pension, would be destitute, was given a pension up to the time when she would be of age for the old age pension and there was also the unmarried mothers' allowance.  The year before last and last year, Fianna Fáil allowed the pension to go down.  This year they have given what appears to be a reasonable increase but it is no more than one might expect, since it is only what these people are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Social Welfare on a recent radio programme if he proposes giving another increase in October, to make the increase twice yearly.  He was not prepared to offer a comment on that, and we can make up our minds about that.  That must indicate that these people have got partial compensation to bring them up to date now, but between now and the end of the year they will be again falling very far behind. There are different schools of thought concerning the increase in the cost of living this year.  I noticed that the Taoiseach yesterday said that it would <Col N="1648" /> be 4 per cent.  Now, I am not an expert, but I have had a certain amount of experience in this House and I estimate that it will be at least 6 per cent.  Before we know where we are we will have another 6 per cent.  We remember that Deputy O'Donoghue, who today was telling us how good their programme and policies were, is the fellow who said we were going to be down to 5 per cent inflation this year.  Where does he stand or what does he think of the whole situation? He did not express his views on it this morning.</P>
    <P>We have had another round of farmers' tax.  There are a number of things about that.  I happened to be at a meeting in the Ardboyne Hotel in Navan two or three nights before the last general election. Deputy Bruton here was present and so also was the Fianna Fáil TD.  The programme as presented by Deputy O'Donoghue was ready and presented and a solemn guarantee given on a number of things, (1) the multiplier would not be increased (2) there would be no question of everybody being made to produce accounts (3) there would not be a reduction in the valuation which would be taxed.  Now we find that (1) the multiplier was increased to 120 (2) the valuation has been pulled down to 40 this year and (3) Fianna Fáil have thrown overboard completely the promise that they would not insist on accounts and now they insist on accounts being produced by everybody.  Is it any wonder that they got the vote they did? Really they codded the farmers.</P>
    <P>Last year they introduced a 2 per cent tax.  Everyone of us, including I am sure a lot of Fianna Fáil people who have a little savvy, felt that the 2 per cent was a lot of nonsense, it was not workable, it was not fair and should have not have been considered.  This year we had an new approach.  Last year's fell down because the Minister for Finance, having said that in no way would he or the Government be prepared to back down, proceeded to back down within hours of having made the statement.  The new Minister introduced his resource tax and yesterday the Taoiseach took the ground <Col N="1649" /> completely from under his feet by talking about it being negotiable.  I do not know what Fianna Fáil mean when they say they were going to do something and stick to it.  Whether the thing was fair or unfair&mdash;and I am not happy that it was the correct approach&mdash;having done that the Taoiseach then said it is negotiable.</P>
    <P>There are not two different races in this country, farmers and others.  We all belong to the one race and we should all be asked to pay tax in the same way. The decision by the Government to remove the right of the farmer to include machinery for taxation purposes was wrong.  That is not done in industry and the same terms should apply to industry as to farmers.  If all people paid their fair share we would all be a lot happier.  But the Government, being afraid of the result of the marches which took place over PAYE, decided that they would give the impression of laying it on the farmers.  They decided then that they would again give the impression of giving something for nothing to the PAYE taxpayers and they did something which all of us in the Labour movement down the years have been opposed to.  We have been opposed to indirect taxation being substituted for direct taxation, and that is exactly what the Minister did in his budget.  He took off taxation at a certain level and then proceeded to put it on again and the same people who were getting it off at one end were going to pay it at the other.</P>
    <P>If there was a complete changeover with no direct taxation at all and all indirect taxation he might have a case.  He might be able to say that people are going to spend what they are going to spend.  But he said it was optional whether they should spend money on drink, cigarettes or minerals.  He did not say anything about spring water yet but I am sure that will come.  Also he mentioned petrol.  Many of these things are not optional.  In addition there is the extraordinary situation that the Government, having decided that they would do this and giving the impression that it was a continuation of the Taoiseach's campaign <Col N="1650" /> against cigarette smoking and drinking which he was so hot about last year, then under pressure agreed that they expected a reduction of about 2 per cent.  In other words it was simply and solely a revenue raising tax.  I do not drink or smoke so I suppose I can look at things in a different way from other people.  I have no objection to people drinking or smoking if they wish to do so.  I think they are mad if they smoke or if they drink one or two more than they can afford.  However, even if additional taxation goes on, people will continue to drink as much as ever and the household will suffer as a result.  That does not seem to worry the Government very much because they have budgeted for what the taxes will bring in and they seem determined to get it anyway.</P>
    <P>One thing in the budget which got very short shrift was the question of prices.  The Fianna Fáil Election Manifesto laid down very definitely that not alone were they going to control prices but they were satisfied that some manufacturers were getting more than they were entitled to.  If there is any doubt about the wording of it I will read it out.  In a debate here last week on prices the Minister responsible, Deputy O'Malley, proceeded to tell us that we had the strictest price control in Europe and that he often felt that he was being unfair to manufacturers in that he was not allowing them enough of an increase. Either he was terribly wrong when he was in Opposition or he is terribly wrong now, and I give a fair bet that he was wrong on both occasions.  Price increases have been listed here.  The Prices Advisory Body make a report which goes to the Government.  We got one the other day.  It was not the March one, it was the December one and there were 55 or 60 increases listed.  When we were in Government we issued a newspaper advertisement of the increases every time the report came in and we issued this immediately so that people going to a shop would know what the increases were. Deputy O'Malley said that that was foolish and he was not going to do it, that he was going to take other steps. People, including myself until I realised <Col N="1651" /> what the answer was, were complaining that the press and radio were not giving due publicity to the increases.  Who in the world wants to know about an increase which occurred last December?  People have been paying it for three months.  It is not news and newspapers will not bother to publish it when they get it. Why should they?  If the Government want to be fair to the people of the country they should deal with the prices report and submit it immediately.  I counted over a number of months and found that the average per month was 44 increases. I suggest that in November that went to 55 and to almost 60 in December. Nearly all of those might have been published because every range of goods and service has been increased.</P>
    <P>There are two other things about which the Minister for Finance should have done something.  One of them is the fact that not alone those items which we read about in the report but other items also have been increased in shops and supermarkets.  Somebody showed me the price on half a pound of margarine which was 23p the week before last and 29p last week.  These things will not hit the headlines, but that means that margarine is now almost as dear as butter and that is only one item.  You can go right across the range.  Go into any shop and see a young mother buying a pair of shoes for a baby or toddler and the price will be from £7 to £12.  A pair of trousers for a nine year old boy will cost about £12 and will not last very long.  Deputy O'Malley was echoed by the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance on the necessity for workers not to look for more wages.  I was a trade union official for 30 years and I know that some workers will never be satisfied.  However, the vast majority of them are prepared to acaccept a reasonable wage.  I never met workers who would be prepared to accept an increase in the price of every item they must buy without asking for a wage increase.  If the Government do not do something to control prices, the kickback from the wages front will shake them more than they expect.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that there will be <Col N="1652" /> very little money for the erection of local authority houses, I understand that a circular was issued to at least some local authorities asking for particulars of the earnings of tenants of local authority houses.  The Dublin County Council have issued their circulars and they want to know about bonus or shift earnings in addition to normal earnings and have warned that unless these requests are complied with properly, they will impose the full rent on the tenants.  This is an attempt to reverse our decision to give tenants a reasonable rent.  The Government are putting themselves back into the position in which I found them when there was a rents strike lasting from two-and-a-half to three years which it took some time to straighten out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should have been a lot more interested in job creation. That was not mentioned in the budget and the Minister seemed to be under the impression that it did not matter. Deputy O'Donoghue this morning talked about areas where there were plenty of jobs and nobody available to do them.  I would like the Deputy to show me these places as I have yet to find any place where an employer was paying a decent wage where it was difficult to get labour.  In my constituency a big carpet factory is being crucified by imported artificial fibre mainly from America.  As long as that sort of thing goes on there is no point in talking about job creation.  The Government should do something at EEC level, if possible, to prevent the importation from America or elsewhere of this sort of thing, as it is putting people out of jobs.  As far as I know the EEC cannot do anything unless representations are made by the native Government.  It appears that this Government have not asked the EEC to do anything.  This was the impression given from a reply to a question put by Deputy Liam Kavanagh a few days ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister might make a formal written complaint.</P>
      <P>Two or three other things require attention. The Minister has already warned that Post Office charges will go up.  I cannot understand why the Post Office, above any other service, should pay their way.  If the Post Office did not pay their way they would be brought before the House, whereas other services are not dealt with in the same way.  To test the service of the Post Office I posted a number of letters, one of them addressed to my home from Leinster House yesterday evening and the letter to my own home arrived this morning on the first post.  The Post Office are giving an excellent service and I do not see why they should be pilloried in the House because they are not paying their way.</P>
      <P>Since the social welfare stamp disappeared things have changed considerably. I know that the workers in the Department of Social Welfare are very humane and efficient and do a tremendous amount of work which people do not realise, but I have noticed that in one or two sections recently there is a tendency to give a short answer, to ignore letters and to say that something has been lost when people are hungry because it has not been dealt with properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that there will be a 3½ per cent increase in costings to the worker for social welfare benefits and an increase of 8½ per cent to the employer as a result of the budget.  Will people get value for this extra increase?  Old age pensioners who qualified last year before the postal strike and who got their books at the end of last year can be told on inquiry that their arrears of perhaps hundreds of pounds will be paid in several months.  That is not the way to deal with people.  It is unfair that people who applied for sickness, <Col N="1654" /> disability, occupational injuries or unemployment benefits are dealt with in that way, especially when they are now being asked to pay more.  Has there been a reduction in the staff?  Is this one of the cut-backs?  Has it been decided to have a smaller number of people doing that work so as to save money on the budget?  At the moment if one tries to phone any Government Department, it is a miracle if one gets through and even if one does one could be left quite a long time waiting to get through to a section. I was told recently that it was not unusual to have to wait for an hour to get on to a section.  I would like to know if it is true that money is saved by reducing the number of staff employed.</P>

      <P>The Government do not seem to understand a number of things about agriculture.  They do not understand that the decision about the rates abatement has created an almost impossible position for a number of farmers. An old man told me last week that his rates which cost him £138 last year would cost more than £450 this year. That man has between 40 and 60 acres and he, and people like him, were badly handled in the budget and before it.  Something should be done to straighten this out before such people are put into the poor house.  Most people, if they are getting fair play, do not like complaining but I am afraid this decision by the Minister and the Government will lead to such dissatisfaction that more people will take to the streets stating that there is no point bringing such matters to the attention of politicians.  It is bad when the public decide that this House is not the forum to deal with such matters. The Government should be very careful about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the questions of employment and unemployment. The Fianna Fáil Manifesto suggested that there would be a reduction of 5,000 unemployed in 1977, 20,000 in 1978, 25,000 in 1979 and 30,000 this year.  If we take that statement <Col N="1655" /> at face value there should have been a reduction in the number unemployed of 50,000 but we all know that nothing like that has happened.  Our young people who were promised the sun, the moon and the stars are now aware that they were not offered anything.  We were told also that it was necessary to tailor borrowing in a certain way and that this was responsible for the situation with regard to the amount of money that was available.  According to Fianna Fáil in 1977 they would borrow 11 per cent, 13 per cent in 1978, 10½ per cent in 1979, and this year it would be 8 per cent.  Last year Fianna Fáil borrowed 13½ per cent and this year they expect to borrow 10 per cent.  The IR£ is taking such a hammering now that it is necessary for people to borrow more in order to carry on. The reduction in the value of the IR£ has also meant that imports from Great Britain cost us a lot more than before and it is not unusual to find a 10 per cent mark up on British goods.  It may be suggested that we should buy more Irish goods but my reply to that is that it is not possible to buy them if they are not displayed.  One is considered a sort of a nut if one asks for Irish goods in a shop. The result is that British goods are displayed to a greater degree and our people are being charged more for them.</P>
    <P>The Government proposed to do something about taxation but all they did was to comply with a decision of the Supreme Court.  With regard to the PAYE concessions it is obvious that those earning a lot of money will come out of this very well but those at the bottom of the pile get practically nothing. My friend who drives to Dublin in a car has told me that while he will get £140 off his income tax he will have to pay an extra £130 for petrol.  The budget is a flop and if that is the best Fianna Fáil can do it is a good job they will not be in Government much longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been pleased to listen to contributions by Deputy Tully and on this occasion he made an excellent job of a very poor case.  He acquitted himself with distinction. When in Opposition I always gave <Col N="1656" /> credit where credit was due and offered constructive criticism where it was needed.  Although this budget was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Party there are elements in it which I would criticise such as the system under which reliefs are given.  This is something which I hope the commission on taxation will change.  I am surprised at the amount of play being made of the extra taxation in the budget.  Common sense must tell us all that even the smallest business must take in a certain amount of money before any can be given out.  That is the situation the Government found themselves in.  I do not believe there was anything wrong with what Deputy O'Donoghue said today.  In the first budget introduced by Fianna Fáil on returning to office we were told that the Government would borrow for the first year and the emphasis would be on getting the unfortunate people on the unemployment register back to work. Young people found it very difficult to get a job three years ago but the situation has changed today.  In my area while they may have to wait a short time they will get a job.  Up to 1977 they were like droves of sheep going for interviews. While employment is not as high as we would like it Fianna Fáil will endeavour to create more work.  Taking into consideration the number of school leavers and the number of people on the unemployment register, Fianna Fáil did a very creditable job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important question for us is energy and the new Minister responsible, Deputy Colley, faces the greatest task of any Minister.  Oil is all important but we may not be able to get it.  It has been the cause of many of our problems to date. People like myself might object to the increase in the price of petrol but the money must be got from somewhere. There is no fairy godmother to create finance.  Only one Opposition Deputy, Deputy Deasy, gave credit to the Government for the manner in which they distributed the national cake.  The Government did a good job in this regard under difficult circumstances. However, the system of distributing the national cake is so wrong that the lower <Col N="1657" /> income group have never benefited to the extent they should.  Since I became a Member of this House I have preached against percentages which are biased against those in the lower income group. The same situation applies to national pay agreements, Deputy O'Leary drew attention on television last week to the fact that the higher income group benefited to the tune of £40 per week under the budget while those in the lower income group only got £4 extra per week but that is the system that has been accepted by the Labour Party&mdash;with the exception of Deputy Bermingham&mdash;and by this House.  With the exception of a few of us who are social minded, that system has been accepted by the House for a long time either in respect of wage increases or of increases in allowances.</P>
    <P>I have contended always that increases should be on a flat rate basis but the situation is that those people who are at the top in various organisations and who are therefore very highly paid are quite happy with the percentage increase system.  However, that is a point that I shall be developing later.  My views may lead people to regard me as a socialist but I make no apology in that regard.  I consider myself to be a genuine socialist. For the person earning £3,000 a year an increase of X per cent in the cost of living will mean every bit as much as it will mean to the man earning £20,000 a year. I urge whatever committee may be established in relation to investigating the tax system to adopt my suggestions in regard to flat rate increases.  I will have more to say in that regard so far as land valuations are concerned.  There are cases in my constituency in which land is valued for rateable purposes at an old halfcrown per acre while in other cases the figure is £1.50 an acre.  In terms of the farm modernisation scheme I fail to understand why the adjusted acre system is not used.  Valuations are not in any way a fair system of determining a person's income.</P>
    <P>On the question of the increase in the price of petrol, I think everybody would have expected some increase in this <Col N="1658" /> respect and I do not think anybody will quibble about the increase to £10 in the registration fee for cars of specified horsepower.  While I am not a drinker as such I consume a fair amount of soft drinks so that to that extent I will be affected by the increased duty on such drinks but that is not of any great import.</P>
    <P>What is most important about the budget is that it indicates a realistic approach to borrowing.  While we are not ashamed to have borrowed for the purpose of creating and maintaining employment it is obvious that we cannot continue to borrow at these high levels. We are well on the way in terms of our employment targets and I am sure that there will not be any cutting back in this regard.  We must ensure that the the IR£ will not be devalued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been devalued.  It stands at 91½p against the English pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned so far as the IR£ is concerned but we must reduce our borrowings.  An effort has been made in the budget to deal with the situation.  I am confident that so long as the people are told exactly what the position is they will agree with our efforts to reduce borrowings.</P>
      <P>I consider the increases in social welfare payments to be reasonable but there are a couple of points that I would make in regard to some of these allowances.  The first refers to old age pensions.  Successive Ministers for Social Welfare in the past number of years have failed to raise the income limit for qualification for an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We raised it considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  I understand that for a single person the income limit for qualification for an old age pension is £6 while the income at which a married person would not qualify is £17. While this year we are giving substantial increases in social welfare payments I am disappointed that the figures to <Col N="1659" /> which I have referred have not been changed.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note the reform in the taxation of working wives though some people on the other side may say that the Government had no option in this matter as a result of the court case, but the Government have been very generous in regard to the PAYE sector.  On this whole question of PAYE people, we must realise when we talk of this section contributing about 70 per cent of our total taxation that included among PAYE workers are some very highly paid company directors and some others who are among the highest paid people in the country.  I say this because very often when people think of PAYE workers they think in terms only of the ordinary worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter in respect of social welfare that I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister whom I believe to be a man who will be sympathetic towards the lower income groups, is in respect of the allowance for prescribed relatives.  This is a matter that I have been raising for some time in the hope that someone will listen to me.  This allowance is paid only in respect of a person who is bedridden and the recipient must be a relative.  Another condition of this allowance is that it is paid only in cases where there is nobody but the person needing attention and the person providing that attention in the house.  This means that if the relative caring for the old person gets married or if somebody else comes to live in the house, the allowance is not paid.  Most old people wish to be able to remain at home until they die.  We should do everything possible to ensure that people can be kept at home in their old age. Another factor in this regard is that the cost of keeping an old person in an institution is very high.  If I were Minister for Health I would take a chance and give a decent allowance to prescribed relatives so that old people might be kept in their own homes.  In that way I believe I would save money in addition to seeing the very human factor of the wishes of the elderly to remain at home being <Col N="1660" /> fulfilled.  If, say, an old man is being looked after by a daughter who has a few children and if the daughter becomes ill or for some other reason cannot continue at some stage to care for the father, she has no option but to put him into a home.  It would cost about £60 or £70 to keep him in a home.  I suggest £20 a week be given to keep him at home.  The daughter could be supervised by a social welfare officer to ensure that the old man is well looked after.  I would be grateful if the Minister would consider this proposal.</P>
    <P>Nearly every farmer is willing to pay his fair share of taxation.  In my view there is nothing wrong with the accounts system.  It is the fairest way to pay taxes but I do not agree with taxing farmers according to the size of their farms. What I liked in the budget was the simple form of accounts for farms between £40 and £49.  I cannot understand why that form of accounts could not be accepted. I have a farm with a £43 valuation. Since farm taxes were introduced I am in the tax bracket and have to keep accounts.  My nephew went to a few lectures about accounting and he keeps my accounts which are submitted to my accountant. The accountant does the accounts his way but there is hardly any difference between the two.  What people in the small farms complain about is this. If a man with a large family has a farm of £41 valuation he is not liable for tax but he must prove it by employing an accountant. This is wrong.  The farmers would not have any objection if a simple form of accounting were introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned an important point.  He said that the biggest grievance will not be on the question of tax, because if a man does not make money he will not pay tax, but on the agricultural grant in the rates.  If a man is taxable he puts his rates against his tax, but if he is not taxable he cannot claim on his rates.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to be critical of the Government if it is necessary.  In the circumstances the Government's proposals have been reasonable.  Maybe I am a bad politician.  I am my own man and always <Col N="1661" /> have been.  It is up to each person to give praise where it is deserved.  This way a man will be listened to.  A person giving a lecture about how politicians should broadcast said that when two politicians come on the screen the neutral observer turns off the television set.  If Deputy Bruton and I were on television the neutral observer would expect Deputy Bruton to say one thing and me to contradict him.  If either of us said what we thought was good, our constructive criticism would be listened to.</P>
    <P>Years ago I knew two great politicians in my area.  Before meeting publicly they would have a drink and A would tell B to attack him immediately because he said he was no good unless attacked.  When the constituency was changed one of these men&mdash;A&mdash;was outside a church gate.  A very cute man from an opposing party with a great sense of humour said: &ldquo;There is a very fine gentleman who has not been in this constituency for some time.  I want you to listen carefully to him because he is a man of common sense and is well worth listening to.&rdquo;  A went to B and asked him to tell the other politician to attack him over anything because, he said, he was not able to say two words unless he was attacked.  That was the old game of politics but I do not believe in it.  I believe in being as fair as I can.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> I do not like the resource tax but the Taoiseach has been misquoted on this. He did not say it could be negotiated this year.  What he said, as far as I recollect, was that it was a temporary measure.  He also said that farming taxation will not be operated properly for another 12 months.  As I said, I am against the resource tax because I do not believe in a tax that does not take into account whether a person is making money.</P>
    <P>The new commission on taxation may come up with another system but I do not know how one can tax anybody unless it is on his income.  A purchase tax hits the poor as well as the rich, but if a man is below a certain income he does not pay income tax.  I would be very glad to hear of a system that is fair to everybody.  Many people say that a tax on income is a disincentive and I agree, because the higher the income the more tax a person pays, but is there any other system?  If so I would be glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>I met a number of farmers at fairs and they are not too satisfied with the budget.  Nobody is satisfied when he is taxed, but the Government must get in the tax.  I shall have a good deal to say about the redistribution of that tax.</P>

I indicated this view to the president of the Irish Vocational Education Association in a letter of 11 October 1979.</P>
      <P>I would see the selection board consisting of the chief executive officer of the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; committee, three other members of the board of management, at least one of whom would be a member of the VEC, and my own nominee.  It appears to me to be more appropriate, and indeed advantageous, that the principal of the college should be present at a meeting of a selection board as a nonvoting adviser, rather than as a full member of the board.</P>

      <P>Oral tests have been an integral part of the leaving certificate examination in Irish for many years and of the French &mdash;Alternative Mode&mdash;examination at intermediate certificate level since 1972. There is also provision in the regulations for the assessment, at intermediate level of oral proficiency in all modern languages which are included in the approved curriculum.</P>
      <P>I have decided in principle that oral tests will be introduced into leaving certificate examination in modern continental languages on a phased basis in the eighties.  As a first step in this direction, I have launched a pilot scheme, in French only, on an optional basis for candidates taking the leaving certificate examination in that subject in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second step will be to convene a <Col N="1627" /> Syllabus Advisory Committee in French, which, with the benefit of the evaluation of this pilot project, will revise the syllabus in French with a view to incorporating this kind of test as an integral part of the leaving certificate examination in French in the mid-eighties.

When applied to the elderly population of Dublin these guidelines indicate that the numbers of beds available, many of which are in private nursing homes, are sufficient to meet requirements.</P>
      <P>This matter is at present under examination, in relation to the demand being experienced for accommodation for elderly persons in south Dublin, by a working group representing the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals, the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health.  This group is at present preparing its report.</P>

      <P>The volumes of ash suitable for hurley manufacture offered for sale by the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department over the last four years were as follows: 1976, 20,000 cubic feet; 1977, 16,000 cubic feet; 1978, 20,500 cubic feet; 1979, 12,000 cubic feet.</P>
      <P>Ash is normally sold to hurley manufacturers and not direct to the GAA.  Availability of ash is based, of course, on planting carried out 25 to 30 years ago.</P>

      <Col N="1634" /> My Department are conscious of the association's need, and plant ash trees in State forests where suitable sites are available.  I met representatives of the GAA recently to discuss their problems in this connection.</P>
