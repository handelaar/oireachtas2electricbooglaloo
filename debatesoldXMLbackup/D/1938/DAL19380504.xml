      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state why the application of Joseph Cullen, of Ballyrannell, Glenbrien, County Wexford, for a holding in the sub-division of the lands of Miss Sweetman and Miss Murphy, at Glenbrien, was refused, considering that he lives within a quarter of a mile of the lands divided, and that some of those whose applications were successful live two miles away from it; and if he is aware that he has two horses <Col N="461" /> and two sons to put to work on such land, has no land at present, and has to take grass for his horses two miles away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of Joseph Cullen for land on the estates in question was fully considered by the Land Commission, but owing to the limited area available for distribution it was not found possible to provide him with a parcel on either estate.  In the event of other lands in the district being acquired by the Land Commission Joseph Cullen can renew his application for an allotment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Joseph Cullen has been working for the last 38 years for the county council, that he has got two horses and two sons working, and that he has not a perch of land?  He has to buy hay, oats and everything else he requires for the horses.  He has also to take grazing for these horses, two miles away from where he lives.  I think it very unfair that he was not given an allotment.  He was surely entitled to it, anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to give authority for the issue out of the Central Fund of any sum, not exceeding £10,000,000, required to give effect to any Act of the present session, for the carrying out of the Financial Agreement which was made on the 25th day of April of this year between this Government and the Government of the United Kingdom. The Bill also provides a charge on the Central Fund for principal and interest on all securities issued under it. I do not think it is necessary for me to detain the House by making a long speech in regard to this matter.  The terms of the Financial Agreement have been already approved of by the House, and the powers we are seeking under the Bill are those which it is desirable <Col N="464" /> we should have in order to give effect to the decision of the Dáil in that regard.  I may say that it is our intention at an early date to ask our citizens to assist the Exchequer in making good this payment, and I have no doubt our request will be very favourably received. I have no doubt that as on a previous occasion, when all Parties in this House were asked to assist in undertaking the conversion of the first National Loan their cordial co-operation will be forthcoming, and, therefore, I have no doubt whatever of our ability to raise the £10,000,000 required to fulfil the Agreement.</P>

      <P>I have not been approached in connection with this matter, other than what has been stated by the Minister for Finance, in asking the citizens of this State to subscribe to a Loan for this purpose.  No doubt, every person of goodwill who has the interests of the country at heart will recommend the acceptance of the Loan.  In the new circumstances which will arise directly this Agreement is implemented, the prospects for the agricultural section of the community will be much more favourable.  Those favourable reactions must affect, beneficially, industrial activities throughout the State and, in consequence, the filling of this Loan is a matter upon which any person, who has any knowledge whatever of business, in the best interests of the country, would be anxious to recommend to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have given the fullest consideration to a suggestion which, I think, appeared recently in the newspapers, and I am satisfied that this is the only way in which this money could be economically raised, and that it is in the best interests of our country that it should be raised by public subscription.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, of course, absolutely necessary to carry out the Agreement.  The raising of this money and the payment to <Col N="465" /> Great Britain were agreed to by the House last week and as the Minister has pointed out, by accepting the Agreement it must agree to accept this Bill, and must also do its best to see that the money is raised.  Otherwise, the Agreement could not be carried out.  Whatever may be thought about the Bill, everyone must agree that the most must be made out of the Agreement.  It is, I take it, a definite settlement between the two countries. On this side, we are glad that the Agreement was made with Great Britain.  That, I think, is one of the best things about this Bill and I think we should help in every way to carry out the Agreement.  The best thing about it is that practically the whole country is committed to it, and that, therefore, it will be carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of it is to enable the Government to carry into effect Article 5 (2) and Articles 9 and 10 of the Trade Agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom relating to the importation of wheat offals, seed oats, seed wheat, wheat and barley in grain, malted barley, and certain feeding stuffs for animals, and biscuits.  The importation of all these commodities is at present subject to control under Part VII of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act of 1933.  If this provision under Part VII had been somewhat more elastic no additional legislation would be required.  As it is, however, some amendments of Part VII of the Act have been found to be necessary, and as a result this measure has been brought in.  It is found more convenient to repeal Part VII entirely and to re-enact the provisions that are necessary than to insert the necessary amendments in the original Act.  This <Col N="467" /> is made all the more necessary, because two amending Acts have come in in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The fact, however, that this Bill looks rather long does not mean that it contains any more than the necessary amendments to bring this Agreement into force.  Under the Act of 1933, certain animal feeding stuffs specified in the Third Schedule of the Act were exempted from restriction on importation, but power was vested in the Minister under the Act to place these feeding stuffs on a prohibited list.  If on the prohibited list, they could only be admitted under licence.  Since 1933 an oil refinery has been set up in business in Drogheda, and as a result of that certain feeding stuffs were added to the list.  As the 1933 Act is drawn, we find that we cannot remove those articles from the list without this amending Bill.</P>
      <P>Power is being taken in this Bill to enable the Minister for Agriculture to transfer any commodity, including any commodity produced in a particular country, from the prohibited list to the exempted list, and in that way to have the particular commodity admitted free of duty from the country named.  But it will be possible, if this Bill goes through, to make an Order to remove wheat offals produced in the United Kingdom from the prohibited list.  At the moment, as the legislation stands, a licence would have to be issued for each individual consignment coming in, but if this Bill is passed, the wheat offals can be transferred from the prohibited list, and thereafter wheat offals will be allowed in without any licence or without any formality of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, power is being taken by the Minister for Agriculture to make an order providing for the importation, without a licence, by farmers living near the Border of the animal feeding stuffs that they may require for use on their own farms.  This provision is particularly necessary in the case of feeding stuffs as applying to the County Donegal.  For instance, certain feeding stuffs such as linseed cake, were particularly difficult to procure in <Col N="468" /> the County Donegal on account of freight and so on, but under this measure it will be possible to allow a certain amount of trade across the Border where farmers are at a disadvantage under the present regulation.</P>
    <P>The new features of this proposed legislation might be summarised by saying that the Bill enables orders to be made for the importation without licence of certain commodities which at present could only be imported under licence, and the re-imposition, should the occasion arise, of restrictions on the importation of such commodities.  It enables effective quantitative regulation to be maintained and, at the same time, provides that only the produce or manufacture of certain countries may be admitted without restriction.</P>
    <P>That is as far as the feeding stuffs go.  Part II of the Bill deals with a matter which really comes within the province of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The only essential difference between this part of the Bill and the existing legislation is that the Minister will have power to make an order providing for the importation, without a licence, of any commodity which at present can be imported only under licence.  That power will be used with regard to biscuits which will be allowed in free of quantitative control under the Agreement with Great Britain. Another provision, which is not contained in the present legislation, enables the Revenue Commissioners to require a return by the importer or carrying company concerned of articles which may be unlawfully imported.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Cereals Act, 1933, dealing with the exports of certain feeding stuffs has been retained and re-enacted.  This provision enables an Order to be made prohibiting the export, except under licence, of any feeding stuffs for animals.  That power is being used at the moment in the case of mill offals and of beet pulp.  It is intended to re-enact and to use these powers again and to make the necessary order prohibiting the export of wheat offals or beet pulp from this country, as it is considered that we require all the wheat offals that we produce here for our own use.  From henceforth, I <Col N="469" /> think, we shall require all the beet pulp that we produce.  During the last three or four years we gave a licence for a certain quantity of beet pulp to go out, but the quantity has been getting smaller and smaller.

      <P>I would like to know if we are bound, by all the restrictions that are in this Bill, to give the implementation that is necessary to the Agreement.  I find on looking over the Bill that the system of licences is still being kept alive.  We, on this side, generally object to this licensing system, and whether one likes it or not, it is inevitable that there should be dissatisfaction with it.  Certain people claim that they cannot get licences, while others are alleged to be able to get them immediately.  It is not a satisfactory arrangement.  In one part of the Bill the question of permits is dealt with.  In both cases, of licences and permits, but certainly in the case of permits, permission is given to import under certain conditions.  It is stated in one of the sections that, a licence having been given, it may be revoked.  I would like to know from the Minister whether, in the case of the revocation of a licence, an importer will get sufficient notice to enable him to stop the transit of certain articles so that he will not be faced with the cost of them, and, generally speaking, if efforts will be made in the administration of this measure to facilitate, as much as possible, the people who will require to import these feeding stuffs?  In view of what the Minister has said regarding the Act being merely an implementing Act, it is not now the time to discuss the limitations in respect of feeding stuffs so far as agriculturists generally are concerned. I am accepting in its full implications the Minister's statement that the Bill does not go beyond merely implementing the Agreement.</P>

      <P>In very many cases, small farmers are unable to buy those feeding stuffs in substantial quantities.  The large farmers will be getting the entire benefit of this, while the poor people whose interests the Minister should help will receive no benefit at all.  I think it would be much better if some device could be evolved whereby the merchants could <Col N="471" /> import a certain quantity on a quota basis.  I am afraid that the benefits which the Minister purports to give those people will not reach them at all.  The man who has enough money can get his stuff anywhere.  He can buy substantial quantities and get cheaper rates.  If he has a lorry of his own he can avoid all the lorry expenses, whereas the benefits which the Minister purports to confer on the small people will not reach them at all.  The Minister stated here that he intended to give them to the farmers for their own use.  That may seem all right, but the Minister must remember that the small farmers will purchase in small quantities, because they have not the money to purchase in large quantities.  It would be better if those permits were given to merchants who are in the habit of importing those feeding stuffs.  They could be given to them on a quota basis&mdash;on the basis of the quantities which they purchased in previous years.</P>

      <P>To my mind there are two points in regard to this Bill which are worthy of special attention.  The first has been touched on by Deputy McMenamin, and that is the statement of the Minister that he proposes to make an order which will allow the free import of certain things from Northern Ireland.  I think anything which in any way lowers the wall that at the present moment exists between us and the people of Northern Ireland is a thing to be very thankful for.  The other point may or may not be a new one, because I have not studied the Principal Act, but under Section 10 it is indicated that certain things may be imported free of duty if they are brought in by an individual or are sent to him personally as a gift.  I think that is new?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave on the restriction of importation under Chapter II, Part III, the principal items dealt with there are wheat, maize and compound feeding stuffs.  In this particular case, there is a register, and, before removing a person from that register as an importer, he must get, I think, 14 or 21 days' notice&mdash;I am not exactly sure which at the moment.  The Minister must be prepared to listen to any points he may put up in his own favour before actually removing him from the register.  With regard to the other cases, I think it is hardly possible to deal with them except under that licensing system.  For instance, this Drogheda factory turns out a fair quantity of some feeding stuffs, and the agreement which we have with them provides that they must sell at the price which would be prevalent, that is, a certain price related to the Liverpool price.  If they exceed that at any moment, then we allow the commodity in fairly freely until they come down to that price again.  But if they are turning out a fair quantity of the material required, and if the price is correct, I think it is only right that we should then protect them.  It is very difficult to think of any other system except the one we have, that is allowing in under licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite realise the objection which Deputy Cosgrave has to this system of licensing.  No matter how careful the officials dealing with this may be, probably some merchant will think he has a grievance, and perhaps some merchant may actually have a grievance in some cases.  It is very difficult, indeed, to see that fair play is meted out, especially when you have only a small quantity to allow in.  Perhaps there would hardly be sufficient to go around to everybody.  As far as I am concerned I should like if we could get away from this licensing system.  I did intend, when the Estimate came before the Dáil to deal with the matter more fully, and try to give the House some indication as to what the future policy would be with regard to feeding stuffs, <Col N="473" /> and whether the time has arrived when we might modify it to some extent at least.  At any rate, I think on that occasion we might have an opportunity of considering the whole policy with regard to feeding stuffs.  With regard to the matter raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, the point is that we have power under this Bill to give the same facilities to any country as we might give to the United Kingdom.  I do not think we intend to do that.  I have not come across any case where we would, but, even if we did, it would in no way interfere with the Agreement, because the Agreement does not put on us the onus of imposing a new tariff against any particular country.  The Agreement does say that, if there is a tariff already there, the United Kingdom product should have a certain advantage over the products of other countries.  At any rate we would naturally keep this point in mind, and see that the Agreement was not in any way broken by anything we might do under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There was more than that in Deputy O'Sullivan's point. Obviously, the sum and substance of this Agreement, if I interpret it correctly, is to develop and increase as far as is reasonably possible, in the mutual interests of both countries, the trade of one country with the other.  Now, in this particular case, it would be all to the good if, by reason of our purchase of a particular commodity of this class from the British, we lessened the demand&mdash;if I might put it that way&mdash;for the purchase of industrial goods.  Does the Minister see my point now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there will be the question of quantity&mdash;the safeguarding of our industries, and presumably that will be one of the tests &mdash;I think our interests ought to be to <Col N="474" /> endeavour to purchase as much goods from them as will not interfere with our industrial activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that, if there is sufficiency of a product of a particular kind to be got there, we would not go to another country, but there are certain products of which, I think, there would not be sufficient. For instance, linseed products is one of the commodities I have in mind and that I have examined.  I do not think that we could get sufficient products from the United Kingdom, and in that case, we might have to go to another country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  At certain times I think it would apply even to some of the manufactured products also.  However, I do not like to be dogmatic about it, but I think that is one of the products that we could not get in sufficient quantities at all times.  I quite agree with Deputy Cosgrave, however, that if we could get sufficient of a product from the United Kingdom, we would not go to another country or extend the facilities we are getting here to another country. Deputy McMenamin raised a point about farmers trading over the Border.  I think we should be able to get over that difficulty without imposing on each farmer the necessity of coming for a permit.  There could be some kind of a general order issued, such as that a product for his own use would be free, and there would be no necessity for issuing a permit in each case.  Deputy McMenamin suggests that we might even extend that facility to the merchants with, perhaps, some safeguard with regard to quantity.  If that is feasible I am quite prepared to consider it and see if something can be done</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, I see the point from the point of view of a small farmer living so many miles from the Border, and I shall have that examined with a view to seeing whether or not something can be done.  With regard to Deputy Benson's point as to the free importation of wheat products in certain cases, I do not think that, if there has been inconvenience with regard to imports here as presents and so on around Christmas time, it applies to wheat products.  It may apply to other commodities, but not to wheat products.</P>

My point is that, where a licence is given, under other sections here the Minister takes power to revoke the licence to import, although he prescribes various conditions, and my point is that the person may not get sufficient notice and that he may only get notice when the stuff is already at the port of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, or some other port.  I hold that he should be served with notice before the stuff is put on board, and thus save him the cost of transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The special object of this Bill is to enable the Government to carry into effect the provisions of Article 9 (2) of the Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom.  In this Article the United Kingdom Government recognises that it may be necessary for our Government, in pursuance of their agricultural policy, to regulate the imports of certain agricultural products, including those set out in Schedule 4 of the Agreement.  The Article further provides that in such cases the quantities of United Kingdom products admitted from time to time shall be the subject of consultation between the two Governments and shall be fixed in accordance with the general principles of the Agreement. The products which are included in the Schedule comprise live pigs; bacon and hams; certain classes of cereals and of feeding stuffs for animals; certain classes of fish; certain classes of fruit and fruit pulp or juice; certain classes of vegetables; grass seeds; forest and fruit trees; and nursery stock and flowers.  Article 9 further provides that duties may be imposed by our Government in agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom on the products referred to in cases where it appears that the benefits in view can be more conveniently effected by this means. There may be a duty imposed in certain cases, by agreement, instead of a quantitative regulation, and in a Bill <Col N="477" /> already circulated to Deputies, which is the last of this series of Bills, they will notice that there is one Schedule which contains a number of duties to be imposed on fruits and fish, and in these particular cases quantitative control will not arise.  There is a number of cases, however, where the United Kingdom Government is not agreeable to a duty, and we must, therefore, have consultation about quantitative control, and it is for these items that this Bill is necessary. These items will be live pigs and bacon, fruit pulp and juice and certain other fruits and rye grass seed.</P>
      <P>The Bill, accordingly, enables the Minister for Agriculture to make orders regulating the importation of any agricultural or fishery product or any specified kind of such product.  The order may fix the quantity of such product or kind of product that may be imported; the country or countries from which it may be imported, and the conditions to be attached to licences or permits allowing its importation. The penalties for infringements of the order are to be fixed in the order, which may also contain all such conditions as appear to be necessary for securing the operation and enforcement of the scheme of regulation contained in the order.  Every order will be laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Goods prohibited to be imported by an order can be dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners in the same manner as other prohibited or restricted goods are dealt with under existing Customs Acts.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners are given power to serve notices on the importer of any consignment imported in contravention of an order requiring such person to export the articles within a specified time.  Although the Bill, admittedly, gives wide powers, I think that at least I can say that it is not a difficult Bill to understand, and therefore I have nothing further to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>While we can agree with the Minister in bringing in this Bill, there is no reason why, in a Bill such as this, the process of prohibiting <Col N="478" /> imports should be brought to a pitch which has not been the practice formerly. I should like to point out that the prohibition of imports in Section 42 of the Customs Consolidated Act, 1876, refers to a list of goods which are known to be prohibited, and the forfeit and destruction of such goods should not be applied in the case of goods suddenly prohibited where a consignment arrives, the arrival of which could not be prevented.  Such goods in transit should either be permitted to land or be allowed to be exported or confiscated at the wish of the consignee. Forfeit or destruction should only apply where the consignee was aware that the goods were prohibited.</P>
      <P>There is a further extension of what we might call the policy of prohibition. Section 3 (2) goes further even than Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act in permitting officers of Customs and Excise to compel the importer or carrier to export the goods within a specified time with liability to a fine of £50 for non-compliance.  This extension of the Customs laws ought not to appear in this Bill.  It is an extension of the powers of the Customs which makes them really the judge and jury in the case of a consignment. There ought to be a preliminary period for goods in transit similar to the period in the Control of Imports Act, with the following addition&mdash;that fishery products and perishable agricultural products which were in transit at the date of the prohibition order and arrived within 24 hours of such date should be permitted to be imported under the conditions in force immediately prior to the prohibition order. It would be obviously unjust to hold up a consignment of fish, the arrival of which could not have been prevented, and it would be worse still if the importer were to be put to the expense of re-exporting under the proposed Section 3 (2).  I am not going to charge the Minister with being unreasonable. At the same time there is no reason why he should take powers only short of taking off a person's head and then say: &ldquo;Of course these regulations are not going to be enforced and we will deal with each case on its merits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> Section 2 contains an extension of the Minister's powers by means of orders.  He may make a specific infringement of an order an offence punishable on summary conviction and fix penalties for such an offence.  In all Acts it is usual in a section under which offences are possible to state that a contravention of the section is an offence and to specify in a separate section the penalty for offences under the Act.  It is not in accordance with the usual practice of law to allow a Minister by order to specify crime and fix penalties.  I suggest to the Minister that that is really giving him powers over property and persons which might be in conflict with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Another question which I have raised repeatedly here is the sovereignty of this Assembly.  Before any penalties are inflicted the Oireachtas should have an opportunity of seeing that the punishment fits the crime.  I commend to the Minister these remarks which are not meant as criticism of the Bill as implementing the Agreement, but as a criticism of the extension of the extraordinary bureaucratic powers of various Government Departments and Government officials which ought not to be brought in under the guise of a Bill such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would avail of the opportunity of saying what he expects from the operation of this portion of the Agreement. We had that Agreement before us when we passed it, naturally, but I do not think it was ever fully explained to us how exactly it will operate, what precisely is the view of both parties to the Agreement as to what will follow from the Agreement itself, which this is to enable the Minister to carry out. I hope the Minister will consider the points made by Deputy Dockrell.  Is it necessary for the carrying out of the Agreement to take such drastic powers as the Minister takes?  If so, undoubtedly we are committed to them. But, was all that drastic assumption of powers necessary?  Is there no other method by which it could be done, without inflicting this loss on people who, on the whole, are innocent people so far as that is concerned?  There would <Col N="480" /> be great inconvenience caused, as Deputy Dockrell pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill raises in a very acute manner a point I put to the Minister in connection with a previous Bill.  For example, under Section 2&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, make an order regulating, in such manner and by such means as he thinks proper, the importation of any agricultural product or fishery product...</P>
      <P>If, say, an order were made on a Wednesday night prohibiting the importation of fish, and if a consignment of fish were on its way on Thursday into the market here, does it follow from the making of an order that the purchaser of the fish has to deal with the arrival of the fish and pay for its transport back, if it was worth while sending back?</P>
      <P>Similarly with regard to Section 4, which says:</P>
      <P>Where an offence under any order made under this Act... was committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any neglect on the part of any director, manager, secretary, or other officer...</P>
      <P>That is a very comprehensive list of persons, and neglect, I think, is qualified in most of the Customs code as being wilful neglect. I suppose the Minister reads newspapers occasionally, and he may have observed some pictures the other day in connection with a professor having forgotten about his car which appeared in a well-known Dublin newspaper. For a mere matter of forgetfulness of that sort, it would be a very severe penalty if a professor were fined £50 or sent to Mountjoy for three months.  I think the Minister ought to consider the terminology of that again, and that, at least, notice should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directly this dispute between the two countries took place we were saddled with a new code here called the <Col N="481" /> Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act. In essence, this is really a sort of stepbrother of that particular statutory enactment and we ought to try to get away from that, if it is possible to do it.  I am at one with the Minister in implementing the Agreement, but it would appear that we are taking very drastic powers.  For example, take the question of an order.  Does it mean that every fishmonger has to 'phone up Government Buildings to know if they are thinking of making an order on a certain day if he is thinking of ordering a consignment of fish?  That would be a nuisance to the Minister as well as to the importers.  If the order were only published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i>, some people might not see it, as they probably never heard of that publication.</P>
    <P>In connection with this particular measure, and in fact every other measure implementing this Agreement, an endeavour should be made to make it as easy as possible for people who are in business, people who may suffer by reason of neglect even though it be not wilful, but through lack of information about these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I can quite appreciate the points raised by Deputy Dockrell and the other Deputies on the rather drastic powers which the Revenue Commissioners would have under this Bill, and it is a point that I had considered before bringing in the Bill, but I was told by the Revenue Commissioners that from their long experience they find it necessary to have these powers more or less in that form.  Now, the point about not mentioning the fine is one of some difficulty.  There are some rather big items under this; fish, I suppose, would be the biggest item of import and bacon would be very big, and there are very small items like tomatoes and grass seeds and things like that, and we thought it better to have a moderate system of fines, but it is very difficult to put them into the Bill.  The list that is published is not necessarily an exhaustive list.  Other items may be added from time to time by agreement between the two countries. We could not possibly put down a fine as applicable to each article <Col N="482" /> because we did not know what articles would be there, and it was considered a better system to have the fine mentioned in the order.  Otherwise I think you would have to put down a very high fine as applicable in all cases.  I can only justify it on this account because we may be able to arrange for smaller fines in the order than we could in the Bill, but I have no great objection if anyone in the House thinks it is necessary.  It will have to be a very heavy fine in that case.</P>
      <P>Another point raised by Deputy Dockrell was that we came down suddenly and stopped the import of certain goods.  I think what he has in mind probably is that there was what could be regarded as normal trade between two countries and that we stopped that trade.  What has happened is the trade was stopped already.  I think fish is the only item which is coming in.  No tomatoes, no bacon, no fat pigs, none of those things that are mentioned are coming in at all, so that if we do make an order we are not going to injure anybody, because if we give two days' notice it is two days' notice to the people that they may begin to trade then, not that they must stop within the two days.  In the case of fish, which was raised by Deputy Cosgrave, I can assure the Deputies that if we do have to regulate the import of fish &mdash;we shall certainly have to regulate it in some way&mdash;but when we do make a prohibition order, at the same time we state that a certain quantity will be allowed in each week from the United Kingdom and not allowed in from elsewhere, so that nobody will be upset practically at all under such an order.  And if there were any possibility that we would be upsetting traders in any way we would give notice.  Fish is one of the things where we could give good notice, because you cannot very well arrange to have a dump of fish brought in and kept here; it does not keep well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Deputy O'Sullivan asked me how did we visualise this operating. If we take a few examples it is the easiest way to explain it, I think. Bacon is one.  There are certain interests in the United Kingdom that <Col N="483" /> believe they could do a certain trade in perhaps a choice type of bacon here, and we, on our side, could not argue very strongly against the case. If they want to send bacon to us and we are sending bacon to them we could not argue against it.  If they agreed to add that quantity on to our quota, which they would, then we would allow a certain quantity in and then we would do what they do, that is, we would send a permit for a certain number of cwts. per month to the British Government and they would look after that part of it and give it to those they thought right, and then they would export it and the exporter in sending bacon into this country would send also the permit&mdash;one of the permits that is given to the British Government&mdash;and our Customs people would allow the bacon through when accompanied by that certificate.</P>
    <P>Tomatoes is another example.  We import a certain amount of tomatoes here during our own tomato season and the British producers have a surplus of tomatoes now and we see no great objection to taking some of that surplus from them provided we have a deficiency in our own production here. In the same way, we issue certificates weekly or monthly&mdash;I do not know which in the case of tomatoes&mdash;the periods have to be arranged to suit the particular commodity&mdash;but we issue these certificates to the British Government and again they give them to whoever they think best themselves to export the tomatoes from the United Kingdom into this country and the tomatoes come in accompanied by that certificate.</P>
    <P>Seed oats would be another example, but it would come in all at once at a particular time of the year. I think, in the case of seed oats we would give a permit for so much.  That is one of the cases where we have practically reached agreement with regard to quantity.  Say, 25,000 cwts. of seed oats would be allowed in for the season.  In that particular case we would give, I think, the whole permit at the same time, say, in the month of September or October and it could be imported here at any time <Col N="484" /> up to the 1st May&mdash;give a liberal day anyway for the sowing of oats.  Seed oats accompanied by that certificate would be allowed in by our Customs people free of duty and so on.  There would be no duty or anything else on seed oats coming in.</P>
    <P>That is the way, roughly, these quotas will work.  As I said, the list that is given in the Agreement is a list of articles that we thought might be dealt with this present year, that is, dealt with by a tariff or by quantitative control.  But you will see that the Article enables the two Governments to add other items to the list if necessity arises for it and therefore there may be other articles covered by this Bill that are not mentioned in that Schedule and it does make it difficult to deal with penalties and other things on a firm basis at the moment and that is why this Bill does provide for perhaps wider powers than usual in the Orders that we put before both Houses.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that these penalties, owing to their magnitude, apply to importers who are importing considerable quantities of stuff?  Take the question that he is dealing with&mdash;seed oats.  Assume that I am importing 1 cwt.&mdash;not importing it at all, but that I am smuggling it&mdash;a small farmer, living on the Border, smuggling 1 cwt. of oats.  On the other hand, somebody else is an importer, importing a considerable quantity of oats; and for my 5 stone of corn that I want for a small bog field somewhere am I to be fined £50, and the man who is importing 10 tons or 5 tons, or trying to do it, is he only to pay £50?  I think this penalty business is a bit overdrawn.  I would like the Minister to reconsider this section with regard to penalties.  If the Minister would look at the definition section&mdash;paragraph (b) of Section 1. What does the Minister mean by including in (b) of 1, &ldquo;any animal&rdquo;?

      <P>There are one or two questions I am not clear about. One I am quite clear about, I admit. I understand the Minister himself was rather surprised at the drastic powers he was taking and went to the Revenue Commissioners and asked them.  He was not surprised with the answer, I expect, that they could not do without them.  What other answer would the Minister ever get from the Revenue Commissioners?  There is another point the Minister might clear up.  Take the question of the importation of fish.  I gather that the amount to be allowed in will be decided each week.  Suppose I am a fishmonger in Tralee and I want to import fish.  Friday, of course, is the day for which I want to import it, because, otherwise, I am practically out of that business.  What will be the position with regard to the gross amount that will be allowed in every week and how will that gross amount, in the case of fish or seed oats, be divided amongst the different people who order from here?  Is there any method of dealing with that?  For instance, a Dublin merchant may order the whole quantity and get in first.  Must all the people down the country take it from him, or can a man get it from a fish wholesaler on the other side?  A fishmonger is never sure whether he will get it or not until it is too late for him to lay in a supply for the Friday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in the case of fish, we would have to announce the weekly quantity well beforehand and over and above that, we should want to have a provision for importing our deficiency. If we were bringing in 100,000 cwts., which is a large quantity, in the year, we might say: &ldquo;We will issue licences for the whole year on the basis <Col N="486" /> of 1,500 cwts., but we will vary the remainder from week to week.&rdquo;  How we are going to manage that variable amount, I do not know at the moment.</P>

      <P>No.  We hope to get advice from the people concerned.  We are not pushed at the moment with regard to fish.  We can take our time and consider what is the best way to do it, getting all the advice we can.  It is really a difficult problem.  Seed oats, will, I think, give no great trouble because we can decide in August or September that we will allow so much in for the season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point which has to be decided.

If, however, we wanted to have an easy time in the Department, we would give them to the British Government, but that might not suit in all cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  These things, however, will have to get every consideration which we can give them. We are up against only a few items which we have to fix up.  Bacon is one which we shall have to fix up soon. In the case of others, we shall have time.  Seed oats, grass seed and so on are seasonal, and we shall have plenty of time to think over them.  With regard to Deputy McMenamin's point, I do not think that the Deputy read the section closely.  The Revenue <Col N="487" /> Commissioners cannot inflict the maximum penalty of their own volition. They must go to court and they are not likely to get the maximum penalty.  If a farmer claims before a district justice that he is a poor man, and that he tried to get in a cwt. of oats, our experience is that the poor farmer gets off very lightly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill is intended to widen the scope of the Poultry (Diseases) Act, 1934, which gives power to regulate the importation for hatching purposes of certain classes of poultry eggs.  This Act was passed as a precaution against the introduction of poultry diseases with eggs from other countries, and, at that time, only hatching eggs were being imported because there was a heavy duty on commercial eggs coming into the country. The Agreement now provides for the removal of duties on commercial eggs coming into the country from Great Britain, and it is necessary, therefore, to get somewhat extended powers with regard to the regulation of disease in hatching eggs.  The way in which we can do this is to get power to control the importation of all classes of poultry eggs so that measures may be taken to prevent the introduction and spread of any disease which may be carried by means of eggs.</P>
      <P>Section 2 widens the definition of poultry for the purpose of the proposed control to include ducks and geese.  This is necessary on account of the spread of fowl pest, which is a disease affecting ducks and geese.  In the order which will be made under the proposed legislation, eggs for hatching will be imported only under a licence, and we mean to facilitate, if necessary, the importation of commercial eggs, while providing for an exemption from the proposed control of consignments of commercial eggs from the United Kingdom packed in cases of not less than 360 eggs, that is, three great hundreds, which is a small case, and also to exempt eggs coming over the Border and brought in by farmers to the market town.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, coming over the land frontier to the market town. Power is also being taken to regulate the movement and use of eggs within the State.  I should mention that this <Col N="490" /> is not necessary for the implementing of this Agreement, but it is necessary for other reasons, and I am asking the House to allow this power also.  The great bulk of the eggs used for hatching comes from the stations which are administered by the Committees of Agriculture and we rarely have an outbreak of disease in any of these stations.  Whenever we have an outbreak of disease, we have no great difficulty in controlling it because the owner of the station is always prepared to carry out any instruction he or she may get from the Department. But in the case of the larger breeders of poultry, when we have an outbreak of disease, we have no power to stop them from selling these eggs and we are taking the opportunity of this Act to get that power.</P>
      <P>Section 3 gives power to suspend an order made under the Diseases of Animals Act.  At present, there is no such power.  An order, once made, can be altered or revoked but it cannot be suspended.  It is desirable to have power to suspend in certain cases.  Section 4 imposes an obligation on a person who has imported illegally to export the consignment again.  It raises somewhat the same issue which has already been raised by Deputy McGovern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>In this series of Bills, we have another outbreak of licensing.  The Minister will agree that this practice of permitting the import of eggs for hatching only under license is very objectionable.  I appreciate the Minister's desire to prevent the spread of disease but I also see difficulty regarding the importation of eggs for hatching under licence.  If a woman wants a dozen of turkey eggs or a dozen of some particular class of hen eggs for hatching, it is proposed that she should have to apply for a licence to obtain these eggs.  She will not do that.  The small farmers' wives are the backbone of the poultry and egg industry and, if there is any case in which licensing is objectionable, it is in their case.  If the Minister acted in conjunction with the Ministers for Agriculture in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, this provision would be quite unnecessary.  If the Minister ascertained whether the Ministers <Col N="491" /> in these areas had regulations providing for penalties against citizens who exported eggs from stations or poultry farms in which there was disease, he might be able to withdraw this part of the Bill.  The matter is quite simple so far as our own area is concerned.  If there is any disease, its spread should be stopped and we can stop it without licensing.  If the Minister could arrange with the Ministers of Northern Ireland and Great Britain to enforce the laws regarding poultry disease within their own jurisdiction, it would make unnecessary the issue of licences for importation of hatching eggs.  The matter would be simplified if there were a central body, like a co-operative society, to get in these eggs in large lots and serve a whole district but, as the Minister knows, there are enormous egg-production areas in which there are no creameries or co-operative societies.  The Minister realises, I am sure, how important it is to provide farmers who have to purchase eggs in small quantities with the simplest possible machinery.  This machinery is cumbersome and technical. These people will not know where to write for licences and they will not write.  We are being licensed out of existence.  I should be sorry if this House should do anything to handicap small farmers in the production of poultry and eggs and I suggest that the Minister should arrange with the other Ministers as indicated by me.</P>

It may be easier administratively to deal with the matter in this way, but the larger powers are being taken under the ægis of this Agreement, while, if they had been brought in independently, we might have a very long discussion on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I may, perhaps, link up these Bills&mdash;the Bill we have disposed of and the one with which we are now <Col N="492" /> dealing&mdash;because one deals with eggs going out and the other deals with a certain class of eggs coming in, and they are part of a scheme designed to implement the Agreement adopted here last Friday.  I wonder if, in connection with the consequential agreements that will fall to be made, it would be possible to open up negotiation between our Department of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture of Great Britain with a view to getting the British Department to consent to the admission of our eggs into Great Britain unstamped.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, a new departure was made by the British Department of Agriculture which imposed upon our exporters the necessity for stamping each individual egg with the name of the country of origin.  At present, each individual egg sold in Great Britain bears on the shell an inked mark declaring the egg to have come from Éire or from Saorstát Eireann, as it was.  At the same time, eggs go from the six counties of Northern Ireland into England without any such mark and are sold without comment in retail shops side by side with English eggs.  They are accepted by the English public as domestic produce.  From the point of view of the egg trade, an egg consigned from Dublin and an egg consigned from Belfast have the same advantages. There is no difference in the time lag between the dispatch and consumption as between the two areas, but the exemption of the Northern Ireland shippers from that regulation is a very material advantage not only to the shippers there but to the producers as well.  For one thing, the housewife of Great Britain is naturally inclined to pay a higher price for the unmarked egg, because she regards that as domestic produce, and the second reason is that the actual labour involved in stamping each individual egg is a very considerable overhead cost on the general business of putting eggs into consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know, for one reason or another, that the egg production of this country has dwindled away to practically nothing compared with what it used to be, and I have no doubt that the Minister will agree <Col N="493" /> that it is highly desirable to extract every ounce of advantage that we can out of the Agreement with a view to restoring that great industry to the position which it used to occupy.  If accommodation could be arrived at with the British Department of Agriculture in this matter it would be a very real stimulus to the egg trade of this country and would materially help everybody to get the maximum return out of the concessions secured under the recent Agreement.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy McMenamin's point, I should like the Deputy to realise that we are not doing anything more in this Bill than we have been doing.  With regard to hatching eggs, it was considered necessary some two years ago to bring in a Bill to safeguard the health of our poultry stocks and that Bill permitted the making of regulations with regard to the importation of hatching eggs in breeding poultry.  The prevalence of disease in the countries from which we were importing hatching eggs and breeding poultry was very much worse than in our own country.  I might say that, compared with other countries, we have a very high standard of health in regard to our poultry.  I am now only asking the Dáil to give me the power to make a similar Order by passing this Bill.  The object of the Bill is to allow in commercial eggs. Under the later legislation we could not allow commercial eggs in without allowing hatching eggs also.  This Bill gives us power to allow in commercial eggs and control the importation of hatching eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How will you differentiate between commercial and hatching eggs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we allow in free of any control eggs packed in cases of three great hundreds, and also eggs over the Border&mdash;in the case of farmers doing a local trade over the Border&mdash;in that way we will keep out the hatching eggs.  I do not think Deputy McMenamin is right in assuming that we could act in conjunction with the Ministers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I believe they have <Col N="494" /> the same trouble as we experienced here.  The big commercial poultry owners cannot be controlled, and if they go on selling hatching eggs, there is no way of dealing with them at the moment.  We must deal with this matter ourselves, both in the case of the imported eggs and eggs sold internally.  I do not think any small poultry raiser will be injured by this Order.  I am sure my experience and the experience of other Deputies will be the same.  It is only the big breeder here who has any desire to import a new breed or bring in hatching eggs from other countries.  The big breeders know where the Department is and they know the way to apply for a permit.  If a good case is made, and if the Department is satisfied that the eggs are coming from a clean source, the permit will be given.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon raised a point with regard to the stamping of eggs.  I think that is outside the Agreement.  I do not think the British Government would agree to our eggs going in unstamped.  It is one of the prices we had to pay for our separation as an economic unit from Great Britain, and we would have to go back to the United Kingdom in order to get our eggs in unstamped.  I will mention this by way of consolation to the Deputy.  Legislation is in course of preparation for the improvement of our eggs and the improvement of marketing.  Under the legislation which is being drafted we hope to put our eggs on the British market in the best possible condition and get a name for them which will make them eventually better than even the unstamped eggs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it is rather slow in making its appearance, but it will come soon.  I am not over-optimistic. The same thing has occurred in regard to another commodity, pork.  Pork, when exported, was sold for a long time at a much lower price than the English pork, but when legislation was brought in here to see that pork was exported under proper conditions, it became so well placed on the British <Col N="495" /> market and it was put there in such a good condition that for years it got a higher price than any other pork in the London market.  We are not over-optimistic, but we may be able to do the same for our eggs as soon as we get our legislation through.  Perhaps we ought not to be too despondent about this thing of getting our eggs stamped. It may be all the better in the end. We are always inclined to be optimistic, and perhaps it will be justified in this instance.  I do not think we can possibly get the British to agree to allow our eggs in unstamped.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is introduced with a view to setting up machinery to implement that portion of the Trade Agreement which deals with the question of protective duties and other import restrictions on goods produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom.  The Bill proposes to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to <Col N="496" /> request the Prices Commission to review the operation of the Customs duty upon any imported article, or to review the operation of any restriction upon the importation of any article. When such a request is made to the commission to undertake a review, the commission for the purposes of the Bill have the same powers as are vested in them under various named sections of the Control of Prices Act of 1937.  The object of the Bill is, I think, clear, and further explanation does not appear to be called for.  It is, of course, known to Deputies that the Prices Commission at the present time have power to make recommendations for the variation of Customs duties following a price investigation, but it is desirable, in view of the terms of the Trade Agreement, that we should have power to request them to undertake a review of the Customs duty even in such cases as those in which the price investigation would not be considered necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister could hardly expect us to get into violent opposition against the rehabilitation of the Tariff Commission. Perhaps the Minister also might consider giving the House and the country a general idea as to how matters will be worked, that is as to how these things are to come before the Prices Commission.  I understand the Minister will put them before the Prices Commission but how will this be done and in what order?  Priority, I understand, will lie with the British Government to put some matters before the Prices Commission.  That arises out of the Agreement.  On what lines will the Minister go in deciding priority as to the order in which matters are to be considered by the Prices Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some obscurity in the public mind as to the exact functions of this Prices Commission.  I have heard it suggested by some people on reading the terms of the Agreement with Great Britain that it might be inferred that in certain contingencies the Prices Commission would have the right to command the assent of the Oireachtas.  I would like that point to <Col N="497" /> be cleared up.  The next point is, can the Prices Commission go beyond making a recommendation which Dáil Eireann will be free to accept or reject? Or has the Prices Commission power arising out of the Agreement which has been entered into for a period of three years of binding this Dáil by its findings?  Does our Agreement imply that if the Prices Commission makes a finding that we, by virtue of our approval of the Agreement, will give that finding legislative effect?  I think that point should be cleared up. I assume that the new situation will be something like this&mdash;that the Prices Commission can make a recommendation to us of what they think would be a reasonable level of tariff, to protect our industries and at the same time give British industrialists an opportunity of competing on reasonably fair terms with our industrialists, or whatever else the terms of the Agreement set out; or that it would be open to Dáil Eireann to say &ldquo;We have examined the evidence brought before the Prices Commission; we have examined the reasons which led to its conclusions and we do not accept that reasoning. We think the tariff should be higher or lower than that recommended by the Prices Commission in order to fulfil the spirit and the letter of the Agreement into which we have entered with the British Government.&rdquo;  I think the Minister should make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point with which I would like the Minister to deal would be, in view of the greater responsibilities that are going to be placed upon the Prices Commission, does the Minister intend giving the members of it a different form of tenure of office from that which they at present enjoy?  As I understand it the present tenure of office of a member of the Prices Commission is like that of any other Civil Servant.  He could be moved from that to another Department at a moment's notice.  Does the Minister think that that will secure for him the independent-minded advice that is so necessary?  Would it not be better to give the members of that Commission a quasi-judicial status and a security of tenure in their office of such a character as would render them quite independent of any pressure from any <Col N="498" /> side, leaving them quite free to give their opinion without any apprehension as to their position or their emoluments being interfered with should their recommendations prove unpopular either in this House or in the country? Deputy O'Sullivan contented himself with saying that the Minister need not expect any violent opposition against the rehabilitation of the Tariff Commission. The public memory is notoriously short.  Most people have forgotten that the Tariff Commission was set on foot by the Cosgrave Administration and that it was swept aside by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who said it was a useless and futile organ and that he found a joy and pleasure in abolishing it.  Well, I am glad he has now taken the view that it was not such a useless body as he once thought it was.  I am glad that he has now found it to be a valuable institution to which technical arguments can be referred for consideration, and recommendations sought which are based on the findings of very skilled technical persons who are not interested parties.  The Tariff Commission is now and has been for some time a feature of the British Revenue Administration, a much more experienced revenue administration than ours could ordinarily hope to be.  With all their experience from a very long tariff history they think it well to have a tariff commission which I think they call a Tariff Advisory Board.  We are going to have one now and so far as I am concerned I welcome it.  I think it would be a great help to the Minister and to the Oireachtas in assisting them to consider matters relating to the imposition of tariffs which may hereafter be brought before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">

      <P>There are many important matters arising out of the consideration of this measure.  The most important is that which concerns the sovereignty of this Assembly, which seems to me to be challenged in this Bill before us.  I always understood that this Assembly is the only Assembly which had power to enforce tariffs; that it was the Assembly which had powers to reduce tariffs or to annul them.  Now, another body is being set up which is <Col N="499" /> going to have power to deal with tariffs, to scale them down or to recommend higher tariffs and to take more than its proper share in imposing them.  The Minister may tell us that if tariffs are scaled down the proposal has to go before this Parliament asking for authority for that scaling down, just as when he imposed tariffs he himself had to come before this Assembly to get sanction for that tariff.  Now, if a tariff is to be scaled down the recommendations of the Prices Commission will have to come here for sanction. But let us suppose a situation arising where the annulment of a tariff is recommended, will that annulment have to come before this House? Will the Minister have in this country two authorities, one a law-making authority and another authority by resolution entitled to annul the laws made here?  This is a matter to which a great many people in the country have given much thought&mdash;whether we are going to have a law-making authority in the State and another authority with power to annul these laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what is going to be the procedure of the Prices Commission. In Article 12 it is set out that the review provided for in Article 8 shall be held first of those classes of goods for which the Government of the United Kingdom asks for early consideration. I do not know whether they will ask consideration for a short list or a long list, but I assume that means priority for some particular list.  The Prices Commission must exhaust that list before they get on to any other review of any other article.  I should like the Minister in that connection to give us some idea as to how long that review would take.  I do not want the Minister to say that he is not a prophet and cannot tell what the length of the list presented to the Prices Commission will be.  What I mean is, will this take years to review?  I mentioned earlier that the Prices Commission have had some articles under review for certainly over a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> The next point which I wish to raise has reference to Article 8.  I am assuming, and I hope the Minister will make it quite clear, that having exhausted the preferential list&mdash;I mean the preferential list as regards review that the United Kingdom manufacturers will present to the Prices Commission&mdash;I take it it will be presented to the Government and that the Minister will pass it on to the Prices Commission&mdash;they will then start to review certain other commodities, prices or restrictions.  Is the Minister the only person who can initiate such a review before the Prices Commission? In other words, can a tariff be reviewed in any other way than, firstly, by getting on the preferential list for the United Kingdom, and, secondly, I presume, by the Minister being asked to consider certain other matters?</P>
    <P>I want to be very clear on the next point which I wish to make, if the Minister can answer me.  I take it that most of the procedure will resolve itself into a case between an English plaintiff and an Irish defendant before the Prices Commission.  In other words, an English manufacturer well be looking for some sort of scaling down of the duties and the Irish manufacturer will be more or less contending against that.  At any rate, the Prices Commission will be reviewing the situation. I want to know whether distributors or the general public would have any <i>locus standi</i> before such an inquiry concerning articles in which they are interested.  I raise that point because the trading policies of certain manufacturers are very different from one another and certain nationals in this country might feel that they had a right to appear before the Prices Commission and make their views known to that commission.  Personally, I think that it would be absurd if the Prices Commission could turn around and say: &ldquo;You have no <i>locus standi</i> in this inquiry; it is a question between Irish and English manufacturers and nobody else can be heard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to clear up that point because I am afraid that in a number of instances the consumer has been thought far too little of, and there is a danger that <Col N="501" /> he might take the revenge which is always open to the consumer, namely, that of doing without the article.  I think that is one of the questions that the Minister is liable to underrate.  If the public are smarting under a sense of injustice about some question of tariffs, I think that it should be open to Irish nationals to appear in their own country to make their case before the Prices Commission.  I should like the Minister to clear up that point because, if he does not, I would like to introduce an amendment to widen the scope of the Bill so as to include those members of the public and distributors who might be interested.  I would ask the Minister to reply to that point as fully as he can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill and that portion of the recent Agreement which it purports to implement proposes to permit representatives of British commercial concerns to come before the Prices Commission and, I presume, to call for the production of balance sheets, costings and other information of a confidential or semi-confidential nature in connection with the conduct of an Irish concern.  What I want to know is: does this Bill, the Agreement, or the complementary legislation likely to be introduced in Great Britain and passed through the House of Commons compel the British commercial representative who will come before the Prices Commission also to produce similar information regarding the concern which he will be representing before our Prices Commission here?  I think it would be rather unfair to permit a representative of a British commercial concern to come before our commission as a non-national, get all the confidential or semi-confidential information concerning the working of an Irish concern here, while the Irish concern on the other hand might not be allowed to get similar information from that non-national appearing before the commission regarding the concern which he was representing.  I want to know what is the position either under the terms of the Bill or under that portion of the Agreement which this Bill proposes to implement in connection with that important aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> The Prices Commission, which is in existence and which was recently given extended powers by an Act passed by this House, has, in my opinion, a considerable amount of work to do in connection with the allegations of profiteering that have been going around the country regarding the prices of necessaries of life.  In fact, I believe that I can turn up the records of a statement made in this House by the Minister that it was intended to have the members of the Prices Commission made full-time members for a stipulated period.  If the same body is to do the additional work imposed upon them as the result of the Agreement, surely there is a case for the appointment of a full-time body for that particular purpose? I am in entire agreement with Deputy Dillon when he suggests that that body should be given judicial or quasi-judicial powers so that they would be free from any interference by the Government or by any section of the House in regard to the way in which they perform their duties.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reconsider the whole position of this Commission, if he has any intention of expecting it to do the work it is expected to do in regard to the internal affairs of this country, apart altogether from the additional work imposed upon it by the terms of this Bill, and that portion of the London Agreement which it proposes to implement.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on the Trade Agreement last week I referred to the Prices Commission as a free trade Commission.  I spoke under a misapprehension, and I wish to withdraw that statement.  Deputy Dillon in the course of his remarks said that the British Government had attached to the Revenue Department what he termed a Tariff Advisory Board.  I think that ought to be the function of the Prices Commission, and that it should not have any absolute powers, either to impose tariffs or to reduce them, but simply to refer them to the Government with their advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Dillon referred to this Bill as <Col N="503" /> a Bill to revive the Tariff Commission. In case any person might be led to misunderstand by that description what this Bill proposes to do, I think it desirable to emphasise the vast difference there is between the Tariff Commission established by the Tariff Commission Act of 1926 and the Prices Commission now in existence to which it is proposed to give new functions under this Bill.  The Tariff Commission of 1926 was set up to consider applications for the imposition of tariffs and was provided with very elaborate terms of reference. These terms were so elaborate that they involved that every investigation carried out had to be protracted. It could be said not unfairly that it was a commission designed to delay, or if not to delay, perhaps to prevent the granting of protection to Irish industries. It certainly was worthy of some of the descriptions that were applied to it, and I think the development of industries in this country, and assisting them by means of protective duties, would have been completely impossible if the machinery of the Tariff Commission continued to operate.  The Prices Commission will have no such function as that which was given to the Tariff Commission.  It will have no function at all in relation to the imposition of tariffs.  It will be asked to undertake a review of certain existing duties, with a view to discovering whether these duties could or should be modified, if effect is to be given to the principle set out in Article 8 of the Trade Agreement. In so far as the development of industries by means of tariffs is concerned, and in so far as the granting of applications for the imposition of new tariffs is concerned, the Prices Commission will have no function, and I think it is desirable that the fact should be made clear, that in the promotion of the Government policy of industrialisation the principle followed in the past will be followed in the future.  Any person desiring to embark on a new industrial venture, and desiring the assistance of a tariff for that purpose, will apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce, where his application will be considered.  If a favourable decision is taken of the application by <Col N="504" /> the Government a tariff will be proposed as in the past by the Government, subject to ratification by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>At no stage will the Prices Commission appear in the picture.  But the Trade Agreement does provide that the British Government may request that such a tariff, after it is imposed, may be reviewed by the Prices Commission in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 8.  I should say that the Prices Commission will not in any sense be a Tariff Advisory Board of the kind that exists in Great Britain.  The Prices Commission will be asked to carry out investigations into the operation of particular tariffs and to make a recommendation concerning them, but it does not follow that every proposal for its reduction that may be made by any person in this country interested in the operation of any tariff need necessarily be referred to the Prices Commission.  The Government is free.  Any person in the position to which Deputy Dockrell referred who feels that a particular tariff is acting harshly against a particular interest can make representation to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and if it appears that the representation is well founded and that action should be taken along the line suggested, that action can be taken without reference to the Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  We have, however, agreed in the Trade Agreement to ask the Prices Commission to report on the operation of tariffs.  We have agreed also that the British Government will have the right to propose that certain tariffs should be reviewed first.  If they propose that we will ask the Prices Commission to give priority to such investigations as the British Government desire.  That, I think, is convenient for us.  If parties interested in having investigation into the operation of tariffs carried out here or if any manufacturer could apply direct, either to the Department of Industry and Commerce or to the Prices Commission, then, <Col N="505" /> inevitably, there would be a large number of such applications coming in at once, whereas the arrangement involved in the Article of the Agreement means that the British Government will sift out applications in the first instance, and limit the amount of work to be done immediately by the Prices Commission.  The Prices Commission will be instructed, of course, to carry out these investigations having regard to the terms of Article 8 of the Agreement.  That Article is fairly definite in its character.  It provides clearly that the principle enshrined in it need not apply in the case of industries which are not fully established&mdash;new industries recently established in this country which have not yet been able to overcome initial difficulties, training workers to a normal degree of efficiency, or getting the best results from equipment and organisation.  They will be protected to whatever extent is considered necessary by the Government.  It is only when industries have become fully established, when they have got over the initial difficulties, when the workers are fully trained, the equipment fully running, and the organisation working smoothly, that the principle enshrined in Article 8 will apply.  That principle is that tariffs will be fixed at such a level as to give producers and manufacturers in the United Kingdom full opportunity of equal competition, while affording to Irish industries adequate protection on the basis of having regard to the relative cost of economical and efficient production.  It is, of course, possible to say that, to some extent, we are paying, but there is no question of any invasion of the sovereignty to this House.  This House is a sovereign Assembly, entitled at any time to take action in relation to tariffs or anything else, provided it has fully considered the matter and is aware of the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is at liberty to reject this Bill, just as it was at liberty to reject the Trade Agreement.  The Trade Agreement does involve this: that if it is accepted by the House, then the Prices Commission will review the existing tariffs on the suggestion of the British <Col N="506" /> Government or of the Irish Government, and if the Prices Commission recommends a reduction of those tariffs then those tariffs will be reduced.  The Agreement is expressed to operate for three years.  After that it will continue in operation, but at any stage after three years clearly the House can terminate the whole business by terminating the Agreement if it so wishes. Whether that would be a wise policy or not will depend, of course, upon the circumstances of the time.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of that, but, however, it could be so.  It was the policy of our predecessors, when the old Tariff Commission was in being, to act automatically upon its recommendations. It did that as a matter of Government policy.  In this particular case, something more than Government policy is involved in so far as there is an Agreement with an outside country, and that Agreement contains this <Col N="507" /> undertaking: that where a review is carried out by the Prices Commission the recommendations of that commission will be given effect to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I refer to the Tariff Commission I am referring to the old body that was set up under the Tariff Commission Act of 1926 which, although theoretically in existence, is inoperative.  When I refer to the Prices Commission I am referring to the body that is now in existence, the body to which this Bill relates.  I do not know what Deputies thought was possible in the way of a trade agreement with Great Britain. Some people have spoken on this matter as if they considered that a trade agreement negotiated between the two countries should result in the production of Article 1 of this document and in no other.  In other words, that we should get free entry for all our produce into the British market and give nothing in return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the position up to 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1931 Great Britain was a free trade country. Circumstances have changed fundamentally since then, and tariffs have been imposed by it in the exercise of its sovereign rights.  These tariffs came into operation in May, 1932, and applied to the produce of every country in the world, including this one.  The only countries which succeeded in securing exemption from these tariffs were those which made trade agreements with the United Kingdom involving the granting of concessions to United Kingdom producers and manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think many Deputies would regard it as not unreasonable on the part of the British Government to have suggested that in return for the free entry which they are proposing to give us immediately we should give an all-round reduction in our Customs <Col N="508" /> duties, or some other immediate benefit to British producers and manufacturers. There are, of course, certain reductions of duties provided for in the Agreement, but they apply only to a limited number of articles. I think it is satisfactory that we had not in these trade negotiations to give an immediate reduction on all duties, but that we secured instead an arrangement which enables reductions to be carried out gradually after a full investigation by an impartial body set up by ourselves, and only to such extent as will still continue to give Irish producers and manufacturers adequate protection.  In my opinion, it is a satisfactory arrangement and one upon which the Dáil can congratulate itself, because it means that the dual purpose which the negotiators in London had in mind in relation to a trade agreement, and to which I referred on Thursday last, has been achieved, namely, that we have secured immediately a free entry for all our agricultural and industrial products into the British market, and in return we have secured an arrangement which leaves us free to protect and develop our own industrial activities.</P>

      <P>It is clear from what the Minister has said that under Article 8 the Dáil is being asked to hand over its <Col N="509" /> authority to the Prices Commission. Would the Minister say if it was a condition precedent to the Agreement that that should be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 8 is an integral part of the Agreement, and it provides that a review will be made by the Prices Commission of existing protective duties and other import restrictions in accordance with the principle stated in that Article, and we undertake that the tariff on goods produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom will be adjusted, where necessary, to give effect to the recommendations of the Prices Commission.  I am not asking the Deputies to vote for the Agreement. They are at perfect liberty to vote against it, but we are recommending it to the House.  We think it is a good Agreement, and that what is provided for here is a good arrangement. We think that Article 8 is a reasonable price to pay for the considerable advantages which our producers and manufucturers are getting out of the Agreement. The Deputies are at liberty to vote against it.  Do not think that we are bludgeoning or bullying you or even trying to induce you to vote for it.  Vote against it now if you do not like it.</P>

If they vote for it, as they did last week, they cannot go out afterwards and say that the Government let anybody down.  The Government think that it is a good Agreement and is asking the House to vote for it.  If the Deputies think that it is not a good Agreement, and vote for it, then there is a lack of moral courage there.</P>

      <P>I was as clear and specific last week as I am this evening. In any event, the Deputies have the chance of voting against the Bill now. I am not asking them to vote for it. They are at liberty to vote against it. I do not want them to vote for it under any misunderstanding.  I repeat that it is a good Agreement; that this review by the Prices Commission, an impartial body set up by us, of our tariffs is something which we would do ourselves, in any event, when the industries protected by those tariffs had reached the stage of being fully developed.  I think that if we set up a Prices Commission for the purpose of carrying out that review we should act on the recommendations of that commission.  I stated not merely last week but long before those negotiations with Great Britain were entered into that many of the tariffs which we imposed to encourage the establishment of new industries had necessarily to be imposed at a high rate because of the initial difficulties which those new industries have; that we never contemplated that those high tariffs would remain indefinitely in force; that, on the contrary, we contemplated that when those industries had got over their initial difficulties, and had got working smoothly with trained workers and experienced directors, similar protection could be afforded to them by duties at a lower rate than were at first deemed to be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But apart from that aspect of the matter, I considered that in the negotiation of a trade agreement with Great Britain it was a reasonable provision that we should undertake that such a review would be carried out in return for the substantial benefits and concessions to our manufacturers and producers which the Agreement provided for.  To talk of taking sovereignty out of the hands of this Dáil is obvious nonsense.  The British Government on the other side are agreeing that for the duration of the <Col N="511" /> Agreement no duties at all will be imposed upon our exports.  They are purporting to take out of the hands of their Parliament the power to impose any duty upon our exports.  Is that a limitation on their sovereignty?  Is that an abandonment of any right of their Parliament?  Of course it is not.  Trade agreements of this kind are made every month of the year between some two countries in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Every one of those agreements involves some limitation upon the freedom of action of both of the contracting parties.  On a more suitable occasion I will deal with the problem of self-sufficiency, and the utter nonsense concerning it which members of the Labour Party have recently been talking.  A question has been asked as to how the Prices Commission will act.  The commission will, of course, establish its own procedure. It is entitled to do that under the Act appointing it.  When it appears desirable for any reason that a review of an existing protective duty or import restriction should be carried out, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will formally request them to do so.  I have used those words deliberately.  It may appear desirable to the Minister that that review should be carried out, either because of purely local circumstances or because a request that such a review should be undertaken has been received from the British Government, but in any event the request goes from the Minister to the commission, and the commission establishes its own procedure.  It will, of course, be only too willing to hear the evidence of any person or any representative body in a position to supply information that will help it in its investigation.  I have mentioned already that any person within the country desiring that a customs duty should be reduced, and in a position to put forward arguments in favour of a reduction, will as in the past approach the Department of Industry and Commerce direct.  The Department of Industry and Commerce in the first instance, the Government <Col N="512" /> ultimately, will then have to make a decision&mdash;assuming that it accepts the representations which are made to it&mdash; whether to act at once, as it will be at complete liberty to do, or to refer the matter for review to the Prices Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the tenure of office of the commissioners.  I think he misunderstands the position.  Every member of the Prices Commission is appointed for a definite term.  The Act requires that they should be appointed for a definite term, the only limitation imposed by the Act being that the term must not be longer than five years. Only one of the existing members of the commission is a civil servant.  The other two members of the commission are not civil servants.  It is true, of course, that the new block of work devolving upon the commission will upset to some extent its contemplated programme in connection with prices investigation.  If it should appear to be necessary.  I will introduce legislation here for the purpose of taking power to increase the number of persons on the commission. That may not be necessary, however. The effective work which will enable the commission to despatch its business expeditiously will be done by the staff of the commission, and, of course, the staff of the commission will be increased to whatever extent is necessary.  The commission itself will, I think, be able to deal with its business quickly enough if the staff work is properly done before the commission has to deal with those matters, but if it should appear to be desirable that the commission should be increased I am prepared to promote the necessary amending Bill for that purpose.  I certainly do not intend that the work of the Prices Commission as such should in any way suffer by reason of the new duties which are now being given to it. In the great majority of cases I should imagine that the review of existing customs duties or import restrictions will also involve a prices investigation, and that consequently the work which the commission does in one connection will be of value to it in the other also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much a question of the number of persons on the <Col N="513" /> commission as a question of whether they are going to be a full-time or a part-time body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission will be such a body as to enable all the work coming to it to be expeditiously done. I cannot give the Deputy any more information than that.  At the present time there is a full-time chairman and two part-time members.  If it should become necessary to make it an entirely whole-time body, or to add to the number of whole-time members, then that will be done, but it is obviously undesirable to rush into decisions upon those matters until one has some experience of how things are going to work out.  Deputy Davin raised some question about the possibility of confidential information relating to Éire industrialists being given to British manufacturers. I do not know where he got that idea. The Prices Commission will consider any representations that are made to them; they will summon witnesses and endeavour to procure all the information which will enable them to arrive at a sound conclusion.  The Prices Commission is bound by law to keep that information strictly confidential, and there is no possibility of any information given to the Prices Commission by a witness in a confidential way being transmitted to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is this: The Prices Commission, I understand, has power to send for persons, papers and documents, and to command that all information which they reasonably require should be presented by firms inside this State. Will they have the same power to compel the representatives of British commercial concerns to produce similar information if it is necessary for the conduct of their particular task?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  If an association of British manufacturers comes before the Prices Commission in connection with the proposal that a particular tariff should be reduced, then the effect they are going to have upon the minds of the Prices Commissioners will depend upon the information they produce. <Col N="514" /> If that information is not supplied, if for any reason their case sounds dubious to the commission, then it is undoubtedly going to be discounted or disregarded.  Those people who appear before the Prices Commission will have to satisfy the commission that their case is a reasonable one before any action is likely to be taken upon it.  I do not think the Deputy need have any fears on that ground.  I can assure him that the Prices Commission will not be biased against Irish manufacturers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but, clearly, a Prices Commission carrying out an investigation as to whether prices here are reasonable would have to institute a comparison between these prices here <Col N="515" /> and in Great Britain or some other country, and obviously they would endeavour to get reliable information as to the circumstances in Great Britain and the prices operating there, as to whether prices are lower there than here and why they are lower, and would also have to inquire into the particular circumstances operating here that tended to enhance prices here more than in Great Britain.  These and other such matters would be relevant.</P>

    <P>It is impossible to say what additional cost will fall upon the Vote by reason <Col N="516" /> of the extension of the staff in consequence of these new duties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this, the question has arisen as to whether interested parties appearing before the Prices Commission can appear by counsel, and it has been decided, apparently, that they may not.  Under the new conditions in which we have, by this International Agreement, given certain British manufacturers the right to make a case before the Prices Commission, is it not desirable that that decision should be reviewable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter entirely for the Prices Commission.  The commission regulates its own procedure. In the case of a prices investigation they decided that they did not want representation by counsel, but that they wanted the witness concerned there for the purpose of examination and cross-examination and thereby getting the information they required. Possibly they might decide that different conditions may apply in the case of a tariff review under this Bill, but it is entirely a matter for them to decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore's point is an interesting one, because you might have an English firm peculiarly well equipped to make their case here, and an Irish firm suffering under some difficulties in that respect&mdash;having, say, two or three good technical men <Col N="517" /> on the board, but men not accustomed to standing up and making a case before a tribunal; and they might be at a material disadvantage if they were not given permission to oppose good advocates on the side of the British industry with equally good advocates on the side of the Irish industry.  I quite see the Minister's difficulty, and that he does not want to intervene and override the commission's discretion, but nevertheless I think it is a matter to which some thought should be given.  I do not ask the Minister to give a snap decision on it now, but it is worth thinking over, and I am sure the commission would give great weight to any representation the Minister would make to them.  I think that Deputy Moore's point is worth thinking over and possibly worth making a representation to the commission from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I admit that there are different circumstances in the case of a tariff review from those in the case of a prices investigation, but, clearly, you must leave the matter to the commission to decide for themselves.  In the case of a prices investigation, I fully agree with the decision to exclude legal representation.  The attitude of the commission is that they want to hear accountants and not lawyers, and I consider that they were quite sound in that attitude.  Where a tariff review is being carried out, however, different circumstances arise, and I am quite sure the Prices Commission will allow due weight to those circumstances.</P>

      <P>(1)  That a duty of customs at the rate of one shilling and sixpence the square yard shall be charged, levied, and paid on all woven tissues which are imported on or after such day as shall be appointed in that behalf by the Minister for Finance and are so imported in the piece and contain, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, not less than forty per cent. by weight of silk and are of a value not exceeding one shilling and sixpence per square yard.</P>
      <P>(2)  That a duty of customs at the rate of eightpence the square yard shall be charged, levied, and paid on all woven tissues which are imported on or after such day as shall be appointed in that behalf by the Minister for Finance and are so imported in the piece and contain, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, not less than forty per cent. by weight of artificial silk or of silk and artificial silk and are of a value not exceeding one shilling and threepence per square yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to both the duties mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the Second Schedule to that Act contained a list of goods which were, by way of preferential rate, to be <Col N="519" /> admitted free of duty and articles chargeable with either of the said duties mentioned in this Resolution were included in that list.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to our part of the Trade Agreement, and various sections of the Bill, in a sense, are disconnected; they relate, not so much to one another as to the appropriate Articles of the Trade Agreement.  The expression &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; is defined as being the &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.&rdquo; Deputies will note, however, that the provisions of the Bill relate not merely to the United Kingdom but also to the Dominion of Canada.  In 1932 we made an agreement with Canada which binds us to give to the produce of that country upon entry into this market the benefit of the lowest rate of duty applying to the produce of any other country.  Canada was the only country with which an agreement of that character was made at Ottawa.  An agreement was also made with South Africa, but it provided for specific preferences and not for a general preference of that kind.  If it should be decided at a later date, as a result of another agreement, to confer similar treatment on the produce of some other country, then separate legislation would be required for that purpose.  The Bill is expressed to come into operation on an appointed day which will be fixed by the Minister for Finance.  That day will probably be at the end of next week, assuming that this group of Bills is enacted by the Oireachtas within that period and that the British Government are also in a position to complete their legislation before then, which is probable.  Section 3 of the Bill implements Article 11, sub-section (2) of the Trade Agreement; that is to say, it imposes the agreed duties upon silk and artificial silk consigned from countries other than the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>Originating in countries other than the United Kingdom.  The <Col N="520" /> effect of the section is, of course, to give a preference to the extent stated to British produce of that character in this market.  Section 4 implements Article 16 of the Trade Agreement, in so far as it imposes a customs duty at the rate of 3/- per ton upon coal.  The existing prohibition upon the importation of coal will disappear.  Section 5 implements part of Article 10 and Schedule 5; that is to say, it imposes a customs duty of 3d. per lb. upon unsweetened biscuits not containing cocoa, which are made from or contain wheat or some wheaten produce.  At present some biscuits are not liable to duty, but their importation is prohibited except under licence.  The prohibition upon importation will be withdrawn and this duty of 3d. per lb. will operate instead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that biscuits containing wheat are subject to prohibition under the Cereals Act.  Biscuits, whether containing wheat or not, but containing cocoa, are liable to a duty of 3/- per lb., with a preferential rate of 2/- per lb.  Biscuits, whether containing wheat or not, and not containing cocoa, but sweetened, are liable to a duty of 1/6 per lb., with a preferential rate of 1/-.  The only biscuits which are not at present dutiable <Col N="521" /> are unsweetened biscuits, whether containing wheat or not, and not containing cocoa.  Biscuits of the same class containing wheat are subject to prohibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These biscuits referred to now are going to have a duty of 3d. on them and nobody knows whether they exist or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This imposes a duty of 3d. per lb. on unsweetened biscuits, not containing cocoa, which are made from or containing wheat or wheaten product.  The Deputy will find that other sections of the Bill relate to other classes of biscuits.  The proposal is that prohibition under the Cereals Act is being removed from all biscuits of United Kingdom origin containing any wheat, whether they are sweetened or unsweetened, or whether or not they contain cocoa, and the new United Kingdom preferential rate of 3½d. per lb. is to be imposed upon all biscuits which are sweetened, that is, biscuits whether they contain wheat or not which do not contain cocoa, with corresponding full and Dominion preferential rates of 1/6 and 1/-.  It is further proposed to impose a new duty of 3d. upon biscuits containing wheat, not containing cocoa and not sweetened, coming from any country. This leaves the position in respect of biscuits, not containing wheat, not containing cocoa, and not sweetened as at present.  That is, they are free of all duty.  There is at present a prohibition on biscuits containing wheat.  The arrangement under the Bill is that a duty of 3d. per lb. is to be put on unsweetened biscuits containing wheat, but that the prohibition under the Cereals Act will remain in the meantime on all biscuits containing wheat not coming from the United Kingdom.  I do not know whether that makes the matter clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous to that, I do not suppose there was a separate category under the trade returns, and so it would be impossible to say.  Under the trade returns they would be classified as biscuits, whether sweetened or unsweetened, or containing cocoa or not.  There are, of course, oaten biscuits, rye biscuits, and biscuits not containing wheat, which were imported in the past, and which are also manufactured here.  Section 6 deals also with Article 10, Schedule 5, in respect of matters other than biscuits and ply yarns.  The effect of the section is to give reduced rates of duty in respect of various articles mentioned in Article 10, which are grown, produced, or manufactured in the United Kingdom and the Dominion of Canada.  These rates are less than the full rate, or less than the preferential rate, where there is a preferential rate.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the procedure is.  I am prepared to go through the Bill explaining the effect of the sections and deal with any points raised by Deputies subsequently.  There is, of course, the possibility of dealing with these matters on the Committee Stage.  It would be preferable to deal with them then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be better.  Section 7 implements Article 9 of the Trade Agreement.  Section 8 gives effect to Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Agreement.  Section 9 gives effect to Article 6, paragraph 1; that is to say, it reduces the minimum customs duty from two and sixpence to one shilling in the case of goods of United Kingdom or Canadian origin.  Section 10 gives effect to Article 10, paragraphs 4, 5 and 7, of the Agreement which deals with the package tax.  Section 11 implements Article 17, sub-section (2) of the Trade Agreement which deals with the <Col N="523" /> importation of motor-car lamps.  Section 12 implements Article 17, sub-section 3, of the Trade Agreement, which is the same section as that to which sub-section 11 of the Bill relates.  Section 13 of the Bill deals with Article 10, Schedule 5, of the Trade Agreement.  It exempts from duty articles which are ply yarns and are made wholly or mainly of flax.  They were liable to a duty of 100 per per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no prohibition other than the duty, the ply yarns being manufactured here. Section 14 implements Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Trade Agreement, as regards certain of the articles mentioned in Part II of Schedule 4 by repeal of the duties on certain articles of United Kingdom or Canadian origin.  Section 15 implements Article 7 of the Trade Agreement.  Section 16 gives power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make regulations prescribing the proportion of the value of an article which must be the result of labour within a particular country in order that such article may be regarded as an article manufactured in that country.  Different regulations may be made in respect of different classes or descriptions of articles.  I should say that in calculating the proportion of value account will be taken also of materials added in the particular country.</P>
      <P>The Bill is one to give effect to the various parts of the Trade Agreement under which we undertake to do certain things of benefit to British producers and manufacturers.  It is largely a reproduction of the terms of the Agreement itself and raises no new point which was not discussed when the question of approving the Agreement was before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his concluding statement said it raises no new point.  Would he say if this Bill goes in any way outside of the implementation of the Agreement?  It does appear on its face to depart slightly from some of the clauses, if <Col N="524" /> not most of the clauses, which it is proposed to deal with.  In connection with ply yarns, which he has mentioned, have they any comparison with what are called worsted yarns?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that.  In 1932 we made an agreement with Canada, under which we undertook to give them the benefit of the lowest duty applying to the goods of any other country, and we have consequently to extend to Canada the benefit of any concessions given now to the United Kingdom.  That requires legislation, and advantage is being taken of this Bill to effect that legislation. Canada is the only country with which we have such an agreement.  If an agreement of a similar kind should be made with any other country subsequently fresh legislation will be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question.  The effect of No. 6 is to reduce the duties to the rates mentioned in the First Schedule as applied to the United Kingdom and Canada.  I take that to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now, there is just one little thing that I am interested in&mdash;there may be some others&mdash; No. 14; that is, about articles made wholly or mainly of wood.  I notice there are not less than five references, and I take it that the Minister on the Committee Stage will be able to give us in a broad way just what is the <Col N="525" /> effect under that section, because, while I would like very much to look up the five references, I would not say that I would be in a position to do that before the Bill comes on to the Committee Stage, and I think the Minister ought to give us as far as possible on the Committee Stage the &ldquo;boil-down&rdquo; of what these various things are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point that I would like to draw the Minister's attention to.  It is in the First Schedule, the third last item&mdash; boots and shoes.  The rate at which the duty is to be charged is 20 per cent.  I understand that there is quantitative regulation at present in operation; there is a prohibition on boots and shoes except as regards a certain quantity.  The method of dealing with that will, I presume, be decided by the Prices Commission ultimately.  In connection with that it is mentioned here: &ldquo;boots and shoes of which the upper is wholly or mainly of leather or skin or either of them.&rdquo; The Irish boot manufacturers are compelled to use Irish leather, I believe, in the product of their manufacture. Will that matter be the subject of investigation by the Prices Commission?  What is the relative advantage or disadvantage which the Irish manufacturers have to endure in connection with their manufacture? In other words, we will assume that the British manufacturer produces boots and shoes and that their quality and price, compared with the Irish quality and price, differ.  Will allowance be made by the Prices Commission in the investigation of whatever quality material the Irish manufacturers are bound to use in the manufacture of their goods?  Does the Minister get my point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The finest kids are all produced outside the United Kingdom. They are all foreign production.  It is only where you have got sole leather and heavy leathers that you are getting this prohibition tariff.  I think while Deputy Cosgrave is making the point that one that ought to be more carefully <Col N="526" /> considered is whether you are going to put these new factories in Enniscorthy and Gorey in a position that they will have to close.  If people want particularly superfine uppers&mdash; mostly ladies of course who are always patriots! &mdash;they will buy them and they ought to be made pay for them.  We can produce a very decent leather for uppers for fine boots but we cannot produce these superfine leathers and they are coming in now on a quantitative agreement, as you know, in thousands. There is also a sole leather and heel leather that should never be allowed in.  At the present moment I suppose your office is submerged with submissions that you ought to give them further leave to import uppers and so on. I hope there will be no change in the shoe industry until the Prices Commission have considered and have reported to you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a Committee point but it has been put to me by an interested party and I think I should give the Minister a chance of answering it now.  With regard to clause (g) Section 12, dealing with motor cars&mdash; a £750 motor car is to be admitted free if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be of a type which is ordinarily kept for the personal use of the owner and members of his family or household.  The question I was asked to address to the Minister was whether that precludes a car from being used for taxi purposes&mdash;taxi or hire purposes.  Further, there is a point in the same paragraph&mdash;a motor car which is of a value of not less than £750&mdash;does that mean the c.i.f. or retail selling value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that in his explanation the Minister passed rather rapidly over Section 6.  I hope that does not indicate that he does not understand it any better than I do. The section, of course, refers to Article 10, is it not, of the Agreement? The Schedule attached to Article 10 is divided into two parts.  The Schedule attached to Section 6 is in a single part.  I do not know what the proposal of the Minister in that way is. This Section 6 is for the purpose of reducing the duty, but the Article also <Col N="527" /> contains provision for a higher duty if quantitative control is removed or for the reimposition of quantitative control at a later time.  Are we to understand that it is the Minister's view that the duty should be reduced and, if necessary, further legislation should be introduced to deal with the matter, or has he at the present moment sufficient legislation to deal with that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister also refer to reference No. 10 in the First Schedule, which is much the same case as that which I mentioned in connection with boots and shoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some misunderstanding appears to have been caused amongst boot and shoe manufacturers and their employees, and also amongst their customers, the retail distributors of boots and shoes, as to the effect of the Trade Agreement.  The Agreement operates to reduce to 20 per cent. the import duty upon boots and shoes, but the importation of all boots and shoes is at present prohibited, except under licence.  In so far as the protection afforded to Irish boot and shoe factories is concerned, the duty is of no real consequence.  The effective protection is given by the prohibition of imports.  A periodic quota is fixed which represents only a very small fraction of our requirements, but, apart from the quota, no boots and shoes can be imported.  That is the present position, and that position will continue until there has been a review by the Prices Commission of the position in respect of the boot and shoe trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement involves the substitution of the quantitative regulation of imports by a Customs duty, but it specifically provides that when quantitative regulation ceases to operate the duty upon boots and shoes may be increased.  It will, of course, be a matter for the Prices Commission, following its investigation, to say to what extent an increase in the duty upon boots and shoes is necessary in order to offset whatever disadvantages <Col N="528" /> boot and shoe manufacturers in this country may have as compared with boot and shoe manufacturers in Great Britain.  If their labour costs are higher, if their raw materials cost them more, if they are subject to disadvantages by reason of the restricted size of the market, or any other cause, then, my view as to the correct interpretation of Article 8 would enable the Prices Commission to fix the duty at such a level as would offset these disadvantages. Whether it is correct or not that their raw materials cost them more is a matter I need not discuss. There are certain types of leather produced here which appear to be cheaper than the corresponding types produced in Great Britain, but that is, of course, a different thing from saying cheaper than the price at which British manufacturers can buy, because they may be able to import leather at a cheaper price.  The other classes of leather are higher.  We are not at present making all the upper leather required by our manufacturers and a fairly substantial development in production will be necessary before all that upper leather will be produced here; but if that leather should be dearer it is clearly indicated that the duty should be sufficient to offset that higher cost as well as any other higher costs or disadvantages which local producers may have.  It is intended that that will be done following a review by the Prices Commission before the quantitative regulation of imports ceases.  Any retailer of boots and shoes who delayed purchasing his requirements from Irish factories in anticipation of an early modification of the import restrictions would be unwise.  There will be no modification of the import restrictions until the review by the Prices Commission has been completed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell will find the woodwork in respect of which a reduction of duty is being effected at Reference No. 267 in the Tariff List.  It is a very long list which would take some time to read out.  The principal classes of woodwork affected are builders' woodwork, boxes and articles of that kind.  These goods will be subject to a lower rate of duty when imported from the United <Col N="529" /> Kingdom of United Kingdom origin. Deputy Moore raised the question of motor cars.  As the Deputy will notice, the Agreement obliges us to give the benefit of the reduction in duty to private motor cars, and only to private motor cars, of c.i.f. value of £750 or more.  In fact, cars of that value have not been assembled here, other than omnibuses and cars which do not come within the description of private motor cars.  It is clearly intended that the benefit of the reduction should be given only to private motor cars as defined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>May I point out to the Minister with regard to what he has said on the question of these expensive motor cars that it will be very hard to administer that provision?  Can the agent or trader import these cars only after he has received an order, on a guarantee that he is going to sell to a private motorist only when he can guarantee that the car will be used only for personal purposes?  It looks a very difficult provision to administer.</P>

In order to get the benefit of this reduction in duty the car must be of a value of not less than £750; it must be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been manufactured in the United Kingdom or in the Dominion of Canada; it must in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners be suitable only for the carriage of persons or of persons and their personal luggage; it must have, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, seating accommodation for not more than six persons exclusive of the driver and <Col N="530" /> must also be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be of a type which is ordinarily kept for the personal use of the owner and members of his family or household.

      <P>On the last evening on which this Estimate was before us, we were discussing the question whether or not the Land Commission were paying an adequate price for the tenanted land they were acquiring.  Deputy Gorey seemed to think that they had not been paying anything for this tenanted land.  He objected to any tenanted land being acquired by the Land Commission. I think that that question was thrashed out very fully during many years in this House&mdash;the question whether or not the Land Commission should have authority to acquire tenanted land.  There were very large tracts of tenanted land, and it was absolutely necessary that the Land Commission should have power to acquire it.</P>

      <P>You are trying to repudiate that right now and deny that it ever existed.  This Government were supposed to be bad fellows for trying to put that provision into operation.  I have heard only one case &mdash;that mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave &mdash;in which the Land Commission did not pay a fair price to the tenant.  I say it is right that they should pay the market value to the tenant. Whatever be the cost of redemption, the tenant is entitled to the fair market value of his land, and I hope it is the policy of the Land Commission to pay that for any tenanted land they acquire over and above the cost of redemption.  The cost of redemption has nothing to do with the tenant. He is entitled to the fair market value, same as any other holder of tenanted land who sells it.  I believe that it is the policy of the Land Commission to pay the fair market value for tenanted land as they have paid for untenanted land.  I hope we have heard the last of this talk of stealing land and seizing people's property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;over and above the cost of redemption.&rdquo;  I think that should please anybody.  We all understand what that means.  I want to refer to the difficulty in getting the Land Commission to provide rights of way.  I have been bringing a particular case to the notice of the Land Commission for a long number of years.  Deputy Corish recently asked a question in the House about it.  It is extremely difficult to get the Land Commission to provide a right of way where, for some reason or other, a right of way has been blotted out.  It may have become a bog or it may have been washed out by the sea.  In this case, the man lives on the sea coast and, owing to coast erosion, he has no means of getting to his holding.  But for the goodness of his neighbours, he could not possibly get in or out to the road.  For five years, the Land Commission have been promising to give this man a right of way but he is still <Col N="535" /> the same as he was five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards derelict and semi-derelict holdings, I think it is time the policy of the Land Commission changed, because up to now it has been impossible to get them to deal with these holdings.  They ignore their existence, and the ratepayers in the country are compelled by law to pay both annuities and rates for these derelict holdings. I hope the Land Commission will take that into consideration and see that these holdings are acquired and given to people who are anxious for land. In County Wexford we have plenty of land for everybody but none to spare. We should, however, have no objection to migrants from the West of Ireland being brought there if it is necessary to find land for them&mdash;if there is no land available for them in Meath. Deputy Giles and Deputy O'Reilly objected to any more people from the West of Ireland going into Meath. As a Deputy coming from a tillage county, I think it is surprising to travel for hours through Meath, Westmeath and Roscommon and see nothing but grass.  I am sure that this House and the country will stand for the policy of the Land Commission to divide up that land.  The land could then be tilled and we could have people living on it.  I think that that is the sound policy.  I am afraid that the Land Commission do not select the most suitable people in some cases when they are dividing land in County Meath.  They should give the land to people brought up on small holdings&mdash; people who will work the land.  There is no use in putting people on the land who will let it in a few years.  The people put on it should be people who know something about the working of land&mdash;people who have lived on small holdings and who are accustomed to the economy of those holdings.  There is no use in dividing up the lands of Meath if you do not put on them people who know how to work them and who can live according to the economy suited to these holdings. That is the key to success in dividing lands in Meath and Westmeath, where there do not seem to be any people to work land and where they all seem to <Col N="536" /> have too much land.</P>
    <P>As regards the size of the holdings, Deputy McGowan, I think, said that people could not live on less than 40 acres of land in County Dublin.  A large number of the best people in this country are living on from 15 to 20 acres of inferior land.  There are not 40 acres of land available for everybody who needs land in this country, and 40 acres in County Dublin or County Meath are better than 80 acres in other counties.  I think that the present policy of the Land Commission in giving from 20 acres to 25 acres is sound policy.  If you have that amount of land to spare for every person in the congested areas, you will have done a good day's work when you have divided it.  It is wrong to say that it is better to leave the Midlands in grass than to give the land to people who will work it and rear families on it.  No land should be left in large ranches or in grass, and the sooner the Land Commission get on to dividing the lands of the Midlands the better.</P>

      <P>One of the paradoxes that seem to exist so far as the ordinary observer of country conditions is concerned is that, notwithstanding all our legislation and all our activities, farmers can raise no credit whatever from the financial institutions of the country.  There seems to be something wrong&mdash;what it is I do not know&mdash;with the credit of the country, which has its base on the land and depends on those who produce from the land.  Industry has to live through that means in the towns and the cities.  It seems to me that the more legislation we pass here the less opportunity is offered to the farmer to raise anything on his land.  I should like some expert to offer an explanation of that state of affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the position of land division in County Louth.  So far as I am aware, the land division is being carried out in a fair way, but it has happened on one or two occasions that people are asked what service have they given in the national cause. Whether that is actually true I am not in a position to say, but the report has <Col N="537" /> gone around County Louth that such questions are being asked.  I do not think that is fair.  I think everyone should be entitled to get land if they are in a position to work it.  I am not making any charge against the officials of the Land Commission.  I have studiously refrained from interfering with regard to the question of getting land for any person.  I have sufficient confidence in the Land Commission officials to do the right thing.</P>
      <P>One matter I desire to refer to is in connection with the action of the Land Commission in taking land from the people who were already allotted land ten or 11 years ago.  I refer now to the people of Drumcashel.  These people were in occupation for a period of ten or 11 years.  They have paid their annuities each year.  The land was recently taken from them on the plea that they were not tilling it; in other words, that they were letting the land. While that may be true of some allottees, it was not true of the whole of them.  A few of them did their best to cultivate as much of the land as possible with the means at their disposal. There have been one or two cases of particular hardship.  For instance, there is a widow there with a family.  Her husband died through overwork trying to cultivate the land in order to make a living for himself, his wife and family.  The widow, in order to rear the family, had perforce to let the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a wrong conception in regard to this whole question of the letting of land.  I feel you will have trouble when the day arrives when there is no land to be let in conacre. Anyone who knows anything about land knows that there are thousands of small farmers who could not exist if they were not in a position to take conacre each year.  That is a well-known fact.  What is the use of singling out people in an area such as I have referred to, and saying: &ldquo;You are not tilling the land,&rdquo; when it is common knowledge that there are thousands of people letting land every year?  Every week the local papers are full of advertisements from auctioneers and others notifying the public that so <Col N="538" /> many acres are to be let in conacre.  I cannot understand the action of the Land Commission in singling out these ten or 11 people at Drumcashel, which is one of the most peaceful and law-abiding areas to be found in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Possibly it is because the people were so law-abiding that this action was taken.  Perhaps advantage was taken of that fact, and the land Commission thought the people would be easy prey, and, unlike the people of other counties, they would not kick up a row.  It should be remembered that there are many quiet people who can be just as sturdy as the next when they are up against it.</P>
    <P>I think the Land Commission are very unwise to have taken such action as they did in this instance.  I do not think it is the wish of the Minister, and I believe that if all the circumstances were put before him the people there would be still in possession of their land.  As a result of the action of the Land Commission, a very serious agitation has started up there. People who were the best of neighbours before are to-day divided into hostile camps.  I do not believe it was worth the price paid to take the land from these people and create the difficult situation which exists there.  I am aware that the Minister is giving this matter his personal attention, and I should like to have a statement from him as to what he intends to do, whether he is going to reinstate all or any of the people in order to allay the public feeling in the district.  I am bringing this matter forward now with the object of restoring normal conditions in that area and in the county generally.  I believe there is no county where there is less trouble with regard to the division of land.  So far as I know, everyone is satisfied, and it is a pity that this trouble has arisen.  If the Minister is not now in a position to indicate the intentions of the Land Commission in regard to this matter I hope he will give us some information about it in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been remarked that in my constituency, where the Land Commission acquire land, they <Col N="539" /> confine themselves to the fairly large estates in areas that are not very thickly populated.  Sometimes it is difficult to get the very best type of tenant for the holdings on those estates.  On the other hand, there are areas in Kildare that are rather densely populated.  I refer now to the areas adjoining the bogs, where the farms are not so very big, where there are no very large farms to acquire, and where the people have not raised very much of an agitation to have land divided.  In those areas that are densely populated there are good types of applicants.  Many of them have very uneconomic holdings.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be important if he could induce some of the farmers to transfer from those places to the less densely populated areas and allow their holdings to be divided amongst the uneconomic holders.  There were a few cases recently in which the Land Commission induced farmers to transfer, and the holdings that they left were divided amongst their former neighbours. That was very satisfactory; it certainly gave great satisfaction to everybody.  The holdings in this instance were not very big, but the transfer did a certain amount of good and I would ask the Minister to pursue that type of policy in Kildare.  I have no fault to find with the progress made in the county.  A wonderful amount of land has been divided.  I would like attention paid to those areas which I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is that where there are two or three sons on a farm there does not seem to be any prospect of the young men striking out and doing things for themselves.  Many of them are good farmers.  They have a good knowledge of agriculture, and I think more attention ought to be paid to them, even if they have to be transferred to another area.  If they were brought into areas where the traditional tillage is not so good, they might serve as a good example to the people living there.  I think something in that connection should be done.  The Land Commission should give more attention to the <Col N="540" /> claims of the sons of good-class farmers, men with 40 or 50 acres of land.  These men are men of good families and they are the right kind of people to get the land.  If they were given the land they would make good and they would be examples of efficiency to people with less knowledge of agricultural methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points on this Vote which I wish to bring before the Minister.  These are mainly with regard to the division of land in my area.  As to the division of land there, I have no very serious complaint to make.  I congratulate the Land Commission on the way in which they have divided estates down there.  With regard to the payment of the workers who are building fences consequent on the division of those estates, I am aware that the men are paid fortnightly. If it were possible for the Minister to make arrangements to have the men paid weekly it would be a great boon to them and to their families. Deputy Minch stated that the credit of our farmers in the country was very low.  I agree with him.  Their credit was never lower than at the present time.  The House and the country are aware of that.  It is because of the distressing and depressing times through which they have passed in the last five or six years.  I appeal this evening to the Minister on behalf of the farmers in the division I represent, and what I say of the farmers there applies to the farmers of the whole County Cork. I am aware that at the present moment there are in the hands of the sheriff thousands of decrees awaiting execution. The economic war has now ended and, with the help of God, I feel sure that in a very short time the country will get on its feet again.  But it will take a long time before the farmers will be again on their feet. In the case of these farmers whose rents are in arrears and against whom the sheriff holds decrees I would appeal to the Minister not to have the decrees executed until after the harvest.  During the past fortnight a number of farmers have come to me.  These men had got 15 days' notice from the sheriff and I am aware myself that they are <Col N="541" /> not in a position to pay now.  After the harvest they hope to be in a position to do so.  I appeal now to the Minister to extend the time for paying until then.</P>

      <P>The statement I have made is not untrue and the House knows that well.  The credit of the farmer is not one ounce worse than it was seven or eight years ago.  I know the farming community as well as any Deputy in the House and I am able to stand over that statement.  We have a certain type of farmer down in the West of Ireland who should not be called a farmer at all.  He is a grazier.  He is the sort of man who always walked about with his hands in his pockets and never did a day's work in his life.  His time is gone now.  I listened to the speeches of Deputy Giles and Deputy O'Reilly.  I think these were two of the most disgraceful speeches I ever heard in my life.  Deputy Giles advocated a policy of asking the Land Commission not to take people from the West of Ireland and put them into the Meath bogs.  I think we in the West of Ireland can stake as good a claim to the lands of Meath as any other people.  I hope the Land Commission will go ahead along their present lines not alone in dividing the lands of Meath but also the lands of Kildare and several other counties.  It is nearly time that the unfortunate people in the West of Ireland <Col N="542" /> should get back a little of their own.  It is due to them.</P>

      <P>We will still have many left.  We will have very many farmers still under £10 valuation.  The Land Commission has done a lot of good work in my constituency.  There is, however, still much to be done.  I wish the Minister would come to see the necessity for making a bigger effort. Certain migrants have been taken away from the West.  But the fact is that in certain areas in the West and in those very places where the people are crying out for land and where the average valuation of the farmer is small, there are a number of ranches waiting to be taken over.  For years I have been advocating this; I have been pushing the Land Commission to take over certain big ranches.  The very first year I came here I spoke about the number of ranches in the West; these ranches still remain.  I refer the Minister to the Colonel Bernard Estate in Castlehackett. There are a number of other estates around Creggs.  The Minister himself knows these estates.  Then there is the estate of Garvey and the Morgan Estate and a number of others.  If these estates were taken over, quite a lot of people would be fixed up.  If the Land Commission would make a <Col N="543" /> move in that direction it would be doing much to help the people.  In and around Tuam we have a number of big untenanted farms.  There is a man there by the name of Stafford who has a couple of thousand acres of such land.</P>
      <P>This year in the West of Ireland we have been very much behind-hand in the production of the necessary quota of beet for the beet factory.  That is owing to the fact that the people there have not sufficient land to rotate their crops.  Many of them, after growing beet for two or three years, have now arrived at the stage when they have no place in which to grow it.  That is a factor that should be taken into consideration by the Land Commission: they should keep it before their eyes when dividing these lands in the West. The beet factory in Tuam is a big asset to the farmers of Connacht.  If one looks through a list of the beet producers for that factory he will find that there is scarcely a dozen people with a valuation of over £10 supplying beet to the factory.  When an industry like that of beet has been set up, and when we find a falling off in the acreage produced for the supply of that factory, we should seek out the real reason for the drop in the acreage.  The real solution of that difficulty would be the acquisition and division of the large untenanted farms and the large ranches in that area. These should be taken up at once by the Land Commission and dished out to the class of farmers who are anxious to grow beet if they had the necessary lands to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk in this debate about the uneconomic position of farms of 24, 25 or 30 acres.  I know people who would be thoroughly satisfied if it were possible for them to get 24 acres of arable land to work on.  I may tell the House that they would not be grousing about it.  They would be quite satisfied and would be able to make a very good living for themselves and their families on a holding of that size.  After all, when you find thousands of families the valuation of whose holdings does not exceed £2 10s. 0d each, and when you consider that those <Col N="544" /> people have had to make a living on them, you can only ask yourself how much better off would these people be if they were given holdings with treble that valuation.  They would be much better off.  I would advise the Minister, whatever he is doing in the Midlands, to come along and solve the big problem which still remains to be solved in the West of Ireland.  I would ask him to press the Land Commission to give more attention to the West of Ireland. If there are more inspectors needed he should get them, send them down to the West and get the land which is urgently needed by the people, divided.</P>
    <P>I have on a number of occasions during the last few years made myself very unpopular, so to speak, amongst certain sections who were out for driving the cattle off the ranches in order to call attention to their claims. We want to preserve the law and my duty as a Deputy is to see that the people obey the law, but nevertheless I do not think I can blame them or ask them to desist if they decide on pulling down the walls or driving the cattle out on the road.  I do not think I am going to stop them, either.  If I were to speak my mind on the matter, I know what I would say.  To avoid all that, I would advise the Land Commission to work a little faster on the farms that still remain to be divided in County Galway. I think that in South-East Galway, Deputy Beegan's area, there are still thousands of acres which the Land Commission have not touched.  We have been introducing legislation for some years past to try to speed up the division of land and I do not see what obstacles there are in the way of that work at present.  I would appeal once again to the Minister to pay more attention to these grass lands that remain undivided in the West of Ireland and thereby give us an opportunity of getting on our feet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I also might as well add my few words of criticism of the methods of the Land Commission. It is generally recognised that farmers are not spending the same amount as in former years on manures, nor are they devoting the same amount of work to making shores, cleaning <Col N="545" /> drains or improving the land as they did in years gone by, simply because of the uncertainty of tenure.  They are not sure whether they will be allowed to keep their lands.  If a farmer is desirous of purchasing some extra land to enable him to provide more freely for his family, he is afraid to do so because of the uncertainty attached to his tenure of these lands. He is afraid to stock the lands, lest he may have to sell the stock at an uneconomic price if the Land Commission decide to call on him with a view to the acquisition of the land. If he decides to sell his land, once the Land Commission inspector calls, it means the end of the sale of the property. He will have to keep it and work it as best he can pending a decision by the Land Commission. From the time the first inspector calls on the farmer who is unfortunate enough to have such a visit, there is a certain amount of suspense.  He does not know what to do.  He is afraid to till the land, because he does not know whether the Land Commission will take the land from him before the crops are removed, and he is afraid to stock the land as he may have to sell the stock at an uneconomic price.  From the time the first inspector calls, it may be months or sometimes years before he is definitely told what the intentions of the Land Commission are.  He will probably write to the Land Commission to know what is the result of the inspector's visit, and he may get a letter or a postcard, sent out by an official of the Department who probably does not understand what is printed on it. Then he may get a solicitor to write, and the solicitor may get a reply that the land will not be required, but he has not received that reply for any length of time until it is all forgotten by the Land Commission, and in a short time another inspector calls.  I think that that is very wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if an inspector carries out an inspection of a farm, and the Land Commission say they do not want it, they ought to abide by their decision.  They ought not to be the weathercock of some Party or some <Col N="546" /> Deputies who come along later and make another demand that that land should be acquired.  The land has not changed from the time it was first inspected. It is the same land that was there when the first inspector called.  I repeat, therefore, that when the Land Commission decide that they are not going to take over a certain farm, they ought to abide by that decision and the occupier should not be knocked about from one inspector to the other. If, on the other hand, they decide to take over the farm&mdash;probably in a great many cases they have a perfect right to do so&mdash;from the time the decision is made until they are prepared to take over the land and pay for it, a long time is wasted and again the farmer is kept in suspense.  In ordinary commercial dealing, the time within which the sale must be completed is definitely stated in the contract. The sale has to be completed within 14 or 21 days, as the case may be, but if the Land Commission makes a purchase the transaction may run for five years before it is finally completed. There is no idea of the length of time it will take the Land Commission to complete the purchase from the time the land is inspected, or even from the time they decide to acquire the farm.</P>
    <P>I probably would not have intervened in the debate on this Estimate were it not for a letter which I received from a man in County Monaghan in connection with the division of certain lands in the Kingscourt area of County Cavan.  This man complains that there were two estates divided, one containing something like 230 or 240 acres and the other containing about 234 acres. The first estate was taken over after a lot of agitation, but the second belonged to a man who had died recently.  Consequently there was no reason why it should not have been taken over because it was not under tillage.  It was practically all in grazing with the exception perhaps of a small area which was let out in meadow.  The man who wrote me had two applicants for holdings on it.  One of the applicants was a man who had been serving for the last 16 or 17 years on the 400-acre estate.  That man had been living on the estate.  The owner <Col N="547" /> did not carry on a lot of tillage.  He had a certain amount of hay-making to do in the summer time; otherwise there was not a lot to be done in the way of tillage.  This man was kept for general work, doing a little gardening and work of that kind.  Although he had been almost 17 years working on the estate, he was dispossessed and he had to leave the house and look for another position.  I understood that when an estate of that kind was being divided, anyone serving on the estate, if he did not get first preference, would at least get some portion of the land and would be left as he was, in undisturbed possession. That has not been so in this case, and I think it is very unfair.</P>
    <P>The other complaint I wish to make is about an applicant, whose grandfather owned an estate not so very long ago but who through misfortune got out of it.  As I am not conversant with the facts I do not know if the grandfather was evicted or had to leave through non-payment of debts.  The grandson thought he was entitled to a share of the 134 acres, but his application was turned down and he did not get a sod of the land.  As these two estates were close together that man should have got a piece of land there.  There were practically 700 acres between the two estates.  In one case a man had to leave the house he was living in, as it belonged to the estate, and look for work elsewhere because he did not get an opportunity of getting it where he resided.  I hope the Minister will inquire into these two complaints and see what is the reason for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other Deputies I would like to compliment the Minister on the great increase in the acreage of land divided since he took charge of the Department, but I regret to say that I cannot compliment him as far as land division in my constituency in Waterford is concerned.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that in 1936-37 only 400 or 500 acres of land were divided there, despite the fact that at least 30,000 acres are available for acquisition and division.  Land division in County Waterford appears to me to have been completely neglected <Col N="548" /> by the Land Commission.  The fact was brought to the notice of the Minister but, as far as I am aware there has been no improvement in land division in that area.  The 30,000 acres available for division are made up mostly of derelict farms and holdings that are not being worked by existing tenants.  I am sure the Minister and the Land Commission are aware of the tremendous burden imposed on the ratepayers by these holdings.  Therefore, I cannot understand why they have not been acquired.  The policy of the Land Commission appears to be to concentrate on areas where there is congestion.  We are in this position in Waterford, that there is very little, if any, congestion there.  I think it is a mistaken policy on the part of the Land Commission and the officials to concentrate on areas where there is congestion, and to neglect areas such as Waterford for a number of years, where there is a big acreage of land suitable for division amongst applicants in every way suitable for working land. The Land Commission seems very hesitant about acquiring land that is not adjacent to a congested area.  I think that is a great mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Waterford constituency 60 per cent. of the applicants for land are of a special type.  When I say that I mean a type that is not at present considered by the Land Commission&mdash; unmarried, landless men.  Take the case of a farmer with a valuation of even £40 who may have three or four sons.  The eldest son is married and lives on the holding, but the claims of the other brothers, who have an expert knowledge of land, having worked on it all their lives, and who, perhaps, have a capital of £100 or £200, are not considered at all by the Land Commission.  That type of applicant should be seriously considered by the Land Commission, as they cannot expect the brother who is owner of a holding of 50 or 60 acres to divide it up.  It would be ridiculous to expect him to do so.  The best applicants in Waterford are unmarried men who are hoping that the Land Commission will give them a portion of the undivided land.  I have not a great deal of experience of the <Col N="549" /> division of land in Waterford, for the simple reason that very little land has been divided, but in the few estates that were divided I found that the landless men were completely ignored. The most suitable applicants are men who were brought up on the land and who, in all probability, will be found to have a little capital.  They are looking forward to settling down and marrying on the land.  I desire to impress upon the Minister the desirability of considering that type of applicant in future.  The only alternative is to emigrate across the Channel or to seek employment in towns and cities.  We want to avoid both of these alternatives.  The Minister has the cure, and that is to settle them on the land.  I am not opposed to cottiers and uneconomic holders getting land.  They are certainly entitled to it, but I am opposed to the Land Commission and the officials trying to force land on people, cottiers and uneconomic holders, who never looked for it and who do not want it.  I think it is ridiculous to ask such people to face the burden of working, say, 20 acres of land when they do not want them, especially when there is a good type of applicant willing to work it and who would make a success of it.</P>

In the division of land in that constituency I hope consideration will be given to the claims of landless men so that they may have an opportunity of settling on the <Col N="550" /> land.  I am sure they would be successful on it.</P>
      <P>We do not want to have these men emigrating or having to seek employment out of the country.  The way to meet that situation is to put them on the land.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the extraordinary position that exists with regard to the Usher Estate near Cappoquin which, I understand, was acquired by the Land Commission nine years ago.  That is a long time.</P>

      <P>It has not been divided yet.  I understand that for two out of nine years it was set for grazing and that it is set at the present time. It consists of 200 acres.  One half is good arable land, and the other half is not so good, but with a drainage scheme it could be made suitable for grazing. I cannot understand why the Estate is not being divided in view of the fact that there are 13 families in the area who want land, and if they had it would work it.  It has been said, but I do not know how true it is, the Land Commission are trying to sell this place.  That is an extraordinary thing in view of the fact that you have so many families there anxious to get land and work it.  I would ask the Land Commission to divide this Estate as soon as possible, and would like to have an explanation from the Minister as to why it has not been divided among the many genuine applicants in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to refer to an estate of 40 acres in the County Waterford which has been acquired by the local golf club for a golf course. These 40 acres are in a congested area.  In fact, I might say this is the only bit of land in the area that was available for division.  All the people there derive their livelihood solely and mainly from tillage.  It is on the Murphy Estate of Ballinacourt.  Despite my representations to the Minister and to the Land Commission, I understand that the Minister has consented to the transfer of these 40 acres to the golf club.  I have no <Col N="551" /> objection whatever to golf, but everyone who knows the area is aware that there is plenty of other land, and not bad land by any means, that would be more suitable for this golf course at Dungarvan.  I do not think you want really good land for a golf course.  I have already made representations in connection with this, but I want again to protest strongly against the attitude of the Land Commission in transferring this land to a golf club.  The harm is done now, and I suppose it cannot be rectified.</P>
    <P>I would like to express the hope that the Land Commission would seriously set about the acquisition and division of land in the County Waterford. The fact that only 400 or 500 acres have been divided there in the past year shows that Waterford is being sadly neglected in that respect. It is time that the Land Commission made a determined effort to divide more land in the county.  You have there 30,000 acres of land suitable for division.  I understand that a large percentage of that acreage has been offered to the Land Commission.  They seem to be very slow in acquiring land. We have in the county a big number of applicants for land, all of whom are desirous of settling down and making their living on the land.  I do not see why, after five or six years, the Land Commission should not turn their attention to the County Waterford and speed up land division there.</P>
    <P>I have heard the view expressed by some Deputies on the opposite benches that the Minister should slow down the activities of the Land Commission in acquiring and dividing land.  That view was expressed, I think, by a Deputy from the County Tipperary.  That may be all right so far as that county is concerned, because I understand that a great number of estates have been acquired and divided there, although I am sure you have a number of others which have yet to be acquired and divided.  I disagree with the view expressed by that Deputy and would ask the Minister to go even faster than he has been going in the division and acquisition of land.  The pursuance of <Col N="552" /> such a policy, of putting the people back on the land, will provide the country with a real national asset.  I would appeal to the Minister to put the descendants of our forefathers who were evicted during the land war back on the land.  It is the best work that could be done by any Government.  I would ask the Minister to bring pressure to bear on the Land Commission, and to give his whole attention to land division in the County Waterford.</P>

      <P>As there has been a good deal of time spent in the debate on this Estimate, I do not propose to detain the House very long.  Some few years ago, after the passing of the 1933 Land Act, I had great hopes that the acquisition of land would be speeded up.  I am sorry to say that I have been disillusioned and, like Deputy Kennedy of Westmeath, I find it very hard to think, or believe, that the Land Commission have any serious intentions at all with regard to the acquisition of land or in trying to settle the land problem as we know it in this generation.  I am not now referring to land that they cannot take over because of certain legal defects in our legislation.  What I have in mind is land that they have taken over, portions of certain estates in the County of Galway where they have taken over 200 or 300 acres and left to the owner 1,200 acres.  I hold that that is altogether too much in a county like Galway.  We have a glaring case at the moment in the parish of Foherna, and that is the Johnston estate.  The Land Commission proposes to take over something like 250 acres of land in a non-residential holding.  This belongs to Mrs. Johnson.  They are leaving her almost 100 acres.  Her only son, living a mile distant from that holding, is left 500 acres of land.  Some <Col N="553" /> people talk about small holdings, and about the amount of land which should be left to the people so that they can eke out an existence.  If it takes 500 acres of land and 1,200 acres of land to give an existence to a few families, what a contrast that is with villages such as I know in the County Galway where the total valuation of the holdings of 20 families is only £50.  I certainly think that, with that state of affairs, it is no wonder we have discontent and dissatisfaction all over County Galway.  I do hope that any defects in existing legislation which prevent the Land Commission from getting on with the acquisition of land will be very speedily removed.</P>
      <P>I have nothing at all to say in regard to the division of land.  I believe the division of land is very creditable as far as the Land Commission inspectors are concerned, but as regards the improvement of estates there is one thing I should like to say, and that is that on the part of some Land Commission inspectors there seems to be a tendency to place a very low estimate on the cost of carrying out improvements and bringing them up to the standard required at the present time.  A very high standard of improvement works is being carried out on the estates I have seen divided in County Galway, but the estimate that is made in some instances is very low, and could not cover the necessary improvement works.  A certain number of improvements are neglected for a considerable number of years.  I believe that, when an estate is allotted, the improvement works should be finished before the Land Commission take away their gangers and supervisors.</P>
      <P>The only other matter about which I wish to speak&mdash;and it connects afforestation with land division&mdash;is the fact that it appears according to existing regulations the Land Commission cannot migrate persons unless the land they hold is sufficiently good to relieve congestion in that particular area. There is a certain area in County Galway where a considerable amount of land is suitable for afforestation purposes&mdash;something close on 1,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the parishes of Kilchreest and Kilnadeena.  The people who live there <Col N="554" /> have a considerable amount of this land, and they have only very small patches of what is known as arable land.  The Forestry Department would, I understand, be quite prepared to carry out an afforestation scheme there, but the fact remains that the Land Commission will not take those people out of that particular district, because they hold that they cannot do so on account of the fact that the holdings which they have are not sufficiently good to relieve congestion there, or give sufficient arable land to people who would be left behind.  That is a regulation, I think, which ought to be altered, and altered as speedily as possible in order to enable afforestation work to be carried out.  There are thousands of acres in those particular districts which are quite useless for anything except afforestation, and yet apparently the people who live in those areas are going to be compelled to live there for ever.  That is a state of affairs which should be remedied in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand there are some people on those benches who are in agreement with the Government policy also, as I have noticed, from the debate.  I have to take exception also to the slowness of the work of the Land Commission.  I come from a county where a great deal of work has been done, but it is also a county where a great deal of work yet remains to be done.  With regard to the area I come from, I am highly dissatisfied with the rate of motion of the Land Commission.  It has been said that great bodies move slowly.  If that be so, the Land Commission must be one of the greatest bodies in existence; it is moving very slowly.  I noticed from some of the speeches by Deputies on the opposite benches that there is an allegation of confiscation of land.  That is not my experience.  An individual case from County Meath has been cited where grave injustice in regard to price was alleged.  My experience, all things considered, is that a reasonable price is being offered, and it is in very favourable contrast to the price paid under the 1923 Act under the Cosgrave régime.  I have sad experience of that.  Time and again I have had communications from people who are still unable to pay the land annuities, people whose land annuities are still altogether too high because of the enormous prices paid for land under that Act.  Personally, I think that the present prices are fairly reasonable.  I have heard the prices given in definite cases around my area, and I think they are fairly reasonable.  Of course, there <Col N="556" /> is Deputy Gorey's alternative of the putting up of money by the State.  That brings in another difficulty, and a difficulty which I think should not be introduced. I think that the prices being offered are fairly reasonable.  Any higher prices would, in my opinion, make the land too dear on the tenants.</P>
      <P>I observe that quite a number of Deputies on the opposite benches seem to think that the people who happen to be tenants should be left in possession, no matter what may happen; in other words, that no matter how they use their land or no matter in how many different places they may have land, it should be left to them in perpetuity. I think that is an entirely ridiculous outlook.  Deputy Dillon and other Deputies spoke about the three &ldquo;F's.&rdquo;  One of these &ldquo;F's&rdquo; was fixity of tenure, and the presumption is that a person who is paying his rent should not be disturbed at all, no matter what use he makes of the land.  If that state of affairs were to be allowed to con-continue, then, so far as the young generation is concerned, they might emigrate or try to find employment in any way they could while thousands of acres would be left with no use being made of them except the growing of thistles and weeds.</P>
      <P>The condition of affairs at the present time is not like the condition that existed at the time the people fought for these three &ldquo;F's.&rdquo;  Conditions are entirely different now.  The landlords are gone, but in their place have come a great many people who simply were more or less adventurers and who bought up these lands, in many cases with the help of bank money, and who used the lands for nothing except the growing of grass.  I know of thousands of acres where even the thistles have not been cut, and the only national purpose, if it could be so called, for which these acres were used was the raising of stock.  No employment was given.  I know of many cases of over hundreds of acres where there is only one herd employed, generally at starvation wages&mdash;one herd and a dog&mdash; and where there should be houses and families by the dozen not a single family is being reared.  That is a state of affairs that cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> There are other aspects of the Department of Lands with which I should like to deal.  The Minister, I know, has taken a very deep interest in his work, and I should like to congratulate him.  He is a colleague of my own, but perhaps nobody knows better than I do the interest the Minister has taken in the Department of Lands.  I should like to congratulate him in the first instance on raising the number of acres to be given to landless men.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister came into office, I think, 22 statue acres was the minimum, and he has raised it to 25.  I should also like to congratulate him on the intimate knowledge he has gained in a short time, because I know the knowledge he has of his Department and the great earnestness he has thrown into his work.  There were a few statements, to which I referred in the beginning, that astonished me&mdash;one was made by Deputy Brennan&mdash;and these were to the effect that Fianna Fáil cumainn, or Fianna Fáil secretaries of clubs claimed to have the division of land in their hands.  That certainly comes as a shock to me, and I can assure the House that I know the Fianna Fáil cumainn in County Roscommon a thousand times better than Deputy Brennan could possibly know them.  Deputy Brennan might be surprised to learn that the views of the Fianna Fáil cumainn and members are quite opposite to Deputy Brennan's view.  They hold that&mdash;I do not say with any great truth&mdash;the opposite is the case: that people of Deputy Brennan's Party have a greater pull in the division of land than the Fianna Fáil clubs have.  I have never yet heard&mdash;and this is strictly true&mdash;a Fianna Fáil secretary or a member of a Fianna Fáil cumann allege or boast that they have any authority whatever in the division of land.  I am certainly astonished to hear it, but I can assure the Deputy and the House that the very opposite is the view of Fianna Fáil members and Fianna Fáil cumainn That was one of my reasons for speaking here this evening.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Brodrick went more or less on the same lines.  Now, if there is one complaint more than another that I have to make about the <Col N="558" /> Land Commission, it is that there appears to me to be too much secrecy altogether at headquarters.  The Land Commission, I suppose, make reports in favour of the acquisition of lands, but the public do not see these reports and they know nothing about them.  All these reports are considered in camera and the decisions of the Land Commission are also in camera and nobody knows anything about them.  There is altogether too much secrecy in this matter.  I agree that it is not very easy to make certain matters in the Land Commission public, and I also agree that, in nine cases out of ten, the inspectors of the Land Commission do act very fairly, but there are exceptions, and if there were not quite so much secrecy about the matter some of these exceptions could be avoided. There are deserving cases which do not get land and there are other less deserving cases that get land.  There is nothing like the truth, and I say that if there were less secrecy about the operations of the Land Commission, as they sit here in Dublin, it would be much better for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is in connection with the division of bogs.  There is a great necessity in various parts of the country for the division of bogs and the making of accommodation roads and the draining of those bogs&mdash;an urgent necessity. The making of roads and draining and so on is done very often in connection with the division of land, but apart from the question of the division of land there is the matter of these bogs, and I think the Minister would do well to urge the rapid division of those bogs and the making of accommodation roads into them.  That is all I have to say in connection with this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a lot has been said on this Vote, perhaps too much has been said on it already.  I really think that the Minister has learned a lot from what has been said. He is playing a policy of hide and go seek.  When something arises and he is asked to do something here in this House with regard to some particular <Col N="559" /> matter, Oh, he cannot do anything; and ultimately one asks oneself what has the Minister thought at all?  A number of things were said here by three Fianna Fáil Deputies that deserve attention&mdash;one is the last speech to which we have just listened &mdash;and the three speeches hang on the one, although put in a different way. Along with the one to which we have just listened, we had another from Deputy Victory, and, of course, a masterpiece from Deputy Kennedy.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether or not Deputy Kennedy owns any land&mdash;I do not think he does&mdash;but if he does, it is all right, apparently, doing anything you like on the other fellow's land so long as you do not touch Deputy Kennedy's land.  Of course, there is hope for this country yet if the Minister should resign and make Deputy Kennedy Minister for Lands. Deputy Kennedy thinks that both the Government and the Minister are just taking the land and bandying it about the way they should.  Running through these three speeches you have the philosophy that it is a regrettable thing in this country that land happened to be vested in anybody; that it is a rather unfortunate thing and that men to whom land is given by the Land Commission under their division scheme should be treated for a considerable number of years&mdash;for at least ten years and possibly for 20 years&mdash;as a sort of ticket-of-leave men; that they should not be vested tenants until, I suppose, they have proved to the local gentleman, such as Deputy Kennedy, that they are worthy of the land.  I wonder does the Minister in the future intend to introduce a Bill into this House which will nullify the effect of the vesting of land?  I heard some whispers of that. Of course, if Deputy Kennedy had his way, that Bill would be introduced immediately, and then we could have Deputy Kennedy appointed an inspector under the Land Commission to decide as to whether or not, for example, Deputy Gorey was working his land in a proper manner.</P>

      <P>This House should make clear to the country that there is no new philosophy with regard to the occupation and ownership of land. Deputy Kennedy told this House that the giving of land was the greatest gift the State had made.  Let me tell Deputy Kennedy at once, and without equivocation, that the land of this country belongs to the people that own it and that, in so far as the Government of this country or any government in this country hold that land, they only hold it as trustees for and on behalf of the people during the time it is passing through their hands.</P>

There are insinuations and implications by Deputies and their supporters in the country so that the atmosphere has been created that the occupiers of the land do not own it.  There is a subterranean campaign being carried on that the vesting of land does not constitute an absolute title.  I wish to tell the House and the people of the country who are vested tenants that they are the owners of the land.  If any Bill is introduced to question that right we will see about it when it comes.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with people who own property and discharge their obligations.  That is implied in what I say.  There should be none of this side-wind business about the national interest.  The national interest is to place the people on the land, make them absolute owners of the land, put their heart and soul into the land, and not ruin this country as has been done for the past six years.  We want to have these things clearly, definitely and emphatically stated in this House. The Land Commission, according to Deputy Kennedy, is the most stupid institution in this State.  He said: &ldquo;Most Government Departments in all countries are regarded as stupid, and the most stupid Department in this country is the Land Commission.&rdquo; That is reported in column 122 of volume 71 of the Official Reports.  Why is the Land Commission stupid in Deputy Kennedy's eyes.  Because it has not justified, I suppose, all the wild speeches which he made in his constituency during the last ten years. The speech which we had from Deputy Kennedy last week was to justify himself and to get it published in the local papers that he spoke in the Dáil and called the Land Commission stupid. The Minister, according to Deputy Kennedy, is a decent fellow.  Does Deputy Kennedy not know that the Minister is responsible for the Land Commission, that the Minister is the Land Commission, and that, so far as there are any faults, they are the faults of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I know the Land Commission.  I think I tramped in and out of it as often as any Deputy.  I have heard a lot here about inspectors being tampered with in the division of land and otherwise.  I know the senior inspector of the Land Commission in Donegal for some 20 years.  He was an employee of the old C.D.B.  I have never spoken or written to that man about land in my life, and I never will.  I must say that I do not know how he did his job, but I heard no complaint <Col N="562" /> with regard to the land divided in Donegal.  There was general satisfaction. What he did, I think, was that he picked out the men who were reared on the land and worked on the land and he gave them the land and, in the main, all the allottees, so far as I can learn, gave satisfaction.  It would be a very good thing for the House and the country if there was an end of this bandying about.  We know that whether it happened or not that impression was given with regard to the division of land in the last five or six years.  This thing should be left in the hands of these men.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy went on to say: &ldquo;I certainly resent officials going down to my county and going out with the local Fine Gael agents on bogs and land and passing everyone else by. The thing should be done in an official way.&rdquo;  I wonder how these inspectors happened to meet all Fine Gael supporters. Were all the people in West meath Fine Gael supporters, or has Deputy Kennedy no supporters?  I wonder how this inspector gets his card marked that he can march up to some Fine Gael supporter, and how he knew he was a Fine Gael supporter. I wonder what is the official way.  The official way, of course, is to get your card marked in Merrion Street before you go out, get a list of local cumainn, put it in your pocket, and go down to Westmeath and call on them and say &ldquo;Do you want any land?  If so, send for Deputy Kennedy and get a list, and we will parcel it out.&rdquo;  I think the sooner the Minister stops playing hide and-seek the better; that when these gentlemen begin to make themselves busy he will clear them out and put an end to this nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then Deputy Kennedy went on &ldquo;One thing that struck me in connection with the speakers from the Opposition Benches was that one was trying to outdo the other in praise of the officials.&rdquo;  I said what I had to say about the officials.  I did not say it to themselves.  The Minister is responsible for the Department, and I think it is deplorable that a Deputy should come into the House and try to segregate them and take the responsibility off the proper shoulders.  The responsibility <Col N="563" /> is on the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary has taken no active part, so far as I can see, in this Department.  We hear about the Minister being a fine fellow, but when the Minister has to do something, of course he has nothing to do with that. The next day it is something else, and then he becomes a very nice fellow. Whatever faults there are in the Land Commission, they are the faults of the Minister.  It is time to stop this attacking of officials and being afraid to attack the Minister.  I am not making any attack on the Minister.  His own Party are attacking now, because he did not put an end to the nonsense carried on during the last five or six years.  He should call them together and tell them there must be an end to this nonsense.  We are now the Government. We have to administer, and we have to administer this and every other Department according to law.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke praised the Minister for having increased the area of farms for landless men from 20 to 25 acres.  I had been trying in this House to raise the area of these things, if possible, up to 50 acres.  I think, if it was possible at all, that every man should get a farm of 50 acres.  Unfortunately, in this country we have a limited amount of land but, at the same time, I dread to think, in the division of land, that irrespective of who it is done by, or what Government, this House should be creating and this Department should be creating a new congested problem.  I have grave doubts as to the wisdom of giving a man 20 acres of land of the type on which he will have to carry the equipment of a large farm.  I think ultimately that that would create a new congested problem in this country and our last position would be worse than the first. I did not know that the Minister was endeavouring to increase or in fact that he had increased the area of these farms to 25 acres.  I still think it is too small.  We should not do this thing purely for the sake of doing something.  We are doing this thing as a national question. <Col N="564" /> We are doing this in order to put families into the way of earning a livelihood and being in a position to earn that livelihood.  The weapon we put into their hands should be effective. It should be, as far as it is humanly possible, normally effective, that is to say, it should have within itself the means of maintaining a man, his wife and family economically.  I am afraid that on a farm of land of 20 acres he would have to carry two horses.  I take it that the position there will not be as it is in the areas where these people come from.  In the first place these people did not want any horse at all.  Secondly they might have to keep one horse and then they did what they call down the country &ldquo;ploughing in &rdquo;&mdash;in other words ploughing with a neighbour, two horses are put together and plough one man's land and then the other man's land, and harrow and finish it, but a lot of the small farms had no call for it at all; it is done by spade labour.  I cannot see that a farm of 20 acres could carry two horses or carry the requisite amount of stock to produce the wealth, even the very frugal wealth, to maintain a man and his wife and family and pay rates and taxes.  What I would like to aim at is this&mdash;offering a man 40 to 50 acres; I would ask him if he were willing to take it; place him there; make him a vested tenant as soon as I could.  I would give him no dole of any kind.  I would say, &ldquo;There you are; there is an opportunity for you; everything is in your hands to make good.  There is a means of making good.  It is in your own hands to do so.&rdquo;  I am still sceptical about the possibility of the success of the scheme.  I think it should not be done purely for the sake of doing something.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the present organisation of the Land Commission. I drew attention to it last year and the year before, observing what has been going on in the country, and also watching what has been going on in the Land Commission.  Some said that it was going too fast; others that it was going too slow; others that there was chaos in the Department.  If all or any <Col N="565" /> of these things are true the fault of it lies with the people in this House and their friends outside.  They have attempted to play hari kari with the wealth of this country because there is no wealth in this State only the land, and in order to get votes these people have played hari kari with that wealth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">

      <P>What is hari kari? I did not know they divided land in Japan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Then they have got this idea into their heads, that of course any farm can be taken over. Some man may have a farm, and his neighbour may tell him something is wrong with it, and they write up to the Land Commission and ask them to take it over.  The Land Commission have to take some steps in regard to that, although the thing may be obviously ridiculous.  They give the idea that of course they will settle the whole ownership of land, not actually do it, but give the impression that it can be done, and there is nothing worse than that.  Inspectors will go down to some of these farms to see if it is possible that they can be taken over.  Time is wasted and, of course, obviously from the beginning the thing could not come to anything.  The Land Commission, when these busybodies get going, have to pay attention to them, or it is probable they may get a rap across the knuckles from the Minister, or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sooner that we all steady down in this country the better.  There is no use talking about what happened in the past.  The past is past and there is no use talking about it.  It is to-morrow that counts.  I would ask the Deputies of this House to use their influence, of themselves and with their supporters, to get the country to settle down and get it into their heads that the sooner the people of this country and the tenant farmers of this country are led to believe, what they did believe and what is actually true, that they are the owners of the land, and that, as long as they discharge their obligations, nobody can dispossess them, the better it will be for everyone, and the Land Commission will work more smoothly.  Every <Col N="566" /> sort of ridiculous fad with regard to land, taking over of land, inspection of land, inspection of 30 acres, ten acres, 15 acres and 20 acres, inspectors going down to see if they could be taken over, is ridiculous and useless for any purpose. Such farms could not be divided.</P>
    <P>Now, rather serious comment has been made here as to the increasing expenditure of this Department.  Really, one finds it rather difficult to understand the increase in the expenditure in relation to, we will say, the amount of wages that is paid out, because there is no substantial increase in the vesting of land, and, of course, the machinery of sub-division was there, and, of course, there is no abnormal increase in the division of land.  It seems rather difficult to explain the increase in expenditure.  I do not know really where it has taken place.  I take it, it has taken place owing to this torture of the Land Commission, and I suppose of the Minister, by claims for inspection and all this sort of thing to see are A.B,, C.D,, X.Y. carrying on their farms in the way they should be. Did anybody ever hear anything like it? They go down to see is he working his farm properly.  What is this thing of working a farm properly?  Who has to come to the conclusion in that?  I hope I will never hear that uttered in this House again.  Nobody knows that.  Take two farms in one townland. In regard to how they should be worked they would be as different as day from night, owing to the nature of the subsoil and of the surface itself. Then we are to have inspectors, more inspectors, to go down to see is A.B., C.D., or X.Y. working his farm properly.  The man to know how to work a farm is the man living on it.  He knows the nature of the surface soil and the subsoil.  He is the man to know what is best for it.  I am glad to see Deputy O'Reilly in his speech has made a somersault on that matter. Deputy Kennedy, I hope, will come next.  Of course, an easy way to get him would be to make him Minister for Lands.  Everything would be gay then in the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>There would be no delays if Deputy Kennedy were Minister. Really I think it would be a wise thing for the Minister to tell the House, give an explanation, as to the increase in the cost of the Land Commission, practically three times, in fact over three times what it was.</P>
      <P>I see in the Estimate an item which, if I were so disposed, would give me malicious delight&mdash;a sum of £12,000 as the cost of the collection branch.  I remember when the 1933 Act was going through, I had the audacity and the presumption to suggest that the old system of collection should be continued. I knew something about it and about how it worked, and I thought that the machinery was as satisfactory as it was humanly possible to create.  I queried the new proposal and a number of Deputies opposite&mdash;I will not name them&mdash; howled across at me: &ldquo;Oh, you are speaking for the lawyers.&rdquo;  I wonder who is getting the loot now?  In that year the collection cost £4,000 and last year was £12,000.  There is another item of £1,400 odd which was, I take it, for costs outstanding, but the cost of this branch has increased from £4,000 to £12,000, and I was pleading for the lawyers&mdash;a crook of a lawyer pleading for his kindred&mdash;five years ago when I thought that the machinery for collection then was as good and as efficient as was humanly possible.</P>
      <P>Another case has been referred to here and the Minister will perhaps reply: &ldquo;I have no power and I can do nothing&rdquo;; but where there is a wrong, where there is an injustice, it should be righted, and I shall not be satisfied with the Minister merely saying that he has no power.  If he has not got the power, let him come in here and get the power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because if injustice has been done, and it has been proved here that injustice has been done, it has been done under a law passed by this House and the Minister should come in here at the first opportunity and right the wrong.  What is this case?  It is worth while returning <Col N="568" /> to it and amplifying what was said about it.  It is a case in, I think, County Westmeath.  A man died in 1925 and the Estate Duty Office assessed the value of his farm for estate duty purposes at £3,500, if my memory is correct.  The widow&mdash;it was not stated here whether or not there were any children&mdash;put up the farm for sale and refused an offer of £3,000.  Ultimately, the Land Commission took it over and that woman got £5.  Those are the central facts of this case.  Let nothing else come in it.  A Government Department charged that woman estate duty on £3,500 after the death of her husband.  She put the farm up for auction and refused an offer of £3,000 and the land Commission takes it over and hands that woman £5.  Is there a wrong there?  Obviously, there is a wrong and a grave injustice.  Everybody except the widow who owned the land has been settled with.  She could have gone into the Land Commission and put an end to the fee farm grant under which the land was held and could have brought the land under the Land Act.  The purchase money would, of course, have to be redeemed.  But in this case, we pay off the landlord and give him all the money that is due to him; we give the Land Commission what is due to them; we pay rates, rent and everything else; and we turn to the poor widow and we give her £5 for assets which one Government Department said were worth £3,500.  I presume she paid the duty, wherever she got it.  I know where the defect is.  It is in the law and we here are parties to passing a law which does that grave injustice to one class and transfers a benefit to another class.</P>

Of course, the State benefits because the State should pay off both the tenant and the landlord, the people representing the owners who hold the rights under the fee farm grant.  Why should the owner of the fee farm grant be fully paid?  Why should there not be some equity in this?  Why should the State demand the last pound of flesh from that widow, and get it, and a few years afterwards say: &ldquo;Your assets are worth only £5.&rdquo;  I am sure that every Deputy and every right-thinking person outside will agree that steps should be taken forthwith to remedy that position and to do justice to that woman, if she is alive, and to others of her type.  We are going to make a new Heaven for one class of citizens&mdash;the people to whom the Land Commission gives the land.  Very well, but it should not be done by robbing somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues are arising with regard to the taking over of estates and turbary rights attached to them by the Land Commission.  The plot of bog allotted to a tenant when the land was vested in him is probably now all used, but that portion of the annuity due in respect of the bog is still being charged although the tenant has no bog.  There is a contract there, firstly, that the Land Commission will give turbary to the tenant, and secondly, that the tenant shall be charged an annuity for it.  The Land Commission are insisting that the amount of the annuity apportioned on the bog must be paid.  I am afraid that matter will give the Minister and future Ministers much trouble, because it is a very serious matter.  I think if the Department looked round a little they would find bogs adjoining.  These people who <Col N="570" /> want a plot of bog might as well be living in the heart of Dublin, because nobody will give it to them.  The portion they got from the Land Commission has been used up and nobody will give them any more.  It is a terrible hardship.  Obviously these people are unable to buy coal, and if they are to have turbary to supply the house with fuel for the year they will be charged a big price for it.  I should like the Minister to investigate the matter.  I am afraid I cannot suggest legislation, but I think something could be done if the Minister would seriously direct his attention to the subject.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of arrears, which has become a very substantial matter in this State.  I hope this whole matter is a closed book for all of us. Regardless of what the cause of it was, it is all over, and we should see to it that such a thing will not occur in the future.  The increase in the amount of the arrears is certainly a very startling thing.  There were practically no arrears due prior to 1933.  The three years' arrears that were due prior to the passing of the 1933 Act were funded and all arrears prior to that were wiped out.  The present arrears are an accumulation since the passing of the 1933 Act, and they are very serious. There has been a lot of badinage in the House as to the cause of the arrears.  Let us be honest about it. In the main those arrears have become due because the people were unable to pay as a result of the Government's policy.  The circumstances that existed during the last few years are happily at an end, and let us hope that the farmers will get some opportunity to become prosperous again.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that these men were driven into the position that they were unable to pay their debts.  I heard speeches made by the chairman of the political Party of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Maguire, as to how these arrears became due.  I am sure that Deputy Maguire, coming from a county something like my own, knows well that perfectly honest men who would not owe a shilling to anybody have not to-day, as the saying goes, a four-footed beast on the farm.  I have tried to arrange with the Land Commission to <Col N="571" /> allow these men an opportunity of putting some stock on the land.  I arranged that no beast would be seized when they let the land, and I promised that when they got some money they would have it sent to pay off some portion of the debt they owed to the Land Commission. I did all I could to allow them to carry on while times were bad. It is a cruel thing that these men have been reduced to such circumstances. The best test of their honesty is that under all the Land Acts they paid every penny that they had to pay.  The men you accuse of not discharging their obligations are not any different from your fathers.  Give them an opportunity and they will discharge all their obligations.  It reminds me of the campaign in the House of Lords when the Land Acts were going through.  The charge was made against the Irish tenant farmers that if the English Government gave them credit they would not repay.  The Irish tenant farmers proved how false that suggestion was.  Wherever there is a charge of that sort against the tenant farmers of this country, I will deny it.</P>

      <P>The less said about that the better.  With regard to the collection, I must admit that the Land Commission have had a desperate job; it must have been a frightful job.  They have been desperately helpful and sympathetic. In many cases it was next to impossible to make an effort.  Under terribly difficult circumstances the Land Commission behaved very well towards the tenants and the tenants should appreciate it, and at the first available opportunity they should discharge their obligations.  It will be necessary to give many farmers some help in order to get going again.  I should like to put an end to the impression caused abroad with regard to the cost of this thing. The impression is that the cost is out of proportion to what has been accomplished.  There is some explanation for that and I think the Minister should give it.  We have all these new schemes of division and sub-division, we have the taking over of farms and <Col N="572" /> more inspectors have to be appointed. There should be an end to that and the Minister should take his courage in his hands and say, to what the people call &ldquo;these wild men,&rdquo; that there must be an end to the gallop.  If he does that, he will get the approval of the House and the country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the transfers to the Gaeltacht colonies, I should like to know what the Minister proposes to do with the plots from which the colonists have been removed.  A very large number of them are pretty worthless. They are terribly small, only small patches in between the rocks and things like that.  On the other hand, on some of the small patches there are very good houses.  The sons and daughters went to America and sent home money to construct houses for the old people. Will the Minister let the houses to those people who remain in the district and who at the moment have very bad houses&mdash;workmen of some kind, carpenters and other tradesmen?  Let us hope that when we meet again on this Vote, the Land Commission will be operating under more favourable conditions than at present and that the Minister will not get the drubbing that he has got on this occasion.  I hope when the Vote next comes before the House conditions will be better and that the Land Commission will not be charged with stupidity as it has been to-day.  Personally, I might say that I have never met with any stupidity in the Land Commission or in any of the staff.  The first man I meet when I go into the Land Commission knows more about land than all the Deputies of the House put together, myself included.</P>

      <P>I am sure I will not be expected to deal with all the points which have been raised, because we have had a record debate, and a record number of points put forward.  I wonder whether I should begin at the beginning or at the end.  I suppose I had better start at the beginning.  In the course of the debate and when Deputy McMenamin was speaking, Deputy Davin said he was here long <Col N="573" /> before the people on this side of the House were here at all.  I must say that Deputy Davin did not make the sort of speech that might be said to be worthy of a man with such a long experience.  Deputy O'Higgins dealt with one part of the Deputy's speech, and I would like to deal with another part.  Deputy Davin told us on the opening day of the debate on this Vote that he got a letter that very morning from one of his constituents, complaining of the conduct of one of the forestry inspectors in one of the local schemes. Obviously he had not time to verify what was in that complaint, but he took it as being correct.  Whatever excuse there might be for a Deputy with a short experience in the House, taking, without verifying, a complaint made about an official, there was no excuse at all for the action of Deputy Davin. The Deputy took as correct a charge by an aggrieved person against a public official.  A Deputy should examine them before he comes to the conclusion that every complaint he gets is justified.  In this particular case the Deputy, certainly, did not behave as a Deputy with his long experience in the House might have been expected to behave. He also did another thing which a Deputy with a sense of discretion would not do.  He accused of something like espionage during the Black and Tan régime a person who could be identified.  If that was not what the Deputy meant, that was the impression that was created here.  That was a most reprehensible thing on the part of Deputy Davin.  Taking the debate as a whole, Deputy Davin's speech was the worst speech to which I listened.</P>

There is an Advisory Committee which advises the Government as to the rate of pay in the different areas.  It is entirely a matter for the Government themselves to decide what wages they are to pay. I am not shelving that responsibility at all.  It is my responsibility.  I tell the Deputy that that question of wages is under review at the moment. More than that I cannot say.</P>

      <P>The responsibility in regard to the matter of wages is not entirely for my Department, but I am responsible as well as the other members of the Government for the decision taken.  It is not entirely a matter for my Department, as the Deputy ought to know, considering the long experience he has had in this House.  I am doing what I can to have a decision on that question expedited.  The Deputy was one of the few Deputies in the House who insisted that there was discrimination in the division of the lands and in other things.  He said that information was given to members of my Party in his constituency and not given to him.  That is entirely incorrect. There is no foundation for that charge.  I get complaints from members of the Fianna Fáil organisation somewhat on the same lines as the Deputy made here, complaints that people who belong to other political organisations are getting land while those who belong to the Fianna Fáil organisation are not.  All this, I think, will convince an impartial observer or listener that taking things in the main a fair deal is meted out to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that charge in one case and only in one case.  I am now in a position to say that I know the Minister has been asked to hold an inquiry in that particular case.  Is he going to do so?  The inspector in that case went to the wives of the applicants and asked them to say with what political party their husband was associated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think of holding an inquiry into a thing like that. There is to-day no inspector in Ireland who is so stupid as to do that sort of thing.  In the beginning there may have been such an inspector.  In some cases the complaint is that they only gave land to the Fianna Fáil people <Col N="576" /> and in others that they only gave land to the Fine Gael people.  I dare say Labour gets a turn, too.  Taking it all round, the general belief is that the junior inspectors are all people of discretion.  If not discreet by nature they very soon learn to be discreet.  I say that really Deputy Davin has not covered himself with glory in the line he has taken here. It was no credit to him or to the House to find that a man of his long experience should behave as he has behaved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin and also other Deputies raised questions with regard to giving allotments to cottage holders.  I think it is a fact that since 1932 a greater number of cottage tenants have got accommodation plots than was the case formerly.  I am not quite certain that that policy has been justified.  I would like to see every cottier or cottager getting four or five acres of land so as to enable him to keep a cow and be able to have a bit of tillage.  I think, however, it will be found that unfortunately a great number of cottagers who have got the land have not been in a position to work these allotments.  I do not say that that was through any fault of their own.  But they have not been able to take advantage of the plots they have.  A lot of these plots have gone derelict.  I am sure that neither Deputy Davin nor any other Deputy is going to ask the Government to continue giving out land except where they are satisfied that the land so given already is being properly worked.  At the time when these men were given land it was the belief of the Department that they would work it.  Otherwise the land would not have been given to them.  In future, cottagers will get land where they are considered to be in a position to work the land. There is no objection to giving a cottager four or five acres of land so as to enable him to keep a cow and to have a little tillage.  I think these were all the points that Deputy Davin raised.  If there are any other points the Deputy wants me to deal with now, I am prepared to deal with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to justify in one case the giving of land to <Col N="577" /> an old age pensioner without a family and ignoring the claims of a cottage tenant with a big family.  Is that genuine?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, I cannot put my hand on it at the moment, so I shall pass from it.  I shall have to content myself with replying to the Deputy.  In regard to bog reclamation about which the Deputy also spoke, not much is being done in that line.  A few schemes have been undertaken but, generally speaking, big schemes of bog reclamation have not been undertaken.  The time of the Land Commission is taken up with the division of land and much of it will also be given over to the rearrangement of congested holdings in the West.  It is principally for that reason that a big recruitment of staff has taken place.  The Cluais Valley scheme, suspended by the last Government, is going ahead again.  There is also a small scheme in Tirconaill and when the result of that experiment is ascertained, probably a bigger experiment will be undertaken; but for the <Col N="578" /> moment, very much work is not being done in the way of reclamation. Deputies will know that grants for reclamation of land are dealt with by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In regard to particular estates about which Deputy Davin asked some questions and to which he also referred in the debate, I cannot add anything to what I told him in the answers I gave to these questions.  The acquisition of these estates is generally held up by an adverse legal decision, but it is hoped that that will be dealt with in the new Bill which is to be shortly introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to answer my question in regard to the employment of men on forestry schemes.  Will he explain why single men are being retained to the exclusion of married men with families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to deal with that until the Forestry Vote was reached, but, as the matter has been raised, I might as well deal with it now.  I have had that matter inquired into, and the charge made by Deputy Davin, or which Deputy Davin took up so quickly, is denied by the official concerned. He was supposed to have said that he fought the Labour Party before and that he would fight them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case about which I asked the Minister now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This staff is recruited through the labour exchange.  When it came to the seasonal discharge of men, which, as every Deputy knows who knows anything about the matter, takes place every year, the forester in charge decided that certain men were better workers than others, and he decided to keep on the men he thought were the best workers.  I do not see any way of getting over that.  If someone on the staff superior to that particular man were to tell him that he should have kept on certain men rather than others, and if the work afterwards were not done as well as it might be, the forester in charge would have a legitimate complaint and he could say, &ldquo;If I had been left the staff I considered best, my work would be better.&rdquo;<Col N="579" /> That is the only possible way you can deal with these schemes.  The fact is that these men who were kept on were, in the opinion of the forester on the spot, the best men for the work.  The men were originally taken on at the labour exchange.  The principal factor in deciding whether a man will be taken on, apart from fitness, is how many dependents he has.  If he is a married man with a family, he gets a preference over single men, and if unmarried men were taken on through the labour exchange their circumstances must be deserving.  If the forester finds that these men are better workers, when the seasonal discharge takes place he keeps them on.  I have nothing further to say on this matter. That is the only justification I have to offer, that if you are going to get the work done, you must give some discretion to the man in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I say they are not.  You must give the man in charge some discretion. If it happens that he puts off a certain man, because he does not consider him as good as another whom he retains, we cannot blame him.  The officer in charge tries to get the best men for the work.  It is unfortunate that the name of any person should be mentioned in this connection but when the name is mentioned by the Deputy there is no way out of it.  You must leave a certain amount of discretion to the person whose duty it is to see the job done.  There is no way out of that in any walk of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall pass on to what Deputy Roddy said.  He complained about the increased expense in comparison with the amount of land divided recently. Surely Deputy Roddy, from his experience in the Land Commission, ought to know that moneys spent on improvements are often expended in respect of land acquired a year or so before?  Housing and other improvements do not take place in the year in which the land is acquired.  If he is looking at the amount of land <Col N="580" /> divided during the past year or at the cost of acquiring land, he should relate the extra cost to the land acquired a couple of years before.  He also complained that it was not set out clearly in the Estimate under what sub-head provision was made for housing.</P>

      <P>As to the cost of collecting, I did not boast of the state of the collection.  I must admit that it was not good, but what I do say is that there has been a distinct improvement. Deputy Roddy will be pleased to know that since that statement was made up, from the 31st January to 31st March, £260,000 extra has been collected.  While I am on the question of collection, some Deputies raised the matter of withdrawing warrants.  All I can say is that it would be impossible to have a general policy of withdrawing warrants or anything of that kind.  I think everybody will, however, admit that where individuals make any case at all, the Collection Department is always willing to listen to them.</P>

    <P>To say that they should simply have a policy of not trying to collect the money at all would be impossible.  We would then find that we would get no money in.  One of the easiest things to do is to ask people not to pay anything. That is not confined to one Party or to one side.  It is the easiest thing in the world to subscribe to.  The Land Bank cases have been almost all disposed of, and there are very few left.  That is the reason the amount is shown for that item.  As Deputy Roddy and other Deputies raised questions about the Gaeltacht colonies I had better deal with them.  He said that we were not doing what we should <Col N="581" /> do, taking bigger migrants.  We are taking both classes.  Where the Land Commission can get big migrants to leave congested areas, they try to induce them to leave.  In addition, they started a policy of migrating small dwellers from congested areas so as to relieve congestion there.  There have been only two schemes so far, and there was a hold up in them to see how the new migrants were shaping.  I admit that it will take some time before the full effects will be seen, naturally, more than two or three years.  At the same time, I cannot agree that after two or three years we cannot see how people are likely to get on.  I have got a very detailed report about all the migrants in the Gaeltacht colonies, and I certainly think it is a very edifying one.  As some one suggested, I would like to get a bus and to bring Deputies down there.  I seriously suggest to any Deputy interested that he should go down to Gibbstown or Rathcarne to see how things are going on.  I think they are doing very well.  We heard about some migrants going to England and to other places for work.  That is so, I am sure, but it is not true in many cases, as far as I know, that the head of the house goes.  There are very big families there, and, as everyone knows, no matter how big a holding is it will not maintain all the members of it when they become adults.  The elder members are bound to leave, and that is what happened at Gibbstown and Rathcarne. They went where they could get work.  If there is work in England they go there, and if there is work in Dublin they come here.  That happens on big farms of 200 or 300 acres, where there are large families.  The only difference is that big families are more numerous in congested districts.  I think County Meath people should not object to the infusion of new blood. As far as the Irish language is concerned, I think it will be maintained. The fact that there are so many families there, and that they have got so much encouragement is bound, I think, to have a very good effect from the language point of view.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to be considered by those who talk about the extra cost involved there compared <Col N="582" /> with the case of landless men.  It has to be borne in mind that landless men are giving up nothing, while these people are, and are also being torn away from places they knew in order to enable their neighbours to be relieved.  Deputy McMenamin asked what would be done with such land. It will be used to the best advantage amongst those who are left behind.  I think there will be a re-arrangement policy in some districts where houses are good and that they will be used for other tenants.  The problem of relieving acute congestion in the west, and in congested areas, is being properly tackled.  There is no other way of tackling this overdue problem except by a rearrangement of congested holdings and by migrating families from congested areas.  If for no other reason than that it is justified.  That work was neglected by the last Government and by this Government up to last year.  There was too much anxiety to divide a lot of land.  I think we will have to face the problem that is crying out for solution, or otherwise leave it largely unsolved.  We are determined that land will be allocated in these areas, but I hope they will be left there until there is a complete re-arrangement of policy or, as Deputy Gorey suggested, until we conquer more land, as the Germans and the Japs are doing.  As far as I could gather from Deputy Gorey, he thinks we have too big a population here. That is the only conclusion I could come to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, if the land is properly worked when divided we can have at least three times the present population living in this country. Instead of that, I think this is the most sparsely populated country in Europe.  As to the question of land being properly worked, I remind Deputies that that was not introduced by this Government, but was in the Land Act of 1923.  It was introduced then when it was a question of resuming holdings of tenanted lands and also in the Act of 1931, Section 44, in cases like Mrs. Connolly's.  If land <Col N="583" /> was worked according to proper methods of husbandry it could be admitted to the benefits of the Act. Otherwise it could not be.  What were proper methods of husbandry and who was to decide that question was settled then.  I can tell the Deputy that the same procedure and the same method of inquiry as to whether the land was worked in accordance with proper methods of husbandry have not changed in one iota.  The policy is the same, and Deputies on the opposite benches cannot throw any blame on us in connection with it that does not belong to them.  So far as that question is concerned the procedure is the same and, very largely, the same individuals are deciding it.  Deputy Cosgrave asked what I was doing for the money I was drawing from the State, and what the Parliamentary Secretary was doing.  I must say that I did not think that a nice way for an ex-President to approach this matter.  I think, to say the least, we are doing as much&mdash;I will not say that we are doing more&mdash;as his Minister and Parliamentary Secretary did.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy thought it fit for ten years to maintain a Minister for Lands and a Parliamentary Secretary, I do not know what fault he has to find with the present Government for doing the same thing, except that he thinks the present Minister and Parliamentary Secretary unfit.  The Deputy did not say that.  To my mind, he also asked an extraordinary question.  I could understand a city man like myself, who had no experience of conditions in the country, asking, but I cannot understand the Deputy asking about the difference in rents paid by town dwellers and by men in the country for houses.  If it was only a city man who had nothing to do with land raised the question, I could understand it.  Surely a man who was in charge for years should not ask a question like that.  I was really surprised. He raised a case that occurred in County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say that the basis upon which the price of land is fixed now is the same as was laid down in the 1923 Act, that it should be fair both to the <Col N="584" /> owner of the land and to the Land Commission.  That was the basis reported on.  It certainly looks a bad case, and is a bad case, but there is more in it than Deputy McMenamin admitted.  He says that there are only three things to be considered, but I have to consider more than three things.  In fact, the lady herself made the first move, and asked to be given the benefit of the Land Acts.  Following that an inspection was held.  It is laid down in Section 44 of the Act passed by the last Government, in which Deputy Roddy was a Parliamentary Secretary, that the land must be worked &ldquo;in accordance with the proper methods of husbandry,&rdquo; and that otherwise the people concerned are not entitled to the benefits of the Land Act.  It was found, by whatever standard is laid down, that the land held by this lady was not being worked in accordance with those methods.  As a matter of fact, the land had become derelict.  There had been no manuring done, the drains were choked up, and the land was being let from year to year.  The income that was being derived from the land was a minus quantity.  As far as I can gather, the outgoings were more than the income.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that a certain figure was offered for the land in 1925, but I submit that what has been said on that is true of other things as well as of land, and that if a person has property and allows it to become derelict that person cannot expect to get very much for it after 12 years of such usage.  As I have said, the price was calculated on the basis laid down in the Act passed by the last Administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister know that the phrase &ldquo;proper methods of husbandry&rdquo; was merely introduced into that Act to enable a tenant to purchase a holding under a certain title from the landlord, and so bring it in under the terms of the Land Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that if land is being set, if it is being neglected and let go derelict, with the drains choked and with no manuring being done, and if it is bringing in less than is <Col N="585" /> going out, it should be acquired. Another thing that has been ignored in this case is that this lady, who has no children, has actually been left with 200 acres.  That is a part of it that I must draw the attention of the House to, although the Deputies opposite who knew all about it did not refer to it.  I mentioned it before when dealing with this matter on the Adjournment, but the Deputies opposite very conveniently ignored it.  It is a very important factor to be borne in mind that she was not turned out on the road and left with nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister going to take the other 200 acres and treat her in the same way?  Surely there is no logic in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Land Commission case, and whatever fault may be found with the procedure adopted it can be shared by both Parties in the House and by the whole House that passed these Acts.  There has been no change in the procedure as far as that matter is concerned.  As I said before, a person might have some other kind of property that might be worth more than £3,000, and if the owner neglected it, he might not get even £5 for it after a lapse of some years.  The person might have to give it away for nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This land, I take it, was not being used.  Hence nothing was being taken out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The land was set for grazing, and as I have said, it was becoming derelict.  I am sorry that these things happen.  This is an exceptional case, and the Opposition have made as much as they possibly could out of it. At the same time, I do not think it is quite as bad as they would have the public believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Brasier's question about the Sailors and Soldiers Act, they got a reduction of 55 per cent., and it is hard to see what more can be done.  Too much money was paid in this case, with the result that those people, even though they have got a reduction of 55 per cent., find it very hard to carry on.  I cannot <Col N="586" /> see what more can be done than to give them this reduction of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of what is an economic holding on which we have had all sorts of opinions expressed here.  I think that Deputy Gorey would probably say that anything less than 80 acres would not be any good.  I cannot undertake to answer the question: &ldquo;What is an economic holding?&rdquo; because so much depends on the standard of the people that you are dealing with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I took 20 Irish acres of good land as the minimum, and said than anything less would be too small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose an economic holding would be such a holding as would enable people to bring up their families in frugal comfort by making good use of the land they get.  I think that the Land Commission are giving out such farms.  The farms are not as big as they would like to have them. I would like to be able to give people 50 acres, but we have to remember that the quantity of land that is available is limited.  We cannot manufacture it. We have a big problem to solve with congestion in the West, South and North, and if we were to give out 50 or 40-acre farms, then we would never solve that problem.  We are going to make a desperate effort to do it in the coming year.  I think the amount of land that is now being given out is about 25 acres of arable land.  In the case of middling land, the quantity given may run to 35 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what is the valuation?  I understood that it was the basis of valuation, and not acreage, that the Land Commission took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They will get 25 acres, anyway, whatever the valuation may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big difference in the quality of land.  Twenty-five acres in one case might be quite all right, while in another case the land might be valueless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They get more where the land is indifferent.  The Land Commission officials are men of great <Col N="587" /> experience and they will know where 25 acres will suffice, and of the case where it would be necessary to give more.  The quantity of land given is not fixed on a valuation basis.  What guides the Land Commission is the re-sale value of the land.  I do not think that I will say any more about the question of what is an economic holding, but the Land Commission intends to continue the policy that I have spoken of.</P>
      <P>Deputies from Meath were very insistent that the demands of local men should get first consideration.  My reply is that they have got first consideration, and got, in my opinion, undue consideration.  I think they have got more consideration than they really should have got.  It is all very well for Deputy O'Reilly to talk about tilling too much.  There is no fear of that.  The instructors that are being sent around by the County Committee of Agriculture are satisfied with the way those Gaeltacht people are working their land.  There is no fear that they will over-till.  Some tillage must be done, and to have all the land laid down in grass, without any sign of tillage at all, is not good enough.</P>
      <P>While I am on that, I suppose I had better refer to the question of fixity of tenure.  Deputy Coburn raised the matter of the people in the County Louth who had land for about 11 years. Their case is different from that of the ordinary allottees who have signed purchase agreements.  The people to whom he referred have signed temporary convenience agreements, one of the conditions of which is that they are not to sublet their land.  But they all sublet it, and sublet it to bigger farmers.  They all paid their rates, I agree, but they did not use the land. I know, of course, that conacre is taken by thousands of people all over the country, but I think that Deputy Coburn will agree that holdings that were given out by the Land Commission ought not to be let in conacre, but ought to be worked by the people who have been given land by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not let. Were not specific instances given to indicate that the people tilled portions <Col N="588" /> of the holdings for quite a number of years, and that it was only in exceptional circumstances that they let the land?  Did not the woman whose husband died till the land for a certain number of years?  Two or three of the other tenants also tilled the land until, through some unfortunate circumstance, such as the loss of cattle or horses in one or two years they were unable to till.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also raised the matter here.  He gave me some papers and I took the matter up personally.  I had the senior inspector for the district sent down to go into every case, and his report was that the case was even worse than was presented by his junior.  In the case of that widow the Land Commission were quite prepared to reinstate her, but I understand that she is not anxious to be reinstated.  That may not be so, but that is the report the inspector has got.  The fact is then that there was no tillage done on the land; it was not done by the people to whom the land was given by the Land Commission.  I think it will be agreed that it is not right that big farmers should be allowed to take the land off those small people, becoming in their turn, as Deputy Dillon said, minor landlords.  That is really what is happening.  When people get land from the Land Commission it is understood that they are going to live on the land and work it, instead of letting it and becoming minor landlords.  I want to warn those people that, in cases where they are doing that, we will have no hesitation whatever in taking up the land from them again, and I think every Deputy in every Party ought to agree to help in that matter.  It is waste of public money, and it is a shame to allow people to make such misuse of the land which the State has gone to the expense and trouble of providing them with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but will the Minister not admit that those people got no warning whatsoever from the Land Commission that the land would be taken from them if they did not cultivate it?  Surely the wiser course <Col N="589" /> would be to say: &ldquo;On and after such a date, if you do not till the land it will be taken from you.&rdquo;  In the case of one particular tenant he had purchased seeds and ploughed the land for this year's crop, and he was turned out of it.  I would ask the Minister, as man to man, if he and his family were in possession of a farm for ten years would he like to be thrown out of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not, but I should like to show Deputy Coburn a copy of the temporary convenience agreement that was signed.  In that he would see the terms under which the people are given that land.  They are clearly laid down, and one of the sections specifically deals with the question of sub-letting.  I do not know whether any notice was given in this case, but the agreement itself ought to be sufficient.  As far as the inspectors could ascertain, no attempt was made by the people to till this land. I have gone into the matter.  I was asked by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Coburn to go personally into it, and I did.  I got the file myself, and, not satisfied with that, I had a special inspection made.  That is the report I received, and I have no reason to believe that the experienced inspector who made the report in that case was not acting fairly.</P>

It is all wrong that people who get land like that from the State and get new houses should refuse to live in the houses and refuse to work the land.  If it is the first time it has happened, it is a start at any rate, and it will continue very rapidly. Some of those people who are now drawing rent which should never be drawn at all will find themselves dispossessed, and the type of people for whom the land was intended will get it.</P>

      <P>The question of vesting was raised by Deputy Hogan.  That matter has been dealt with.  Last year 2,630 holdings were finally vested.  That is the highest annual number since 1931.  Of course the people are getting the benefit of the reduction since the 1931 Act.  All the land was vested in the Land Commission, and although it was not vested in those people they are getting the benefit of the sinking fund reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being speeded up. Deputy Linehan suggested that there should be public notice in regard to those applications for land.  As we do not want to have too many riots in the country, I do not think that is the best way.  The Land Commission inspectors go around and interview every applicant for land, and every consideration is given.  If we were to send out a notice that they would be considered on a certain date I do not think you would do much business.  Deputy McGowan and Deputy Linehan raised the matter of the sub-division of land. I do not think there is any undue delay now.  There has been a big improvement, but there are cases where there is difficulty about title, and in some estates in County Dublin near the sea where there are sub-divisions for house building purposes there is unavoidable delay.  I understand that there is no avoidable delay now.  Deputy O'Sullivan and others talked about improvements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Taken generally, I <Col N="591" /> believe there is an improvement, and that will continue, but there will be some cases which will cause difficulty. Deputy Maguire dealt with the question of building.  He wants the people to do the work themselves in his constituency. The experience of the Land Commission is that in Leitrim anyway it is not possible to get that done.  It is one of the dearest counties for getting houses built.  Deputy Brennan raised a question about military service pensions.  That is no bar to a man getting land.  Of course, if he has a big pension I suppose he would not get the same chance as a man who had only a small pension.  As a matter of fact, I think Deputy Coburn mentioned the matter of national service.  There is preference given to people in all categories who have pre-Truce I.R.A. service.  There is that preference, but, of course, all the circumstances are taken into consideration, and I think general satisfaction has been given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the case of a road ganger getting land. I know the case he referred to.  There was a great number of applications, and the comment I heard about that division was that it was Deputy Brennan who divided the land.  That is what I was told anyway, in Roscommon. I think it was done as well as it could be done in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is not the same case.  That is what I was told by a prominent supporter of ours, that it was not the Land Commission who divided it but Deputy Brennan.  Of course I am well aware that it was not any such thing; it was done as fairly as it could be done in the circumstances. On the question of increased improvement costs, that has relation to land acquired a couple of years before and not to the current <Col N="592" /> year.  Improvement expenditure carries over for a couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of land is three times what it was in 1931, so naturally the improvement work would cost three times as much.  Deputy Dillon made a long speech about fixity of tenure, but I cannot deal with all those matters.  If any Deputy has raised points which I am passing over, I will have them looked into and an answer given.  In regard to the general activity of the Land Commission, I think if people were aware of all that is being dealt with, if they were aware that there is actually under consideration at the present time as much as 700,000 acres, they would realise that the Land Commission is doing an enormous amount of work.  It is doing much more work than it ever did before.  As a matter of fact, I myself would feel inclined to try to get most of that off their hands before they embark on any new land, but I suppose that would not be possible either.  In some of those cases in which there was reference made to the undue delay which has taken place, legal decisions have been given and have held up the proceedings. Nothing can be done until that position has been rectified.  I think I have dealt with practically all the big questions which have been raised.  If I were to give replies to every point which has been raised by the Deputies I would be here all night, and I do not think anybody wants to hear them.  It is all very well for every man to come in and make his case here, but surely I am not expected to reply in public to every point that is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to give a little synopsis of what has been done in the last six years.  From 1932 to 1938, 1,000,000 acres have been inspected; 420,000 acres have been acquired, and 400,000 acres have been divided amongst 30,000 allottees.  A sum of £2,500,000 has been spent on improvements, mainly on divided land, and at the present moment there are 700,000 acres in the Land Commission, in various stages in the machine, for <Col N="593" /> inquiry as to acquisition and division. I think that is a very good record and I think it justifies the increased expenditure that there has been on this Vote for some years past.  I conclude by saying that I hope that, in a very short time anyway, that question that has been a burning question, so far as the land is concerned, will be coming near solution.  I refer to the question of the rundale holdings in the West of Ireland, or wherever they exist, and the agricultural slums. For the purpose of dealing with that question, a large number of officials have had to be earmarked or left there, and they will have to be left there until that problem is solved in so far as we can solve it at all.  It cannot be solved entirely, because there is not enough land in the country for it, but so far as it is possible to provide these people with new holdings and to consolidate their holdings and house the people properly, we shall endeavour to do so&mdash;to build houses for them and make the land more accessible for them.  In order to do that, however, it will be necessary to have much more migration, and I hope that Deputies will help in that matter.  It is a national work, and I hope Deputies will not take the narrow county view that has been taken by some Deputies.  There is a great amount of migration in my own constituency, and I have to put up with it because it is good national work.  As far as County Meath is concerned, we are told: &ldquo;We object to them coming to this particular place; why do not you bring them down to the particular part of the county where it is most thinly populated, and there will be no objection.&rdquo; Well, when they were brought down to the most thinly populated place, we had to call in the police to protect the Land Commission officials in doing their work.  Now, that is a bad spirit, and I appeal to the Deputies to take a broader national view.  This is a very pressing problem, of which some Deputies seem to know nothing, and I suggest that they ought to go down for a day or two to some of these agricultural slums and they would then take a different view of this question. If we are not going to be <Col N="594" /> allowed to migrate people into places such as that where we had the trouble recently, then the whole question of solving the congested areas problem simply cannot be solved.</P>

      <P>We are not concentrating on County Meath.  We are migrating to Meath because it is one of the counties in Ireland that is most thinly populated, but there is migration going on to Clare and to Roscommon&mdash;plenty of it.  I met a whole parish one day marching in with their parish priest in connection with this question, and I had to tell them the same thing: that we could not recognise the question of county boundaries and that we would have to take Ireland as a whole and give first preference to the local people.  That always has been done, and done as I say, to an undue extent in County Meath.  The Deputies can judge of that for themselves.</P>

      <P>Sir, I put down a motion to refer back this Estimate for one reason&mdash;a policy reason&mdash;and that was for the purpose of asking the House to approve or disapprove of the action of the Minister for Lands in reducing the old rate of wages of forestry workers from 28/- a week to 24/- a week&mdash;in other words, reducing the old rate of wages by 15 per cent. If the Minister refuses to give an assurance that he will restore the rate to the old figure paid for the last eight years, pending the report of this advisory committee, I will have to invite the House to divide and say whether the House approves or disapproves of his action, and I only want one vote on that issue.</P>

It is a question for the Government as a <Col N="595" /> whole and therefore I could not give a decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £98,743 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1939, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Foraoiseachta (9 agus 10 Geo. 5, c. 58; agus Uimh. 34 de 1928), maraon le Deontas-i-gCabhair chun Tailimh do Thógaint.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £98,743 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (9 and 10 Geo. 5, c. 58; and No. 34 of 1928), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
      <P>The total net Vote proposed for the current year is £148,103, representing a reduction of £4,695 on the provision made last year.  The reduction is mainly under sub-head C. 2 in respect of planting operations and the maintenance of existing plantations.  This does not mean that any curtailment of forestry operations is contemplated.  On the contrary, it is proposed to plant 10,000 acres in the coming year as against approximately 8,500 acres during the season now closing.  The Estimate last year was also based on a 10,000 acre planting programme, but it was not possible to reach that figure.  The final figures of the area planted during the past season cannot yet be definitely stated and it may be possible to continue planting work in some districts for the remainder of the present month.</P>
      <P>It would have been possible to do more work in a number of areas but for local objections to the planting of the land acquired.  These objections were not heard of until the Department took possession, and in the main took the form of claims to the possession of grazing and turbary rights.  In some cases actual ownership has been disputed, while demands have also been made for the division of lands amongst adjoining tenants.  These difficulties have impeded forestry operations considerably, as lands have to lie derelict until the disputes are settled. They are occurring in the very districts where there is a strong demand for afforestation and where the land is suitable for planting, and it will be regrettable if some accommodation cannot be found in such areas between the reasonable needs of sheep owners for grazing facilities and the wider national interest which seems to call for the planting of the very poor type of land concerned.</P>
      <P>During the past year 13,360 acres were acquired, as against 9,550 acres in the previous year, making a total area of over 122,000 acres acquired since the inception of State forestry in 1904.  Of this total area, over 65,000 acres have been acquired since the 1st April, 1933, and during the same period the area planted annually has increased from 3,564 acres to 8,500 acres. The number of forest centres is now 84, as against 45 on 1st April, 1933, and forestry operations have been extended to 24 counties.  It is hoped to be able to establish centres in the two remaining counties in the near future.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration all the difficulties confronting forestry development, satisfactory progress is being made.  Additional men have to be trained, the State nurseries have to be enlarged, and the rate of acquisition of lands has to be accelerated.  Each of these requirements is receiving attention.</P>
      <P>Three new centres were established in the past year, namely, at Inchigeela and Ballyhooly, County Cork, and Carne Park, Athlone, County Westmeath, and negotiations were completed or undertaken in respect of nearly 30,000 acres of new land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> The problem of setting up forest centres in the Gaeltacht is especially difficult.  During the year it was possible only to establish one centre there &mdash;namely, at Inchigeela.  Considerable tracts of land have been offered in County Kerry and in County Galway and in County Mayo, but these lands have been almost entirely of a type that is unsuitable for forestry.  About 20,000 acres in County Kerry, 10,000 in County Galway, and 5,000 acres in County Mayo have been rejected as unsuitable owing to lack of shelter, to poor soil conditions, or to a combination of both reasons.  Intensive treatment and much expenditure might improve the soil conditions in selected spots in these areas, but there is no remedy against the strong sea winds which are a permanent obstacle to successful afforestation, even on the most restricted scale, in these areas. Nevertheless, investigations are still being pursued.</P>
    <P>The provision required in respect of the respective sub-heads is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £899 under Sub-head A&mdash;£14,014.  Salaries, Wages and Allowances for additional staff.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £500 necessary under Sub-head B&mdash;£2,500.  Travelling Expenses and Subsistence Allowances. The expansion of operations calls for additional travelling.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C 1&mdash;£5,000.  Acquisition of Land (Grant in Aid).  It is considered that the additional £5,000 asked for, together with the balance carried over at the end of the financial year (now found to be £47,000 approximately instead of £30,000 as in the footnote to the Estimates) will be sufficient to meet any commitments in respect of the acquisition of land for forestry purposes.  Approximately the sum of £43,000 was expended in the past financial year.  Negotiations have been completed for the acquisition of close on 6,000 acres, and it is hoped to acquire shortly from the Land Commission about 5,000 acres.  There are also negotiations pending in respect of about 19,000 acres.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction of £6,050 under Sub-head C 2&mdash;£130,554.  Cultural Operations, Maintenance, etc.&mdash;but as <Col N="600" /> I already explained this reduction does not indicate any curtailment of Forestry work as it is the intention to plant 10,000 acres next season as against 8,500 acres during the last planting season.  This reduction is mainly due to closer estimating of the year's requirements.</P>
    <P>There are now 85 foresters and foremen in the State forestry service as against 82 at 1st April, 1937.  Provision is made for further increases in these grades.</P>
    <P>The amount required for seeds, seedlings, and transplants has been reduced by £2,000, as, owing to the enlargement of the State nurseries, the bulk of the requirements for the planting programme can be provided from these nurseries.  The only purchases during the season now closing were from home nurseries, the quantity purchased being 1,995,000 transplants and seedlings.  It will be necessary to continue to purchase most of the seed required, though an increasing quantity is being collected in the State forests.  The quantity of seed ordered during the year now closing was 3,015 lbs., the source of supply being Germany (50 lbs.), Austria (800 lbs.), Denmark (900 lbs.), Scotland (625 lbs.), Japan (150 lbs.), United States (285 lbs.), and Canada (205 lbs.).</P>
    <P>Approximately 2,000 men are at present employed, this being the period of maximum employment.  This was for March.  The lowest number employed was in June last, viz., 1,013, but generally a greater number of men was taken on at all periods of last year than during the previous year.</P>
    <P>Provision is made under Sub-head C 3&mdash;£2,728&mdash;Timber Conversion&mdash;for the upkeep of the State sawmill at Dundrum, County Tipperary, where timber is sawn and partly manufactured for sale in the immediate locality. Material is prepared there for the requirements of the different forest centres and sawing is done for persons who bring their own timber to the mill. One portable mill has been purchased and is being worked experimentally at Avondale.  Upon the result will depend the purchase of additional mills of the same type.  The purpose of these portable mills is to extract timber at present difficult of access and not <Col N="601" /> marketable as standing timber owing to the difficulty of extraction.  At Emo, Portarlington, there is a small mill which is used for cutting firewood as well as for producing stakes.</P>
    <P>The amount required under sub-head D 1&mdash;£650&mdash;Grants and Advances for Afforestation Purposes&mdash;is increased by £50.  This sub-head is to provide assistance to private persons and public bodies undertaking planting operations.  Under the scheme grants are made at the rate of £4 per acre, payable in two instalments, £3 per acre as soon as the plantation has been laid down and ascertained to be properly done and properly fenced, and the remaining £1 per acre in five years' time, provided the plantation has been properly maintained in the meantime. The minimum area necessary to qualify for a grant is 5 acres, but two or more persons can join to make up the prescribed area.  As the scheme has now been in existence for more than five years, the second instalments are falling due for payment, and it is necessary to increase the provision slightly.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction of £50 under Sub-head D 2&mdash;£350&mdash;Arbor Day&mdash;as the number of schools participating in Arbor Day is falling off.  Some 1,500 schools took part in the first Arbor Day, 900 in the second, and 640 in the third Arbor Day.  For Arbor Day, 1938, about 600 schools have participated. The reason for the decreasing number would appear to be that many schools have either no available ground or have already utilised any ground attached to the school.</P>
    <P>The provision under Sub-head E 1&mdash; £2,563&mdash;Forestry Education&mdash;is largely for the upkeep of the School of Forestry at Avondale.  There is an increase of £1,446, which is almost entirely due to the provision proposed to be made for a new water supply for the school and for the installation of electric light and power.  As in previous years, provision has been made for a Scholarship in Forestry at the National University, and for the maintenance of the scholarship awarded last year.  The question, however, as to whether this is the best method of fostering forestry education in present circumstances is under consideration.</P>

      <P>Thirty-three.  Provision is made under sub-head E (2) for the preparation and staging of a forestry exhibit at shows.  The Department usually have such an exhibit at the Spring Show of the Royal Dublin Society.  We thought we were going to lose it this year, as the Department of Agriculture was trying to take all the space, but we managed to get space again.</P>
      <P>The sum of £10 provided under sub-head F (1)&mdash;Agency and Advisory Services and Special Services&mdash;is merely a token Vote.  With regard to sub-head F (2)&mdash;Membership Contribution to the Imperial Forestry Bureau, £94&mdash;in February last, the Dáil agreed to the payment of a contribution by this country towards the cost of the maintenance of a Commonwealth Forestry Bureau on the same lines as the existing Agricultural Bureaux of which this country has been a contributory member for some eight years past.  It is desirable that our Forestry service should be kept in touch with developments in other countries.  The Forestry Bureau will fill this want.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head H&mdash;£10,650&mdash;Appropriations in Aid&mdash;is comprised income from all sources, such as grazing, shooting and cottage rents, but mainly from timber sales.  It is anticipated that there will be a considerably increased revenue this year from the sale of timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year about 2,800 felling notices were lodged and, in many cases, it was considered necessary to issue prohibition orders so that the trees might be inspected and a licence issued for such trees as should be permitted to be felled.  It is regretted that illegal felling has not yet ceased, and during the year it was necessary to prosecute a number of offenders.  The Act is now eight years in operation and its provisions ought to be well known. There is no excuse for failure to comply with the requirements of the Act, particularly as all that is required is to call at the nearest Gárda station, obtain the prescribed form, and lodge it when completed.  Otherwise the Act <Col N="603" /> is working very smoothly and is securing the replanting of many areas that would otherwise be left derelict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this reduction had taken place on any other Estimate, I should have congratulated the Minister responsible, but I do not think the Minister for Lands deserves to be congratulated on the reduction in this Estimate.  I think every member of the Dáil is anxious that there should be a forward policy in respect of the re-afforestation of this country.  The Minister's statement, so far as it went, was quite all right, but my complaint is rather about what the Minister left unsaid.  I have heard the Minister and his predecessor make statements on this Forestry Estimate for the last four, five or six years, and each statement is merely a repetition of the last one.  He deals in a general way with the sub-heads and indicates the area of land acquired and the work done for the particular year with which the Estimate deals, but no Minister for the past six years has attempted to give us any estimate of the area of land available for re-afforestation, and I think the time has arrived when the Dáil should be made aware of the actual acreage of land available for that purpose.</P>
      <P>For the last few years, at all events, there is a public opinion, and a strong public opinion, growing on this subject of re-afforestation.  It is very generally realised that we are the most backward country in the world in that respect.  Experts say that the normal forest cover should be about 18 per cent., whereas the area of forest cover in this country amounts to something less than one quarter of 1 per cent. I think these figures give a very good indication of how backward we are in respect of re-afforestation and of how necessary it is that this question should be studied seriously, and that the Minister and the Department should make an effort, firstly, to find out what area of suitable land is available and, secondly, to set about devising a policy with the object of bringing our position somewhere near the standard set in other more progressive countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, these Estimates pretty well <Col N="604" /> follow on the same line year after year. The Minister explains the different sub-heads and the reasons for the amounts stated in them, but the Minister, I imagine, is so engrossed in the work of the Land Commission that he has had no time so far to devote to the subject of forestry.  I think it is a debt he owes the country now that he would have this question studied seriously and, above all things, that he would have an estimate made as soon as possible of the area of suitable lands available for re-afforestation purposes.  He has, I know, an enormous amount of information available in his Department, and he should be in a position, in a relatively short space of time, to form an estimate, and something more than an approximate estimate, of the actual area of land available and suitable for this purpose.  I know that the figure of 300,000 acres was mentioned many years ago, but I do not believe that figure is accurate and I think that actually there is a larger acreage of land available.  I do not pretend to have a very deep knowledge of this subject, but I certainly do think, in view of the importance attached to it in other more progressive countries, that it is time for us here to wake up and to see that there is a progressive and comprehensive policy adopted with regard to this subject.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I want to draw to the Minister's attention, and that is that where land is divided by Land Commission inspectors there are very often belts of trees&mdash;shelter belts, if you like&mdash;and no steps are taken by the inspectors to ensure that these shelter belts or forest belts are preserved. In fact, in the majority of cases where such belts do exist on holdings distributed by Land Commission inspectors, they disappear after a few years. The tenant is allowed to cut down the timber, and, in the majority of cases, he does so.  I suggest to the Minister that in view of the prime importance of this subject, he should take steps for the future to ensure that where there is a shelter belt or forest belt of suitable timber on any holding divided or distributed by any of his inspectors, that forest belt or shelter belt will be preserved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> There is another matter of only local importance.  For the last two or three years, the Minister's officials have been engaged in acquiring a property in County Sligo&mdash;Hazelwood&mdash;a short distance outside the town of Sligo.  The Land Commission, I understand, has actually made an offer for the property, but that offer was made, I think, almost three years ago.  I understand that it is the intention of the Land Commission, when that property is acquired, to utilise portion of it for afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>Three years is a long time to spend in acquiring one property, especially when it is proposed to utilise the greater portion for afforestation purposes. I suggest that it is time to speed up the negotiations in connection with this particular property, and make an effort to do something in connection with re-afforestation in the constituency I represent.  So far as I am aware, nothing has been done, so far, in that direction, and I think that it is time a beginning was made.  The Minister stated that, last year, he saved £4,000 on the most important sub-head of this Estimate&mdash;the sub-head relating to cultural operations and maintenance&mdash; and the explanation he gave was that this was effected by better organisation and better appreciation of costs.  He stated, in addition, that he proposed to plant 10,000 acres during the coming year.  I hope my rendering of the Minister's statement is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, instead of effecting that saving, the Minister could have spent the money on planting an additional acreage.  Why did he not arrange to plant that additional acreage?  Is it that he has not enough trained foresters for the purpose of superintending the work, or is it that, at the time this Estimate was prepared, he had not a sufficient number of suitable acres for the purpose of enlarging the area to be planted?  If the number of foresters is not sufficient, surely the Minister should provide additional educational facilities so that additional foresters might be trained.  I do not relish the idea of the Minister going outside the country for officials to carry out forestry work.  I <Col N="606" /> think he should do as the U.S.A. did when they were working on a big scheme of forestry.  They trained their own men.  Men trained in such a way would understand the local conditions better than foresters from other countries.  In any event, it should be possible to get a sufficient number of foresters trained for the carrying out of afforestation on a big scale in the space of four or five years at the outside.  I know that, for 14 years, men have been undergoing training for the purpose of carrying out schemes of re-afforestation, and I am rather surprised to learn that, at present, the Minister has only 85 trained foresters.  If there is any impression at all to be made on the problem of re-afforestation, it will be necessary for the Minister considerably to increase the number of trained foresters. Instead of having 85 foresters trained in the course of 12 or 14 years, there should be some hundreds of foresters available and they should be operating in every county in Éire.  If we are only going to progress at the present snail's pace, it will take more than 100 years to get any real improvement effected so far as afforestation is concerned in the worst afforested country in Europe. The Minister should give the Dáil and the country some assurance that he is prepared to tackle this problem of re-afforestation seriously, that he will have the various aspects of the problem seriously examined by his officials, with the assistance of experts from outside, and that, when he approaches the Dáil next year with his Estimate, he will be able to announce that a bold, broad, comprehensive policy has been entered upon and that efficient measures are being taken for the purpose of bringing this country into line with other European countries so far as afforestation is concerned.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why we should have to import any plants from other countries.  Cork County Council have a large nursery and on at least two occasions, at my request, they offered trees to the Department of Forestry.  On each occasion, they received a very nice acknowledgement but nothing more.  I suggest that the Minister could very well send one of his <Col N="607" /> officials down to examine these trees and see if they are suitable.  This nursery is being maintained at the expense of the ratepayers and, when they went so far, I think the Minister should go a little farther and assist them when purchasing trees.  He should aid the ratepayers in carrying on this laudable work.  The Minister seems to have forgotten that there is such a place as Cork on the map.</P>

      <P>There are hundreds of acres there suitable for afforestation. When the land was being purchased under the 1903 Act, hundreds of acres were cleared of timber and these lands have been repeatedly offered to the Land Commission.  Whether it is due to the shortage of inspectors or not, no steps have been taken to acquire this land.  Outside Midleton, in Glenville, and in Iniscariff some hundreds of acres are available and no steps have been taken to inspect them.  I have already referred to the position in regard to the Rostellan estate.  We are told that the Land Commission are making arrangements with the Department of Forestry to have the estate taken over jointly&mdash;one portion to be used for the purpose of afforestation and the other to be divided.  It is rather strange that that position has existed for three or four years and that we cannot get any decision notwithstanding that both Departments are in charge of one Minister.  I should like to know from the Minister when this estate is to be taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out on the Land Commission Vote that this estate is an eyesore and that the burden on the ratepayers is close on £1,700, due in rates.  That position is being carried on year after year and one would think that the Land Commission and the Forestry Department would make a bold bid to remove that eyesore.  That is my principal complaint&mdash;that these areas are left unattended.  Apparently, Cork has got the palsy so far as the Department is concerned.  The Department seems to be afraid that it would be contaminated by going in there.  I suggest that the <Col N="608" /> Minister should have these lands inspected.  There are also large areas in Clonmult suitable for afforestation. They were offered to the Department of Forestry, but no steps have been taken to plant them.  These are areas in which fine timber was grown successfully within recent years and cut down by the landlords before the estates were sold.  The lands are now an eyesore, while they were once beauty-spots.  I hope I shall not have to be bringing this matter up again next year.  I think it is time the Minister paid attention to it and got it cleared off once and for all.</P>

      <P>Níl mise sásta faoi'n méid atá an tAire agus a chuid oifigeacha a dhéanamh faoi scéim na gcoillte.  Dubhairt sé, ag oscailt dó, gur thóruigh a chuid oifigeacha go leor talamh i gContae na Gaillimhe, i gContae Mhuigheo is i gContae Chiarraighe le haghaidh coillte is nach bhfuaireadar áit ar bith feileamhnach le n-a gcur.  Déarfainn-se nach fíor é sin, agus má tá chó fíor leis an rud adubhairt an tAire faoi chur coillte ag Ard-Fheis Fianna Fáil an 14adh lá de Dheireadh Foghmhair seo caithte fágaim-se ag an Teach agus ar an tír bhreithiúnas a thabhairt air.

Seod é adubhairt sé ag freagairt cuid dá dhream ag an Ard-Fheis o Chiarraighe, Contae Mhuigheo agus Contae na Gaillimhe &mdash;&ldquo;Níl mo chuid oifigeacha sásta go bhfásfadh coillte áit ar bith sa nGaeltacht; tá siad tréis é thóraidheacht. Tríáladh scéim ar an Cnoc Buidhe; chosain an scéim seo £30,000, agus níl oiread is dhéanfadh maide laimhe ann faoi lathair.&rdquo;  Ní sheod í an fhírinne. Níor cailleadh tríú cuid £30,000 leis. Tá béal na fírinne annseo i mo láimh agam an chéad chóip go dtí an naoú cóip den Tuarasgabháil a chuir an C.D.B. amach.  Léighfe mé as seo. I mbliain 1892 tóigeadh an Cnoc Buidhe le haghaidh coillte a chur ón sagairt pobuil a bhí i bpobal Chárna an t-am sin&mdash;an tAthair Tomás O Flannghaile, beannacht Dé le n-a anam.  Tosuigheadh ag cur na gcoillte.  Deir an naoú cóip den Tuarasgabháil gur caitheadh £8,750.  Is mór an deifir é seo agus an rud adubhairt an tAire, ach má <Col N="609" /> bhí an tAire ag fid-mhaghadh faoi n-a dhream féin ag an Ard-Fheis níor cheart go ngabhfadh sé amach ag an tír gur caitheadh an oiread seo ar an nGaeltacht nuair nár caitheadh.  Anois deirtear gur olc an sompla a théigheas i bhfad.  Chuaidh an tAire tamall maith siar nuair a chaith sé dhul siar go dtí 46 bliana o shoin&mdash;aimsir Bhalfour&mdash;agus leis sin cén dochar dá mba í an fhirinne í.

Ach creidim nach bhfeilfeadh sé sin leabhar an Aire ná a chuid oifigeacha.  Ar an Mám agus i dTír na Cille le mo linn féin bhí dhá choill iongantacha ann.

Níor cuireadh coill amháin ina n-áit.  Tuige nach dtógann an tAire an áit seo agus coillte a chur ann?  Tá a fhios agam ceathrar na cúigear daoine sa nGleann céanna&mdash;an Mám&mdash; a thiubhradh leath-chéad acra don Aire ar rí-bheagán no béidir in aisce.

      <P>I wish at the outset to say that I have no practical personal knowledge of forestry.  I wish also at the outset to say that I am not now criticising the Department of Lands or the forestry section of it, but that does not mean that I agree with the policy of those Departments.  I do not&mdash;most emphatically I do not&mdash;and though I say I will not criticise them it will be rather difficult for me to express the views I hold without in some way reflecting on them.  The great question that Deputy Roddy raised is the question of area.  The Minister for Lands states that there is only a limited amount of land in the country and we cannot make more.  But it seems to me there is a very great division of opinion as to what is actually available. The one thing that is definitely evident is that the Department or the Minister do not seem to be so well informed. As Deputy Roddy requested, the Minister <Col N="612" /> and the Department should endeavour to get a commission or a committee to examine the whole country rapidly and find out what land is actually available and is suitable for forestry.  They should ascertain definitely that the land is not suitable for agricultural or other more paying work than forestry.  That has not been done so far, and it should be done at once.  Any information I have on the subject of forestry I derived from this book, &ldquo;Forestry in Ireland,&rdquo; by Mr. John Mackay.  If I may be permitted to say so, it is a mine of information, and every Deputy who wishes to know something on the subject of forestry should buy the book.  It is well worth reading.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is not quite relevant to this Estimate, but I must say that I derived most of the information that I possess on the subject of forestry from this book and from other literature.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I have gone into this question already with both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Lands, and we differ in our opinions very strongly.  The Estimate before us involves a sum of £132,000, and I think <Col N="613" /> that represents £4,600 less than last year.  It does seem to me that if we are so backward in our forestry schemes as Deputy Roddy has declared, we should not have a decrease in the Estimate, but rather an increase; that is, if there is any intention of going on with this forestry proposition.  I would not speak about it at all if I did not think it was a subject of immense importance, and one likely to be of tremendous benefit to the country.  If it were not, I would not bother my head at all about it.  The Minister suggests that he hopes to plant 10,000 acres.  He has had that scheme in his mind for years, and the Cumann na nGaedheal Government also had certain proposals in their mind. Though the Minister has improved very considerably on what the last Administration did, he certainly has not done anything very appreciable in the matter of afforestation.  Instead of 10,000 acres he is going to deal with only 8,000 in the near future, and I imagine the reason is that there are not sufficient plants available.  The Department have acquired a lot of land, but the strange thing is that on the land that they have already in hands they have not done much planting.  Either they do not want to do it, or else they have not the plants.  If they have not the means of growing the plants, they ought to increase the Estimate and let us have a bigger grant for forestry this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a big doubt whether sufficient land is available.  I believe that there is sufficient land, but the Department do not think so.  Deputy Roddy called attention to the fact that they have only 2,085 men employed in the Forestry Department.  We are informed that if forestry is carried out on a proper scale it will give a vast amount of employment.  Indeed, the figure is put at 25,000 men, who would be engaged in the forests alone, and there would be more employed in the subsidiary industries arising out of a big forestry scheme.  If the Department went on seriously with re-afforestation I think they would do much to help the country generally.  Some few weeks ago I happened to be speaking to Deputy Dillon in the Restaurant.  He is not here at the moment, but what I have to say is not of very great importance, and <Col N="614" /> scarcely needs his attendance.  One of the things that got me interested in forestry was the progress made in the Landes district in the south-west of France, on the Bay of Biscay.  The development of the Landes district has been proceeding since 1570.  Considerable areas were taken from the sea, and the problem is something similar to what we have on our west coast, and on other portions of our coastline.  In France they started in 1570 and they finished in 1860, or thereabouts. The problem before us is only child's play compared with what they had to do.  Probably the Minister knows all about it, or has read all about it.  Yet I do not think that he or his officials can have grasped the problem properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said he flew over the Landes district in France and that the development that had taken place there had been a most wonderful sight.  Over 1,500,000 acres had been successfully planted.  Immediately after he had said that, he said that to talk of forestry in Ireland was all bunk, and proceeded to debunk everything in the way of forestry in this country.  At all events, so far as forestry went here, he had not a word of encouragement.  That sort of mentality on the part of so many people in this country forces me to the conclusion that in the matter of forestry we are all suffering here from some form of inferiority complex. Everything done or suggested to be done here reveals how deeply that virus has entered into our system.  Everybody here, including the Department of Lands and Forestry and even the Executive Council, so far as forestry is concerned, seems to be afflicted with that disease of inferiority complex.  It is sometimes a source of wonder to me that some super-pessimist does not come along and tell us we cannot grow babies in this country.  I mention this because that is the attitude of mind that keeps us as we are.  We are not doing the work that is before us to do and we are not making the progress we should make in some things.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that inferiority complex we have got in some quarters too much of the superiority complex. This obtains very largely in public <Col N="615" /> Departments and amongst the officials connected with this Department of Forestry.  It seems to be accepted that nobody except the Minister and the Departmental officials knows anything about anything.  I have been trying to understand what it is that brings about that attitude of mind in these public officials and heads of Departments. These supermen seem to take it for granted that everybody else in the country is ignorant of everything.  I think the only explanation of that is that these people are themselves suffering from the arrogance of ignorance.</P>
    <P>I did not quite understand what Deputy Mongan said, because he spoke in Irish.  I inquired and I found that he dealt with the question of Cnocbuidhe. I also inquired about the Cnocbuidhe experiment.  I now see that Deputy Mongan has dealt with that experiment in such a way that from this onwards we will hear no more about Cnocbuidhe, which has been used as a bogey-man for very many years by the Forestry people.  Indeed, Cnocbuidhe seems to have knocked the wits out of everybody connected with forestry work in this country.</P>
    <P>The result is that it is being used as an argument to do nothing.  There is very strong feeling in the country that sufficient attention is not given to forestry and to its development.  I hope that sufficient pressure will be brought to bear on the Minister and his officials to force them to take action in the future on a very much more comprehensive scale than in the past as regards forestry in this country.  So far as forestry goes, perhaps it is as well that we should not praise him and pass encomiums on him, because of his good intentions.  Everybody has heard of the &ldquo;road to Hell.&rdquo;  We should all try here to get the feeling that is so general in the country with regard to forestry expressed here and in the Department in terms of action.  In that way more will be done than has been done.  It is up to us all to bring pressure so as to bring about that result.  In some of those books that I was not permitted to read&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, the Chair would not let me read them here.  I gathered, however, that there was an attempt made by the British Government to deal with afforestation.  In 1884 the then Government set up a Forestry Committee of Inquiry.  It was said by a Danish conservator who was examined that there were 4,000,000 acres available for forestry.  A German expert put the figure at 3,900,000 acres.  At all events, I think there were at least available 2,000,000 acres.  The figures have never been verified by anyone, so far as I know.  It is something that should be verified, because the sooner the truth in these matters is learned the better.  Deputy Roddy spoke about the small fraction we have under forestry.  He said it was only a fraction of 1 per cent.  We have just concluded a debate on the Vote for Lands.  I listened to portion of that debate. The thing that struck me was that there seemed to be a feeling that men should get land merely because they were landless.  That would be no reason for giving them land.  They should also have the capacity and knowledge to farm the land successfully.  Since 1919 when Denmark got back part of Schleswig-Holstein from Germany the area of the country has been increased to about 16,000 square miles.  That is about half the area of Ireland, yet they have a population of close on 3,600,000. I am not sure of the exact figure.  In 1805 they passed a law for promoting afforestation.  I have been all around Denmark, and I am aware that their land cannot at all compete with our land for afforestation or for anything else.  Why is it that they are able to produce so much more from their land than we have been able to produce?</P>

      <P>At all events I hope that now at last we will be able to convince the Minister of the benefits to be derived from going in more for forestry than he has been doing.  I hope that on the Vote next year we will be able to congratulate him on having done some really good useful work for the country in the matter of <Col N="617" /> forestry.  In 1884 there was a forestry committee set up by Great Britain, and I think in 1908 another commission was set up.  The recommendation of the latter commission was that everything should be done to carry out forestry work, and that Ireland was not acting as a prudent nation if she did not do so.  There is an interesting account of that in the book I was not permitted to read to the House.  In that book there is a statement made that sheep land in a mountainy district yielded about 3/5 per acre per annum profit on sheep rearing.  The profit made according to that book on the growing of second-rate timber would bring in a profit of £21 odd per acre per annum for the whole period it took the wood to mature.  The figure was put in some cases as high as £29 per acre, but I am giving the lower figure.  That was from the report of the British Empire Commission that sat in 1920.  That seemed to me to be so abnormally high compared with the profits made out of sheep rearing that I made some inquiries. I was not successful in getting the thing verified except in the Ballingeary district in West Cork.  In that case I was able to get the actual figure, and that worsened the case as regards the profits on sheep raising.  In that area I found that a man carried 300 sheep on 500 acres of mountainy land. He made a profit of £70 a year on the 500 acres.  That was much less than the ? an acre calculated by the British Empire Commission.  It would seem to me that the Department of Forestry are really only playing with this question of afforestation.  Up to the present they have only dealt with 200,000 acres.  At that rate of progress it would take more than 200 years before anything at all commensurate with what is being done in other European countries would be accomplished here.  I feel rather strongly on this forestry business, and I am thankful for your forbearance in allowing me to go at this length into the question.</P>

    <P>I would just say that in any general scheme that is planned&mdash;and of course it will have to be properly planned&mdash; careful consideration should be given to every aspect of the matter so that no mistakes will be made.  A forestry scheme if properly carried out&mdash;and I <Col N="618" /> hope the Minister and the Government will go into it very carefully&mdash;will give a vast amount of employment.  It will stop emigration and will be of great help to farmers who find it rather difficult in winter time to make ends meet. If I might be permitted to make a brief reference to the book again&mdash;I am not going to read it&mdash;it gives a tremendous amount of information.  Ministers probably have all got a copy of it, but I do not think they can have read it. I would urge on them now to avail of the wisdom in that book, to get more wisdom into their heads and to carry on this great work.  If they do so, they will be doing some good for themselves and for the country, which is more important.</P>

      <P>I think that neither the Minister nor any person in this House would submit that this question of forestry has been tackled seriously by anybody, either by the present Government or by its predecessors.  I have not had the advantage of reading the book which Deputy Dowdall has not been permitted to read in this House, but I have had the advantage of reading the Book of Estimates and on the face of it I do not think there is anything I could say, or anything any Deputy could say, so condemnatory of the activities of the Forestry Department as that Book of Estimates itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, I find a footnote here to sub-head C 1&mdash;Acquisition of Land (Grant-in-Aid) for which £5,000 is provided. The footnote states: &ldquo;The expenditure out of this Grant-in-Aid will be accounted for in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, but any unexpended balance of the sums issued will not be liable to surrender at the end of the financial year.  The balance as at 31st March, 1938, is estimated to be £30,000.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, the Minister said it was much more than that in his opening remarks. Here is a position where the House has been providing £5,000 per annum, apparently for the purposes of grants, and no part of that, if unexpended, is to be surrendered, with the result that owing to the inactivity of the Forestry Department, we have £40,000 left unexpended. I do not think anybody could say anything so condemnatory of <Col N="619" /> the activities or lack of activities of the Department as the facts contained in that statement.</P>
    <P>There is no use in pretending that we are doing anything for forestry; we are not.  Let us be candid.  If the thing is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.  If it is not worth doing, we should not attempt to do anything at all.  On the face of it, we are not doing anything.  The Minister tells us, and certainly it is not a very reassuring thing, that in cultural operations and maintenance we are going to spend £6,000 less this year than last year.  He said that that reduction is being made because they have found more economic ways of dealing with these operations than in the past.  If we are going to attack this problem at all there should be some plan, some policy or scheme for dealing with it.  There is not, and there has not been in this country ever.  It is better for us to face up to that.  The limited amount of forestry which we have in this country at present and the fact that at the same time we have an unexpended balance of over £40,000 on that item alone, carried over at the rate of £5,000 a year because we cannot get room to spend it, are surely indicative of no scheme and no policy.  The Minister cannot seek to justify that position by saying: &ldquo;Well, I am doing better than we did last year, 10 years or 15 years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think there should be some attempt made to get after the problem properly. As Deputy Dowdall rightly pointed out, the advantages that would accrue to this country from a proper scheme of afforestation are immeasurable.  Any person who has had an opportunity of visiting the southern end of France, where the lands were planted in the Napoleonic years, can testify to the immense present-day value of the schemes then started.  I believe they add immensely, not alone to the wealth of the nation, but to the wealth of the Exchequer in that country.  In addition to that we have immense potentialities as far as employment is concerned.  Here is an opening and an outlet for the high percentage of unemployment <Col N="620" /> which we find prevailing amongst agriculturists and in rural districts generally.  The Minister and his Department under the system which they are operating at the moment will never make any impression upon that problem unless there is some kind of board set up&mdash;call it a Forestry Commission or anything you like.  There should be some set of persons selected who would interest themselves in this matter, who would educate themselves in it and who would try to impress on individuals and on local authorities the importance of the matter.  It is a very important matter.  The growing of timber can be made a very great source of revenue to the State, and would provide schemes that would absorb our unemployed.</P>
    <P>We have a scheme whereby certain grants and advances are made to individuals for afforestation purposes. Again, on the face of it, the figures given here are self-condemnatory of that scheme.  According to the Minister, the Department is prepared to give £4 per acre to persons who will plant their land, provided they plant at least five acres, or if two or three persons join together and plant five acres, they will get that allowance of £4 per acre.  Small and all as that allowance of £4 per acre is, they get it in two instalments, £3 first and £1 afterwards.  We shall, I think, get nowhere with a scheme of that kind. That is evident from the figures given here because, over the Twenty-Six Counties, this scheme has absorbed only £650.  If a sum of £60,000 were being spent on this scheme, we might think that something was being done.  Personally, I do not think that it is any inducement to a landholder at all to tell him: &ldquo;If you have four or five acres which you do not think is very useful to your farm, and that you think should be devoted to forestry, for the reason possibly that it is in a very picturesque situation or anything of that kind, in order to help you fence and plant it, we will give you £4 per acre.&rdquo;  I move to report progress.</P>
