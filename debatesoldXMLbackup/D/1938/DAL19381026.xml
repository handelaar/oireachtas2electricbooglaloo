      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the allegation that Seanad electors were approached prior to the last Seanad Election by candidates proposing to buy their votes, and of the widespread belief that a number of Seanad voters did, in fact, sell their votes for a valuable consideration, he will indicate whether it is his intention to introduce proposals at an early date for amending the law relating to the election of Senators.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to introduce legislation as suggested by the Deputy.  I know that allegations of the kind referred to by the Deputy have been made, but I am not aware whether or not any evidence can be produced in support of them.  If evidence is available there is ample provision for dealing with the matter in the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  I would refer the Deputy in particular to Section 44 of the Act where provision is made for inquiry by the Attorney-General, on information being furnished to him, into alleged corrupt or illegal practices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="Seán MacEoin Seán MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>Seán MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware of the decision of the Military Service Pensions Board that to qualify for a military service pension the applicant must have been engaged in at least one major operation; also that the phrase &ldquo;being engaged in a major operation pre-truce&rdquo; is interpreted in a very narrow form; that in a large number of cases applicants for pensions did not state their case clearly in their forms of application and that this is likely to result in a large number of applicants being disqualified without their claims being heard verbally by the board; and if it is proposed to define &ldquo;active service&rdquo; for the benefit of applicants and for the guidance of the board and referee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Acting Minister for Defence (The Taoiseach) Acting Minister for Defence (The Taoiseach)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Defence (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that no such decision as that referred to by the Deputy has been taken by the referee and advisory committee.  The fact is that an applicant's service as a whole is taken into account.  It is true that where evidence is given that an applicant was engaged in a major operation the question of his having rendered active service is more easily determined and his case, consequently, more readily disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other parts of the Deputy's question: In any case <Col N="5" /> where an applicant for a pension has not stated his case clearly in his form of application he is given every opportunity of supplying further particulars of service before the referee reports on his case.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is not proposed to define the term &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  That must be left to the referee and advisory committee.  The Act of 1934 is, in this respect, similar to the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Air-raid Precautions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is in a position to indicate what steps have been taken by his Department to protect the civilian population in the event of cities, large towns, power stations, etc., being attacked from the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of the defence of the civil population in the event of air attack has engaged the attention of the Government for a considerable time.  No scheme of precautions can give complete protection, but with the full co-operation both of the local authorities and the civilian population, it is hoped that a scheme reasonably effective may be evolved.  Legislation making it compulsory on local authorities in certain areas to carry out schemes which will cover the action required to be taken by them in the event of the areas being submitted to air attack is being prepared.</P>
      <P>In advance of such legislation, the Government considered it desirable to take steps at once with regard to Dublin, which would offer the most likely target.  Plans were, accordingly, drawn up indicating the functions which would be assigned to the State and to the local authority, respectively, and the division of cost. These plans have been discussed with the City Manager and Town Clerk of Dublin and officials of the Dublin Corporation have been engaged in the preliminary steps to bring the necessary organisation into existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuance of the obligations to be assumed by the State under the plans referred to, the Department of <Col N="6" /> Defence has taken the following action.  They have:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Made arrangements for the purchase of respirators for free issue to the public, decontaminating material for use in the event of gas attack, and protective clothing and equipment for air raid precautions personnel.  A considerable quantity of respirators, etc., is already available.</P>
    <P>(2)  Prepared handbooks for the instruction of the civilian population, which it is intended to issue to the public at an early date.</P>
    <P>(3)  Established a school for the training of air raid precautions personnel.</P>
    <P>Apart from the measures to which I have referred, the Department of Defence has also had under close examination the military measures necessary for the defence of Dublin and other centres against air attack.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether he will place a copy of the plan, which he has indicated was discussed between the Department and the Corporation, in the Library, so that Deputies might have access to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to state that that can be done.  There might be some reason why it could not.  Perhaps the discussions have not reached a sufficiently advanced stage or something of that kind.  I do not think that they are in a form final enough for that purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be premature to give figures with regard to the cost of maintenance at this stage.  As the Deputy is aware, the transfer of the harbour defences has only recently taken place, and any figures based on the short experience we have had would be misleading.

      <P>A policy of insurance for the period 1st April, 1938, to 31st March, 1939, was made during the present year with the Irish Employers' Mutual Insurance Association, Limited, whereby the Commissioners of Public Works were indemnified against all claims and expenses, etc., arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, the Employers' Liability Act, 1880, the Fatal Accidents Act, 1846, and at Common Law, from workmen directly employed by them on arterial drainage works, maintenance of marine works, fishery piers, and landing slips, airport construction works, and employment schemes.  A sum of £7,393 11s. 10d. was paid to the association on the 4th April, 1938, as an advance of premium for the insurance, the premium being adjustable at the end of the year in relation to the actual wages paid.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the company is now in liquidation as a result of which the policy of insurance ceased to have legal effect from the 10th June, 1938, the date of the commencement of the winding-up proceedings; and on the application of the official liquidator of the company appointed under order of the High Court made on the 4th July, 1938, the commissioners have paid to him a sum of £5 which, under a clause of the memorandum of association of the company, they were liable as a member thereof to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up.  If it transpires in the winding-up that the assets of the company are more than sufficient to discharge the liabilities the commissioners have the right to receive a prorate payment of portion of this sum from the official liquidator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new policy of insurance has been effected by the commissioners with another company.  The commissioners have presented to the official liquidator a claim for sums due to them by the Irish Employers' Mutual Insurance <Col N="29" /> Association, Limited, and for such losses as they have suffered or may suffer in consequence of the winding-up of the company.  The commissioners will defray in full all legal claims against them in respect of workers who have been covered in the policy of insurance with the company, and they have included provision for recoupment therefor, so far as can be estimated, in the claim which has been submitted to the official liquidator of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if in view of the extra expense to which farmers are made liable by the operation of the Agricultural Wages Order, which enforces the payment of increased wages and extra pay for Sunday work, and also considering the present excessive cost of feeding stuffs, he will consider the advisability of providing such a bounty for stallfed cattle as will encourage farmers to finish their cattle instead of selling them off as stores.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion that the scheme for the payment of a bounty on exports of fat cattle which was in operation earlier this year was not wholly justified by the results, and I have been unable, so far, to devise a more satisfactory scheme.  I have, consequently, come to no decision as to the renewal of a bounty on fat cattle this season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the farmers who go in largely for tillage farming always buy their cattle in the autumn.  The fact that the British Minister is giving a bounty on home-fed cattle increases the price of cattle bought for stallfeeding by approximately £2 a head. I am sure the Minister will see his way to help the tillage farmer to continue the old custom of stallfeeding in the County Wexford.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the circumstances of the case referred to in the question. Secondary teachers' pensions are awarded in accordance with the statutory provisions of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme, which was framed in 1929.  Under the provisions of the scheme only completed years of service are reckonable for pension, and there is no power to refund the contribution referred to in the question.

    <Title>Town and Regional Planning (Amendment) Bill, 1938&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is introduced to make certain amendments to the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934.  Its main purpose is to import into the general framework of the law governing the making of planning schemes some of the flexibility which experience has shown is desirable for the planning of a district. By adopting the machinery of the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, a planning authority may make a scheme that will secure the orderly and progressive development of their area. A planning scheme should make provision for the control of development that is not only imminent but also likely to occur in future years.  For this purpose it was necessary to confer upon planning authorities wide powers over private property in their areas, subject to necessary safeguards. The safeguards imposed by the Act of 1934 and the regulations made thereunder are contained in an elaborate procedure to be followed by the planning authority in the making of a planning scheme including the issue of public notices at various stages of the preparation of the scheme, consultations with owners of property and other persons; the approval of the Minister to the planning scheme when made, and its subsequent submission to each House of the Oireachtas.  There <Col N="46" /> is also appeal to the High Court on matters of law.  All these safeguards are being preserved in this Bill.</P>
      <P>A planning scheme when approved and brought into operation can only be revoked in whole or in part, or amended, or varied, by means of a subsequent planning scheme.  The provisions of a scheme are just as rigid and binding as the provisions of an Act of the Oireachtas.  It follows, therefore, that before a scheme is made the future development of the area to be planned must be carefully surveyed from the social, physical and economic aspects.  It is doubtful if every form of development to be permitted after a scheme has come into operation can be envisaged during the preparation of the scheme so as to enable appropriate provision to be made therefor. My Department has been engaged for a considerable time in working out the details of model provisions for insertion in planning schemes for the guidance of planning authorities, and upon full consideration of the powers necessary to secure effective control of development, I came to the conclusion that it was desirable to adopt a more flexible procedure whereby, without departing from the principle that a planning scheme should determine the main lines for the orderly and progressive development of an area, it would be possible to entrust to the responsible authority the control of the internal development of a particular site or sites within the planned area.  In this way the work of planning authorities would be facilitated considerably and the preparation of schemes expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The altered procedure is concerned mainly with the control of development for residential purposes and the regulation of density of dwellings.  A planning scheme could include appropriate provisions dealing with the improvement of existing roads or the construction of new main routes, but it would be difficult to prescribe conditions in regard to roads of lesser importance or lay down the future road system for particular portions of the area planned on which development is to be permitted, or possibly postponed for a specified period.  The new procedure is set out in Part III <Col N="47" /> of the Bill.  It is proposed that a planning scheme may contain a provision declaring in relation to any specified land in the area to which the scheme relates that such land shall not be developed wholly or mainly by the erection of dwelling houses or other residential buildings thereon, unless and until a road plan in relation to such land is in force and the development is undertaken in accordance with such plan.</P>
    <P>The procedure to be adopted will ensure that there is full consultation between the owner of the land and the responsible authority as to the nature of the development.  On the submission, by the developing owner, of the road plan to the responsible authority, the particular area affected can be examined in detail and its development planned with due regard to the amenities and convenience of neighbouring lands.</P>
    <P>The road plan may authorise the appropriate local authority to construct or improve roads on the land, and payment by the developing owner to the local authority of all or part of the cost of the construction or improvement.  The plan may also provide for payment by the developing owner to the local authority of all or part of the cost of any construction or improvement of roads carried out between the coming into operation of the planning scheme and the coming into force of the road plan which has facilitated or rendered less costly the development of the land to which the road plan relates.  There is also provision for the preparation and submission of amending road plans.  The decision of the responsible authority on a road plan will be subject to appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the areas where development is subject to a road plan being in force, the planning scheme will contain the provisions regulating the density of buildings.  It has been found desirable to have more extended powers for determining density than are conferred by Part II of the Second Schedule to the Act of 1934.  The power of limiting the number of houses to the acre is one of the most <Col N="48" /> important powers that a planning scheme confers.  It will secure in a planned area that there is no recurrence of the conditions which are associated with slum dwellings.  It will also tend to reinforce the efforts that are being made throughout the country to raise the standard of public health.  Rates of mortality, especially infantile mortality, are highest in overcrowded areas.  Local bodies should, therefore, avail of the powers that town planning confers to ensure that our people may enjoy proper sanitary surroundings both in home and workshop.</P>
    <P>The model provisions that were framed for the consideration of planning authorities in the making of planning schemes contemplate that the density of buildings, other than dwelling houses, should only be controlled by prescribing a minimum area for the curtilage of each building.  It is thought that this method should suffice. In the case of dwelling houses a greater power of regulation is desirable, and in addition to a minimum curtilage for each dwelling the density is also to be controlled by prescribing maximum average densities over units of land.  It was not clear that this power in regard to land units was fully given by the Act of 1934 and Section 8 of the Bill is intended to remedy the position.</P>
    <P>A further practical difficulty is concerned with the details of development occurring after a scheme comes into operation.  An example will serve to illustrate the position.  Suppose that in the area planned there is undeveloped land of 50 to 100 acres which the planning authority considered would be suitable in the future for general residential development, and provision was made accordingly in the planning scheme prohibiting the erection on the lands of any buildings except dwelling houses.  After the lapse of some time and before the development of the lands is complete, it is found that a shopping centre would be an advantage, or that the erection of a school would be desirable.  When an area is being planned the allocation of a site or sites for residential purposes only may be decided upon; the necessity <Col N="49" /> for making wider provisions not being apparent at the time.  At a later period, after the scheme comes into operation, a change in conditions may warrant a modification of such a provision in a scheme.  If the modification would not conflict with the main features of the scheme, a departure from the particular provision should be permitted under proper safeguards, without carrying out the procedure which an amending planning scheme would entail.  It is, therefore, proposed in Section 9 of the Bill to confer upon the responsible authority a power of granting exemption from particular provisions in a planning scheme where there is specific provision included in the scheme for the adoption of that course.</P>
    <P>The other sections of the Bill deal with certain amendments of the Act of 1934 which its operation has shown to be desirable.  Under Section 28 of the Act of 1934 a planning authority can authorise a person to enter on lands within their district for the purpose of making surveys and investigations before deciding whether a resolution for the making of a planning scheme should be adopted.  It is proposed in Section 4 of the Bill to give an urban planning authority powers of entry on lands for the purpose of examining an area adjoining their district before deciding whether the area should be planned as a contiguous area.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the Act of 1934 provides that a planning authority must give not less than one month's notice of the intention to pass a resolution deciding to make a planning scheme to every member of such authority. Such a resolution when passed by a majority of the planning authority has important legal effects.  All development within the area to be planned comes under control, and if any new building is begun without the permission of the planning authority, or if the continuance of any building is prohibited by the planning authority such building (if it contravenes the planning scheme when made) can be removed without compensation.  It is possible that where one month's notice was duly given to every member of a <Col N="50" /> planning authority a new member may be co-opted on the council between the giving of the notice and the passing of the resolution, and such new member may be present at the meeting at which the resolution is passed. The effect would be to invalidate the resolution and everything done in pursuance of the resolution.</P>
    <P>An appeal lies to the High Court on the making of a scheme for the annulment thereof or any specified portion, and if the High Court is of opinion that the whole or substantially the whole of the scheme is not authorised or is not made in accordance with the Act, the court may annul the scheme. To prevent any uncertainty in regard to the validity of a resolution passed by a planning authority deciding to make a planning scheme, it is proposed by Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to provide retrospectively that it will be sufficient for notice to be given of such a resolution to all the members of the planning authority at the time when the notice is given and not at the time the resolution is passed;</P>
    <P>(b)  to require the planning authority, as soon as may be after the passing of the Bill and, in future cases, as soon as may be after the passing of the resolution, to publish a statutory notice of the passing of the resolution;</P>
    <P>(c) to allow persons who own land in the area to apply to the High Court for the annulment of the resolution;</P>
    <P>(d) to provide that where a resolution is not annulled on an application brought to the High Court that the resolution shall be deemed to have been validly passed.</P>
    <P>Where a planning authority passes a resolution deciding to make a planning scheme for a named area and later finds that the area might be extended with advantage, the present position is that the planning authority must pass a new resolution for the added area and must make two planning schemes&mdash;one for the original area and one for the added area.  This will prove inconvenient, especially where a contiguous area is added to a planning <Col N="51" /> district after a planning resolution has been passed for that district.  It is proposed in Section 7 of the Bill to empower a planning authority, which has passed two or more resolutions relating to separate but adjoining areas, to make one planning scheme for the whole area.  The relevant date in any part of the whole area will depend on the resolution relating to that part.</P>
    <P>It is proposed by Section 11 of the Bill to give the Minister power to dispense with the giving of any notice or the publication of any advertisement where he is satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for such dispensation. A similar provision exists in the housing code.</P>
    <P>The present is a fitting occasion for a short review of what is being done in regard to planning throughout the country.  In the large majority of areas, very little attention has been given either to the provisions of the Act of 1934 or the model clauses prepared by the Department.  The areas, however, in which planning schemes are under consideration are the areas in which the largest development is taking place.  They contain about one-third of the total population of the country.</P>
    <P>These areas comprise the County Boroughs of Dublin and Limerick, the Boroughs of Dun Laoghaire, Galway, Clonmel, Drogheda, Sligo, Wexford, and six urban districts.  As regards the county health districts, Dublin and Meath County Councils are the only bodies that are preparing schemes.  The area selected for planning in Meath County is the seaward part of their county lying between Dublin County and the Borough of Drogheda.  The Corporation of Cork have recently advertised for expert technical assistance in the formulation of a comprehensive scheme of development of the city, and the preparation of a scheme for the extension of the borough boundary with a plan for the future development of the area.  Amongst the county boroughs, Waterford is the only one that has not so far taken any action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> The preparation of a planning scheme is a difficult task.  A planning authority which desires to plan its area fully should be guided by expert advice.  The model clauses prepared by my Department indicate the extent of the problems that are likely to be met with in preparing a planning scheme and the manner in which the development of an area may be controlled in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In circulating the model clauses to local authorities, I expressed the hope that they would be helpful in the preparation of schemes and lead to a better understanding of the general powers which a planning scheme confers in securing the orderly and progressive development of an area in the best interests of the community and of preserving, improving and extending its amenities.  I would like again to stress the importance of planning as a means of controlling sporadic development which is so injurious to the natural beauty of the countryside. There is also that form of development along main roads which is generally referred to as &ldquo;ribbon development.&rdquo; The main objections to this form of development are traffic dangers, expense in providing the essential sanitary services, and interference with the development of adjoining lands.  Apart from the danger to children and pedestrian traffic generally the carrying out of road widenings may be rendered difficult and costly.  The boards of health who are concerned with the provision of labourers' cottages must give special attention to this aspect of planning.  If it is necessary near the smaller towns to place cottages in close proximity to main thoroughfares, they should be grouped on sites conveniently placed in relation to such roads and with access thereto properly regulated.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to welcome this Bill as being some effort to improve on the Town and Regional Planning Act, but I do not want the Minister to think, from that, that I wish to criticise the Principal Act.  I think it is an admirable Act, and that, in many ways, it is in advance of similar legislation which is in force in Great Britain.  There is no doubt about it, however, that in the working out of the Act it has been found that there are certain things which are capable of improvement. This amending Bill sets out to improve some of them, but there are others which, I think, the Minister might equally have included in this amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his concluding remarks he referred to the question of ribbon development, which I suppose is one of the things to which any thinking man objects more than anything else. There is one way in which the inducement towards ribbon development could have been at least reduced, and to my mind the principle&mdash;which I want to particularise afterwards&mdash;is admitted to a certain extent in Section <Col N="54" /> 16.  Section 16 provides that where an existing road is improved by the local authority the owner of the land should pay for that improvement.  I think this should be extended not only to roads that have been improved but to all roads.  Take the case of a main road in which the services possibly already exist, there is held out at the present moment an inducement to the builder to come along and &ldquo;ribbon&rdquo; on it, because he has the services and he can build his houses comparatively cheaply.  If he goes into the hinterland, and does what we would all like him to do&mdash;to have perhaps one or two outlets from an estate to the main road &mdash;he then has to make his road and he has to pay for his services.  Therefore, there is at the present moment a considerable inducement to the builder to &ldquo;ribbon.&rdquo;  If this principle in Section 16, which refers to improved roads, were extended to apply to all roads, then there would be no inducement, because the local authority would expect the man who wishes to build along the main road to pay as much for the services which are in that road as the man who develops the background and has to pay for the services to be installed.  I think this is an important question, and I hope the Minister will give the matter consideration.  I hope I have made the actual position clear to him.</P>
    <P>I find a difficulty in completely following Section 10, sub-section (1), because it says:</P>
    <P>A planning scheme may contain provisions empowering the responsible authority to determine the frontage line of buildings and other structures adjoining any road in the area to which such planning scheme relates which is constructed or improved after the making of such planning scheme and for which a frontage line is not determined by such planning scheme.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to agree with the Minister that the town planners are very wonderful people, but I think it is asking too much of them to require them to say before the roads exist where they are going to be, and that is what I read into that sub-section. It relates to any road which is constructed <Col N="55" /> or improved after the making of such planning scheme.  The position of that road apparently has to be determined in the actual plan, although the road may not be developed for years afterwards.  There is also another aspect which I think the Minister might have included, and that is the question of what are known as play streets.  I do not know what legislation it is that empowers it to be done, but in England&mdash;in certain municipalities anyway&mdash;there is a provision by which the police, I think in that case, can close certain streets to traffic during specified hours.  Those streets are then available for children, and they can play there without having to dodge vehicles, horses or motor vans.  Admittedly, the proper procedure is to provide proper playgrounds. But proper playgrounds cost money, and in a congested area it is extremely difficult to find the necessary space to provide them.  In Part I of the Second Schedule to the Principal Act there is provision for the closing of or diverting of traffic from existing roads and public and private rights of way, but I take it that that means a permanent closing.  I do not know whether it can be stretched to apply to a temporary closing such as I have suggested, but possibly the Minister might think it worth while to clear the matter up by making provision in the amending Bill for the local authority to have power to close certain streets during specified hours for the purpose of being used as play streets.</P>
    <P>With the Minister, I regret the lack of interest which has been shown by local authorities generally in this country in the putting into force of this very admirable Act.  There are, I think, great benefits to be obtained from it, and it is much to be regretted that more use has not been made of it. I should like to suggest to the Minister that it would be worth his while to have his Department take an average town&mdash;not too big, because it would be too big a job, but not too small either&mdash;and produce a town plan for that town, so that it can be used for the authorities who are not so keen on this, in order to encourage them by <Col N="56" /> letting them see what improvements can be effected and what benefits can be obtained from it.  I think that is a point which the Minister might at least consider.  In Dublin, it is now nearly three years since the original resolution was passed by which we adopted the Act.  I know there are many people who say that we have done nothing, but probably the people who say that do not conceive what a town plan means, and the information that is required before such a plan can be produced.  We have had consultants appointed.  They are working at the moment, and have been for some time now.  It is hoped that a sketch development plan for Dublin will be produced early next year.  I do not imagine that this will be as revolutionary a document as the Bressey Report was in London, but it is possible that the consultants may have some very interesting development to suggest.  We have, of course, been fortunate in Dublin in that the housing schemes have all been produced by qualified town planners.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part III, which, of course, is a completely new aspect of the matter, I feel that it should be made to apply from the passing of this Bill and not wait until the plan is made.  It would be an advantage to the local authority to let them have immediately the control which this part of the Bill gives to them&mdash;those who have already passed the resolution &mdash;rather than having to wait until the plan is made, because here in Dublin, at any rate, it is going to be at least another four years before the actual plan itself is made.  I think also that this part might give power to the local authority to impose a road plan in certain cases where the owner did not produce one of his own.  There is also another point to which I should like to refer&mdash;of course it will be dealt with later on the Committee Stage&mdash;and that is in regard to the definition of the word &ldquo;development.&rdquo;  It defines the word, and then right through the rest of the part it never uses the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; by itself.  That probably will be better dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is another point, too, which I think might have been included in <Col N="57" /> that, and that is that the power of interim control which is given by the Principal Act should be extended to cover objects affixed to structures. That would cover advertisement hoardings and advertisements fixed to buildings.  We have in the operation of control up to now come across cases where there were advertisements which it was felt did not enhance the beauty of the city.  There are some people who hold that no advertisement can possibly enhance the beauty of anything. That is possibly going a little too far.  At present we have control over the structure, but we have no control over an object affixed to the structure.  For instance, a man may come along and put advertisements up on a railway bridge, and there is no power to have them removed under interim control.  There will be, I admit, when the plan itself is passed, but not under interim control.  In the meantime, the whole appearance of the bridge may have been ruined.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the Principal Act deals with the control of constructive and other work.  At the present time there are various alterations made to structures without seeking permission, and the corporation has no power to prevent that.  It may be that some of the things which are done are not in accordance with what would be desirable. These things, of course, do not come under the bye-laws.  If they come under the building bye-laws they can be controlled.  I suggest that an amendment might be included in this section making it necessary to secure permission to make alterations to any structure before such alteration is carried out.</P>
    <P>Under the next section of the Principal Act, Section 58, where the planning authority has made a special prohibition in relation to any work, the planning authority may prevent the thing being done before the actual plan comes into force, if my reading of it is right.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>When a planning authority has passed a resolution for the making of a planning scheme, and has, before such planning scheme comes into operation, made a special prohibition in relation to any work, such <Col N="58" /> planning authority may, if they are of opinion that the prejudicial effect of proceeding with or doing the work to which such special prohibition relates, would be of such nature as to be incapable of being remedied after the coming into operation of such planning scheme, declare, at any time before such planning scheme comes into operation, that any contravention of such special prohibition before such coming into operation shall be unlawful.</P>
    <P>There are very few things which cannot be remedied after the coming into operation of the scheme, and the only one which occurs to me at the moment is: if an historic building were pulled down, a planning scheme obviously could not make it be put up again. At the same time, if a structure, whatever it may be, has been built and possibly has been in existence for three or four years, there would be very few local authorities who will say that it must be pulled down after four years when the plan comes into operation. That is what Section 58 allows them to do.  If, instead of that, some provision was made for the work to be stopped, and for a penalty to be imposed rather than allow the job to proceed and then have it destroyed, I think it would be an improvement.</P>
    <P>Section 16 (2) (b) of the Bill provides &ldquo;a road plan which provides for the construction of a new road may regulate the situation and nature of such road.&rdquo;  It is suggested that the sub-section might also include the extent to which such a plan must be carried out by a certain time.  There are cases where you have a loop road possibly affecting two different builders and you want perhaps to make both of them work from the main road, or only one from the main road and leave only one outlet until the full site is developed.  At present there is no power to specify the order in which the work has to be done.  It is entirely in the hands of the developer.  If the road is passed, one man possibly can hold up development of another piece of ground.  Because he is not prepared to make a certain section of the road, he will hold it up until his own houses <Col N="59" /> are built and then complete the job or allow the other man to develop.  Some power might be included in that section to allow the local authority to specify the order in which the work is to be done.  These are all the comments I have to make on the Bill at this stage. I think it is a desirable measure, and I am only sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to expand it to include some of the points I mentioned. Whether he is prepared to consider including any of them at a later stage, I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a couple of points really along the lines which Deputy Benson has already outlined. I take it that this Bill more or less deals with towns in one section and the wider aspect of houses in the outer area.  The Minister has taken power in connection with the frontage line of structures on new or improved roads.  I take it that that is only one aspect of an improvement that may be desirable.  Of course, we would all like to see large schemes of improvements carried out straight away, but owing to financial difficulties and other things the usual procedure is to carry out a desirable improvement in the city over a series of years.  The Minister can say how far there is any substantial truth in this, but most local authorities, when you reproach them with possibly not doing some aspect of a very desirable improvement, will say that they are up against difficulties; that if they acquire a house which is in a bad state of repair and put a tenant into it, the tenant obtains rights against the local authority and that really the last stage is worse than the first.  It seems to me that the local authorities ought to have power to go on with plans piecemeal where they are not prepared to go on with them all at the one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Benson has referred to ribbon building.  Everybody deplores that and yet nobody seems to be prepared to tackle the question as to why it takes place.  Houses are supposed to be erected around roads but they must be roads with sewers, water, gas and probably electric light.  I do <Col N="60" /> not know whether the Minister has made up his mind or not that those things should be tackled as a whole, but to start to develop a site&mdash;to make a road and forget about the sewers, the gas, and the electric light&mdash;would be to make a farce of this Bill.  I should like the Minister to say how far that aspect of the question has been considered. As has been previously stated, in the case of a main road where all the amenities are present, there is nothing to do but put down the house. But the development of the hinterland requires certain services and it should be developed in an ordered way.  There is no use in talking about roads and forgetting about the other necessities. Apart from the main thoroughfares, how many places could the Minister find where there are desirable sites with all the amenities laid on?  I think that they are very few and far between &mdash;except sites which are at present in active development by either the Corporation or a builder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a difficulty in planning which is experienced by local authorities&mdash;that is to say building on what we might describe as <i>culs de sac.</i>  Local authorities are practically debarred from taking over that type of road.  I happen to come from an area in which there are a considerable number of seaside resorts.  These resorts are now being developed but, owing to the irregularity of the building which is taking place, it is impossible to lay down water or sewerage schemes and some sort of control of this class of building is absolutely necessary.  For some reason or other, the Local Government Department seems to be reluctant to give powers to the local authority to control building of this type.  I should like if the Minister would say whether in the future <i>culs de sac</i> can be taken over and developed by the local authority. These are some of the difficulties we experience in regard to building development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily a Bill for towns and cities.  The Minister referred to the destruction of the <Col N="61" /> natural beauty of the country and, to that extent, rural areas ought to get consideration and local authorities ought to get powers which, I am sorry to say, are not contained in this Bill. Possibly, the Minister will agree to include those powers in the Bill.  I have in mind the presence of unsightly rubbish heaps in various towns and villages.  These unsightly deposits are situate on private property or on property the ownership of which is not known.  Certain public squares in villages and small towns do not appear to have any owners and we have all kinds of rubbish deposited in these places.  The local authorities do not know where they stand in regard to these places.  If we are going to beautify public places, that is one of the things which should be done first. There is no use in having town planning for cities or towns or seaside resorts if our public highways are used for deposits of unsightly rubbish.  Local authorities are given certain road powers under this Bill.  If they were given the right to assert their authority over property, no matter whose it is, and have these rubbish heaps cleared away, a very good thing would be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister did not tell us the meaning of Section 12.  It seems to me to be a new departure.  It is not a new departure for the Minister to fix compensation but this does not refer to compensation.  The Minister reserves to himself the right to decide that a certain sum of money should be paid by a certain local authority to another and that sum is to be recoverable, in the ordinary way, once it is fixed by the Minister.  There is no machinery for the taking of evidence and, so far as I know, there is no precedent for the giving of judicial power of that sort to a Department.  When the Bill comes back from Committee, I hope we shall find that that provision has been eliminated or that the wording has been altered.  I would like again to refer to the Minister the points I have made with regard to the removal of rubbish heaps all over the country and I would ask him to say what authority he proposes to give to <Col N="62" /> the local authorities for their removal.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I would like to know if this Bill applies to rural villages and if such matters as the situation of abattoirs, slaughter-houses, the widening of roads and such things would be covered by this Bill.  In cases of rebuilding, after the demolition of sites, perhaps the Minister would say how the provisions of the Bill will apply and what is the position generally with regard to making the roads wider.  I understand that at present there are such powers in existence but they are not being exercised.  In country villages I have seen houses demolished and in other places I have seen new houses being erected at corners which are a danger to the travelling public.  I have been told that if certain things were done and certain processes of law were exercised that such things as these new buildings could be prevented.  However, the matter is not very clear in the public mind.  I think it would be well to have full powers to widen streets and roads and make it possible to remove such unsightly buildings as abattoirs on the side of the public road.</P>

      <P>I would like briefly to refer to one matter in connection with this Bill now before us.  So far no reference has been made to the matter I want to raise, and that is in connection with the question of rights of way at seaside resorts.  For some years past the habit has become fairly general and, it seems to be a growing habit on the part of certain people, who have the influence, the money and in some cases the effrontery, to come in and grab certain portions of land adjoining the foreshore and in this way to deprive the ordinary citizens of access to the sea in certain parts of the country.  I am aware that this has happened in the neighbourhood of bathing centres and other beauty places.  In view of the tourist development which is now taking place in this country it would be very advisable and very much in the interest of the country and of the tourist industry in general if local authorities would be <Col N="63" /> given definite rights so as to enable them to see to the preservation of these public amenities and rights of way.  I have been informed and I believe that at present the law in relation to these rights of way is notoriously intricate and very difficult of interpretation.  That state of affairs lent itself to exploitation by persons who desired to exploit these rights of way.  Now that there is an opportunity of clearing these matters up and of taking control of these rights in the interest of the public, I hope that opportunity will not be lost.</P>

      <P>Four years after the passing of the original town-planning Act we would hope, in facing new legislation, that we would be in a position to deal with this whole matter.  Undoubtedly that will be found to be the case.  In the meantime, however, there is danger that between the chinks in the two pieces of legislation unsightly remnants will be found here and there arising out of the new development.  It is with a view to seeing whether this amending Bill will cover that matter or whether it will be necessary to bring in additional legislation that I am raising this question now.  Deputy Benson implied that in Dublin we were rather happy in the fact that housing schemes were produced by people who were fully qualified in the matter of town planning.  However, I have here a letter from the city architect's office dated 16th June, 1938, to the effect that a certain building scheme in Clontarf complied with the building by-laws and therefore there was no power to refuse sanction, and it was further added that town planning power would be strained if applied to boundaries between two building schemes.  I take it that the Minister does not accept that as a theory.  There was a nice residential <i>cul-de-sac</i> in Clontarf which was shut off from the public road by trees and a nice green hedge.  On an estate on the far side of this, another housing scheme was being developed.  It appears that the plans of the building scheme on the other estate complied with the building laws of the Dublin Corporation. <Col N="64" /> Everything went on all right until last Easter when the people who had built on the Dunluce Road found that the nice green hedge and the trees at the rere of their houses had disappeared. Instead of having nice ornamental trees and hedges at the back of their houses they found that the builder on the adjacent estate had destroyed the natural boundary of trees and hedges and substituted a four strand wire fence which gave an uninterrupted view from the public road in front of their houses and showed a view of the back gardens with the daily line of laundry et cetera.  They naturally expected that nothing like that would occur four years after the Town Planning Act had been passed&mdash;an Act controlling building schemes.  It should be within the power of people controlling the supervising and passing of housing schemes to deal with a matter of that kind.  The position now is that such a state of affairs exists as I have indicated.  The amenities of these people have been destroyed.  The city architect's office appears to be in full sympathy with the people in this matter, but it appears they are of opinion that there is no remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the city manager and the city authorities had the matter brought before them on the 27th July, the people interested were advised that the law agent would be asked to advise in the matter as to the powers of the corporation to compel the builder to build a wall hiding the objectionable view.  Since the 27th July there has been complete silence on the whole question as to what authority there is to prevent a person in the City of Dublin in the case of a new housing scheme passed by the Corporation, leaving his work in such a way that the whole amenities of property recently built may be utterly destroyed. Personally, I refrained from referring the matter to the Department of Local Government, because I felt that something could be done through the corporation officials to have the matter satisfactorily settled.  I still hope that it may be possible, through the intervention of the Dublin Corporation, to get the matter settled.  In view of the fact that these matters are now occupying the attention of the Minister's <Col N="65" /> office, I would like to take this opportunity of passing the papers to the Minister or his officials so that this complaint could be looked into in connection with the Town Planning Bill, and so that they would have an opportunity of seeing whether cases of this kind cannot be covered by the town planning legislation we have, or by the powers provided in this Bill, or whether there is not a case for some definite <i>ad hoc</i> legislation of a kind which would deal with questions like this.  It is certainly a pity when we have had so much talk about town planning, and when so much general acceptance was given to this legislation in the House and in the Press generally, and when so much money has been spent in assisting in the building of houses, that in an important residential part of the City of Dublin it is possible to have a thing like I have mentioned happen.  The Corporation of Dublin have so far failed to determine their powers in this matter.  The natural boundary was removed last Easter, and the people in Dunluce Road have since been in correspondence with the various parties concerned to have the matter remedied.  As I say, I take the opportunity of passing the papers to the Minister so that he and his officials can have a look at them.  I should like also to support the case made by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Kennedy that, apart from planning altogether, there does seem to be a necessity for putting legislative powers into the hands of local bodies to prevent eyesores and nuisances being erected in parts of the country where clearly it would not be necessary to create a plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the attention of the Minister to the need for intelligent planning in respect of small towns and villages.  In many of our small towns and villages, housing schemes are in the course of development and the effect of these schemes has been to demolish large sections of these towns and villages and, in some cases, to transplant the population of the streets to districts far removed from the towns and villages.  That has the effect of creating eyesores in these small towns.  It gives them the <Col N="66" /> appearance of having been visited by a badly directed air raid, and it also inflicts a certain amount of injustice on traders in these small towns who have got to depend on the people at present residing in these towns for their custom.  These traders will suffer a very grave loss if the population, or a large section of the population, are removed to a considerable distance.  I think town planning in these small towns and villages should be directed so as to ensure that where houses are demolished they should be replaced as far as possible by other buildings.  The sites should not be left derelict and the business people should not be deprived of customers upon whom they have got to depend for their existence.  Moreover, such a course would lead to an improvement in the appearance of these towns whereas, under the present housing arrangements, you have these towns disfigured to a great extent owing to the demolition of condemned buildings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points to which I want to direct the attention of the Minister.  They are, perhaps, points that would arise more appropriately on the Committee Stage, and, consequently, I do not want to take up too much time in discussing them.  The general scheme of the Principal Act, which this Bill is designed to amend, provides, I think, that before the powers that are granted to local authorities are exercised, there should be in existence a scheme, and if such a scheme is in existence that property owners or people who are developing property should have an opportunity of going into that scheme, with a view to seeing whether their plans in any way run counter to the planning scheme.  I want to know if that is the principle under which the Act is operated.  I shall develop the point a little further in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question is this: Under the Town Planning Act, as it stands at present, provision is made for compensating owners of property whose rights have been interfered with by local authorities in the exercise of their powers under the Town Planning Act. When, however, property owners apply, <Col N="67" /> certainly in the City of Dublin, to the corporation, as the town planning authority, for the assessment of compensation to which they are admittedly entitled in consequence of the alleged exercise of these powers by the Dublin Corporation, they are told that it is not possible to have any compensation assessed, or even to have arbitration held with a view to having evidence taken and compensation assessed, until the town planning scheme is in operation, perhaps years and years hence.  In one case of which I know, that was the answer given. Subsequently High Court proceedings had to be taken but the matter was compromised eventually.  I want to know if the Minister has considered that defect, if it is a defect, in the Act?  That is the contention of the Dublin Corporation, that even where a property owner is admittedly entitled to compensation for interference with his buildings or property, in pursuance of the alleged exercise of powers under the Act, then that compensation is not payable for years ahead, that the assessment of compensation cannot be made, or that arbitration proceedings cannot be held for years.  If that is the position under the Act&mdash;and it is alleged to be the position by the legal advisers of the corporation&mdash;that is a matter that should be looked into and should be amended if necessary.  I propose to put down an amendment if the Minister does not see his way to amend the Act in that respect, to secure that the compensation shall be assessed immediately.</P>
    <P>The other point upon which I want guidance from the Minister has reference to the question I put already: Is it the general scheme of the Act that the powers of the Act are not exercisable until a town planning scheme has been prepared and put into operation? Property owners who are developing their property in the city do not quite know what to do.  If there was a scheme in existence, they would know whether or not their plans for building cut across the planning scheme of the City of Dublin.  In one case, actually where buildings were <Col N="68" /> erected, it came to my personal knowledge that the Dublin Corporation served notice on the person building the houses that they intended to run a road through portion of the property. As a result of that, he had to remove a garage which he had erected.  He had entered into an agreement with the purchaser of the house and garage and as a result of the removal of the garage he got into very considerable trouble, as the purchaser repudiated the transaction on account of the removal of the garage.  At the end of all that, when he had made his plans in accordance with the requirements of the Dublin Corporation, after the lapse of some months he was told by the corporation: &ldquo;We are not going on with our scheme; you can do anything you like now; we are not going ahead with this road.&rdquo;  While I admit that local authorities should have ample powers in that respect, it is most essential that the rights of local authorities in this respect should be very definite and specific.  The Town Planning Act is a very difficult Act to construe.  It is extremely difficult to ascertain what the powers of local authorities are under the Act.  So far they have not been clarified by the amending Bill, and I should like some guidance from the Minister as to what is intended under the Principal Act and this Bill in reference to powers before the town planning scheme comes into existence, and, secondly, in reference to this question of compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. T. Linehan Mr. T. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention. Reference has been made to unsightly new buildings at seaside places and beauty spots.  I think an evil that requires equally urgent attention is the number of derelict, unoccupied, old buildings that are dotted all over the country in various towns and villages.  There are a number of towns and villages in which these buildings have been unoccupied for years.  They are dreadful eyesores as far as the appearance of the town is concerned and, apart from the value of the site, they are absolutely valueless <Col N="69" /> to anybody.  I do not think that you could pick a town in the South of Ireland in which there is not some derelict eyesore of that nature.  I believe that if powers are not given in the Regional Town Planning Act some steps should be taken to compel local authorities to deal with the position and to see that these unsightly eyesores are removed from the public view.  They are absolutely of no utility and, as far as one can see, they are of no value to anybody.</P>
      <P>Another point to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention is that in small towns and villages it is noticeable that when the town begins to develop and building starts it invariably develops in the direction of the population trend.  I think you will find that in the South and West when towns begin to develop they generally go in the one direction&mdash; usually towards Dublin, as a matter of fact.  When that happens you get a string of buildings all along the main road in the direction in which the development is taking place.  You ultimately have in a medium-sized town or village a string of big and small garages in a straight row.  You have this ribbon building on the main roads on which there is the general flow of traffic.  I think that in non-urbanised areas the local authority should have power to deal with that kind of thing. It is not an improvement to a town to have that type of building going on.  It is not on those lines that modern building development should go&mdash;one straight line out along a particular road.  I would ask the Minister to look into the two points I have raised.  I should be glad to know from him if these points are covered in the Bill, and if the public health authorities in rural areas have power to deal with them.  If they have not that power already in the existing legislation, I think the Minister should take the power now and give it to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that so many Deputies have taken an interest in this amending Bill and displayed an interest in the question of town planning in general.  As Deputy Costello has said, it is a new subject <Col N="70" /> and a very intricate matter.  The law dealing with it is, I am afraid, little known due largely to the fact that not many places have availed of the existing powers.  In fact, too few local authorities have put the present Act into operation up to the present.  I hope that the discussion that we have had here to-day will help to direct the attention of the public in general, as well as local authorities and their officials, to the Town Planning Act, and that it will tend to make its possible benefits better known.  I trust it will have the effect of getting the matter more widely discussed so that the benefits that can arise to the community from putting the Act into operation may become better known. As a result of the passing of this Bill, and of amendments to it, we hope to put at the disposal of local authorities and the community in general additional powers for their benefit and welfare.</P>
      <P>A number of the questions raised on the Second Reading of the Bill can best be left over, I think, for the Committee Stage.  Deputy Benson raised some matters of interest.  He had some questions to ask about Sections 10 and 16.  Some of the matters that he referred to have been the subject of discussion between officials of my Department and officials of the Dublin Corporation.  Some of the matters that the Deputy referred to will arise for further discussion on amendments which I propose to introduce on the Committee Stage.  If there are any other matters that Deputy Benson, or any other Deputy thinks are worthy of consideration, by way of amendment to the Bill, I should be very happy to have them discussed.  I shall be pleased to see Deputies interesting themselves in this, and giving us all the help they can to try and improve the Bill&mdash;to try and make it a more useful instrument for local authorities and the community in general.  We shall do our best to try and utilise the suggestions which Deputies make, by way of amendment or otherwise, to improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if there is any power at present to do what Deputy Benson suggested in the way of closing streets at <Col N="71" /> certain hours, and I doubt if any amendment of the kind could be introduced into a Town Planning Bill.  I will look into the matter and see if it would be possible to do by way of amendment what the Deputy has suggested, but I hardly think it would come within the scope of a Bill of this character.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello at the end of his speech referred to the question of the planning of small towns.  A number of other Deputies also dealt with this. Deputy Costello wanted to know whether a planning scheme must be in existence before a local authority can exercise its powers with regard to planning schemes or building operations. I would point out that once a local authority passes a resolution to make a scheme it has, following that, certain well-defined powers.  These are set out pretty fully in the Act.  In addition, I should say that about a year ago we sent out not only to every local authority but to everybody whom we thought would be interested, or who had displayed a special interest, in this matter, a copy of model regulations. We also sent these to the Press.  We did that to give as much information as possible to everybody interested: to try and get the Act known and its provisions better understood. We have also issued a summary of the provisions of the Town and Regional Planning Act of 1934, which contains a fairly full description of the Act&mdash;of its provisions and powers and the manner of using them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was aware, of course, of the fact that there are in the Act certain powers where a special resolution is passed.  But supposing a local authority passes such a resolution, and then sits down <i>in secula sæculorum</i> and does nothing about a planning scheme surely it is not equitable that it should be allowed to proceed on the basis that it was exercising the powers given it in the Act by proceeding &ldquo;with as much expedition as possible to formulate a plan.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that what the Deputy has suggested has <Col N="72" /> happened in one or two cases.  In the Act as it stands there is no provision to oblige a local authority to produce their scheme within a certain time, and I doubt if, as things stand, we could introduce such an amendment into our legislation.</P>
      <P>It is generally agreed that it is necessary to have expert advice in the making of a plan.  The number of experts on town planning is strictly limited.  There are numbers of professional men who, if asked to make a study of it would, probably, find it profitable to give their time as experts, but the disposition of local authorities to utilise the Act has not encouraged a sufficient number of professional men to engage as specialists in the subject up to the present.  I know, probably, three or four professional men who have secured appointments as experts in town planning since the Act was passed.  There may be others.  I also know that some local authorities have given it as an excuse for not proceeding with greater rapidity in the making of plans, that they found difficulty in securing expert advice.</P>

      <P>No.  Deputy Dockrell suggested that we should produce a plan for small towns and rural areas.  That is not the province of the Department.  There are plans in existence&mdash;not many&mdash;for towns and cities.  These are preliminary plans, but the officials of any local authority, engineers, architects, town <Col N="73" /> clerks or members of boards, would be facilitated by those who already have plans, and every advice and assistance that we could give would be given.  It is not the province of the Department or of the officials to produce plans for local authorities, and, as Deputy Mulcahy stated, we have not the staff necessary at present to give time to do so.  The other point made by Deputy Costello was with regard to compensation. I think what the Deputy said was true and that until a standing scheme is made, compensation cannot be ascertained.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello asked a question about Section 12, and the power of imposing costs.  If a person prosecutes an appeal and is unsuccessful, and costs are imposed on him, say a builder or someone of that kind, it seems reasonable that something in the nature of a penalty might reasonably be imposed on the person who insisted on carrying on the appeal, and who put costs on the person who had to fight his corner.  There is, at least, one precedent, I am told, for the imposition of costs by the Minister.  It is not a thing about which I am enamoured, and I am quite prepared to consider the possibility of leaving to someone the power of imposing penalties of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder in that connection if the Minister would consider at this stage whether, where an appeal had been taken by an ordinary person against a local authority in connection with a scheme that it should not be possible for an award of costs to be made against the person taking that appeal in favour of the local authority; that is, that where the local authority is undertaking a building scheme and bearing the costs of it and where there are likely to be appeals from ordinary persons affected by the scheme, that they should not be inhibited from putting forward an appeal by the fear that they may have to bear the costs of the local authority.  I do not think that the local authority should get the costs against a person in any case where, because of the action of a local authority, that person is driven to appeal.</P>

      <P>That is the difficulty, you see, and if costs were given, then a person is stopped from making an appeal that he might reasonably make simply because of the unknown into which he would be going and the fear that he might be going into a case in which he might have to bear the local authority's costs.  I think that where the local authority is bearing the costs of the whole scheme the additional cost of having to bear the ordinary type of appeal that might come up from any owner of property is not such a great addition to the scheme as would warrant its being imposed on the person appealing.  I think that plans might be much more satisfactorily made and that there would be greater harmony in the end over the final decisions to be taken if it were possible to have an appeal heard without the persons appealing having to bear the local authority's costs as well as their own.</P>

    <Title>Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1938&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move, Sir, that the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1938, be read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose, or the two main purposes, of this Bill are, I think, clearly stated in the Long Title; that is to say, it is</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An Act to confirm and give statutory effect to an Agreement made between certain assurance companies for the transfer of their life assurance <Col N="78" /> business and their industrial assurance business to a single company, to make provision for divers matters arising out of or consequential on the said Agreement, including the making of similar agreements by other assurance companies, and to amend the law relating to assurance business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Scheduled to the Bill, as Deputies will have noticed, is an agreement entered into between the City of Dublin Assurance Company, Limited; the Irish Life and General Assurance Company, Limited; the Irish National Assurance Company, Limited; and the Munster and Leinster Assurance Company, Limited.  These four companies, referred to in the Bill as the participating companies, have undertaken to transfer their life assurance business and industrial assurance business to the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company, Limited; that is to say, a new company, which is referred to throughout the Bill as the terminating company, incorporated for the purpose of consolidating the existing business.</P>
    <P>As the title of the Bill indicates, its purposes are twofold: firstly, to confirm and to give statutory effect to the scheduled agreement and secondly, to enable other companies engaged in these two classes of business to enter into agreements with the new company for the transfer to it of their industrial and life assurance businesses on terms similar to the scheduled agreement.</P>
    <P>We had a Bill dealing with assurance before the Dáil in 1936 and, as Deputies will remember, provisions were embodied in Part III of that Bill to encourage the amalgamation of the Irish life offices.  In the course of prolonged discussions and negotiations following the enactment of the 1936 Act, it emerged that the British offices transacting life and industrial assurance business in this country were also prepared to accept the principle of amalgamation.  The British offices did not consider that it was possible, however, to commit themselves to an amalgamation scheme until they were in a position to examine the terms and <Col N="79" /> the conditions of any scheme adopted by the Irish offices, and to see how such of these offices as had deficiencies in their funds would have the deficiencies made good.  The four participating offices have now executed an agreement and there is every prospect that the principal British offices transacting industrial assurance business here will transfer that business to the new Irish company.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, therefore, that, in addition to the four participating companies, any other company may join in the amalgamation by entering into an agreement with the new company, and adopting the provisions of the scheduled agreement so far as they may be applicable.  Negotiations with the Prudential, the Brittanic, the Pearl, and the Refuge companies are proceeding and there is every reason to believe that they will result in agreements between the individual British offices and the terminating company.  In all important respects, such as the basis of valuation, the allotment of shares and the provisions for the transfer of staff, the terms of these agreements will be the same as those set out in the scheduled agreement and, further the bonuses which the policies of these companies have enjoyed in the past will be guaranteed in the future.  Adequate provision will be made by the British companies for these bonuses.  There will, of course, be no question of the State covering deficiencies in the case of these companies and assets equivalent to the full liability will be transferred in each case.  The agreements with the British companies will probably require certain legal formalities in the British courts and the passing of this Bill by the Dáil will be important in that connection.  The date for the transfer of the business will be so fixed as to enable these formalities to be completed and, in the event of any unforeseen conditions arising, the position can be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation scheme which it is proposed by this Bill to facilitate and to make as comprehensive as possible, embodies three main principles: first, that the interest of the policyholders, <Col N="80" /> including those holding policies with companies whose assurance funds are not actuarily solvent, shall be fully safeguarded; second, that all companies joining in the amalgamation of business shall enter on a common basis; and, third, that the employees affected shall be fairly dealt with.  An important feature of the scheme of amalgamation is that the liabilities and assets of the companies are to be ascertained on a uniform basis, and that in the case of such of the Irish offices as are unable to transfer assets equal to the ascertained liability, the deficiency is to be made good out of money provided by the State.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the Irish offices have had to compete with the external offices on unequal terms for a share in the business.  The inequality of the competition arises from various causes, the most obvious one being the disparity between the limited funds of the native offices and the very large accumulated funds of the external offices.  The native concerns entered the field to compete with external offices which had already built up the necessary organisations and firmly established their business here.  Apart from the disadvantages arising from limited financial resources, they had to contend with the difficulties attending all insurance institutions in their early stages.  One heavy handicap was the high ratio of working expenses consequent on the comparatively small amount of business procurable by each company in the face of intense competition. That the Irish offices have succeeded in working up a substantial business, despite the disadvantages referred to, is evidenced by their combined premium income in the life and industrial branches of nearly £700,000, of which about £430,000 is accounted. for by the four offices which have executed the agreement which is the schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>When the business of the participating companies has been valued on the basis provided for in the agreement, it will doubtless be found that in varying degrees the available assets will fall short of the ascertained liabilities. The State is concerned that the policyholders should not be adversely affected <Col N="81" /> by any deficiency in the funds, and it is for this reason that it is prepared, as an essential condition of the amalgamation, to make good any deficiency out of State funds.  That principle was recognised in the provisions embodied in Part III of the Act of 1936.  As I have already indicated, the provisions of Part III of the 1936 Act are not wide enough to meet an amalgamation scheme of so comprehensive a character as has now become practicable, and it is now, therefore, proposed to repeal it.</P>
    <P>Part III, I think, has served a useful purpose in that it has made possible the bringing together of the companies to discuss and hammer out a concrete and acceptable scheme of amalgamation.  I may point out that the State's undertaking to make good any deficiency applies only in the case of the four companies which are parties to the scheduled agreement.  Any other company joining in the amalgamation as an adopting company&mdash;to use the phrase in the Bill&mdash;must put up assets equal to its ascertained liabilities.  As the State is to make good deficiencies in the assurance funds of the participating companies, it must see that all proper safeguards exist for the future organisation and conduct of the business. I am satisfied that the provisions embodied in the scheduled agreement and in the Bill contain all the necessary safeguards.</P>
    <P>The new company has been set up for the purpose of taking over the business of the four participating companies and of such other companies as enter into agreements for the transfer of their business.  Its authorised share capital is £200,010, divided into 2,000,000 A ordinary shares of 2/- each and 100 B ordinary shares of 2/- each. No cash consideration will be paid to the amalgamating companies for the transfer of their business.  Instead, each company will be allotted a number of fully paid-up A shares determined by the measure of the particular company's premium income and the degree of the solvency of its funds.  If it is able to transfer assets equal to its liabilities, then it will be allotted a 2/- A share for each £1 of premium income, the premium income or goodwill <Col N="82" /> being calculated in the manner laid down in the scheduled agreement.</P>
    <P>Where the Minister for Finance is called upon to make good a deficiency in the assets of any company, the number of shares allotted to that company will be reduced to correspond to its degree of solvency and the balance will be allotted to the Minister for Finance. In addition, that Minister is to be allotted whichever is the lesser of 100,000 shares or 5 per cent. of the issued capital.  The Minister for Finance will hold all of the 100 B shares.  These shares carry the sole voting rights, thus giving him complete control of the company.  The company, having taken over the existing business, will confine its operations to working off that business as a closed fund, after which the company will be liquidated.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to know why the capital is divided into 2/- shares rather than £1 shares.  The reason is this. The issued share capital of the company must be represented on the assets side of its balance sheet by a corresponding figure for goodwill since no cash consideration will pass for the shares.  The low nominal value of the shares, 2/-, was fixed so as to keep the goodwill figure at a low level in order that this intangible asset might be eliminated from the balance sheet at an early stage in the company's career.  It will be appreciated that the amount of the company's capital does not purport to represent the value of the businesses to be transferred. The shares are merely tokens by which the equity in the amalgamated company can be distributed among the participants.</P>
    <P>In addition to the terminating company, a further public limited liability company, referred to in the Bill as the permanent company, is to be incorporated for the purpose of taking a transfer of the staffs and goodwill of further business of the amalgamating companies, of servicing the business transferred to the terminating company and transacting new business. That company will be the operating company.  Its authorised share capital will be £200,000, divided into 200,000 ordinary shares of £1 <Col N="83" /> each.  All the original share capital of the permanent company is to be taken up by the terminating company which will continue, until its liquidation to hold not less than 76 per cent. of the issued shares of the permanent company. The Minister for Finance will thus have a dual control: directly over the terminating company with his exclusive holding of the voting shares and indirectly over the permanent company through its control of the terminating company.</P>
    <P>The memorandum and articles of association of both are to be subject to the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The directors of the terminating company, including the first and any subsequent directors, are appointable by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the first directors of the permanent company are similarly appointable. There is an advantage in setting up two companies to handle the amalgamation.  The existing policy-holders in the several companies will have their contracts transferred to the terminating company which will, from the outset, have assets adequate to meet the claims of these policy-holders as they arise.  All new policies will be issued by the operating company which, having taken over the staffs and connections of the existing offices, will be in a position to conduct future business with all the advantages of a unified organisation.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Insurance Act of 1936 through the House, concern was expressed by many Deputies as to the future of employees who might be affected by the amalgamation scheme.  I made it quite clear then that I would not be prepared to approve of any scheme of amalgamation which did not recognise the right of employees, who depend for their livelihood on the insurance industry, to continue in that industry.  The scheme now before the House gives effect to that principle.  Under the scheme, the right to employment by the operating company is secured to the staffs of the participating companies, with certain minor exceptions, at rates of remuneration equal to their average earnings during the two years <Col N="84" /> ended June of this year.  The minor exceptions are persons who entered the service after June of 1936, or were earning less than 20/- per week, or are over 60 years of age.  These persons may be offered employment, but will not have an express right to employment, but if they are not offered employment in the operating company, they will be entitled to compensation on the scale laid down in the agreement.</P>
    <P>Provision is made to prevent dismissals on account of redundancy and a board of referees is to be made up to which an appeal will be made if any dismissed member of the staff considers that his dismissal is due to redundancy.  Directors and executives are in a different category.  None of these will have an expressed right to be taken over.  If, however, they are not taken over by the terminating company or the permanent company, they will be entitled to compensation on the terms provided in the agreement. It is certain, I think, that the operating company, binding itself to take over the general body of existing staffs to work in a unified block of business, will, for some years at least, have to carry more employees than would in ordinary circumstances be necessary.  In fairness to the staffs, however, that cannot be avoided and the position will no doubt adjust itself through normal wastage over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The agreement contains adequate safeguards against the discharge of persons on grounds of redundancy.  It is not contemplated that it will be necessary, in practice, to invoke these safeguards, but it is nevertheless well to have them there.  I believe the proposals embodied in the Bill will mark a turning point in the history of Irish life assurance.  Having regard to the conditions under which the business has heretofore had to be conducted, it cannot be doubted that this amalgamation scheme will result in the advancement of life assurance, and particularly industrial life assurance, in this country.  The operating company will have all the advantages of a unified organisation and persons desiring to place new business will have at their disposal a national insurance <Col N="85" /> institution in which they can have the fullest confidence.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the manner in which the officers concerned have co-operated in the formulation and development of the scheme now before the House.  The settling of an amalgamation scheme of any kind is not an easy matter, and the formulation of a scheme of amalgamation of life assurance business, involving the solution of many technical problems peculiar to the nature of that business, is a matter of great complexity, and I am the more appreciative, therefore, of the efforts which have gone to produce the scheme.  I am confident in believing that, with a spirit of co-operation on the part of all concerned, the future holds bright prospects for Irish life and industrial assurance.  It is very desirable that the proposals in the Bill should receive legislative sanction as speedily as possible so that the amalgamation may be proceeded with without delay, and as the main purpose of the Bill is to confirm the scheduled agreement, I trust the House will see its way to approve of the Bill as an agreed measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, one would like to discuss on this measure a few things, such as why no names from amongst the names of the large group of persons, who, as directors, managers or officials in one way or another, were associated with the development of the insurance business in Ireland in the past appear among the names of the directors of the new company.  One might like also to discuss the particular significance of the names that do appear on the board of the new company, and why it was not possible to get an amalgamation which brought in all the Irish companies. Normally, as I say, one would wish to discuss some of these things, and it would be important to do so, but the Minister comes before us with this Bill which, on the face of it, gives no indication that the large exodus of money from this country to Great Britain, about which the Minister complained so much in the past, is going to be stopped.  After negotiations which <Col N="86" /> must have been delicate and difficult, bringing four of the Irish companies together, the Minister tells us that as soon as this thing is settled, certain British companies carrying on industrial assurance in the country are going to join.  In these circumstances, the Minister, in introducing this Bill, puts the House in the position of discussing a very difficult and a very delicate transaction in the middle of its being completed, because, as I say, the Bill, in itself, gives no indication that the exodus of Irish money to British companies is going to be stopped.  If the British companies he mentions are going to transfer their Irish industrial insurance to this new company, some little in that direction will be achieved, but, generally, my position with regard to this Bill is that in the circumstances in which the Minister presents it to the House and in view of the statement he has made to the House, it is impossible to discuss it.  I want, therefore, to take him on one point alone.  The Minister gives the House the assurance that this is a sound development, that there need be no fear for the future of a company of this particular kind, that it will be the nucleus around which the conservation of Irish insurance companies is going to grow, that the insurance policy-holders in the past are fully secured, and that the arrangement is such that new policy-holders that will do business with the new permanent company that is set up will have full assurance themselves, and that, as well as that, the directors and the employees of the companies now being amalgamated will all be reasonably and equitably looked after.  In presenting that picture to the House here some of us are inevitably driven back to consider the people who were employees of these companies and who, because of the operation of the 1936 Act, have had their services dispensed with and have got compensation of no kind at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, take one of the companies here. I know of one particular company which, on its life side, had 40 indoor workers and between 200 and 300 outdoor workers, and on the fire and accident side of the business had 11 <Col N="87" /> workers, three of whom were outside inspectors.  There you have something like, in all, say, 300 persons on one side and 11 persons on the other side. Under the 1936 Act they had to give up their fire and accident business. Eight of the people who were actually employed under the fire and accident business were retained and have been on life business since and are given the guarantees for future employment or for compensation that the Minister speaks about, but three have had their services dispensed with, and in one particular case an official, after nine and a quarter years' service with his company, got this: &ldquo;I enclose a cheque for four weeks' salary in lieu of notice.&rdquo;  Now, I do submit to the Minister that to leave a small group such as that where, say, 311 or 320 persons of one particular company are being given the security about which the Minister speaks under this, and to throw out on the road three persons because of the operation of the Insurance Act, of which this is the fruit, is certainly a thing that is inequitable and unreasonable.  It is not possible to introduce into the agreement, which is the appendix to this particular Bill, anything that will cover such cases, but I submit that it is due to these people and that it is possible for the Minister, now that he sees success in sight, to put into the present Bill a stipulation that, where persons who were the employees of these companies on the fire and accident side have been dislodged from their employment without compensation as a result either of the passing or the coming into force of the 1936 Act, they should be given from the new company the same terms of compensation, or the same treatment, as are being given to those persons who were fortunate enough to have been retained.  If the relation in numbers between the numbers who were employees of these companies and are being retained or compensated under this system to the numbers that are actually being let go is taken into consideration, then the problem is infinitesimal, but if it is not recognised that these people are entitled to compensation for being dislodged as a result of the Minister's <Col N="88" /> 1936 Act, then the injustice that is done to these people is a very great injustice indeed.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that I would ask the Minister to consider fully and carefully, and, as I say, with regard to any other aspect of the Bill, as far as I am concerned, and as the Minister has told the House that he is in the middle of a very difficult and delicate operation, I think it is quite impossible for me, at any rate, to discuss the proposals of the measure in this House.  I do say, however, that left as they are, they do nothing to stop the stream of monies leaving this country for Great Britain or other countries for insurance purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters that I should like to raise on this Bill.  The Minister has told us of the functions of the terminating company and has informed us that its business will be to take over the assets and liabilities of the four amalgamated companies and also to promote the establishment of a permanent company.  He did not indicate, however how long the terminating company is going to function and how soon it will be before the permanent company comes into operation to transact business as the normal company looking after the interests of the participating companies in the amalgamation scheme, and of any companies which may subsequently agree to adhere to the amalgamation scheme now being provided for.  I should like, therefore, to know how long this temporary company will function, welding these parts together; how soon we may expect the permanent company to come into operation, and also whether the intention of the State in taking up capital in the terminating company and exercising absolute control thereby of the manipulation of shares, and also exercising control in respect of the permanent company is intended to be an intimation that the State will continue to direct the policy of this permanent company; or is it intended, at a later date, that the State will get out, will sell out its rights in the matter and allow this company to be <Col N="89" /> operated as present-day insurance companies are operated in this country? Does the Minister visualise the State continuing to have a directing influence in the policy of this new company?  Does he intend that the State should have permanent control over the company, and does he intend that the State is going to take a guiding hand in shaping the destinies of this new company which is now going to make a serious effort to compete for life and industrial business in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are questions on which I should like the Minister to give us some information because they represent important considerations in approaching this Bill.  There are other aspects of the Bill, however, upon which I should like to express a view.  One cannot but feel convinced that, if the directors of these companies spent a good deal of time looking after this amalgamation scheme, they certainly spent a very substantial amount of that time looking after themselves.  I have taken the trouble to try to find out the number of directors affected by these four companies, and there appears to be 27 directors, in all, affected by the four companies, the City of Dublin, the Munster and Leinster, the Irish National, and the Irish Life.  We are told in the agreement that the City of Dublin directors are to get £10,000 compensation.  The Munster and Leinster, with six directors, are going to get £9,000 between them, and in the case of the other companies they are going to get three, four or five times their annual fees, according to their period of service as directors, and on top of that, if they were chairmen of these companies, they will get twice their annual fees in addition.  I think the Irish National Insurance Company has six directors and that the Irish Life &mdash;or rather, I think, the City of Dublin &mdash;has six directors and that the other company has seven directors.  It looks to me as if about 13 directors alone are likely to absorb close on £20,000 compensation.  When we have paid that £20,000 to about 13 directors, we find there are still 15 more to be provided for.  By the time the entire 27 <Col N="90" /> directors are provided for it looks to me as if a sum in the vicinity of £40,000 will have been spent.  One might even understand that, if this were a giant capitalised undertaking, but the paid-up capital of the four companies concerned amounts to only £92,000.  We are going to pay out approximately half the paid-up capital of the four companies in compensation to about 27 directors.  That seems to me to be particularly generous treatment of the directors.  It is exceptionally generous treatment when you remember that this amalgamation is necessary because of the fact that those companies are actuarially insolvent according to the Minister; this is necessary in order to save the policy-holders and to save Irish insurance from the serious damage which would ensue to it if there were default by any one of those companies.  But the scheme does not end when you have paid compensation to the 27 directors; it does not end when you have written cheques for approximately £40,000.  There is another group to be dealt with, and those are executives, managing directors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure there is something wrong in that, because one gentleman in the insurance world is boasting that he alone will get about £10,000 out of this scheme, five times his annual emoluments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy referred only to the two companies in respect of which there is a limit applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I understand, but you have to look at the executives, the managing directors, the assistant managing directors, the agency managers, and people of that kind.  They are also entitled to come into this scheme of compensation.  The compensation they get is five times their annual emoluments.  You, therefore, <Col N="91" /> get this position, that apart from the executive who would be compensated you are compensating the directors. Here there seems to be a peculiar and in my view an unjustifiable distinction in the principle of compensation as applied to the agents, for instance, and as applied to the directors.  A director who has ten years' service as a director will get five times his annual income, which is equivalent to five years' salary, but an agent who has ten years' service with the same company will get only ten months' salary.  Directorships are in themselves <i>prima facie</i> evidence of relative freedom from poverty, but a director is going to get five years' salary while for the same service an agent is going to get only ten months' salary.  That seems to me to be an unjustifiable differentiation in the matter of calculating compensation.  I cannot understand why a director should be allowed to get away with five years' salary for ten years' service, while an agent with ten years' service will have to content himself with ten months' salary if he is not taken over by the new company.  Of course we all know perfectly well that the new company is not going to be able to sustain and keep in employment those who are at present employed as agents in the four separate companies.  An effort may be made at this stage to say, &ldquo;Well, while there may be some disemployment, there will not be much,&rdquo; but I think we will not have to wait very long before we get sufficient experience of the new company to realise that this kind of tightening up of the insurance business&mdash;the amalgamation of four companies, and the abolition of four separate offices in one town or city&mdash;is going to mean a considerable amount of disemployment. If those people are to be disemployed they ought to get decent compensation, but to pay a man with ten years' service merely ten months' salary&mdash;and the bulk of them, mind you, will not get more than that&mdash;does not seem to me to be treating those agents fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his approach to the whole matter, the Minister has apparently given his consent to an arrangement by which very substantial compensation is being <Col N="92" /> afforded to directors and executives on the one hand, while inadequate compensation is being given to agents on the other hand.  We had an assurance from the Minister on the previous Bill that he would not give his imprimatur to a scheme which did not provide reasonable compensation for the agents, but it cannot be contended that giving a man four weeks' pay for a year's service is adequate compensation, particularly for a man who has followed the insurance business, and who under this scheme of insurance administration is going to find it harder than ever to get back into the insurance business with the throwback from this new company.  We ought to have from the Minister some information as to why this discrepancy in the basis of compensation was consented to by him.  I should like to know, Sir, from you whether it is permissible for a member of the House to submit amendments to this Bill in such a manner as to alter the schedule to this agreement.  We are being asked in this Bill to vote State money, and we ought to be able to amend this schedule in such a way as to ensure that that State money will not be utilised on the one hand for paying excessively generous compensation, while on the other hand it is withheld from paying reasonable compensation to persons less favourably placed.  I should like to know, therefore, whether you, Sir, would rule that amendments to alter this schedule can be moved by individual Deputies, or whether, if that is not practicable, it will be necessary to endeavour to defeat the section which gives legislative sanction to the schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in discussing this measure which will be present, I am sure, to every Deputy's mind when he examines it, because we really have no alternative to accepting this agreement.  It is an agreement which has been entered into by four companies, presumably with the consent of the Minister.  There could scarcely be a more unsatisfactory method of doing business, because, while we are committed to acceptance of this agreement, even the Minister, I am quite sure, has not the faintest knowledge of what sum of money the <Col N="93" /> State is being committed to in this transaction.  If we take even the case which has been mentioned by Deputy Norton, and I presume that he spoke without any inner knowledge, it is possible that the same scale of remuneration for their directors did not operate in the case of each one of those companies. If Deputies will take the trouble to look up the capital subscribed in each case, they will find that there is a very considerable difference. The total capital invested in those four companies is something under £90,000, I think.  One of those companies has something like £45,000 paid up.  It by no means follows that the company which has the most capital paid up has been the most successful or the best managed.  While the Minister devoted some of his remarks to the insurance industry as such, the House is not in possession of any information of any kind to show in what respect this country has benefited in any way by reason of the flotation and the business of the Irish insurance companies.  It may, but we have never heard of it. In the normal working of insurance business, the major sums of money expended are in respect of agents or collectors, or other people of that sort.  You go from them into the offices, and in what are described as the foreign insurance offices, I suppose a percentage of those employed are Irish.  I do not suppose there is a foreign collector employed by any of these outside companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet been told by the Minister, nor have I learned from any other source, what precise national advantage the country derived by reason of the inauguration of these national insurance companies or Irish insurance companies.  I infer from what the Minister stated that money has been lost in this insurance business and that, so far as the Dáil and the State are concerned, they have accepted one principle, that the policy-holders will not be at any loss; that the State is prepared to put up whatever money is necessary to safeguard the policy-holders.  What it will cost nobody knows.  We have no idea of what it will cost us, but that it will cost us something we may all assume. We would not have the elaborate <Col N="94" /> machinery of the Minister for Finance taking up shares in the company if it were not in contemplation that we were going to be in for some of the cost.  On that examination, although some one or two or three of these companies may have been a success, taking them all round they have been a failure from the point of view of a balance sheet.  That is all that can be said in respect of Irish experience in the last ten or 15 years in connection with insurance business.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to pay for that in so far as the policy-holders are concerned, but I think that the Dáil is entitled to know what compensation is being paid in actual cash to these directors.  Whether it is their fault or their misfortune, they are, in bulk, the people who have lost our money or lost the money of the policy-holders so that they are not in a position to make good what their tables or advertisements or attractions offered to the public.  It may be that we are doing good business in getting rid of them.  It may be that they deserve all that is going to be given to them.  But, so far as the House is concerned, it has to place the responsibility for that decision upon the Minister.  The Minister has made up his mind that that is the proper thing to do.  But I think he should  further and take the House into his confidence and let us know what the remuneration has been in respect of each director of these companies.  In the case of those which are solvent, they well deserve it.  It is an injustice and a misfortune that a company which is solvent and in a good position in doing its business and which had made good is, by reason of the weakness of other companies, now forced to come in and that the directors who have done so well have to go out of their employment.</P>
    <P>In so far as the general employment of the staff without particularisation is concerned, I say that if there is something like £430,000 of premium income to be collected, presumably much the same number of persons will be required to collect that in future.</P>
    <P>On the other question raised by the Minister, I can express no opinion; that is, the desirability of getting <Col N="95" /> non-Irish companies to join.  What I am concerned about very much is what the directorate of the new company is going to be.  I would be particularly nervous in respect of that directorate if it were to follow the line of the nominations which have been made by the Government in respect of other activities of a somewhat similar kind. Some 20 years or more ago when a proposal was made at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis that insurance should be started by Sinn Féin I opposed it.  I said I did not know anybody in this country who possessed the requisite knowledge and experience of this business to justify the public in putting their money at its disposal.  We had various phases of it.  There was, first of all, the collection.  That appeared to be easy, as people were accustomed to it, and a number of collectors had experience in other companies.  Then there was the central management.  That was not so easy, because there were not people with so much experience of it. Then there was the investment of the funds.  I do not know in connection with the insurance experience of those four companies or of the other companies which have not come in in what respect the real weakness has been discovered.  The Minister told us that the cost of collection, or whatever other term is applied to the expenses inseparable from the collection of premiums, was particularly high in this country.  I think he mentioned as a reason for that the smallness of our population.  I wonder if that has been the experience of the companies that are not of Irish origin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it that the company is overloaded with overhead expenses of one kind or another? Surely if there is only a small business done it could be arranged that the office work would not be so expensive as in the case of a large business?  I think it has transpired from the Banking Commission report that while the <Col N="96" /> general trend of commerce and manufacture has been towards large concerns, nevertheless there were small institutions capable of competing with the larger ones.  In any case, for whatever reason, the expenses were higher.  If that were due to defective management, if it were in any way the responsibility of the directorate, that was our misfortune and we have to pay for it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal concern of the Dáil is to see that the new directorate will be a qualified directorate, that there will not be merely political nominations. If my recollection is correct, there is certainly a very strong political tinge about the names mentioned in connection with the new directorate.  I venture to say that outside one, or possibly two, they have very little experience of insurance. My information is to the effect that one of them is not too well and consequently will not be able to act.  Will the Minister tell the House what is his view as to the real cause of the non-success of these companies?  Was it their inherent smallness?  Was it that the money which they had to invest was not well invested?  Or was it by reason of the lack of expert knowledge on the part of the management that the costs were rather higher than they might otherwise be?  Will he say, further, if he has any idea of what the compensating costs of this transaction are, as distinguished from the normal deficiency which has to be made up?  It is a very nice question whether there should or should not be a segregation of these two items.  If we regard it as our duty to wind up these companies, I should like to know whether the winding-up is not at the expense of the Irish investor.  If my recollection is correct, those who subscribed to the Irish insurance companies during the last 18 or 20 years were people who could ill afford to lose their money.  Will the State pay off these investors and seek shares subsequently in the new company?  Let me give an example of what I mean. Let us take a company with a capital of, say, £20,000.  Apart from the cost of the gratuity to the directors, that company is found, on examination of its position, to be worth £18,000.  That <Col N="97" /> is £2,000 short.  I presume that if there were 20,000 shares of £1 each, shareholders would get nine shares for every ten they formerly held.  But they happen to be responsible for paying off the directors.  That means, say, an addition of £3,000.  Does it follow from that that the shareholders are to be entitled to only £15,000 worth of shares in the new company and that, instead of getting nine out of ten shares, they will get only 15 out of 20?  I do not consider that that would be fair.</P>
    <P>I have no great gradh for this measure at all.  Somehow, I think it is not reasonable to ask the Dáil to pass a Bill like this when they do not know what the amount of money involved is.  We are committed to certain costs, but it is scarcely right, on our part, considering we have come in and regimented these people and told them that they have to join up, to put on them costs which may be unfair.  They may have agreed to it but, if so, they have agreed in a very peculiar fashion. The negotiators, in the course of the proceedings, assumed they had a right to do this and, in the operative part of the Bill which the Minister has introduced, he assumes the same right. While I am not disposed to agree entirely with what Deputy Norton has said, there is a great deal in his contention that the best part of this agreement has been made by the directors themselves.  There has been a statement that the employees would be fairly dealt with and it has been said that redundancy is not likely to arise. Suppose it does, what steps are to be taken to deal with it?  I do not think that any course is open to us except to accept the Bill, but it is a very unsatisfactory proceeding from beginning to end.  It was unreasonable to issue this Bill about a week ago, after the Dáil had been out of session for almost three months.  The agreement was entered into on 13th September, and surely a fortnight was quite sufficient for the legislative part of the work. Why could we not have had the Bill a fortnight ago?  It is a very complicated measure and one would require to be a lawyer as well as a business man to understand it in its entirety.  I <Col N="98" /> propose to support the Bill, but not with any enthusiasm.  The House should get more information.  The House should be told what the Bill is going to cost, and it should be told what compensation is to be paid to each of the individuals in questions.</P>

      <P>I want to assure Deputy Cosgrave that no policy-holder in any of the participating companies has lost any money or is losing any money and that no advertisement has been issued respecting policies which has not been carried out.  In 1936, an Insurance Bill was introduced and I make the statement without fear of contradiction, that no legislation in any country goes so far to protect policy-holders and the rights of the public in insurance as that Bill. The Irish insurance companies participating in this amalgamation could not carry on when the various parts of the 1936 Act would come into operation. But the Irish concerns were commercially sound propositions.  They might not have been actuarially sound, but the history of British insurance shows that it took from 30 years to 50 years to make concerns there actuarially sound.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of every policy taken out, there is a responsibility on the company to pay the required amount immediately in case of death.  The computation of actuarial solvency is based on that. Commercial solvency is based on the day-to-day work.  These companies were commercially sound and are commercially sound.  Therefore, I say it is a libel on these companies to say that any policy-holder taking up a policy in any of these four companies paid 1/- for which he was not fully guaranteed.  Then it is a question of what the State will lose.  The State will not lose a threepenny bit because of the compensation paid and the policy-holder will not lose anything because of the bonus paid.  That comes out of the assets of the participating companies.  I am saying this much in answer to Deputy Norton.  He talked <Col N="99" /> about thousands of pounds being divided between the directors.  That money only applies to the executors, and the sum is specifically mentioned there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to the managing directors and in one case it is specifically set out who are the executors. Deputy Cosgrave made a reference to what the State was going to lose.  I say that it is a gilt-edged investment for the State.  Whatever money the State puts into this investment is gilt-edged and the Minister for Finance has never made a better investment than this.  He has four companies with assets of practically £500,000. The British companies had a monopoly of Irish insurance.  I want to say this much now that, with limited resources, with limited capital and with limited subscribed capital the Irish companies had, all of them did trojan work.  They were up against English companies in the field.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the time of Sinn Féin.  I would remind Deputy Cosgrave that the appeal that time was to support everything Irish and people invested in Irish companies for patriotic reasons even though offered better terms by English and other companies.  Against that opposition the Irish companies have survived. Leaving out altogether the question of the directorate I say here that you have as good a staff in the Irish companies as the executive staff in the offices anywhere else in the world.  I do sincerely hope that if English companies do come in&mdash;I am sure the Minister will see that they do&mdash;that the Irish executive staff will not be crushed out. These men, up to very recently, all worked for very little.  While the companies were being built up their salaries were very small.  They had every inducement to go to English or foreign companies but they did not go. Many of them were in foreign companies and came in and worked for the <Col N="100" /> Irish companies at the time of Sinn Féin when these companies were first started.  I hope now that in this national scheme that everybody concerned will see to it that the existing staff are not pushed off.  I fully recognise that when big companies like the Prudential or the Refuge come into the amalgamation&mdash;with far greater business each of them than the combined four Irish offices together&mdash;they will fight for complete control.  It is only natural that they should.  I hope when that day comes that the men who, with very small salaries, worked so hard for the last 15 years will not be crushed out.  I do not intend to repeat what I said in the beginning of my remarks&mdash;that these four companies though not actuarially sound in 1936 would in ten years be found, each of them, actuarially sound and in a lesser period one of them would be actuarially sound.  I want to stress to the House that when this Act begins to operate it will be for the benefit of the policy-holders and I hope that the employees who have made such a good job of Irish insurance will find that their services will be continued while fit for service.</P>

I am not taking into consideration at all the opinion of the directors.  What I want is the opinion of the experts who are, as Deputy Kennedy admits, called upon every five years to report on the future of these companies.

I have no objection personally to reasonable compensation being paid to the directors of a company if that company is solvent or actuarially sound.  I share the view of my colleagues and their strong objection to this generous measure of compensation being provided for the directors of a company, if the company is, at the moment, in a semi-insolvent or insolvent state.  Deputy Norton has covered the ground from that point of view fairly fully and I wait with interest the Minister's reply to some of the questions in connection with the matter of compensation which Deputy Norton has asked him to answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with one aspect of this Bill.  It is a very difficult Bill to construe, by reason of the fact that all the important matters with which we have to deal are contained in the Deed of Agreement which is in the Schedule.  There is one aspect of the Bill which I think is appropriate for discussion at this time, because it concerns the general policy of the Bill.  As I understand this Bill, it is one of a series of legislative proposals which we have had in this country during recent years under which the Government for the time <Col N="103" /> being departmentalises, if I may use the expression, certain public services in the State.  It is insurance in this case.  It was the supply of electricity in another and, to a minor extent, the amalgamation of the railways in yet another.  What we have to guard against in this country, particularly in the setting-up of these various organisations, is peaceful penetration from outside.  In this case it is the amalgamated company.  I refer now to the company that is called the Terminating Company.  The question of the directors of this company, the persons who are to guide the policy of this company, is in my opinion a most important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to ascertain who are the persons entitled to be directors, one has to look to the agreement in the Schedule and to that portion dealing with the Articles and Memorandum of Association of the Terminating Company. I have no objection, if you like, to one non-citizen of this State being a member of the board of directors by reason of his international reputation as an expert, but as the matter stands at present, nine directors are permissible and four of these are entitled to be citizens of a State other than our own.  In a matter of this kind, I think it is not a question of the majority of the directors being nationals of this State; I think practically all the directors should be.  That is an aspect of the Bill which I should like to place before the Minister.  I realise the difficult position in which he finds himself.  Four companies have met together and they have presented him with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  He has undertaken to give legislative effect to that in the Dáil and to make any alteration now in the Deed itself would involve his going back to the companies and getting their consent to such alteration in the Deed.  I do submit, however, that we should not accept the principle here that in undertakings of this character, which after all are of a semi-State character, there may be four directors who are not citizens of this State.  The same remarks apply equally to any other service such as the Electricity Supply Board, the railways, etc.  It is not in any spirit of criticism of the <Col N="104" /> arrangement that has been come to that I make these remarks.  I realise that the Minister must have had great difficulty in arriving at an agreement with the various parties and interests concerned.  It is merely because I do not like this principle being accepted by this House that I make these few remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point upon which I should like to get some information.  I did get a certain amount of information from Deputy Kennedy but his was about the naïvest explanation I ever heard.  He attempted to show that the State was entering into a gilt-edged investment. He said that the State would be under no liability as regards compensation because compensation would come out of the assets of the participating companies. If Deputy Kennedy had read the Agreement and then read section 5, which provides for the payment of money by the Minister for Finance, he would find that the Minister for Finance advances money to the Terminating Company to make up a deficiency, a deficiency of any one of the participating companies.  The deficiency is ascertained by a formula in the agreement, signed by the directors of the companies and the formula sets out as an equation, the net assets of the Participating Company divided by the liability of the Participating Company, multiplied by the goodwill.  Now the compensation payable to the directors comes out of the assets of the Participating Company, and if that causes a deficiency, then it is the money advanced by the State that will meet that deficiency.  If there was no deficiency no money would be required from the State.  If the company was in a position to meet any demand for compensation and there was no deficiency no money would be required from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance will advance a certain amount to the company if there is a deficiency and in return he will get shares.  The only assurance that this House has, <Col N="105" /> on being asked to invest public moneys in this company, or to give public moneys to a participating company, is Deputy Kennedy's statement that it is a gilt-edged investment.  We have been asked to vote this money on the assurance that this is a gilt-edged investment. Now if the participating companies were such a gilt-edged investment, there would be no necessity for this legislation at all.  This House would not be asked to guarantee the compensation because it would come out of the assets of the participating companies.  Everything that comes out of the assets reduces the assets and possibly increases the deficiency.  The money the State is asked to provide is the deficiency between the assets and the liabilities.  I should like to know from the Minister if he can give us any indication of what the amount of money required by Section 5 is likely to be.  Further, if he cannot give us that information, he can tell us what is the relation between the amount of money to be advanced under Section 5 and the amount of the shares the Minister for Finance will get in the participating companies because there is a provision in the agreement which says that the Minister for Finance will get all these shares with voting powers. The agreement says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In consideration of the Minister for Finance having undertaken the liability for the deficiency and having taken the necessary steps to render the amalgamation possible&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;by advancing the money if there is a deficiency&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and bring it about, the Terminating Company shall allot to the Minister for Finance or his nominee all the B shares&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;which carry voting powers&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and such number of A shares of 2/- each as shall be equal to whichever be the lesser of (a) 99,900 shares, and (b) 5 per cent. of the total issued capital of the Terminating Company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister if it is possible that the amount required from the Minister for Finance to make up the deficiency would be twice as much as the value of the 99,900 &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares or the 5 per cent., or would it <Col N="106" /> be ten times as much.  The Minister can get whichever is the lesser&mdash;the 99,900 shares or 5 per cent. of the total issued capital of the Terminating Company. In either case it is not a very large amount of money, but can the Minister give us any indication at all as to how much money is likely to be required, and that will have to be voted by this House in order to implement Section 5?  Secondly, taking the present position of the four participating companies, how much money will be required by the fact that in this agreement arrangements have been made for the payment of fairly large sums to the directors of the various companies?  If, as Deputy Kennedy says, the whole thing is going to be such a gilt-edged investment for the State, and if the State is not going to lose anything on the 99,900 2¾ per cent &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares or on the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares&mdash;if, as the Deputy would lead us to believe, the position of these companies in the future is going to be as commercially sound and as rosy as they are actuarially sound&mdash;I find it very hard to see why any of them should want to amalgamate or want legislation of this sort at all.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill to implement an agreement already arrived at, an agreement which cannot be altered or changed. It says that the Minister shall do certain things.  It lays down that the Minister for Finance shall advance certain sums of money.  It lays down the compensation that the directors shall get on the termination of their employment and the compensation which other employees shall get.  Before committing myself to vote for this measure, I should like to know from the Minister, first of all, what amount of money will be required from the Minister for Finance; secondly, what proportion does that bear to what the Terminating Company will give in shares or share values, and, thirdly, what proportion of that is rendered necessary by the fact that compensation is arranged for the directors in this agreement.</P>

It is obvious that the Chair <Col N="107" /> could not, in advance, give a decision as to probable rulings on amendments not yet submitted.  However, it was to a matter of principle that Deputy Norton directed his question.

      <P>I would ask you for a ruling on this point.  It looks to me from this agreement, to which the Minister for Finance is also a party, that the deficiency to be made good by the State will be paid out of the Central Fund, and I presume that the passage of the Money Resolution on this Bill will be the authority for the State to finance the deficiency in this company.  To that extent, therefore, I submit that the House is really voting money to finance this company, and I think it is rather unusual if a Deputy in the House has not the opportunity of deciding by means of an amendment in what way the State's money is to be directed in the payment of compensation to the directors and employees of the company.  If it be possible, I urge that members should be permitted to submit amendments because the State is going into this thing and is committing itself to an unknown and an unnamed amount.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this procedure is not unprecedented. We have had many such measures in the past when the House took agreements as a whole or rejected them.

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy inquired why it was not possible to get an amalgamation scheme covering all the Irish offices.  I do not think it would be practicable in the time available to me, or in fairness to all concerned, to express an opinion upon that matter at any length.  I regret that the agreement before the House does not provide for the amalgamation of all the Irish offices, but I am not without hope that the provisions of the Bill, which permit of other companies participating in the amalgamation, may yet be availed of so as to bring about a complete amalgamation of industrial insurance business here.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the difficulty which he had in discussing the Bill while negotiations were proceeding with the British companies carrying on industrial business here with a view to their participating in the amalgamation and transferring their existing business in this country to the new company.  The principle of amalgamating all industrial insurance offices was approved of by the Dáil in 1936.  In fact the Act which was passed in 1936 contained provisions to facilitate any such amalgamation, and discussions have been proceeding not merely between the Irish offices but between my Department and the English offices concerned since then. I am confident that the British companies concerned may yet participate in the amalgamation.  I do not think that the fact that no formal agreement has yet been made need deter the House from discussing the Bill frankly. In fact, the enactment of this Bill by the House is a necessary preliminary step to the conclusion of negotiations with the British companies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked how long it was intended that the temporary company, as he called it, would remain in existence, and if it was the intention of the Government that power to direct the policy of the Terminating Company would remain indefinitely in the hands of the Government, or would eventually be transferred from the hands of the Government to private interests.  I do not think the Deputy <Col N="109" /> quite understands the machinery of the Bill.  The Terminating Company, which is to be set up, will operate until all its liabilities have been discharged. It might be said, although it would be entirely incorrect, that that period represents the longest period that any person holding a policy in an Irish Company is likely to live.  That statement will give an indication of the length of time it will probably take to clear off all the liabilities of the Terminating Company, and when these have been liquidated it will then have fulfilled its functions.  The permanent company will remain permanently in existence doing new business, and the position in which effective supervision over its policy can be exercised by the Government will continue, so far as this Government is concerned, indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I do not want to lay down policy in this regard for many years in the future, but I cannot see circumstances arising in which any Government which may hold office here will consider it good policy to sell its interest in that company to private parties. There were many references to the provision of the agreement in connection with the compensation to directors of the amalgamated companies, and to the provision for the staffs of the amalgamated companies.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with these matters it is necessary to make the minds of a number of Deputies clear as to what precisely the agreement in the Bill provides.  Deputy Linehan is doubtful whether the shares which will be transferred to the Minister for Finance will be valuable assets.  The Deputy said he was not prepared to take Deputy Kennedy's assurance in that regard.  I am not asking him to take Deputy Kennedy's assurance.  I am asking him to use his own common sense on the question.  Here is a company which will be operating a closed fund.  It will undertake no new business at all; it will have transferred to it the liabilities of the amalgamated companies, and, as against the liabilities, assets to cover them in full.  I think it is clear that in the course of time the shares of that company will <Col N="110" /> acquire a substantial value, so clear, in fact, that in another connection I have officially committed myself to recognise that.  The fact that they have a nominal value of two shillings is of no significance.  As I explained, the reason for putting the nominal value low as against items in the balance sheet of the company is that goodwill items must appear; but it is hoped that in the process of time that goodwill will be eliminated.  As time proceeds, the value of the shares will grow.  Clearly, the company could operate a policy which would enhance their value rapidly, but it would do so at the expense of the policy-holders. I do not expect it will follow such a policy.  I hope it will not.  But, even by a policy operated in the interest of the policy-holders, a substantial accumulation of assets could be expected, assuming that the company is well and properly managed, and I have no reason to expect the contrary.  The Minister for Finance gets these shares in consideration of the amount advanced by him against the deficiencies of any of the amalgamating companies. In addition to the shares that he gets in consequence of the advance, he gets the 100,000 shares which caused Deputy Linehan some concern. These other shares amount to 100,000, or five per cent., whichever is the lesser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to consult those who put that interpretation on it, and he will not have to go very far for expert advice.  Many questions have arisen as to the actual position of the companies amalgamating. It is impossible to say to what extent their funds are deficient until the test provided for in the agreement has been applied.  It is known that some, at least, of the companies will show a deficiency under that test, and that they will be unable to transfer assets equivalent to the liabilities transferred.  It does not follow, as Deputy Cosgrave assumed, that the policy holders of the companies have lost anything yet.  What does follow is that there is reasonable assumption they will lose if ordinary expectations in that regard are realised.  The solvency of insurance companies is based on two calculations, one relating to the earning powers of the assets, and the other to the expectation of life of human beings.  The liabilities are calculated <Col N="112" /> on certain expectations of life, and the assets are valued, having regard to a certain percentage of returns which might be anticipated.</P>
      <P>On that basis a company could show a deficiency while still able to meet liabilities arising without undue difficulty.  Most insurance companies, in fact, for a substantial period at the beginning of their career are in the position of having an actuarial deficiency while able to meet current outgoings without difficulty.  Deputy Cosgrave was also confused as to the relationship of the paid up capital of the companies to the assets.  Their assets are, of course, substantially in excess of paid up capital, even in cases where companies have a substantial paid up capital.  The amount of money which it is anticipated will be required to meet the deficiency is about £500,000.  That was the maximum amount provided in the 1936 Act and I think will be the maximum. There is no relationship between figures of that kind and the total subscribed capital of the participating companies.  They will be transferring assets of substantial magnitude, even though these assets are less by £500,000 than the liabilities transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amalgamation was considered necessary in 1936 first because of the provisions of the 1936 Act and their probable reactions on insurance business here, and secondly because of the known weakness of the Irish companies, a weakness which was bound to become greater when the onerous provisions of the 1936 Act came into operation.  It was the fact that it was known that these provisions were about to come into operation, together with the additional powers given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the 1936 Act to wind up insolvent companies, that produced this agreement although it must not be assumed from that that all the companies participating in the amalgamation are insolvent at present.  That would not be the case, but the companies concerned, facing the coming into operation of the provisions of the 1936 Act, designed to protect policy-holders, and knowing that the conduct <Col N="113" /> of their business was going to be more difficult and more expensive, agreed to participate in this amalgamation. Remember it is in a sense a voluntary amalgamation.  There were other courses open to each of the companies concerned: they could have faced a winding up.  It might have been in the interests of the shareholders of these companies to have wound them up rather than to participate in the amalgamation, although I think if any such course had been contemplated by the companies concerned we would have had to face the question whether we were not obliged to bring to the Dáil legislation which would secure that the assets would be available for the policy-holders in priority to the shareholders.  However, the question does not arise now and consequently we are presented with this agreement, an agreement of which I have approved.  I do not want to give the impression that it was merely a case of the companies coming together of themselves and presenting an agreement which I approved.  Right at the very start of the business I told the companies the kind of agreement I would approve of and that it was useless for them to submit any other kind and, consequently, it was on the basis of the intimation of the nature of the agreement I contemplated, given in 1936, that the companies worked.</P>
    <P>Now, they have provided for compensation for their directors upon terms which some Deputies consider generous. I have no particular desire to defend and certainly no desire to criticise the directors of these companies.  Some of these companies had unfortunate experiences. Their boards did not always act wisely in their interests but it would, I think, be wrong to assume that the existing directors are in any case those responsible for the weakened positions in which they now find themselves. In fact, in the case of some of these companies, even those that show an actuarial deficiency and which can be said to be weak, the existing directors stepped in when conditions were much worse and have succeeded in keeping them off the rocks even if they did not get them floating safely in calm waters.</P>
    <P>It is correct that the provision of <Col N="114" /> that compensation is at the expense of the shareholders of the company.  It is quite true that the more that is given in compensation the greater is the deficiency that will be shown and, consequently, the greater the amount that the Minister for Finance will have to provide, but, against what the Minister for Finance provides, there come shares in the Terminating Company, shares which would otherwise go to the participating companies and be available as assets for the benefit of the shareholders of those companies.  It is on that account necessary to emphasise that these shares have a real value.  As Deputies are aware, some of these participating companies have carried on or are carrying on other forms of insurance business and will perhaps remain in existence for the purpose of conducting these other forms of insurance business and, in that connection, because of the provisions of the 1936 Act, there arose for me a question for decision as to whether the available assets would be sufficient to justify me in giving a licence&mdash;a licence which would be required under the 1936 Act &mdash;to carry on these other forms of insurance business.  I decided and, I think, properly decided, that we could regard those shares as having a definite value which would have to be taken into account in determining the extent of the total assets available for the purpose of enabling the companies to undertake these other forms of business.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made to the directors to be appointed to the new companies.  The names of certain persons appeared in the newspapers and in that connection I would like to make the position clear to Deputies.  I start off by reminding them that there are two companies&mdash;the Terminating Company, which has been brought into existence, and the Permanent Company, which has not yet been brought into existence.  The persons whose names appeared in the newspapers will be directors of the Terminating Company. That company will not be conducting insurance business.  It will be conserving its assets.  The actual conduct of the business relating to the policies transferred to it will be done by the Permanent Company as agents for the <Col N="115" /> Terminating Company.  The main function of the board of that company will be to safeguard its assets, to look after the investment of the funds and generally, to see that its business is safely and properly conducted.  The persons whose names appeared in the paper do not represent the full board of that company.  The full board has not yet been appointed and, of course, nobody has yet been nominated for the board of the permanent company that will be carrying on insurance business in the future.  I think it will be desirable to have associated with the direction of these companies persons who have got experience in the insurance business, but one could exaggerate to a very great extent the importance or the desirability of confining membership of the boards to persons with such experience.</P>
    <P>As regards the employees, I think Deputy Norton was quite unfair in his remarks.  We are proposing here that all employees of the existing companies who can be fairly said to be depending for their livelihood upon the insurance business are going to remain in that business.  Those employees are not being offered the alternative of work or compensation or, if they are, it is an alternative for themselves to choose. Every person who has been earning more than 20/- a week, who has more than two years' connection with the insurance business or is under 60 years of age, is offered employment.  He may choose to accept compensation, but, if he elects to take employment, employment cannot be refused to him &mdash;employment at the same remuneration as he is now getting.  In order to ensure that there will be no subsequent victimisation of these persons a board of referees is provided for and the scheme of amalgamation ensures that none of these persons who will be transferred to the new company can be dismissed for redundancy.  They may be dismissed for other reasons, but if there is any doubt as to whether other reasons existed or not&mdash;any doubt in the mind of the employee as to whether or not redundancy was responsible for his dismissal&mdash;he has an <Col N="116" /> appeal as against his managers to this board of referees.  I think the scheme, therefore, provides adequate safeguards to ensure that none of these employees will be put out of the insurance business because of the amalgamation scheme.  That does mean inevitably that the new company will have surplus staff.  They will have to carry for a long period of time a much larger staff than would ordinarily be necessary.  Deputy Cosgrave assumed that adding the business of company A to company B and company D would involve also the adding of their staffs in order to carry on that business. That is not so.  In fact, one of the advantages of the amalgamation is that it makes possible a reduction of the working expense ratio.  The trouble with these companies, as with all small companies, and not merely in Ireland, but elsewhere, is that their working expense ratio is too high.  That has been the difficulty of these companies here.  In insurance it is a fact that close alliance is a source of strength, and by this amalgamation it is hoped it will be possible not merely to reduce the expense ratio but also to bring into full operation the safeguards against the abuses of the past which the 1936 Act provided for and institute a system of operation which will eliminate the cause of those abuses.  The cause was the intense competition between rival companies.  The reduction of that intense competition reduced the abuses and the elimination of the abuses involves the elimination of the competition. That is why we set out to secure this amalgamation.  I hope we will be successful.  At any rate, we are going to create an organisation&mdash;it may not be the only organisation&mdash;but it will so predominate in this field that it will be effectively able to ensure that only proper methods of business may be resorted to.</P>

      <P>Everybody.  Deputy Cosgrave raised a very big question when he asked in what way this country gained by the establishment of Irish insurance companies.  I would not like to discuss that here and now. Apart from the question whether it is better to have industrial assurance carried on by Irish instead of English companies, there is no doubt it is best to have it carried out by one office. The experience of this country and every other country has been that undue competition between competing organisations in the matter of industrial assurance leads to abuse, abuse which has called forth many enactments, not merely here but elsewhere.  We are going to get that amalgamation to a very great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, Deputy Esmonde's remark calls for attention. He referred to what he described as peaceful penetration.  I do not know if he is using that phrase in the sense in which it used to be used, implying a gradual incursion of a British or other foreign interest in our affairs.  It does not apply in this case, because we hope that there will be transferred to this Irish company the industrial assurance business that is now carried <Col N="118" /> on by the number of British offices here.</P>
    <P>Various questions were asked which might well be postponed to the Committee Stage.  Deputy Davin asked about the shares in a Northern insurance company owned by one of the amalgamating companies, and which are not being transferred.  I do not want to deal with that matter at any length, but we do not think that these shares represent a desirable asset to have transferred to the amalgamated company, for reasons on which I would rather not dilate at the moment.</P>
    <P>Some comparison was made between the provisions for the compensation of directors and executives, and the provisions for the compensation of staffs. There is a fundamental difference in each case.  In connection with the staffs, we are giving them not merely the right to compensation, but the right to employment.  The directors and executives are being given no such right.  If they did get corresponding employment in either the terminating or the permanent company, then the amount of compensation to which they are entitled is reduced, or they get no compensation at all.  They are given no such right to employment as members of the staffs are given and, consequently, there is not a useful basis for effective comparison between the two provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the case of certain employees in an insurance company who have already lost their employment.  I do not think he was quite clear as to the circumstances of the case he referred to.  I am familiar with the case.  One of the companies participating in the amalgamation scheme carried on, in addition to life assurance business, a general insurance business.  It is true that the 1936 Act made it illegal for any company to carry on, at the same time, both life insurance and the industrial assurance business.  It is also true that portion of the 1936 Act has not yet been brought into operation.</P>
    <P>This company, possibly in anticipation of that, and possibly in anticipation of transferring its life assurance business under this scheme, decided to <Col N="119" /> dispose of its general insurance business to another Irish office.  It did so. It was a voluntary arrangement on its part, and I do not think we could accept liability for any of the members of the staff which the company to which its business was transferred did not choose to take into their employ. It was open to that company to have disposed of its life assurance business under this scheme, and continue to carry on the general insurance business. It did not choose to do that.  It is quite clear that it is not a matter that arises on this Bill, nor would it be in any sense equitable to impose against the life funds of these companies a charge for the compensation of these employees.</P>
    <P>I do not think there were any other points that I would like to deal with at this stage.  We will have an opportunity of considering the various sections in detail on the Committee Stage.  The Bill has apparently been approved of in principle by the members of the House, and I think we can deal more effectively with matters of detail on the next stage.</P>

      <P>I have gone carefully into paragraphs 25 and 26 of the agreement, and I would ask the Minister to read them and see if there is not an entire ambiguity; there is <Col N="120" /> the same consideration for two different things.  First of all, it is specified that in consideration of the payment of money to make up the deficiency, the Minister will get so many shares, and, pending the final ascertainment, there shall be allotted to the Minister only 60 per cent. of the shares to which he would be entitled under the provisional valuation. In the next paragraph it is provided that in consideration of the very same thing, plus taking the necessary steps to render the amalgamation possible and to bring it about the Terminating Company shall allot to the Minister all the B shares and such of the A shares of 2/- each as shall be equal to whichever be the lesser of 99,900 shares or 5 per cent. of the total issued capital.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose for which this Bill was introduced was to make provision for holidays with pay similar to that contained in the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, and the Shops Act of this year for those workers not covered by these two earlier Acts.  In connection with the drafting of the Bill, however, it became clear that it was desirable to repeal the holidays provisions of the 1936 Act and to re-enact them here in somewhat amended form, firstly, for the sake of clarity and, secondly, for the purpose of effecting some amendment in the provisions of the 1936 Act.  Consequently, the Bill before the House is one designed to insure that all workers, with certain exceptions named, will be entitled to annual holidays with pay other than those provided for under the Shops Act of this year.  It was found that it was not desirable to include the shop workers in this Bill also for various reasons, the principal reason being that we had not yet sufficient experience of the operation of that Act to know to what extent amendment was desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, is a comprehensive measure.  It is introduced to implement the Government's programme of improving the conditions of employment of workers.  The first Act of the kind was that introduced in 1936 and it was followed by the Shops (Condi <Col N="123" /> tions of Employment) Act of this year which related to shop workers.  In considering this programme, it will, I think, be agreed that it is desirable to have as far as possible uniform and equitable treatment for all classes of workers.  I think it will be readily appreciated by the House that it was a very difficult task to insure the realisation of that ideal because of the wide variety of occupations dealt with and the different circumstances under which workers have to work.  However, the main idea was to give to every worker a statutory right to one week's holiday with pay in each year.  If it were possible to arrange it, all workers would also get the right to holidays with pay on six public holidays, but everybody will agree that unless some classes of workers are employed on a public holiday, a free holiday for the others is not of very great benefit to them.  In fact, in the nature of things, a holiday for many people means increased work for many other people.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of domestic servants of whom it is estimated about 90,000 will benefit by the provisions of this Act.  It was necessary to consider, and to consider very carefully, what was the best course to adopt for them. Many of them reside where they work and have no other homes.  If the employers of these workers were obliged to send them away for a couple of weeks' holiday, the workers might have no place to go during that period. These cases are mentioned merely for the purpose of indicating the points which had to be examined, but as far as possible all circumstancees have been looked into, and the Bill, it is hoped, will be regarded as a fair solution of the problems inherent in carrying out a scheme of the kind.  I submit the Bill as the Government's solution of these problems and I can say now that I am quite willing, and, in fact, anxious, to have the assistance of Deputies of other Parties in examining the measure and in effecting changes which, in the opinion of the majority of the House, may be necessary in order to make it more effective, or to eliminate the possibility of evasion or abuse.</P>
    <P>As for the Bill itself, the workers <Col N="124" /> coming within its scope are divided into two main classes, namely, non-domestic workers and domestic workers. We have defined the domestic worker in the Bill as a worker who is either entitled under his contract of service to free lodging either in his employer's house or elsewhere, and does work of a personal or domestic character in or about the dwellinghouse of his employer.  All other workers are described for the purposes of the Bill as non-domestic workers.  The non-domestic worker will be entitled to seven consecutive days' leave, including a Sunday, if he fulfils the same conditions as those laid down for industrial workers in the 1936 Act, namely, that he has been continuously employed for not less than 1,800 hours in his employment year.  As in the 1936 Act, also, where a worker's employment ceases before the end of his employment year, a day's pay will be given in respect of each two months' employment during which he has worked 300 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister speaks of domestic workers, he uses the phrase &ldquo;his employer.&rdquo;  Does this not apply to women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  I will use the term &ldquo;his or her&rdquo; if the Deputy prefers, but it is shorter to use the word &ldquo;his.&rdquo;  A day's pay will be granted to a person who has been employed for not less than a month and has worked not less than 150 hours in that month; but over a longer period it works out as a day's pay for two months' work.  The qualifying period to which I have referred may be altered by regulation.  As the Bill stands, young persons under 18 years of age can qualify for leave by working shorter periods, but I propose to amend the Bill in Committee by confining that to industrial workers.  The Act of 1936 dealt with the hours of employment of industrial workers and, consequently it is necessary to make special provision, in relation to the holiday part of that Act, to deal with the case of juvenile workers whose hours were limited by another part of the Bill to 40 hours per week as against the 48 hours per week permitted in the case of other workers.  In the case of <Col N="125" /> the non-industrial workers who are covered by this Bill there is no limitation in this Bill of their hours of work and, consequently, we will have the same provisions relating to the qualifications for holiday pay or holidays in the case of juvenile workers as in the case of adult workers.</P>
      <P>The principle of the employment year&mdash;a device which was adopted during the passage of the 1936 Act through Committee here&mdash;has proved very satisfactory in practice and, consequently, is adopted in this Bill.  The employment year is a period of 365 days, commencing on the day upon which the worker last entered his employment or any anniversary of that date.  Six public holidays are fixed in the Bill, namely, Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter Monday, Whit Monday, and the first Monday in August.  Certain Church holidays may be substituted for any of these days other than Christmas Day and St. Patrick's Day.  Industrial workers who are prohibited by the 1936 Act from working on a public holiday retain their rights under that Act in regard to payment for those days. Other non-domestic workers who do not work on a public holiday must get a day's pay therefor.  Such workers who work on a public holiday and do not get at least 25 per cent. above the normal rate of pay must get a day in lieu thereof within a month or an additional day added to their annual leave.  The qualification for holiday pay is that the worker has worked not less than 150 hours during the five weeks immediately preceding the public holiday.  A worker will get payment for a public holiday, even if he is dismissed before that day, provided that he has worked the number of hours mentioned, in the five weeks immediately preceding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned that we are repealing the corresponding provisions of the 1936 Act and re-enacting them here.  There are certain reasons for that which I have mentioned briefly, and which, perhaps, I should refer to in greater detail.  Certain classes of industrial workers did not get the benefits given by that Act to other workers, and which it was intended <Col N="126" /> they should get, because of defects in some of its provisions.  For instance, industrial workers who are prohibited from being employed on a public holiday got no compensation in respect of that day.  Again, a worker may be working on that holiday and get no compensation.  It has also come under notice that some employers have taken advantage of some of the provisions of the 1936 Act in order to deprive workers of benefits to which they are entitled.  Sub-section 5 of Section 49 of that Act provides, among other things, that a worker must be in the employment of the employer on the working day next before the public holiday concerned, and must have worked in such employment not less than 20 hours during the six working days next preceding that day.  By simply dismissing workers a day or two before a public holiday, some employers were depriving their workers of public holiday pay although the workers concerned had fulfilled the main conditions of payment.  At Christmas time, when two public holidays occurred, that method was adopted in some cases.  I should like to say, however, that that has not been the general practice with employers, or that employers, as a class, have tried to evade their obligations. On the contrary, employers as a class have entered into the spirit of the legislation and have co-operated with the Department in making that legislation effective An effort, however, is made in the Bill to remedy an abuse, if it may be so termed, of the character to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It was considered desirable, also, to clarify the position of workers who normally work a five-day week, a form of employment which is found in many industries.  Taking all these factors into consideration, it was decided to bring industrial workers into this Bill and to repeal the provisions of the 1936 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It means that the non-working day cannot be a public holiday or a substituted public holiday. A separate section had to be introduced with regard to the public holidays for industrial workers, as set out in Section 7 of the 1936 Act, where the ordinary six-day-a-week workers get a week's pay when a public holiday occurs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it became clear from our administration of the 1936 Act that some provision must be made to deal with workers who normally work a five-day week and get a week's pay for a five-day week. Their position was dubious and some section must be put in to deal with them.  However, I think that we can deal more fully on the Committee Stage with the type of section that would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there are industries where the normal week is five days.  In fact, there are industries where, by Government regulation, a five-day week is the maximum of work, and consequently special provision <Col N="128" /> must be made for workers employed in such industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>One can visualise a situation whereby an employer&mdash;I am not suggesting that all employers would do it&mdash;might take advantage of this section to work his men only five days.  On Saturday a man usually works three or four hours, and an employer might evade his obligation by putting a man on five days and cutting out his half day.  Some of them might do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  I am not dealing with the case of the short week. I am dealing with an industry where a 40-hour or 42-hour week has either been imposed by legislation or is generally worked by agreement.  In cases of certain industries that 40 hours' work may be secured by a five-day week, and in other cases by a shorter working day.  In the case of the five-day worker some special provision will have to go in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable number of workers are working a five-day week owing to depression in the industry, as in the case of the railways for instance.  They are going to be penalised by this as against the advantage they had under the 1936 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot work a full week.  They can only work five days, and they are going to suffer another penalty under this.  They do not get a week's pay.  They only get five days' pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing, I think, with the position of workers who qualified for public holiday pay, and did not get it because of defective provisions of the 1936 Act.  The change being made in this Bill will, I think, cover this by making it sufficient for a worker to have worked 150 hours at any time during the five weeks immediately preceding the public holiday, in lieu of the provisions of the 1936 Act to <Col N="129" /> which I have referred, namely that the worker should have worked on the day immediately preceding the public holiday, and for 20 hours in the preceding week.  There is, of course, in this Bill no prohibition against working on a public holiday, except in the case of industrial workers already prohibited under the relevant section of the 1936 Act.  That prohibition will still stand, and the workers prohibited from being employed will get paid for the public holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies who have read the Bill will have noted, a different system for granting leave is fixed for domestic workers as compared with non-domestic workers.  It is not proposed that those workers will get holidays with pay on public holidays.  Instead, they will get seven consecutive days' leave, which is called semi-annual leave in the Bill, for each half-year's employment during which the worker was employed for 150 days continuously. It is open to the employer to give the domestic worker the full 14 days together, and satisfy the requirements of a whole year.  It is necessary, I think, to stress that the seven days are in respect of a half year.  I notice that a prominent leader of women workers, Miss Bennett, during the past week published in the Press a protest against granting only seven days' annual leave for domestic workers, and she made a case for the granting of fourteen days.  In fact, Miss Bennett misread the Bill.  The Bill provides for 14 days' annual leave for domestic workers.  So as to meet the case of domestic workers whose conditions of service include board and lodging, the Bill provides that in addition to the ordinary pay such workers will get certain additional allowances set out in the Bill.  Furthermore, if the worker does not wish to go on leave he or she, with the consent of the employer, may remain at work, subject to the provision of the payment of double pay.  The usual provisions are made in the Bill for enforcement by inspectors of the Department, and by the worker himself, or by his trade union.  A special provision has been inserted, however, so that an inspector cannot enter a private dwellinghouse <Col N="130" /> for the purpose of enforcing the Act unless he has a special certificate.</P>
    <P>In the main, as Deputies will have noted, the Bill is similar to the two earlier measures which the House has already discussed and passed.  The changes are changes arising out of the different character of the employment which the persons covered by this Bill experience, as against those to whom the earlier Bills were confined.  We have excluded certain persons from this holiday legislation altogether.  I do not know that everybody will agree with our exclusions, but I think there is none of them in respect of which a good case cannot be made.  We have confined the Bill to workers of a certain class by fixing a maximum rate of remuneration and excluding from the Bill persons whose remuneration exceeds that maximum&mdash;£350 a year.  We have, of course, excluded from this Bill persons who are covered under the Shops Act, and also agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I think most Deputies will agree that it would be impossible to apply the provisions of this Bill to agricultural workers, or to those others who are mentioned here&mdash;sailors employed upon a sea-going vessel, a person employed in a lighthouse or lightship, members of religious orders, and, of course, also relatives of employers. The question of the relationship between workers and employers, and the extent to which it should be used to justify exemption from measures of this kind, was discussed before.  Deputies will have noted that the provision here is the same as in the Shops Act, or in the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  I do not know if any objection will be offered to the principle of the Bill.  I do not expect that there will be.  The Act of 1936 and the Shops Act, 1938, were accepted in principle by all Parties in the House, although we had considerable discussion on the details.  Those who accepted those Acts in principle will, I am sure, agree that their benefits should not be confined to the classes of workers to whom they related, and that similar benefits, at any rate in respect of annual leave and public holiday pay, should be conferred upon all other <Col N="131" /> classes of workers.  That is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there may be considerable difference of opinion as to the details of this measure.  I expect that there will be.  It was, in fact, a most difficult measure to prepare, and many of the provisions of the Bill were only inserted after fairly great hesitation. In other words, so many alternative courses of action offered themselves, all of which had something to recommend them, that it was very hard to make a clear decision as to which was best.  I am quite certain that the doubts which I had and other members of the Government had in the discussions which took place between myself and the officers of the Department concerning those details will be reproduced here, because the number of minds that will be brought to bear upon those details will probably indicate the number of different opinions which will exist as to how best those problems can be solved.  On those matters of detail I am prepared to accept the judgment of the House.  In fact, I will welcome the suggestions and criticisms of members, because I know only too well how elaborate measures of this kind can be made ineffective by defects in their phraseology or in the scheme of administration.  We have found those defects already in the 1936 Act, and, to the extent to which we have found them, we are remedying them, but the course of years will probably prove that we have not yet found them all, and that this Bill, no matter how carefully we attend to it, or how long it may take us to deal with the various sections of it, will also, in the course of time, prove to be defective in some regard.  I, therefore, would ask the House to regard it in a sense as a non-controversial measure so that we can get the same type of very useful discussion upon it as we had on the 1936 Act and the 1938 Shops Act, both of which were very substantially improved by the amendments effected during their passage through the Dáil.  I recommend the Bill to the Dáil in principle, and urge that it should be read a Second Time, <Col N="132" /> so that we can get down to its consideration in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly prepared to accept the Minister's invitation. I accept this Bill as a non-controversial measure.  I am conscious of the fact that it is a particularly difficult type of Bill dealing with hundreds of thousands of cases, each one possibly very dissimilar from the other. The principle enshrined in this Bill, as in some others, is the principle of, as far as possible, giving a reasonable holiday with pay every year to every worker.  The fairness of the principle and the justness of the theory will be accepted by everyone of us.  There is, however, room for a caution.  We have got to be satisfied, when applying even a just theory or endeavouring to get fair play for individuals, that we are not creating a greater injustice or a greater hardship in other directions.</P>
      <P>I speak with particular reference to the classes of domestic servants.  If this Bill was applied to households that keep two or more domestic servants, in that type of household I could not possibly see that there was any hardship to anyone.  Such people are comparatively well-to-do and reasonably able to pay holiday wages and allowances for two weeks a year to a maid. But when we come to the smaller type of household, the one-maid household &mdash;take the thousands of small landladies in the City of Dublin&mdash;it may be that hardship is being done there.  Many of these people could not afford a week-end holiday for themselves in 30 years.  Now they are asked to provide two weeks' holidays per annum with wages and 1/- per day allowance for their maid.  I am merely raising, so that it can be looked into, the advisability of starting off by dealing with the type of household that has two maids or more and leaving the smaller household for a future Bill.  I certainly agree with the principle of holidays, but it is hard to expect people who cannot afford a holiday themselves to finance holidays for another.  That is one point that struck me about the Bill and I mention it for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another is around the same question. This Bill provides a fortnight's holidays <Col N="133" /> with pay and 1/- per day allowance for every domestic servant.  You have thousands of juveniles from the country in domestic service in Dublin &mdash;young girls of 17, 18 and 19 years of age.  The mistresses in most cases are responsible in the eyes of the parents for seeing that the girls keep good hours and attend to their religious duties, etc.  Are those young girls now to be liberated on the City of Dublin, we will say, for a fortnight every year, to walk out of the house for a fortnight with a fortnight's pay and 1/- per day allowance?  Is there any provision to ensure that that type of juvenile servant returns home?  I suggest in the case of the juveniles that, together with the two weeks' allowance, the previous month's pay should be given and that the Minister or the mistress should insist on their return home.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make any more than a few remarks on this Bill, as, frankly, I have not given the study that I hope at a later date to give to this measure.  The first thing I should like to ask the Minister is for as long a time as possible between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage, because, with all due respect to the Minister and other members of the House, there are a whole lot of outside bodies who can bring their expert minds to bear on certain sections of it.  It is really only now that the Bill is before the public, and I, therefore, ask the Minister to give as long as possible before the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rather agree with what the Minister said as to the provisions about the people who are dismissed before a holiday. Undoubtedly there were some people who did that, so that I think the Minister is right in his remarks, but whether what he has done is the correct way is another matter.  For instance, Deputy Corish asked him a question about the five-day worker where a bank holiday fell on the other day.  I did not catch the Minister's reply to that.  It seems to me that there were at least two classes of five-day workers referred to in the discussion. For instance, Deputy Keyes referred to the six-day worker who has <Col N="134" /> been reduced to five days.  Then there is another class of worker.  There is the case of a worker who is working, say, 44 hours per week, or there may be even cases where he is working 48 hours.  He spends a considerable time in travelling each day, and it suits the worker and suits his employer for him to put in the 44 or 48 hours in five days in the week.  That only serves to illustrate the differences which there are between even two five-day workers.  I do not propose to offer any criticism of the Bill at the moment. As I said, I think I can agree with the Minister in saying that the principle is accepted, and, if he will give us as long a time as possible to examine it minutely, I think it will probably make for the subsequent speedy enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make only one remark, and it has reference to this five-day week question.  This is the first occasion, so far as I know, on which legal recognition has been given to the five-day week, and, as I understand the section, it means that if the holiday falls on a non-working day it will not be regarded as a holiday and, therefore, another day will have to be given in lieu of it.  If the Minister is going to do that, he should give a <i>quid pro quo</i> and alter the permissible hours under the Conditions of Employment Act so that those factories working a five-day week may work longer hours than factories working a six-day week.  That principle has been given effect in the recent Factory Act passed in Great Britain. Under that Act, a five-day factory may work longer hours than a six-day factory.  I put that suggestion to the Minister to be considered as a return for the five-day week.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Bill.  It is easy to see that difficulties attended the drafting of such a Bill, and the Minister and his Department are to be congratulated on its production.  As regards the five-day week, there is, as Deputy Dockrell pointed out, a difference. A man might work 44 hours or 40 hours as an agreed week over a period of five days and be paid a full week's wages.  On the other hand, a <Col N="135" /> man might work five days and be paid only at a certain rate for those five days.  We want to avoid the victimisation of a man in that way.  So far as I can see, by the proposal in this Bill to amend Section 7 of the 1936 Act, there is the possibility that an employer might abuse his position.  I ask the Minister to try to get a form of words between now and the Committee Stage which will ensure that the worker will not be victimised in consequence of this amendment.  We appreciate very much the number of extra workers who are being brought in by this Bill.  Transport workers especially have been agitating for a considerable time for legislation of this kind.  It was an anomaly, since the passing of the 1936 Act, that you had certain industrial workers in large firms getting holidays while carters in the same firms were not entitled to holidays.  The same thing applies to clerical workers.  This Bill regularises the position, and I hope that other workers who may not be covered by the Bill will be catered for in the near future.  Again, I ask the Minister to try to simplify the position and make clear the intention in regard to the five-day week.  As the Bill reads at present, it would appear that certain people who are entitled to a holiday under the provisions of the 1936 Act would have that right taken from them by this Bill when it becomes law.</P>

      <P>Servant girls with small farmers will come under the Bill.  Take the case of the small farmer who has five or six children.  That man's wife is working from Sunday morning to Saturday night, and she has to employ a maid to feed the fowl and do other small jobs.  That woman is expected to give her servant holidays.  When the Shops Act came into force, it proved to be very unpopular and it had to be withdrawn.  This Act will be more unpopular than the Shops Act was because the wives of small farmers who employ these girls have to work <Col N="136" /> from one end of the week to the other and they never get a holiday.  They will rise up in rebellion against the giving of holidays to their servant girls.  What will happen will be that they will not employ them.  This Bill will tend to reduce the employment of servant girls.  People are crying out about keeping the girls and boys in the country.  This Bill will tend to send a lot of them away because people will not employ girls to whom they have to give holidays when they cannot get holidays themselves.  Many of the wives of small farmers have never had a holiday since their honeymoon&mdash;if they had one then.  If they have to give servant girls holidays with pay, this Bill will be more unpopular than was the Shops Bill.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Fagan has said.  This Bill deals mainly with workshops, offices and business premises, and, to that extent, we have very little to say to it; but when it comes down to the kitchen of every home in the country, quite a different principle is introduced, and a most undesirable principle.  This sort of thing can be carried too far, and it is being carried too far in this Bill.  Even if nobody else goes into the Lobby against the Bill, I shall do so.  There are, we are told, 90,000 domestic servants in the country.  That figure gives a fair indication of the number of kitchens which will have to be visited in the country.  This goes beyond all reason.  The only holiday, as Deputy Fagan says, that the farmer's wife ever has is her honeymoon.  These women will be compelled to let their servants off for a fortnight, with pay, and give them subsistence allowance, while they themselves cannot get a holiday.  That is carrying the thing too far.  As I said, I shall go into the Lobby against the Bill even if no one else does.</P>

      <P>I endorse the appeal of the Deputy who asked for as long a time as possible between this stage and the next stage of the Bill.  The Bill is one which is suited to Committee discussion.  That was exemplified in the case of the Conditions of Employment Bill, which took up a <Col N="137" /> considerable portion of the time of the House, and was much improved, as the Minister said, by the generous participation of all Parties in the attempt to make it as effective as possible.  This Bill brings us a further stage towards the objective aimed at in the Conditions of Employment Act. The only thing which strikes one in connection with it is that the title is somewhat different.  I thought that the title would follow the same lines as the Conditions of Employment Act, extending the advantages of that measure to some of the classes heretofore excluded.  Even a cursory examination of this Bill will show that it affects the 1936 Act in five or six of its sections.  Some of these provisions will have to be carefully analysed to see that workers do not lose something which they gained under the 1936 Act.  Reference has been made to the five-day week, but this is not the time to enter into detail in connection with that provision.</P>
      <P>I give the Bill a general welcome. Whenever any kind of social advance is being made, there are protests.  We are told, in connection with every social advance, that it is going to lead to revolution and pauperism&mdash;to complete beggary and bankruptcy.  The big firms employing large numbers of men who came under the Conditions of Employment Act survived the ordeal.  Yet, we are asked to believe that a householder who employs one domestic servant will have to shut up shop completely if the domestic servant gets what every other section of citizens is getting&mdash;an annual holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The domestic servants in my opinion are a most deserving class.  In the matter of legislation they have few to speak for them and I am sorry to say that the conditions in which many of them work are scandalous.  It is a pleasure to see this Bill brought in by the Minister and the Government.  I join in the appeal of the Minister to all Deputies and all Parties in the House to regard this Bill in a non-contentious way.  I think nobody could with reason get up and oppose the granting of an annual holiday to domestic servants.  They are really domestic drudges and it is only right that their little salaries should be paid <Col N="138" /> to them while on holidays.  That surely will not bankrupt any of the people who are employing them.  On behalf of the Labour Party and my colleagues, I welcome this measure.  I would ask that sufficient time be given before the Committee Stage to enable necessary amendments to be drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a line of thought which Deputy Keyes has not followed but which I think many people in this House followed with regard to this Bill.  That is the line of thought which will justify complete opposition to the Bill.  There is no person in this House who wants to stand up as an opponent of holidays to any worker much less to domestic servants.  But we have this situation: that the trend of all concessions in this country has been to non-agricultural workers.  I am not blaming the Government for that.  In a country like this where you have peasant proprietorship, where small farmers are hard workers as well as employers and are considered by some people as capitalists, you have the position that you cannot apply social legislation to them.  When you do apply it there is the natural tendency to leave the land.  Why not?  At the present time we have a terrible outcry about the falling rural population.  There is no doubt we have a falling rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as opposing this particular Bill or as being an opponent of holidays to domestic servants. But I am putting this view to the Minister: that this method of granting concessions in a country like this has its own particular difficulties. Every concession you grant to people outside the land is an inducement to people to leave the land.  There are fixed hours, fixed wages, fixed holidays with compulsory payment for people outside the land.  Is it any wonder then the people are leaving the land?  I think Deputy Fagan was perfectly right when he said there are in this country farmers' wives who have been drudging and slaving, carrying on their poultry business, their dairy business and minding families of six or seven children who need someone to help them in this work.  Some of these farmers' wives have never had a holiday since their honeymoon, if they <Col N="139" /> had one then, and that is doubtful. When the domestic servants get holidays is it any wonder that the neighbouring girls or the daughters of farmers feel that there is nothing in farming and that they must leave it?  Is it not obvious that that would happen? It was obvious all the time that it would happen.</P>
    <P>This Bill is going to be applied willy nilly to everyone, but there does not appear to be any consideration for the means of the people who will have to grant the holidays and pay for them. None at all.  My experience of domestic servants is that they always get holidays wherever they have sought them.  Their mistresses were only too glad to give them holidays, but once you had it laid down that there are certain concessions accruing to people who leave the land, then that is an inducement to them to do so.  I am not going to go into the Lobby against this Bill, but I am warning the Minister and this House that legislation of this type which is designed for people who are off the land is going to have an ill-effect on work on the land and upon people who live by the land. Deputies can imagine&mdash;but some of them perhaps cannot&mdash;the dull slavery there is in the lives of people working on the land and working the soil, and they can imagine perhaps the glamour and the advantage there is in fixed hours of work, fixed wages and fixed holidays.  If they can imagine these things they will realise the danger the country is up against.  That is my view, and I hold it very strongly.  I think domestic servants should get their holidays.  I think they have always got them, but we ought to be very careful in dealing with peasant proprietorship where you cannot offer them the same facilities that other people have.  We ought to be very careful of what we do in awarding concessions to people who are not workers on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one section in this Bill to which I would like to call the Minister's attention.  That section defines holidays for non-domestic workers who are not industrial workers.  These holidays are defined <Col N="140" /> as Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter Monday, Whit Monday, and the First Monday in August.  Church holidays may be substituted for those public holidays.  I do not see why Church holidays could not have been substituted right away for these holidays.  Why not give Church holidays a preference?  I think that would be a very right thing, and I would recommend the Minister to make that change in the Bill now. There is another section in the Bill, Section 11, which provides penalties for anyone on holidays doing work for pay.  Such people are liable to very heavy penalties if they work.  I notice that in recent legislation going through this House it has been made a very heavy offence to work.  But the Minister and everyone else should bear in mind that this country is consuming £20,000,000 worth more than it is producing and that it is more work and not less work that is needed.  It should not be an offence to work in any case.  In this country it should not be made an offence to work whether on holidays or not.  The liberty should be there to every citizen to work if he likes during his holidays. A man should be free to use his holidays as he wishes.  The Minister should consider these points, especially the point with regard to Church holidays rather than public holidays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this question of holidays, I think there is general agreement that as far as possible the principle of public holidays for workers should be accepted.  But there are exceptions to every rule, and the Minister in this Bill has been forced to make exceptions.  He has been forced to exclude agricultural workers from the provisions of this Bill.  I can well believe that he has been forced to make this exception because the agricultural worker is living in an atmosphere in which there are no holidays for those working with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister has been forced to exempt the agricultural worker from the right to holidays under this Bill, I would suggest that all workers on agricultural holdings, male and female, should be exempt.  Everybody must <Col N="141" /> realise at the present time that the people who are carrying on work on the land, and who are making it possible to carry on production, are mainly people who get no holidays or who get no wages.  They are the farmers' wives, the farmers' sons and daughters, and the farmers' relatives working on the farm.  I do not believe that it would serve any useful purpose or that it would serve the interests of domestic workers in rural areas to grant them compulsory holidays.  I believe that any interference with employment in rural areas would only tend to create more unemployment. At the present time, farmers are finding it very difficult to employ anyone outside their own families and relatives. I think if the Minister would exempt from this Act domestic servants who are employed on agricultural holdings or, at any rate, such servants who are employed on agricultural holdings where there is no other servant employed, he would make the Bill more acceptable to the people generally.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there are many farmers in the country who employ only one man and who have to insure that man as a groomsman, as he may have to train horses or to attend to a sire?  He is a man who works on the farm generally. I think these people should be excluded from the Bill, because they are semi-agricultural labourers.  It would be a great hardship to farmers if they were compelled to give such men holidays.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that here are our proposals, but there is none of them to which we are so closely wedded that we are not prepared to consider any amendment that may be brought forward on Committee. If the Deputy wishes to have that point raised he can bring forward an amendment.  I can then give my reasons as to why I think they should <Col N="142" /> be excluded from the definition of agricultural worker, and the Deputy can give his reasons as to why they should be included.  So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to be guided by the general volume of opinion here.  The principle of the Bill is that holidays with pay should be secured for the classes of workers not already covered by existing legislation.  I recognise that there must be exceptions in the application of that, but the question is: where are we going to draw the line?  Whom are we going to exclude? These are matters upon which there can be as many opinions as there are individuals in the House.</P>
      <P>In framing the Bill I had often very grave doubts as to whether the particular proposals that were ultimately embodied in it were the best.  In these circumstances, it is quite clear that any reasonable proposition made by any member of the Dáil will have to be fairly considered.  A suggestion has been made that there should be a protracted period between Second Reading and the Committee Stage.  I am not so sure that that is the wiser course.  Deputies who were members of the last Dáil will remember that previous Bills of this character could not be disposed of in one Committee Stage.  Ultimately we agreed that it was best to have an ordinary Committee consideration and, arising out of it, many ideas were ventilated and many suggestions were made which had to be examined.  Then we had a recommittal of the Bill and further consideration of it in Committee.  I think it would be necessary to adopt the same procedure in relation to this Bill. I would suggest that we fix the Committee Stage, say, for this day fortnight. I would not press to have it taken then if there is other business available for the Dáil, but if it should prove that the Committee Stage could be begun on that day, we could proceed with the examination of the Bill. If the volume of amendments subsequently appearing should be so great, I shall move to recommit the Bill on Report, so that there will be ample opportunity for putting forward any proposals for alteration in the text of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> Two special types of cases have been referred to&mdash;the domestic servant case and the five-day-a-week worker.  So far as domestic servants are concerned, I confess that I had very grave doubts as to whether it was wise to include them in the Bill.  I certainly considered the matter for a long time.  I did so, not so much because of the objections to which Deputies opposite have referred, but to the feeling I had that it would be a matter of great difficulty to enforce the provisions of the Bill in relation to that type of worker.  I had also in mind, not so much the domestic servant employed in lodging houses in Dublin, about whom personally I have no doubt, but the case to which rural Deputies have been referring&mdash;domestic servants employed upon an agricultural holding.  In respect to them, I can see at once that many considerations can be advanced in favour of their exclusion from the Bill.  In the end I decided against it, but I will admit that it was not a very firm decision on my part and, if Deputies care to move amendments to exclude that particular type of servant, I shall be prepared to consider them, though I think Deputies are looking at the matter from a one-sided point of view at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the actual amount of work done by a housewife is probably greater than the amount done by a servant in such houses but Deputies should remember that it is much more pleasant to work as mistress in your own house than as a servant under a mistress, even though you may receive no wages.  There is a very substantial difference between the conditions under which the servant and the mistress work.  I do not think it unreasonable to expect that the State should intervene for the purpose of fixing certain minimum conditions for such workers or for the purpose of protecting that type of worker.  If employers are not prepared to conform to these conditions then they cannot have the benefit of employing persons of that class at all.  In the early history of social legislation in this country, the case always arose where you had to ask yourself whether the benefits that were being conferred on one <Col N="144" /> class outweighed the disadvantages that were being inflicted on others.  I mentioned here before the case of a British Minister who introduced legislation to prohibit the employment of women underground in mines.  He thought that he had achieved some great social reform but when next he visited a coal-mining district the women who had lost their employment in the mines were so incensed that they nearly lynched him.  Yet nowadays nobody would suggest the repeal of that legislation in order to permit the employment of women as coal-miners. In this regard you have got to make sure that you are moving in the right direction and if you are sure of that, there is no reason why you should not go forward.  In the great majority of cases, domestic servants do get holidays at the moment and there is no objection to giving them this statutory right.  I have no doubt whatever that it is desirable that they should be given that privilege.  I am prepared to argue in favour of domestic servants getting the privilege, even though, as you go down the scale, you come to the point where it is very hard to distinguish between the domestic servant and the employer so-called.  You have to draw the line somewhere, and we will all differ as to where it should be.</P>
    <P>The case of the five-day workers, which has been referred to, is a complicated matter, it is true.  The 1936 Act gave to these five-day workers a rate of payment in respect of public holidays even though they would not have worked on that public holiday at all because of the fact that their employment was limited to a five-day week.  They have got that, and because of that I admit at once that it is not going to be easily taken away. Quite clearly we did not intend to make it apply that way.  What we intended to provide in a week on which a public holiday occurred was that the worker should get the same wages as he would have got if no public holiday occurred.  In other words, that the occurrence of the public holiday was not to be a serious loss to the worker. We provided that in the case of the six-day worker but in the case of the five-day worker, when a holiday fell <Col N="145" /> upon a non-working day we did more than we intended.  We provided that even though he got a full week's wages, the wages that he would get in a normal week, he got more than that&mdash;he got an additional day's pay for the public holiday even though he would not have to work on that holiday at all.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is to put that right: to provide that these five-day workers get what the six-day workers get, a normal week's wages in a week in which a public holiday occurs.  I know I am in a weak position. Even though the five-day worker got that because of a mistake, the proposal is to take it back from him, and that is not an easy thing to do in any circumstances.  However, we can discuss that more fully when the case arises on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Brennan say that all our social legislation conferred benefits on urban workers and not upon agricultural workers.  I do not think the Deputy could possibly have given a moment's thought to the history of social legislation in this country before making that remark.  Surely, the whole history of our social legislation proves the very reverse.  Would the Deputy name any of our social services which do not extend to the rural areas and to the agricultural workers?  They were all extended to them at great difficulty and at considerable expense from public funds when the easier course would have been to apply them to urban workers only who can more easily organise.  With great difficulty and always at great expense, all our social services have been extended to cover agricultural workers and the rural areas.  You have old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, housing subsidies, national health insurance, unemployment assistance, and all the other social services.  Everyone of these applies to the agricultural workers.  In fact, their application to agricultural workers is frequently the main item in the cost of them.  Deputy Brennan made a statement which he may think may sound very well in the ears of farmers, but it does not happen to be true.  In this particular case we <Col N="146" /> are not extending the provisions of this measure to agricultural workers. Acts for the regulation of the conditions of employment for agricultural workers are a different matter to Acts for the regulation of conditions of employment for non-agricultural workers. A measure has been passed by the House for the fixing of wages and conditions of employment for agricultural workers.  The Minister for Agriculture took responsibility for it.  If a measure of this kind is to be applied to agricultural workers, then I think that should be done through legislation promoted by the Minister for Agriculture after consultation with those who are more familiar with agricultural conditions than I am, or the officers of my Department.  We are more familiar with the conditions of urban and non-agricultural workers. An extension of this legislation to agricultural workers could best be done by an extension of the Agricultural Wages Act.  That is something that would have to be very carefully considered, because, as rural Deputies know much better than I do, the work of an agricultural labourer depends upon factors other than the desire of his employer to have regular hours. It depends upon the seasons of the year, the state of the weather, and quite a number of other factors, factors which do not enter into the regular output which a cigarette-producing machine is capable of and which permits of the regulation of the conditions of employment of those who attend that machine.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of the agricultural worker from this Bill was not intended to enforce a distinction between agricultural and non-agricultural workers or to intimate to the agricultural worker that he is regarded as being of less importance in the eyes of the State than the other.  Quite the reverse.  Practical difficulties were involved which also necessitated, for example, the exclusion of sailors and the other classes mentioned in Section 2.  On the general question of the applicability of social services to rural areas, I say then that they all apply to the rural areas, and I hope that it will always be the policy of the <Col N="147" /> Government in office to see that they continue to apply.</P>

      <P>That, in the opinion of Dáil Eireann, it is essential that special long-term loans be provided for farmers at easy terms; that rates on agricultural land be completely abolished; that a moratorium be granted on the payment of land annuities, and that the payment of arrears outstanding be spread over a number of years in order to promote the recovery and expansion of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, so many weeks have passed since this motion was tabled that it may occasion some surprise that some change in it might not be necessary.  It might be expected that it would be out-of-date, but the claims that I wish to put forward are so just and so reasonable that time only renders them more urgent.  Farmers are as much entitled to-day as they were last July to special loans to enable <Col N="148" /> them to re-stock and re-equip their farms, and to a temporary respite from the payment of annuities, the funding of outstanding arrears, and the complete derating of agricultural land.  As a matter of fact, I think they are even more entitled to these concessions now, because the operations of the clerk of the weather, an official over whom this House has no control, have had a very detrimental effect on the agricultural industry during the past few months.  The case in support of this motion rests mainly on the fact that during the past five years farmers have been bearing an intolerable burden, a burden that has been estimated by the Banking Commission to amount to about £20,000,000 a year. That estimate was based on statistics given by various Departments of State.  It has been estimated that the total value of the agricultural output has been reduced by more than £20,000,000 since 1929.  A reduction of £20,000,000 in the farmers' income, affecting 500,000 people who work on the land, must naturally have exhausted their resources, must have placed them in a very impoverished position, and deprived them of the means of carrying on and developing their industry.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy will agree that the economic existence of this country depends upon the agricultural industry being extended in every possible direction.  It depends also upon the volume and the value of agricultural production here being increased by every possible means.  What chance have unfortunate farmers, who were forced to endure the effects of seven years of acute agricultural depression, during which there were export tariffs upon their produce, which reduced its value by 40 per cent., as well as restrictions on the export of live stock, which practically rendered them unsaleable, of developing the industry? Farmers who lived under such conditions cannot be expected to carry on in tillage or in live stock unless special relief is provided for them, by way of loans to enable them once more to get into the position of being able to work their land.  In asking for loans, we ask for special loans that do not carry <Col N="149" /> the same conditions as those applying to ordinary commercial loans.  We ask to have it recognised that farmers have passed through an abnormal period of depression, and that they suffered very severely in what was generally considered to be in the national interest. Having made big sacrifices, they should now be put in the position of carrying on their industry.  In order to enable them to do so is it not reasonable and just to demand that special terms should be given them, and that a sum of money should be set aside by the State to re-establish agriculture, by providing loans on especially easy terms?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture stated some time ago that to provide loans for farmers to purchase live stock would result in putting up the price of live stock and would have an adverse effect on agricultural conditions generally, since farmers would have to sell the stock later.  Nobody could seriously accept such a contention. The number of farmers requiring loans to purchase live stock might be considerable, but it would not be sufficient to alter the trend of prices, which are governed mainly by export prices abroad, and the greater portion of our live stock is exported.  In addition to loans for stock, farmers require loans to put their land into a working condition, to improve and drain holdings, to make fences and provide buildings. All these things were neglected during the years of depression.  Surely it is not unreasonable to demand that farmers should be put into the position that they were in some years ago. Farmers have been told that if they had no capital they could turn to tillage.  Anyone who knows anything about agriculture will admit that there is no more hopeless, and no more disastrous activity than to proceed to break up land without plenty of capital with which to procure seeds, implements, supplies of artificial and other manures, as well as paying the wages of workers.  Even in regard to tillage, farmers have to wait, at least, 12 months before they can reap any benefit from their labours.  There is a case for impoverished farmers getting loans at a low rate of interest.  It is <Col N="150" /> not the intention of the motion to suggest that loans given on special terms, or at low rates of interest should become a permanent feature here, but should be given simply as an emergency measure to enable farmers to recoup themselves for the abnormal losses they sustained.</P>
    <P>In addition to the case that can be made for the granting of loans at a low rate of interest, one can be made also for a temporary respite in the collection of land annuities, and for the funding of arrears that accrued during the period of depression. Farmers were called upon during that period not only to pay the annuities to the Land Commission here, but also to pay them to the British Government by way of tariffs on agricultural exports.  That double burden, in addition to agricultural depression and restrictions on exports, rendered live stock unsaleable, and left farmers in a deplorable position.  As a result they were unable to meet the demands of the Land Commission or the rate collectors.  Apart from every other consideration, simple justice demands that farmers who made such sacrifices should be given breathing space, a temporary respite from the payment of land annuities.  I know that it has been stated by, I think, the Taoiseach in this House, that if farmers were given a temporary respite from the payment of annuities now, and some concession by way of spreading the arrears over a number of years, there would, possibly, be a demand for the same concession in the course of a few years.  Our answer to that is that we do not expect to have a period of agricultural depression such as we have experienced.  We do not expect to have an economic war such as we have experienced, and we do not expect to have the various restrictions, with their consequential losses, inflicted upon us again in the course of a few years.  We, farmers, only ask concessions of this kind on the ground that conditions have been absolutely abnormal. If such abnormal conditions were to arise again we might be justified in demanding similar concessions again in the future, but it is no answer to <Col N="151" /> our demands to say that we would be putting up the same demands in a few years' time even if conditions were absolutely normal.  Farmers in this country have always had a strong sense of justice and fair play.  They have never demanded anything to which they did not believe they were fully entitled.  They have always been prepared to pay what they believed they justly owed, but a position has been imposed upon them in which they have been compelled to pay, not what they justly owed, but an amount abnormally higher.  They have been compelled to pay their annuities three or four times over, and to bear a disproportionate share of the whole cost of the economic dispute between Great Britain and Ireland.  In every national dispute and in every national emergency in which the citizens are called upon to make sacrifices it is always a recognised principle that it is the duty of the Government to compensate, to some extent at any rate, those who have been called upon to make sacrifices in the national interest.  We, farmers, when we realised that the economic dispute had been brought to an end, were confident that we would be treated in a similar manner, that some recognition would be given to the fact that the farmers had been, as has been admitted by Ministers in this House, in the front line of trenches in the economic dispute, and had borne more than their share, and more than any other section of the community of the burthen of that dispute.  Yet we find that the only concession made to farmers on the termination of the economic war was to increase agricultural wages by three shillings per week.</P>
    <P>That concession was made because the Government realised that there was in this House an active Party representing the labour interest, a Party which they sought to overcome, and because they believed that by making a concession to the agricultural labourer at the expense of the farmer they would win the agricultural labourer from the Labour Party to the Government.  It was simply a move made in anticipation of the general election.  That was <Col N="152" /> the only concession I can see that was made to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think nobody can dispute the fact that farmers have suffered and suffered very severely during the past five or six years.  Take the average small farmer raising eight or ten store cattle per year.  That man formerly was able to market these cattle for £12 or £13 per head.  During the years 1933, 1934, 1935 he was forced to sell these cattle at £3 per head.  That left him an income of barely £24 or £30 per year upon which to support his family and carry on the business of his farm.  That is just one aspect of the manner in which farmers suffered owing to the economic dispute and the depression in agricultural prices.  Surely any reasonable person, appreciating the importance of the farming industry, would have realised the necessity for giving some chance to the agricultural industry by a temporary remission of annuities.  Instead of a temporary remission of annuities, however, we have had during the past few months an intensive campaign for the collection of annuities.  We have had a position in which farmers' basic stock, that is, their cows and horses, were seized in order to meet the demands of the Land Commission.  I could give instances of farmers who offered money to the forces of the State who were sent to seize in respect of annuities, but the money was refused because it was insufficient to meet the demand.  I could give an instance of one particular farmer who offered half the amount demanded and it was refused. He was engaged in removing corn from the field into the haggard with one horse.  He had only one horse and, notwithstanding that fact, the horse was taken from under the cart.  He was left there with a stock of oats, half made, in the kind of weather which we have been experiencing. When that farmer made a protest, or endeavoured to protest, against such action he was brutally assaulted by a member of the flying squad.  I ask you, can any Government stand behind such action?  Can any Government justify such action?  Is it not the last word in tyranny and injustice? In addition to that, we have cases where farmers who had endeavoured <Col N="153" /> to build up stock to supply the Dublin market had their cows seized and sold.</P>
    <P>In all their actions in regard to agriculture the Government seemed to completely ignore the fact that the agricultural industry is the most important industry.  They have simply proceeded on a policy of ruthlessly extracting from the farmers the last shilling which they claim to be due.  It would seem as if they were inspired to a great extent by the people who formerly oppressed the agriculturists of this country.  It would seem as if they were inspired by the landlord garrison, who are dead and damned for 50 years, but who still seem to be able to get their philosophy and outlook accepted by the people who are holding office in this country. In dealing with agriculture, it may be said, as was said of another Government in the past, that they have gone to hell for their principles and to Bedlam for their policy.  But, they have done worse than that: they have gone to Belfast for their tools.  They have imported from Northern Ireland a creature who was picked up in the slums or in the back lanes of Newry, a creature named Morgan, who attends&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the position is that we have a Government compelled to use the very self-same methods that were employed by their predecessors, or rather, I should say, by the landlord garrison in bygone days.  They have been forced to make use of emergency men who buy farmers' stock at a small proportion of their value.  As long as the Government is forced to make use of creatures of that kind they are exposing themselves to the contempt and ridicule of all decent people.  A Government which claims to be Christian <Col N="154" /> should endeavour to administer the affairs of this country in a Christian manner.  If it is necessary, even as a last resort, to seize stock, at least they should ensure that the farmer whose stock is seized and sold gets the full market value for that stock.  We find an agent of the Government purchasing farmers' stock at one-third of their value.  That agent is still continuing to do so without censure from his superiors.  Surely a Government with any idea of Christian principles should insist upon their servants or agents acting in accordance with Christian principles and purchasing the seized stock at its full market value.  We find that no recognition has been made of any principle of justice. It is simply a case of keeping the farmer under foot, trampling him under foot.</P>
      <P>This motion asks for the complete derating of agricultural land.  Farmers in this country have been demanding derating for the last ten years.  It is over ten years since derating was introduced into Great Britain and the Northern counties.  If there is any sincerity in the claims of our Government that they are anxious to restore national unity, surely they must realise that the imposition of rates on agricultural land in Éire constitutes a very serious barrier to national unity.  They must realise that the farmers in the six excluded counties are looking across the Border witnessing the activities of the rate collector.  Our Government must also realise that not only have they refused complete derating, but they have in various ways contributed to increasing the rates in every possible direction and thus making the burden on the farmers' shoulders more intolerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every measure introduced here has tended to increase the rates on agricultural land.  I am told that the measures proposed for aerial defence in this country will impose a certain burden on the rates.  The grants held over the heads of the local authorities are always conditional upon the local authorities putting up a certain amount of money, thereby increasing the rates.  Every measure that has been adopted here has increased the burden on the unfortunate farmer. <Col N="155" /> What answer can the Government make to the demand for derating?  Any answer that could have been made to that demand was made in England and Northern Ireland, and was found to be faulty.  What case can be made for excluding the farmers of the Twenty-Six Counties from benefits which are enjoyed by the farmers of the Six Counties?  You will be told derating will cast an additional burden upon other sections of the community. It will impose no burden on any section if it is financed by a reduction in public expenditure.  It will impose no burden if the local services are financed by the State out of money saved through the exercise of public economy.</P>
    <P>Six or seven years ago, when another Government was in office here, we were told that they were extravagant, and that a saving of at least £2,000,000 a year could be effected. That sum would completely derate agricultural land and leave a considerable surplus.  We will be told that there are large numbers of farmers here who would derive very little benefit from derating.  I have never yet come in contact with a farmer who would not derive some benefit if he was exempt from the periodic or perhaps frequent visits of the rate collector.  It may be said there are some people whose rates are absolutely insignificant, but these are scarcely farmers.  People with a valuation under £5 hardly ever live exclusively out of their holdings.  They are people who are either agricultural workers or are engaged in some other activity.  Nobody will suggest that a person could live on a holding with a £5 or £10 valuation.</P>
    <P>So far as holdings of a higher valuation are concerned, there is a considerable advantage to be gained from derating.  You may ask why should we derate agricultural land and why not relieve people in the cities and towns of the burden of taxation, of rates or income-tax, or something else. The whole case for the derating of agricultural land rests upon the fact that the present system of rating is unjust.  Every citizen will acknowledge that he is bound morally as well <Col N="156" /> as legally to contribute to the upkeep of the State, according to what is right and just.  Every citizen will admit that we are bound not only to pay direct but also indirect taxes.  But it is not an established principle that, so far as direct taxation is concerned, it should be based on the taxpayer's means.</P>
    <P>The whole trouble in connection with the rates on agricultural land is that they bear no relation to a person's means.  Two people may live side by side on holdings each with a valuation of £20.  One may be a civil servant; he may be a person in receipt of a private income of £1,000 or £10,000 a year.  The other may be a small farmer and yet you will find they are both compelled to contribute alike to the maintenance of local services.  Is the system which allows such inequality a just system?  Is it a system which any Government could stand over?  You have the fact that the British Government, even though they have not always been very keen on living up to high ideals of justice, have found that they could not stand over a system so inequitable and unjust as the present system of rating on agricultural land and they were forced to abolish the rates on agricultural land.  I think that not alone will the derating of agricultural land be a step in the direction of giving justice, but a step towards the introduction of a fairer system of taxation generally, a system based upon the means of each individual citizen.  I believe that the derating of agricultural land must inevitably be followed by derating of other property. Therefore, it cannot be contended that the derating of agricultural land inflicts injustice upon other sections of the community.  As a matter of fact, it simply paves the way for a just and equitable system of taxation based on the citizen's income.</P>
    <P>These are the three demands included in this motion.  I think no member will dispute that they are absolutely justifiable and, not alone justifiable, but that there is urgent need for immediate relief for the agricultural industry.  We are all painfully aware that the agricultural industry has been steadily declining, except for the few years of the war, for the past 50 years. <Col N="157" /> Tillage has diminished; live stock have been reduced; every branch of the industry has declined.  Most people hoped that when we had set up in business as a free country our Irish Government would take immediate steps to come to the rescue of agriculture, and that one of the first actions of an Irish Government here would have been to arrest the decline in the industry and to arrest the decline in the population of rural Ireland.  Yet we find that, during the past 16 years, the population of Ireland generally, and of rural Ireland in particular, has sharply declined. People advance various reasons for that decline.  They say that it is due to the fact that the young people seek amusement and pleasure and leave the rural areas; that it is due to the fact that custom in this country is against early marriages; but the real reason for the decline and for the decay in our rural areas is the simple fact that the farming community are not being fairly or justly treated.</P>
    <P>When this country was subject to Great Britain there was an excuse for that state of affairs because we were governed by a nation which was predominantly urban, but to-day we have self-government and we are a nation predominantly agricultural.  At least, we still are, but it looks, from the present rate of decline in agricultural population, as if this country will soon be predominantly urban.  While the country is still predominantly agricultural, so far as population is concerned, and still absolutely dependent for its economic existence upon agriculture, surely some big effort should be made to rescue the industry from the slippery slope down which it seems to be sliding to complete decay.  Surely some big effort should be made to encourage the people who are still struggling to live on the land to keep up the struggle; and to encourage the young people who are leaving the schools to turn their attention to agriculture. There is no means by which that can be achieved until there is some immediate improvement in agricultural conditions and the suggestions contained in this motion, I think, offer some hope of improvement in rural conditions.</P>

      <P>In seconding this motion, I must say that Deputy Cogan has not left me very much to say.  I would, however, earnestly ask the Government, even at this late hour, to come to the rescue of the farmers.  If they do not do so, the farmers will be bankrupt, without any doubt.  If the members of the Government travelled up and down the country as I do, and saw the poverty which exists, they would quickly change their minds as to how the farmers should be treated.  I now ask the Government to put into force every item of this motion and I shall say no more.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;to increase the production and profitable sale of agricultural produce and to that end a loan should be made available to agriculturists at a rate of interest not exceeding 3 per cent.; that a Commission of Inquiry into the Agricultural Industry be set up consisting of:&mdash;</P>

      <P>1 agriculturist to be nominated by the Royal Dublin Society.</P>

      <P>1 person to be nominated by the Banks' Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>1 person to be nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, and</P>

    <P>I think the case for the amendment has been made by the mover of the motion.  He impressed on the House that he was looking for an emergency measure, for a temporary respite.  We do not think that any emergency measure, any temporary respite, or any temporary advantage that can be conferred on agriculture to-day, in its present condition, is sufficient.  We feel that the question of agriculture must be examined in the light of all the new factors.  We have opened up a new era now.  The Government of the country have been educated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are certainly not preaching the same policy which they preached in 1932, in relation to agriculture. That is all to the good, and, as a matter of fact, I should be inclined to throw bouquets at the Government for it; but this whole question of agriculture, in view of all the new factors, requires to be thoroughly examined in the light of all these new factors, in the light of the information which the Government have from their own nominees, the Banking Commission people, and in the light also of the information they have from the publication of figures for which they themselves are responsible with regard to the fall in the value of production here.  We feel that an examination of the position must be undertaken by somebody, firstly, because agriculture has reached an ebb at present at which no temporary advantage can put it where it ought to be, and, secondly, because the disease must be diagnosed and, when diagnosed, ruthlessly dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come to the conclusion also that the shifting of burdens from one back to another is not a solution of any of our difficulties.  We have all a common platform.  Everybody in this country says that agriculture is the basic industry of this country.  Very <Col N="160" /> well; if it is, let us see what has happened to it for the last few years. Deputy Cogan has told you, and it is quite true&mdash;and all the figures published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, by the Department of Agriculture, and by the Banking Commission, will tell you also&mdash;that agricultural production here dropped by over £20,000,000.  That must have affected somebody.  It was not the farming community alone that it affected.  It affected every person, every activity and every industry in this country.  If agriculture is the main industry&mdash;and let us all admit that it is and that there are no two questions about it&mdash;and if we are going to have any prosperity in this country, the prosperity of the country lies in the soil of the country.  That is where it lies, and no other place&mdash;in the soil of this country.  What has happened to this country&mdash;to the soil of this country?  Let us take up the question of the purchase of artificial manures in the last five or six years and see what has happened to the soil of this country, or let us take up the feeding of concentrated foods to cattle, or stall-feeding, which is so important to this country and to the soil of this country.  Let us see what has happened. How far and how long are we going to have that situation continuing? The application of artificial manures in this country dropped by something between 20,000 and 30,000 tons per year in the last five years, and it has dropped all the time.  That meant that, possibly, 60,000 or 80,000 or 90,000 acres went unmanured every year.  Our feeding of concentrated foods to stall-feds dropped by over 52 per cent.</P>
    <P>The repercussions of that are to be felt and seen on the soil of this country.  It might be of interest to people in this House to be told that quite recently there were representatives of the British farmers in this country.  They were in County Roscommon. They were sent over here as a kind of investigating committee, if you like, to look around them and see the type of live stock here, and, possibly, learn some lesson from this country.  The opinion they expressed <Col N="161" /> in Roscommon was that the land of this country is being starved; it has every appearance of it.  One of these gentlemen said that he had a farm of 400 acres on the other side, and, of that 400 acres, 100 acres each year was being top-dressed with artificial manures, and it was able to carry 400 head of live stock and fatten them on the land.  Now, there is no land in Ireland to do that to-day.  The soil of this country is not good enough to plant food stuffs continually without having something put back into it. Those who think so are making the biggest mistake in their lives.  It is not.  The soil has got to be continually fed back.</P>
    <P>Now, if we are to consider seriously what has happened for the last five years&mdash;I do not care even what particular political reputations were at stake&mdash;if the Government is seriously to consider what has happened for the last five years, to consider now, even at this stage, what are the possibilities for intensive farming in this country, they would not mind political reputations or anything else, but they would go ahead and get the work done &mdash;they would try to put farming on its feet.  One great mistake, however, that the Government made was that it went forth on a policy of blind industrialism. Now, we all wanted industries in this country, but they should have been well planned.  They should have been of such a nature that they would be able to produce goods worth the money.  Has that happened? Everybody knows that it has not, but in their blind industrial madness they forgot the main industry.  Nobody would advocate now that the only salvation for this country is a tillage policy.  The Minister's predecessor, the late Mr. Hogan, wanted tillage, although he was put down as the Minister for Grass.  Why was he put down as the Minister for Grass?  Does anybody now ridicule the idea of more grass in this country?  No; and the reason is because it is the greatest asset we have.  We have 12,000,000 arable acres in this country, or about that.  If we were to till 4,000,000 acres, or less than 4,000,000 acres, we would produce every single thing that the people of this country require as <Col N="162" /> far as cereals and roots are concerned. What are we going to do with the other 8,000,000 acres?  I am sure that the Government is convinced, and that every member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;outside of the city members, who do not understand this question but who nevertheless are and must be interested in it&mdash;is convinced now, that the one thing that should be advocated for the people of this country to do is to produce more and better live stock if we want to have prosperity.</P>
    <P>For five years we were gallivanting in the wilderness and talking about the British market.  We did not want it back! We got it back, however, and, thank God, that era is finished.  Now that we have got it back, however, and now that we can at least look forward to getting on that market and to getting there on equal terms with other people, what are we going to do to get back the custom we lost while we were gallivanting on the economic war?  We are doing nothing.  There is only one way that it can be done.  It can be done by producing more and better live stock, by having them earlier, and by having them better fed. How are you going to do it?  You are going to do it, firstly, by paying attention to the soil of this country and by putting back into the soil of this country what it wants.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the case made by Deputy Cogan with regard to derating, but I do not think that, even if you had derating to-morrow morning, it is going to solve our difficulties.  Somebody must take off their coats&mdash;not somebody, but a lot of the best and most scientific people that we have in this country or in any other country who can help us to solve our problems, and our problems are great.  We want to get down to bedrock. We want to assist the Minister for Agriculture and we want him to assist us.  Let him or the Taoiseach do what was done in connection with the Banking Commission.  In other words, search the world and get the best experts to come and try to put us on our feet.  The Taoiseach knows perfectly well, and the Minister for Agriculture knows perfectly well, that if we are going to get on our <Col N="163" /> feet we will get on our feet by following pursuits which are profit-earning and which will leave us a profit.</P>
    <P>You cannot continually feed the dog with his own tail.  That is what bounties and subsidies mean.  You may and you must occasionally have bounties, and you must have subsidies, but, in the main, agriculture in this country will have to carry the burdens. No matter where they are placed, they will come back to its shoulders.  That is why we have put down this amendment. That is why we feel that no temporary advantage, no temporary concession, no temporary respite, as Deputy Cogan said, is going to put us back where we want to be put.  In every daily paper and every weekly paper in this country we have responsible people worrying about the falling population in this country, worrying about the falling averages in the schools, worrying particularly about the fall in the marriage rates in the rural districts.  How are we going to tackle it?  It is a serious problem, and I do not propose to suggest a solution for it, beyond this, that until you place farmers in a position in which they can afford to be comfortable, in which they can afford to be as well off as the people engaged in other pursuits in the country, you will have the people flying from the land.  As I said to-day on a previous measure, we have fixed hours, fixed wages, fixed holidays, for other people in this country.  Mind you, I am not against that, but it is a very dangerous thing in a country like this.  After all, we have less than 3,000,000 people in this country.  We are not a big industrial country.  We are depending upon agriculture to supply us, in the main, with funds for everything.  All our industries, all our business, depends upon the success of agriculture.  Spoon-feeding agriculture will not be any good to it.  You must put it on a paying basis.  As I said a while ago, we have here a peasant proprietorship; we are, in fact, all small farmers.  Take this country county by county.  If you take up the census and find the average size of the farms you will be amazed.  This is a country of <Col N="164" /> small farmers, small hard-working farmers, whose wives and families are toiling and drudging from Monday morning until Saturday night, without a fixed wage or fixed hours, or a fixed holiday.</P>

      <P>In a country which is composed of people like that you have got to be very careful in awarding to people outside that industry privileges which you cannot offer to the people inside that industry.  There is certainly a desire at the present time to leave the land.  People do not know why it is.  It is probably hard to diagnose it, but certainly the advantages enjoyed by people who are not working on the land are the biggest inducement to leave the land.  We hear it referred to as a flight from the land.  Personally I am inclined to dispute that, because if we were to take up the census to-day&mdash;if it were up-to-date&mdash;we would find that with the operation of the Land Commission you have more holdings in this country now than ever you had before.  Every one of those holdings has a proprietor. Nobody has run away from it.  There is somebody living in it.  But the population is not there; the people there have not got married.  For whatever reason that has happened. It is a problem to be solved.  It is a problem which must come up for solution very soon, or if it does not come up pretty soon this country will never recover.  We feel that, from another angle, examination of this problem of agriculture is imperative and urgent.  I do not think there are many persons in this House who are satisfied, or were ever satisfied, that the land of this country is being worked to its productivity or anything like it. In Denmark, for instance, according to the figures published, which can be found in the Library, taking the year 1900 and the year 1937, they increased their production of butter by 100 per cent.; they increased their production of bacon and hams by 100 per cent., and they increased their production of eggs by 300 per cent. in that period. <Col N="165" /> We have gone back.  What has happened? How is it that in that country they have been able to achieve that increase?</P>
      <P>I am pleading for an examination of agriculture, an impartial examination of it.  We have set out a formula here, or a suggestion to the people from whom such a commission might be drawn.  We do not ask the Government to tie themselves to that, but we are showing what we think is impartiality. We are giving the Minister an opportunity of appointing his nominees.  In fact, the whole thing is outside politics altogether, and ought to be outside politics.  If Denmark could increase her production of eggs by 300 per cent. in the last 37 years, we ought to be able to do the same thing.  I do not like reminding the Government of what has happened since they came into power with regard to eggs and poultry in this country.  They know it.  Everybody knows it.  I do not think there is any loss which caused more discontent in the farmers' houses than the loss of the poultry and egg industry, because that was the industry which gave the woman of the house and her daughters a little cash in hand.  It gave them some little comfort which they had not got in any other way.  That industry has dwindled.  The figures are appalling. In 1931, according to the figures produced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we got into this country £2,031,000 for eggs.  What did we get last year?  We got £837,000. Imagine what that must mean to the farmers' wives of this country, to the people in the cottages of this country, to the labourers' wives of this country! The relief of rates on land or the relief of annuities is not going to cure that. That is the reason, while we demand as a right the relief from rates, that we also feel there must be an examination of the whole position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing less is any good to the farming community.  It would be good business for the Minister for Agriculture, if he does not see his way to adopt that suggestion of ours, to select five or six people to travel Europe and bring back ideas with regard to agriculture.  There is an intensive application of artificial manure <Col N="166" /> in Germany, in Holland and in Denmark, where they put out per acre 14 times what we do.</P>
    <P>In this country at present we are keeping an eye on industrialism.  We are keeping an eye to the things which in the main do not count.  We can find £300,000 for industrial alcohol or something else and we think we are making a contribution towards agriculture by doing that; but we are not.  If the Minister for Agriculture would make a contribution of £300,000 towards the cheapening of artificial manure, it would be the best investment for this country.  It would not be like a bounty or a subsidy for cattle, oats or barley or anything else; it would be something that you would have the benefit of over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Within the last 18 years New Zealand increased her agricultural production by 100 per cent.  We have not done anything in all that time to increase our production.  I am pleading for an examination of the real position that exists here.  I do know that the question of credit facilities, which Deputy Cogan spoke about, is a very important matter.  But, do not take me as saying that the prosperity of this country lies in the hands of the people who want credit; it does not.  I want this House to come to a decision that an agricultural policy which will bring prosperity to the farmers ought to be found even before providing credit for them.  Credit is not any good to a man unless he can make it pay.  With farming in the position which it is to-day, credit may mean what it did to people who got it some years ago&mdash;they simply lost what they got and are not able to pay it back. That has happened in various cases. The Government should examine their own agricultural statistics and the report of the Banking Commission, which they set up themselves, which deals with this matter of agriculture. They should not be afraid to tackle this question because it is a big one or because they may possibly have to go back on their political past.  They should not be afraid to tackle this problem; it is there and has to be tackled by somebody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> The Government cannot escape responsibility in this matter.  I do not want to go back on the responsibility which the Government carried for the last five years.  I want the Government to look forward.  There is no use in telling the farmer that we are going to find salvation in beet and wheat. That is not any good; that is finished. Everyone on the benches opposite knows that it is nonsense.  So far as agriculture is concerned, you must have an industry which is paying its way and producing a profit; which is not a national loss, much less an individual loss.  The Government should examine their own statistics dealing with the pig industry.  What has happened to that industry?  Does not everybody know that there is something wrong there?  When foreign bacon was being imported here, people advocated putting a tariff on foreign bacon or that it should be prohibited altogether, which it was.  They felt that if that were done it would open up to the farmers a greater market for their pigs.  But what has happened? We have fewer pigs now.  Is there not a case for examination there?  Is there not a case for examination of the poultry industry!</P>
    <P>The Minister now thinks that the admixture scheme ought not to be continued. In that he is possibly influenced by the figures with regard to pig and poultry production and, if he is not, he ought to be.  Whether he is or not, he is apparently convinced that that scheme must go; in other words, that it is not a sound one.  It was never a sound one.  I am giving the Minister credit for being honest about this.  He must be convinced that the thing is wrong or he would not propose to abolish it.  He is abolishing it and, consequently, he must be convinced that it has done damage. Nevertheless, he says the damage must continue for another 12 months.  He said that next September he is prepared to withdraw the scheme.  Why is he going to withdraw it?  Evidently because it has done harm.  If it has done harm for four or five years, will it not continue to do harm for the next year?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> Is there no other way to deal with the barley and oats growers than to let the country suffer for another 12 months under a scheme which the Minister is convinced did damage to the country?  There ought to be some other way of doing it.  Would it not be a better policy for the Minister to say now: &ldquo;I am convinced that the scheme has done harm; I am convinced that the poultry trade and the pig trade, and others, have suffered as a result of the scheme and I am withdrawing it to-day; if there is any barley or oats left over and not consumed in this country, I am going to buy it; I am going to sell it to the mills and let it be sold to the farmers as cheap feeding for poultry?&rdquo;  Is not that a far better policy than continuing for another 12 months a policy which he is now convinced did damage?</P>
    <P>Personally I do not think there will be 1 lb. of cereals that will not be used even without the admixture scheme. The oats crop is a bad one and in parts of the country it will be very hard to realise cash for it at all.  A shopkeeper in Roscommon told me the other day that he was obliged to buy oats from some of his farmer-customers who came into him.  They had just done their threshing.  He bought the oats at 8/6 per barrel, although he did not want them at the price.  They were no good to him because the weather was bad, the harvest was bad and the crop was bad.  I do not think that the Minister should have been cowardly about the admixture scheme.  Once he came to the conclusion that it had done damage or was doing damage, he should have discontinued it straight away.  We, on this side, feel that there must be a complete examination of the agricultural position, that whatever is to be learned from other countries should be learned, that whatever has been found to be of advantage in other countries, taking everything into consideration&mdash; soil, climate and soforth&mdash;should, if practicable, be introduced here.</P>
    <P>Other countries have dairying such as we have here but they also go in for winter dairying.  How do they manage that?  We ought to find out.  Other countries are using as a substitute for maize not barley or oats but potatoes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> They have to put them through a certain process.  What about examining into that?  Is it not a proposition worth examination?  New ideas in agriculture, in soil cultivation and, particularly, in the manuring and treatment of soils obtain in other countries.  We are lagging behind. We want a bold, forward agricultural policy.  I have no doubt that, if the people of this country were put on the right road and if they realised the potentialities of our soil and our grass for live stock, with a market right at our door, even with the disadvantages of the past five years tied round their necks, they would be able to get back to their former position and hold their own.  I have not lost hope in this country but my hope does not lie solely in a tillage policy.  If we went for a whole-hog tillage policy, we should have no market to which to export our products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the burdens which agriculture has to carry to-day, and what are the prospects of easing those burdens or of increasing the income of farmers so as to enable them to bear these burdens?  I have before me figures published in the report of the Banking Commission relating to the overloading of the public debt. That is a very serious matter, because no matter how we try to shift the burdens, they will come to rest on the backs of agriculture.  A Labour Deputy, speaking a short time ago on the Holidays Bill, referred to the anxiety which obtained when the Conditions of Employment Bill was going through.  He said that they were told that it would result in pauperism, but the Bill went through and everything was working smoothly. Of course, everything is working smoothly.  But what has happened? The costs have gone on to production. The costs have gone on to the people, and the people are the agricultural community.  They are the people who, in the end, are going to keep this country going or to let it fall.  You have all those reactions and repercussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cogan pointed out, grants are being made to the county councils by the Local Government Department and by the Board of Works for the relief of unemployment, and these grants are conditional upon the ratepayers&mdash;otherwise the agricultural community&mdash;putting up a certain percentage of the amount granted.  There the agriculturists are affected on the double, because some of that money was taken from the Road Fund, which was ordinarily a fund to relieve the rates and which was applied in an unconditional way.  Now its application <Col N="171" /> is conditional on the ratepayers putting up certain sums.</P>
    <P>I have here figures in relation to loans and stock outstanding by the local authorities.  What do these figures show?  That we have an enormous increase in local commitments.  Even during last year and this year, or rather 1936 to 1937, the provision for the repayment of the interest and Sinking Fund by the local authorities has been increased by £126,173.  But that is not anything at all like the entire bill.  I am mentioning these things to try to impress on the House that the burdens on agriculture have increased and that they are still increasing with no prospect of any reduction. Unless we can have a basis of prosperity for the farmers and unless we can put agriculture into a better position so that it is going to show a profit, these increased burdens on agriculture cannot continue.  Farming cannot pay under these burdens.  If we are going to have prosperity in this country, I am sure the Minister for Agriculture is as convinced as I am that there will have to be a complete examination from beginning to end of the whole agricultural position.  It is becoming clear that the farmers in this country cannot continue to carry the load which is on their backs at present.  Industry must be put into the position that it is going to return a profit.  If you are going to have a prosperous rural community and contentment on the land; if you are going to free the agricultural community from the inferiority complex forced on them to-day you will have to help them, in some shape or form, to prosperity.</P>
    <P>You have not that contentment to-day amongst the rural community that you had in the past.  We are living in a new era.  We are living in a dangerous era.  It is not as easy to have contentment in the land now as in the past. There are numerous factors to be taken into consideration.  One thing I would impress upon the Minister before I conclude is this&mdash;he is the watchdog of the farming community and he should see that no inducements are held out to people to leave the land.  That is what is happening just now.</P>
    <P>He should see that something is done <Col N="172" /> to give the farmers a chance and to put them in the position that they can carry their burdens; they should be put in the position that they will not be afraid to rear a family in rural Ireland.  To-day they are afraid to undertake the rearing of a family in rural Ireland.  The people in this country who are inclined to look upon the farmer as an inferior person ought to beware of what they are doing.  The farmer is not an inferior person.  He ought to be made to feel he fills the most honoured rôle in the community, that he is nearer to nature and nearer to God than anybody else in the country.  The farmer is the primary producer of food and clothing for the people.  We ought to be very careful when passing legislation granting concessions, holiday measures, fixed hours and fixed wages to other people, that we should not intimate to the people on the land that they cannot expect to enjoy any of these things; that they are never to look forward to these amenities.  That seems to be the position at present.  They cannot look forward to any of the concessions that other people get.  There is a peculiar complexity about this country and we ought to be very careful about it. Where you have peasant proprietorship, where you have the small farmers all over the country, you ought to be very careful as to what you are doing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister sets his mind to tackle this question, if he is convinced now, as I believe he is, that agriculture must be made a paying proposition, not a subsidised proposition, he will seriously consider getting the best minds he can to make an examination into this problem.  Let us have all the scientific assistance we can get.  Let us have all the commonsense possible to deal with this.  I have no doubt that if the matter were tackled in that way and if you had commonsense brought to bear upon the position of agriculture you would succeed in getting a solution.  The relation of live stock to everything else on the farm should be examined.  The relation of live stock to the only market which is available should be gone into.  If the matter were tackled in this way I have no doubt you would again have prosperity <Col N="173" /> amongst the farming community.  Until you do that and place the farming community in a position of independence and comfort, not in a position of worry and anxiety, there will never be prosperity and contentment for the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House moved by Deputy Cogan and Deputy Thomas Burke asks that special long-term loans be provided for farmers at easy terms; that rates on agricultural land be completely abolished; that a moratorium be granted on the payment of land annuities and that the payment of arrears outstanding be spread over a number of years.  These at first sight appear to be rather a big order. Naturally, they would have the approval of any farmer or any person who wants to advocate the claims of the farmers.  Without going into the question whether the farmer should get these things, the only question that arises is whether the other members of the community should be called upon to contribute towards these various schemes or not.  Let us first of all take the question of the rents or annuities and rates.  Deputy Cogan said that we in Eire were anxious to end Partition, but that if the Northern farmer were to look across the Border and see his colleagues here in Eire paying rates, naturally he would not be keen on coming in, especially seeing the condition of the farmers in this State.  Now, I do not think there is any necessity to exaggerate anything in this matter.  I am sure that every Deputy here could make a good case on behalf of the farmer.  We can examine the case much better by not exaggerating.  We may be able to agree to do something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Putting the rent and rates together, you will find that the farmer in the North of Ireland is paying as much as the farmer on this side of the Border.  I say that because, when half the annuities were taken off the farmers in the Twenty-Six Counties, it amounted to a sum of something over £2,000,000.  Now derating would not <Col N="174" /> have cost as much.  In fact it would have cost annually about £500,000 less. Looking at the matter, therefore, in a rough way, it would appear to me that half the annuities plus the rates here are not any higher burden than the full annuities plus the rates on the other side of the Border.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in advocating that the farmers here should be given derating, I do not think it is right to bring in the case of the farmer in the Six Counties and assert that he is better off from that point of view.  Deputy Brennan said that the abolition of the annuities or derating would not be a permanent solution for agriculture.  I hold the view very strongly, and I stated in this House very recently, that if we are to devote a million pounds, or whatever the figure may be that we would spend on the promotion of agriculture, personally I would not recommend that it should come in the form of derating.  There were other matters mentioned by Deputy Brennan that might give very much more useful results if we had the money to spare to carry them out. However, I am not against derating on principle.  I only say that I do not think it is the best way that we could help agriculture in this country if we had the money to spend, and, of course, that is a very big &ldquo;if.&rdquo;  I am sure the Minister for Finance would find it extremely difficult to find the amount necessary to derate agricultural land here at the present time.</P>
      <P>I just want to touch upon a few other points that were raised by Deputy Brennan before going on to deal with the motion and the amendment in general.  I do not want statements to go unchallenged, if they appear to me to be unjust or perhaps inadvisable. In the first place, Deputy Brennan said that we were not importing nearly enough artificial manures or concentrated feeding stuffs to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;using.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly; I do not want to misquote the Deputy.  I am quite prepared to agree with the Deputy in that.  It would be most advisable if we could use much more artificial <Col N="175" /> manure in order to increase the productivity of the soil.  Similarly, it would be most advisable if we could use more concentrated foodstuffs and turn out more live stock.  On the other hand, is it not true to say that there has been a big falling off in the demand for these commodities in the last few years.  There was undoubtedly a reduction in the years 1933 and 1934 but, if the Deputy looks up the returns, he will see than last year we were back to the level of 1931 as far as artificial manures were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I give the Minister the source of my information?  My local dealer in Roscommon told me on Saturday last that in 1930 he sold 500 tons of grass manures whilst for this year he sold only 114 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be true of that particular locality but the amount of artificial manures, between what was imported and produced in this country, was about the same in 1931 and 1937.  There is not much difference either way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Beet and wheat would account for a lot of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  There would not be a very big difference either between 1931 and 1937 in the amount of concentrated feeding stuffs used.  I have not the exact figures. Of course, it is an infinitesimal part of what we should use.  If we could induce our farmers to use four or five times the amount of these commodities it would be a splendid thing for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned that we might give a bounty on the sale of artificial manures.  That is one proposal I have been examining for some time but, apart from the question of financing a scheme of that kind&mdash;we might possibly be able to induce the Minister for Finance to give us some money for that purpose&mdash;the administration of some of those schemes is an extremely difficult matter.  That <Col N="176" /> applies to other schemes too.  I agree with Deputy Brennan that the giving of credit in an indiscriminate manner is sometimes dangerous.  We have gone into that matter before and I do not want to go over it again.  I think that credit for some purposes, such as building and so on, would be very useful to some farmers.  The provision of loans at a small rate of interest would be useful.  I must say that, as far as credit for the restocking of farms is concerned, I do not think that a point or two in the rate of interest would mean very much; because if a man borrows £100 to buy cattle, whether he gets it at four or six per cent. does not make nearly so much difference as the fair to which he brings out these cattle to sell.  In short term loans for restocking farms, the rate of interest does not make any great difference. The matter of facilities for credit at low rates of interest, which is mentioned in the motion, is being examined.  That is another scheme that might be useful in the present circumstances. I do not think I could agree with Deputy Brennan when he said, if I understood him rightly, that it was admitted by everybody that wheat and beet were finished.</P>

      <P>Not alone, certainly.  We might finish on that point because it is getting a bit late.  There is no use in saying that this Party is altogether for tillage, or that the people on the other side are altogether for grass. One statement is just as ridiculous as the other.  We cannot have the country all under tillage or all under grass.</P>

      <P>The whole difference between the two Parties is this.  When we came in here in 1932 we looked up the statistics and we saw that at the rate at which tillage was declining, there would be practically no tillage in ten years or so.  Of course it could never disappear entirely because people would continue to grow potatoes and crops of that kind.  It was not going to disappear completely.  We set out, as far as our agricultural policy was concerned, to try to increase tillage by getting wheat and beet and other crops grown here as far as possible.  There may not be a big difference between the policies of the two Parties now, but if there is not a big difference, it is not we who have changed.  It is the Fine Gael Party who have changed because they signed a report in 1928 and they sent out pamphlets to a number of people in the country saying that we could not grow wheat because the soil was not suitable, the climate was not suitable, and the crows would eat it all.  Now, after five or six years, when we have proved that we can grow wheat in this country, they come along and say: &ldquo;We will continue to grow wheat.  We are all the same way of thinking now.&rdquo; They have been converted.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
