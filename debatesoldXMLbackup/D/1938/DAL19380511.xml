      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Gárda Síochána Pensions Order, 1938, made on the 6th day of May, 1938, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 11th day of May, 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for this order arises from the contemplated change in the Commissionership of the Gárda.  Articles 1, 2 and 3 are formal.  Article 4&mdash;This Article is intended to ensure that the Gárda Síochána Pensions Order, 1925 (as amended by any subsequent order) <Col N="728" /> shall apply to the present commissioner. The wording of Article 3 of the 1925 order left some room for doubt on this point.</P>
    <P>Article 5.&mdash;The &ldquo;requisition period of approved service&rdquo; referred to in this Article is 25 years in the case of the present commissioner and 30 years in the case of any future commissioner who joined the force after the 19th October, 1925.  The Article provides that when a commissioner has completed such period of service, he may retire on pension, but only with the consent of the Minister if he has attained the age of 60.  Under the 1925 order a commissioner irrespective of his length of service could not retire on pension except on medical grounds before the age of 50.</P>
    <P>Article 6.&mdash;This Article enables, in the case of the present commissioner, the period which he served in the D.M.P. prior to his dismissal therefrom in July, 1921, and the period from such dismissal to the date of his re-instatement (1st April, 1925), to be reckoned as approved service for pension. This provision is identical with those contained in Section 3 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, and in Section 11 of the Dublin Police Act, 1924, which applied to other members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police who were dismissed for political reasons prior to the Truce and were subsequently reinstated therein. The Article also enables the Minister for Finance to add as approved service, in the case of any commissioner, a period not exceeding 10 years.</P>
    <P>Article 7.&mdash;This Article is intended to cover the case of a civil servant appointed, without break of service, to the post of commissioner.  It provides that in such a case the full period served in a pensionable capacity in the Civil Service may be reckoned as approved service, for the purpose of pension, on retirement from the Gárda. Under the 1925 order only three-fourths of such service, served after the age of 20, could be so reckoned.</P>
    <P>The present commissioner joined the D.M.P., as it then was, on the 20th January, 1911.  He was dismissed for political reasons on the 24th July, 1921. From July, 1921, to May, 1922, he was engaged on intelligence work.  From <Col N="729" /> May, 1922, to May, 1925, he was Secretary of the Civil Aviation Organisation. In May, 1923, he was appointed Secretary of the D.M.P., which was then a recognised post.  On the 1st May, 1925, he was reinstated in the D.M.P. with the rank of chief superintendent. Under the order, it is provided that the breaks shall count and that the commissioner's service shall be regarded as continuous service from 1911.  That would give him a service of 27 years, and it is proposed to add three years' service for pension purposes.  Ten years is mentioned in the order, but this is merely suggested by the Department of Finance as a round figure.  It is proposed to add three years, which will give him the maximum pension of two-thirds of his salary.  The idea of the Principal Order is that any member of the force is entitled to full pension after 30 years' actual service.  In calculating the actual pension, every year's service after the twentieth year counts as two. The effect of that is that every member of the Guards who has 30 years' service, gets credit for 40 years, which entitles him to a pension of forty-sixtieths of his salary.  I should like to add, at this stage, that I recognise that the position of chief commissioner is a very onerous one, and I should like to avail of this opportunity to express my deep appreciation of the services rendered by the commissioner who is now retiring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second Bill we have had before us in five years for the provision of pensions for two commissioners who were comparatively young men.  It is a question of whether the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet can justify that. I should like to know whether it is the deliberate intention of this Government, as long as they are in office, to confine the period of office of a commissioner to five years or less?  I should also like to know if it is correct that a civil servant has been appointed a successor to the commissioner now retiring, and if so, whether it is the intention in future or so long as the Government is in office, to confine the position of commissioner to civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this motion might with advantage be made the occasion by the Minister for Justice for some statement as to what his intentions are in regard to the future of the Gárda Síochána.  I recognise the Minister's peculiar position in the matter of introducing an order of this kind providing for a retiring allowance for the chief commissioner before the normal date of Civil Service retirement. I think that the Minister is entitled to ask the House to allow him a wide discretion in that matter, but on the Estimate for his Department this year his attention was directed to the apprehension that was felt I think, pretty widely, in this House that all was not well with the Gárda Síochána, that while the personnel of that force, especially of the rank and <Col N="731" /> file of that force, was of very high quality indeed, there did appear to be a slackening in morale and discipline which suggested the necessity for reform.  Now, I do not think it is going to be of advantage, either to the force or to this House, to seek to fix responsibility for that decline in morale and discipline.  I am not concerned to go into that side of the question at all, nor to examine the circumstances under which it arose, but I would be relieved, I think the members of the Gárda Síochána would be relieved, and I think the country would be relieved if the Minister for Justice took this occasion to say that, in any appointment contemplated by the Executive Council of a successor to the chief commissioner, special regard would be had to that individual's ability to restore the force to the prestige it enjoyed some years ago.  I think the impression has gained ground amongst the members of the Gárdaí, first that the same importance is not attached to discipline as used to be attached to it, and secondly, that as individual Guards and sergeants they cannot depend on the impartial support to which they ought to be entitled if they do their duty without fear or favour to anybody. The impression has grown that if, in the course of his duty, a Guard interferes with the sweet will of a supporter of the Government, instead of being complimented on his action and supported in what he deemed it his duty to do, he is quite likely to be sharply reproved, and to be told it is a useful thing on certain occasions to put the telescope to the blind eye.</P>

      <P>Very well.  All I ask, and I ask it with a sincere desire to <Col N="732" /> help in the restoring of a condition which every side of this House desires to see restored, is that the Minister should take this opportunity of saying that, without regard to what may have eventuated in the past history of the force, he is now primarily concerned to strengthen discipline and morale; that the person in whom the Executive Council will repose their trust will be specially charged with that task; that he will get a categorical assurance not only of the cordial and unrestricted support of the Executive Council in that work, but an assurance that from every side of this House the full authority of the Oireachtas will support any chief commissioner who concerns himself to make the force as efficient a body as it used to be, and who concerns himself to ensure that every member of it, from the chief commissioner down to the youngest Gárda on the beat, will do his duty without regard to the prestige or influence of any person with whom he may come in contact in the course of his daily work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the matters that have been raised, there is no principle that a change is to be made at the end of five years.  It has been the practice, I know, in other countries that people in the position of a commissioner here have been changed from time to time, but there is no decision here that he should be changed every five years.  A question was asked as to whether the successor was to be a civil servant.  That is so; the Assistant Secretary <Col N="733" /> to the Department of Justice is the person who will succeed the present commissioner.  Again, there has been no decision made&mdash;nor should it arise, I think, except in a certain set of circumstances&mdash;as to whether or not the person who occupies the position of commissioner should be a civil servant.  The fact that a civil servant has been appointed in this case is not intended to create a precedent.  I do not accept what Deputy Dillon says with regard to the apprehension alleged to exist as to the condition of the force.  I feel that the commissioner has done his best, although sometimes under very difficult circumstances, and I feel that the force is not at all in the position which has been represented in this House.  However, the Chair has ruled that discussion out of order, and I cannot go into the matter.  I am anxious now, as always in the past, that discipline should exist in the Gárdaí, and I think I have got a fair amount of co-operation in that matter.  I am quite sure that the successor to the present commissioner will see that discipline in the Gárdaí is preserved, and will see that the force keeps up to its usual high standard.</P>
      <P>Order approved.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Alcohol Bill, 1938&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Industrial Alcohol Bill, 1938, be read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill, as Deputies who have studied it are aware, is to make provision for the formation of a limited company to take over as a going concern the industrial alcohol undertaking which was established under the Industrial Alcohol Act of 1934.  It is considered that the time is opportune for making that change, and the Bill which has been designed for that purpose is similar to other measures introduced here from time to time for the establishment under State auspices of public companies for one purpose or another. The time is considered opportune, because the industrial alcohol undertaking has now passed the initial stage, and will in this year, it is <Col N="734" /> hoped, commence to work on a whole-time basis.  The production of industrial alcohol was commenced in May of last year at the factory in the Cooley area, County Louth, but only for an experimental run.  In that year at that factory 18,000 gallons were produced in the short period during which the trial run-in of the plant lasted.  Operations were recommenced at Cooley in November, and production began at the other factories in the following months.  It began at Labadish in December, at Carrick-macross in January, at Carndonagh in February, and at Curroy, County Mayo, in March.  So far, adequate supplies of potatoes, which are the raw material of the industry, have been forthcoming in all the factory districts except the Curroy area.  In the Curroy area it has only been possible to run at half the normal rate so far. For technical and other reasons, it was not possible to start all the five factories simultaneously, and the inadequacy of the supplies at Curroy may be partly due to the delay in putting the plant into production there.  As I have mentioned, the Curroy plant did not commence to work until March.  At the same time, some doubt exists as to whether the supply of potatoes in the Curroy area will be satisfactory for the forthcoming season and for that reason arrangements have been made to examine the feasibility of adding a molasses plant to the present equipment at the factory, which step has already been taken at the Cooley factory.  It is expected that the molasses plant at Cooley will be in operation by the first of next month and will process about 2,000 tons of molasses between that and the opening of the next potato campaign. The molasses used will be supplied by the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the introduction of molasses plants at the other three factories is also under consideration.  The total output of industrial alcohol up to 30th April was 299,000 gallons.  Supplies of potatoes are still available, and it is not improbable that that figure will be increased by 80,000 or 90,000 gallons by the end of the present production <Col N="735" /> period.  The quantity of potatoes processed at the five factories during the campaign up to 30th April was 14,600 tons.  The direct employment afforded at each factory is on an average 43 workers, including the managing staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they all men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the factory, yes. The head office is staffed by 35 hands, making a total of 250 employees.  In addition, substantial indirect employment is provided in the collection, blending and distribution of the petrol-alcohol mixture.</P>
      <P>In the original estimates submitted to the Government in connection with the establishment of the factories it was assumed that the wash from the distilling operations would be sold to farmers at a price of ½d. per gallon. There is a 13 gallon output of wash per gallon of alcohol, and the normal daily output of wash, therefore, is 13,000 gallons in each distillery.  So far, however, efforts to dispose of this wash to farmers have only been partially successful.  About 3,000 gallons per day is being sold in the Cooley area, but not more than that.  The whole question of the utilisation of this material is at present under examination. At the moment, material which cannot be sold to farmers is being disposed of as waste.</P>
      <P>The arrangements made with the farmers for the supply of potatoes in the current campaign were based upon a price of 40/- per ton for potatoes with 16 per cent. starch content, with an increase or deduction of 2d. per ton for each deviation of one-tenth of 1 per cent. in the starch content.  There was an additional provision that, where potatoes were tendered for in advance, a payment of 1/- per ton per month would be made in respect of deliveries after the 1st January.  That latter provision has been dropped for the next campaign, but representations have been made to the Department to have it restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the agreement with the technical experts, Messrs. Noury and van der Lande of Holland, each plant is guaranteed to produce 660 gallons of <Col N="736" /> absolute alcohol per day.  In actual practice, however, the output has reached 1,000 gallons per day.  On the assumption that the distilleries operate on potatoes from November to May inclusive, approximately 875,000 gallons of alcohol will be produced annually from the potatoes.  That will require about 15,000 tons of potatoes, as compared with the original estimate of 35,000 tons of potatoes producing 660,000 gallons of alcohol. The processing of 2,000 tons of molasses at Cooley between June and October will give an output of approximately 130,000 gallons of alcohol.  The total production, therefore, of the plants as at present equipped should amount to approximately 1,000,000 gallons per annum, The installation of additional molasses plants at the remaining four distilleries will increase that by another 500,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>When the initial difficulties associated with the introduction of the new industry have been overcome, the operation of the plants and the conduct of the enterprise on a purely commercial basis can better be carried on by a public company than by a Government Department because the organisation of a public Department, by reason of statutory and other obligations inseparable from the expenditure of public money, does not readily lend itself to the operation of a commercial enterprise.  The nominal capital of the company which it is proposed to establish&mdash;Monarchana Alcóil na h-Eireann, Teoranta&mdash;is fixed at £500,000 divided into shares of £1 each.  It will take over the undertaking as and from a day to be appointed by the Minister.  In consideration of the transfer of the undertaking to the Company, shares will be issued to the Minister for Finance. The total nominal value of these shares will be equivalent to the amount certified by the Minister for Finance as having been expended out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for the purpose of the undertaking up to the appointed day in the acquisition of land and so forth, the construction of the distilleries, the construction of rectifying plants, and other necessary works, and the purchase of machinery. <Col N="737" /> plant, and equipment.  The maximum amount which may be expended by the Minister for Finance in the acquisition of shares, including the nominal value of those allotted to him in consideration of the transfer of the undertaking, is limited to £500,000.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed with the Department of Finance that the company should undertake liability for the fixed capital invested in the undertaking only.  The company will not be charged with expenses which might be described as development expenses. The principal items included under this arrangement are moneys which are payable as bulk sums to the Dutch company who act as technical advisers, and salaries, wages, and other expenses of head office and distilleries up to the date of commencement of production.  These sums amount approximately to £37,000, of which £20,000 is attributable to head office and other expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that these will not be charged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not be charged.  The Government has approved of the sale of industrial alcohol to petrol importers and refineries at a price of 3/- per gallon. That figure has been based on the assumption that certain items will be capitalised; that is to say, interest on the fixed capital invested in the undertaking in respect of the first year's working when production was very much below what it would be in a normal year; the excess of the production costs in the first year's working over the estimated normal production costs and the royalties payable to Messrs.  Noury and van der Lande on the output of distilleries, which charge is spread over four years.  The total amount of these items is £156,000. Apart from the three items which I mentioned, the total liability incurred on the undertaking, for which the new company will assume liability, amounts to £266,000, made up as follows: In respect of land, buildings, roads, etc., £156,000; in respect of plant and equipment, including royalty payable on the Melle process <Col N="738" /> working in the distilleries, £97,000; rolling stock, lorries, etc., £9,000; miscellaneous equipment, £4,000.  In addition to this, an estimated capital expenditure of £4,000 will be incurred during the next few months.  Allowing a sum of £30,000 for working capital and contingencies, it will be seen that the immediate capital required by the company will amount to £356,000.  It has, however, been thought advisable to fix the nominal capital at £500,000.  The Bill provides that, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the company may issue debentures, but the amount raised by debentures must not at any time exceed the paid-up share capital of the company.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is further empowered to guarantee the principal and interest in respect of such debentures. The Bill also provides that while the Minister for Finance continues to hold not less than one-tenth of the issued shares, while any debentures guaranteed by him are outstanding, a majority of the directors, including the chairman, shall be nominated by him, and the company's auditors shall be appointed with his approval.  Power is also given in the Bill to the Minister to authorise, subject to such conditions as he thinks fit, the payment of subsidies to the company out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  That clause is in the nature of a safeguard to cover abnormal circumstances, such as a shortage of raw materials in a particular period, resulting in excessive working costs.</P>
      <P>Part III sets out the special powers of the company in relation to the laying down and maintenance of pipe lines, and the compulsory acquisition of land, and the construction, maintenance and operation of transport works.  This clause follows the provisions recently enacted by the Dáil in the Cement Act of this year, the Liffey Reservoir Act, 1936; the Air Navigation Transport Act, 1936, and also the provisions of the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1934, as amended somewhat in the light of experience gained in the operation of the Cement Act, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> Part IV provides for the transfer to the company of assets and liabilities of the State in respect of the undertaking. Part V provides for the compulsory purchase of industrial alcohol from the company by petrol distributors at a price to be fixed from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  It also provides for use by distributors of the industrial alcohol so purchased.  In addition to re-enacting Part IV of the 1934 Act, with certain amendments for simplification, this part of the Bill provides a new arrangement, and compels purchasers of alcohol to use it solely for blending with petrol, except with the permission of the Minister. Part VI deals with restriction on the manufacture of industrial alcohol. The Bill repeals the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1934, as on and from the appointed day.  That, I think is a general review of its main outline.  There are, of course, a number of detailed matters which it will be more satisfactory to discuss in Committee.</P>
    <P>I think the House will approve generally of the transfer of the control of this undertaking from the Department of Industry and Commerce to such a public company as the Bill contemplates. During the initial stages of an undertaking, which is definitely of an experimental nature, it was, perhaps, best to have its control directly under the Department of Industry and Commerce, but, it has now reached the stage when that arrangement is by no means satisfactory, because the Department of Industry and Commerce is not suitable for the running of a commercial enterprise of this character. The company which it is proposed to set up will have the same relations with the State as other public companies, such as the Sugar Company, which was established mainly as a result of State enterprise.  It is, perhaps, even yet too early to say what the outcome of industrial alcohol will be.  Certain experiments upon which it was inaugurated have proved to be less satisfactory than was originally thought.  Others have proved to be more satisfactory.  The efficiency of the plant that has been established is beyond question.  It is, in fact, of <Col N="740" /> much greater efficiency than was guaranteed.  On the other hand, it has been found, in order to procure adequate supplies of potatoes, that we had to pay a higher price than was originally anticipated.  Of course the price of potatoes has the most direct and the largest influence on the price at which the spirit can be sold.  Other costs have also been increased.  I think it is recognised that the circumstances under which this enterprise was first decided upon do not now exist.  At the same time it is well worth while continuing.  It does provide a substantial additional market for potatoes in areas where such markets may be of real value.  If the Dáil were to decide that the element of agricultural assistance should be taken out of the scheme then, of course, a much lower price for the alcohol could be secured by making it from potatoes altogether.  But, in so far as the factories were established mainly for that purpose, we thought it desirable to continue to work upon potatoes and to give the advantage of that market to the farmers in the factory areas.</P>
    <P>The position is, therefore, that we have got very efficient distilleries, as efficient as any industrial alcohol distilleries in the world.  Probably they are the most efficient because they are of the most recent origin, and equipped by a firm with a high reputation for work of that kind.  These distilleries have been working satisfactorily. The only circumstances that can affect the output of the distilleries is the price of the products and the availability of the companies to the raw material.  Subject to the raw material being there at a reasonable price, the alcohol can be produced and made available at a cost as low as is paid in any other country. If we were concerned only with the cost of the alcohol and not concerned with utilisation of native materials, of course, a lower price would be secured but that, I think, would be bad national policy in the present circumstances.  Of course, circumstances may change in the future and it will be open to the board of this company to adopt a changed policy with the consent of the Government. <Col N="741" /> I do not think there is anything else I wish to say at this time except to recommend the Bill to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell us the reason for the reduction in the strength from 55 to 40 degrees overproof? In the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1934, the expression &ldquo;industrial alcohol&rdquo; means alcohol which is of a strength not less that 55 degrees overproof, whether denatured or not.  In this Bill it is 40 degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true; he 1934 Act defined it as alcohol which is of a strength not less than 55 degrees overproof. It was felt that that definition would allow of the production of alcohol which would compete with the product of the distilleries.  The lowering of the strength would, however, necessitate the giving of licences to the distillers of whiskey, and the difficulty has been surmounted by the insertion in this new <Col N="742" /> definition of the words &ldquo;by a process other than the pot-still process.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what is the reason for the reduction from 55 to 40 degrees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition has been altered in order to get out of the difficulty to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Pot-still whiskey is produced at a strength of approximately 25 degrees overproof. You can get patent, as it is called, up to 65.  I say it once tested, two gallons of it, at 65 degrees overproof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that the definition in the original Act, that is &ldquo;alcohol which is of a strength of 55 degrees overproof,&rdquo; would permit of the production by persons other than this company of an alcohol which would compete with the products of this company. It was, therefore, considered desirable to reduce that figure, but while reducing that figure we do take into account the possibility of bringing whiskey distillers within the definition and therefore the definition has been changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very remarkable Bill.  In a sense it is not surprising, having regard to the previous measure.  On the first point which I raised with the Minister with regard to the strenght I certainly do not accept the Minister's explanation of it.  My impression, for what it is worth, is that a spirit which would be not less than 55 degrees overproof would be more potent spirit to mix with petrol than one at 40 degrees overproof&mdash;very much more potent. Now, the Bill is very remarkable in a great many ways. In the first place, power is taken in respect of acquisition of lands, properties, houses, railroads and so on, which so far, until this Minister came into office, was <Col N="743" /> reserved for public utilities, for local authorities or for works which were and could be regarded as of general public benefit.  This, as the Minister says, is an experiment.  The right to acquire public property at a knockdown price is, to my mind, an abuse of public rights.  In the original Bill that power was taken by the Minister for Finance.  It is now handled over, or will be handled over, to a body of whom this House at the present moment does not know the names of the directors.  In the original Bill even the Minister in the case of a temporary acquisition could not give less than 14 days notice; in this Bill he need only give seven.  The Minister may say that having regard to the experience that has been derived over the last few years, that a longer period is necessary but the public is entitled in a case of this sort to protection; it ought to get it.  If private company came before the Dáil and lodged a private Bill to get this right ample opportunity would be afforded the public concerned to come in and object to the seizure of property in this fashion and they would be entitled to get a larger price than is allowed, or will be allowed under this Act for any property that would be so seized.  Really, it is not acquired at all; it is seized that it is in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what is the policy behind the production of industrial alcohol? Listening to the Minster here this evening one would think that the entire benefit that was to be derived was to agriculturists, that they had a new market for the sale of potatoes and 45,000 tons of potatoes are to be offered to these factories at a cost of about £2 per ton.  Many, many years ago a Christian Brother in teaching boys sums happened to come across one dealing with potatoes and the price that was given was 5d. a stone.  He was an elderly man and he said: &ldquo;They must be old ones, and hey must be no good at that price.&rdquo;  That is very many years ago.  It is a much lower price now so that it must be for  class of potato that is not saleable,  presume.  That is £90,000, and in <Col N="744" /> order to enable agriculturists to get £90,000 we are going to produce 1,500,000 gallons of alcohol at a profit to the company when selling at 3/- a gallon.  I take it that the company will get for that 1,500,000 gallons £225,000.  I do not think there is any bargain in selling 45,000 tons of potatoes at £2 a ton.  I dismiss that as a proposition.  I have not heard any agriculturists claiming any advantage in that particular sale.  £225,000 is going to give employment to 215 men.  Do we gather from the Minister that the present staff of these five factories consists of 43 men each or that that is the maximum number that will be employed in them?</P>

The Minister mentioned in the course of his observations that from November to May they expected to produce 875,000 gallons annually. He added that if they added molasses there would be an additional 130,000. Making in all 1,000,000 gallons.  Is that the output of 215 men plus 35 on the staff?  Would the Minister answer that question?</P>

      <P>The output is determined by the period during which the factory works.  The normal employment is what I have given the Deputy but the factory has only been working for a short period in the recent campaign.  Therefore, in the present campaign the factories would work very much longer.  They would work much longer too if the molasses plant were installed.  Then they would work all the year round.  The total employment would have direct relation to the figures of the output given.</P>

I do not know that there could be a more expensive method of giving employment than this.  That is the figure that I would like the Minister to deal with now so that we will not be making fools of ourselves in going on talking about it.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minster did not tell us what the purpose of this Bill was.  Was this an experiment?  If so, I want to know the nature of the experiment.  If the production of industrial alcohol is for use in the manufacture of munitions I can understand it.  If it is begun as an experiment in order that in time of war, when it is difficult to get petrol, we will have and alternative I can understand it.  If it is introduced for the purpose of giving employment to 250 men I can understand it.  If further, it is introduced for the purpose of supplying a market for 45,000 tons of potatoes I can understand that too.  I can understand if it is introduced for any of these four or the whole four.  Presuming that it is introduced for the whole four, I should like to know where the munition factories are.  In the second place, I should like to know from some person who has experience of this fuel for motor use whether it is going to damage the machinery and whether it is going to mean great additional cost in transport.  There are all classes of people using motor transport now.  We do not mind about the rich because they can afford money for increased costs of running their cars.  What we should be concerned with here are the people who want to make a livelihood from motor transport, from the carriage of goods and so on.  I say that these people cannot stand that loss.  Then if we come down to the question of employment, I presume that petrol could be bought at 1/3 per gallon so that we are paying 1/9 more for this.  We are paying at least out of the £225,000, possibly £150,000 to give employment to these 250 men.  That would come to about £600 a year for each man.  I do not think that is good business.  It is on that question I would like the Minister to give the House more <Col N="747" /> information.  I want to know from him whether this has been introduced for any one of the four purposes I have mentioned or for the whole four or whether there are other things in connection with the matter?  So far as one can see extraordinary powers have been taken in this Bill, powers that in the ordinary course one would hesitate to give to local authorities when they want to provide the public with water reservoirs, housing schemes, or something of that kind. We are going to gat an article that is particularly costly.  If I mistake not the recent impost on distributors would amount to about £75,000 per annum.  It will probably be more, if they had got to pay for 1,500,000 gallons.  It is an unusual power to give to the company; in this case you are giving power to fix its prices by order.  It may be that the Minister would exercise discretion with regard to the making of the order.  Remember people consider that it is bad enough to give power to a Minister to make an order, but giving it to n outside body merely with the consent of the Minister is an innovation and something that I would not like the House to pass.  I am very much disappointed with this measure.  It is disappointing that so much public money should be put into an experiment of this sort.  We are committed to an expenditure of £250,000.  If this Bill passes nobody can tell to what extent the public purse will be committed under this Bill.  Taking it all round and considering the Minister's explanation I think we must vote against the measure.</P>

We had all sorts of rosy promises, too, with regard to the cement industry, and these promises took in poor Deputy Corish. We were promised that the result of the Cement Bill would be to reduce the cost of cement; instead of that it has been very much the other way.  Were it not for the Cement Bill you could buy cement delivered in Limerick to-day at 26/9 a ton.  The price of Irish cement at <Col N="748" /> Limerick is £1 a ton dearer.  Deputy Corish thought it would be only 5/- a ton dearer, but already it is £1 a ton more.  In addition to that, the specification laid down for Irish cement compares unfavourably with that of other commercial cements.</P>

But since the economic war has been settled there is no shadow of justification for telling the people of this country that an annual burden of £175,000 a year to produce alcohol that nobody wants is a good proposition.  This rubbish is going to be let loose on the petrol distributors of this country.  In addition to constituting a very heavy burden of £175,000 on the backs of the people of this country, it is going to impose a burden on the wear and tear of every motor cylinder that is moving in Éire.</P>

In the meantime he would be doing the House a service by keeping silent.  You are going to saddle the people of this country with an annual burden of £175,000, if you are going to compel them to purchase 1,500,000 gallons of this rubbish, rubbish which pays no excise duty at all, and yet is going to cost the consuming public 3/- per gallon.  Petrol can be purchased at 8d. per gallon c.i.f. in Dublin, therefore there is a difference of 2/4 in the cost.</P>

It is, however, as well that you should hear the truth now, as you heard it before, five years ago, on another issue, because you will the more readily recognise it when at last it dawns upon you.

I strongly urge the Government to abandon the whole wretched folly now.  The thing is manifestly grotesque and absurd and everybody knows it is manifestly grothat this Company is being formed is to take this bady over, to save the face of the Minister.  Will the Minister tell us why Mr. Mass retired from the General Managership?  I suggest that he retired because he came to realise that the whole thing was a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and that the sooner he got out of it, the better it would be for his own reputation.  He got out of it as quickly as he could: His successor is now being appointed.  No rational man could stand over the expenditure of this money, in the circumstances of this country.  One of the inducements apparently is that we shall provide a market for a certain amount of potatoes at £2 per ton provided they have 16 per cent.  of a starch content.  I suppose 16 per cent. is not a very excessive starch content but to grow potatoes at £2 per ton&mdash;</P>

Would it not be much better to buy potatoes and dump them into the Irish Sea than manufacture them into industrial alcohol? If you want to relieve the farmers, why not give them a dole of £2 in respect of every acre they possess and let them grow something useful on it? It was all very well to go on with this kind of &ldquo;codology&rdquo; when the Minister for Agriculture was blasting our market in Great Britain. Then you had to find a market for something <Col N="751" /> but now that we have secured a market for practically all our agricultural produce, why proceed with this absurdity?  You might as well urge the people to grow nettles to be converted into artificial spinach. Every acre of our land can now be profitably used if only this Government will get commonsense.  It is a monstrous thing that having learned their lesson, and having got back the markets for us, we should now see a considerable acreage of our land producing potatoes for conversion into idusrial alcohol for no purpose except to save the face of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

The employment given in these factories is trivial&mdash;about 200 person, some of whom no doubt, in the headquarters office, are women.  The employment given to the agricultural community growing potatoes at £2 ton is Congo slavery.  The growing of potatoes is exceedingly arduous work.  They require active cultivation and they are not a crop that can be grown exclusively by machinery, in the circumstance obtaining in this country.  At £2 per ton they are not worth growing. What is maddening is that the land on which these potatose will be grown, could be profitably used.  It is land on which we could grow crops that would yield us a profit in the British market and in that state of affairs, having made considerable concessions in the Trade Agreement with Great Britain to get back the markets we actually will not use the land to produce the crops that would yield us a profit on that market.  We are going to sue it to produce industrial alcohol that nobody wants.  Who wants to manufacture industrial alcohol?  Is there anybody outside Grangegorman who wants to manufacture industrial alcohol in this country?  If there is, I never met him.

      <P>The Minister can look up his facts but if he wishes to persuade me that the majority of countries of the world want to embark on the production of industrial alcohol, as a commercial undertaking, he will have to produce something more convincing than has yet been put before the House.  Many European States at the present time, being obsessed by the fear of war and by the fear that they would find themselves without the wherewithal to dispatch their bombers to slaughter the people of enemy nations, are no doubt engaged in the production of industrial alcohol.  There might be some excuse for the establishment of these factories if we were faced with a situation here in which we had to consider the dispatch of aeroplanes to slaughter the people of a nation whose aeroplanes were slaughtering us.  The Minister has never suggested that that is the purpose of those alcohol factories.  Does the Minister want to establish great air fleets here, and fuel them from those factories for the slaughter of the people of some neighbouring country, or some country on the Continent?  I do not believe he does.  I am practically certain he does not.  What does he want them for?  What does he hope to achieve?  Does he deny taking into consideration the amount of revenue that the Treasury will lose from the consumption of this alcohol instead of <Col N="753" /> duty-paying petrol?  The annual charge will amount to about £175,000 How on earth can he defend that?  Does he allege to this House that it is profitable to use Irish land under those conditions to grow potatoes on it at £2 a ton?</P>

      <P>To use the land of this country in existing circumstances&mdash;and to spend £175,000 a year to persuade the people to do it&mdash;for the production of potatoes at £2 a ton is a crime against the State.  Now, observe what has been brought in on a side wind in the course of this statement.  We were told originally that those factories were to relieve the special circumstances of the farmer in Cooley, because it was a black scab area.  Then those factories spread out.  They spread to Mayo, Donegal and Monaghan, my own constituency, all the time for the purpose of enriching the farmers by giving them £2 a ton for their potatoes.  Now we are told that the factories are going to embark upon the manufacture of this spirit out of molasses, and that is going to account for part of the annual burden of £175,000.  We are already spending considerably over £1,000,000 a year on the tomfool idea of producing sugar out of beet, and now we are going to add a further subsidy to that crazy scheme by buying molasses from the beet factories and converting them into industrial <Col N="754" /> alcohol.  That is further adding to the cost of that codology.  Is there ever going to be an end to the waste of public money for which the Fianna Fáil Government is going to be responsible in order to finance schemes that have been discredited and blown sky high from ten to 15 years ago in other countries? Just imagine what we could do with £175,000 a year.  If we had that money and endowed education, or endowed a dozen other things that are in urgent need of money, just imagine what we could do for our people. Instead of employing that money prudently, we are using it in this imbecile enterprise for no other reason than to save the face of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the enterprise had any prospect of surviving, or ever getting on an economic basis, one might be prepared to consider the proposition. But it never will.  Everybody in this House, every Deputy on those benches, knows that this business will collapse in the course of the next five or six years, and vanish for all time, but they would not admit that now.  They think that that would interfere with their pretige.  They must go on father ing this piece of codology because they were in the first case responsible for it. They admit, through the Minister's mouth, that the calculations upon which they first brought the proposal before the country were all wrong, and that since they brought it before the country all the costs have gone up.  That does not deter them in the least.  They admit, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that all the circumstances which they thought justified them in embarking upon this enterprise have changed.  That does not deter them in the very least.  They must go on, and we have got to pay for it.  Now, we are going to have a difficult time in restoring the economic equilibrium of this country after the past six years, but if these kinds of follies are going to be perpetrated over the next couple of years no Trade Agreement is going to be of any avail. We will &ldquo;bust&rdquo; the country.  If you are going to spend on tomfoolery of this kind, the wealth which could and ought to be derived from the Trade Agreements into which we have just entered, instead of building up <Col N="755" /> the country to the position which it occupied five or six years ago, then the value of the Trade Agreement will be lost, and all the concessions we have made to Great Britain in order to get those facilities in the British market will be thrown away.  I remember when the Minister was introducing his first Bill he fixed the price of coal for the purpose of this enterprise at twenty shillings a ton.  What is he going to pay for the coal now?  In those halcyon days he was going to get potatoes at 35/- a ton.  He has now raised the price to 40/-, and he certainly will not get supplies at 40/- if the farmers are allowed to trade in the normal way.</P>

He will come trotting back here, and make a virtue of giving the farmers something more for their potatoes in order to convert them into industrial alcohol. Dr. Ryan will go down and deliver soul-stirring speeches about giving a high price for potatoes for the industrial alcohol factories.  Everybody will crow about it, and nobody will advert to the fact that the higher price is going to come out of the consumers' pocket in the form of the price they will have to pay for industrial alcohol. Nobody will advert to the fact that if the farmers were allowed to use their land in the normal way, producing exportable agricultural produce, then, without putting any burden on the consumers of this country, we could get greater profit out of the land.</P>

I think the Minister ought to explain to us the circumstances under which those costs were incurred.  I have no doubt he will not do so.  He will simply get up and say that there is no foundation whatever for any anxieties which I have expressed in regard to those matters. I have no means of finding out.</P>

      <P>I am asking questions. <Col N="757" /> I am asking questions which the Minister should have answered before they were asked.  I am expressing amazement that the Minister, in justifying to this House the writing off of tens of thousands of pounds of the initial expenditure in the erection of those factories, did not tell us the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister did not tell us the circumstances under which they were spent.  I think the Minister should tell us.  I am now affording the Minister an opportunity of doing so, and I should be glad if he would. I want to say quite definitely that this enterprise is a thoroughly unsound and undesirable one.  It is going to produce an advantage to nobody.  It is going to involve the consuming public of this country in another immense lump of concealed taxation, because the taxation is going to be collected through the price of petrol.  The Minister has not informed us of any technical reason from the point of view of national defence which would justify this immense anual expenditure. There can be no argument that it is necessary to employ the acreage which will be employed in the production of potatoes to produce 1,000,000 gallons of alcohol per annum, because with a free British market we ought to find adequate employment for every acre of our land in providently producing agricultural produce.  I think it will be a great scandal if, having fixed 40/- a ton for potatoes and having found ourselves unable to get them at that price, we then jockey up the price and induce the people to use their land in an uneconomic way.  Remember that if the Government are prepared to pay a stiff price for any product, individual farmers are entitled to grow that product and reap the harvest of Government expenditure, but it is bad from the community point of view.  I know that there are some men so short-sighted and so silly that because they hope that a few of their constituents will get some profit out of this, if and when the price is further <Col N="758" /> raised for potatoes, they will remain silent and say: &ldquo;It would not suit me to criticise this, because the factories are going to be situated in my constituency.&rdquo; There are some of these factories in County Monaghan and in my erstwhile constituency in Donegal, and, in the full knowledge of that, I say that, in my considered judgment, their establishment is absolutely indefensible and, from the national point of view, disastrous and calculated to do nothing but create confusion, expense and inconvenience, and to confer no real or lasting benefit on anybody anywhere.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the House to reject this Bill and, by their rejection of it, to indicate clearly to the Government that, in our judgment, this whole disastrous experiment should be abandoned. It was embarked upon much as the Slaughter of Cattle Bill was embarked upon.  It is interesting to look back at Volume 53 of the Official Reports, because in it you will find that the Second Reading of the Industrial Alcohol Bill was taken on one day and the Second Reading of the Slaughter of Cattle Bill on the next day.  The Slaughter of Cattle Bill ended in the Roscrea factory scandal.</P>

      <P>The Slaughter of Cattle Bill that will be remembered in this country is the one which buried hundreds of thousands of calves that we badly require at present.  It was in the same spirit that we advocated the manufacture of industrial alcohol. It was all of a piece.  It was the same kind of lunacy romping around this country at that time under the guise of patriotism.  That kind of dishonest hogwash has been abandoned by the Government's own supporters and by the Government itself.  Why carry it over into a new era?  Why carry over this absurdity in what ought to be a common-sense period of development in this country?  There is no reason except to save the face of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have spent £50,000,000 saving the face of the Prime Minister.  We have gilded that countenance wit the last penny we can afford.  Why should we now start the business of putting a brazen face upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  At £175,000 it is not worth it, and the Minister ought to be able to face the consequences and freely admit that the enterprise was a complete mistake and should never have been embarked upon, and wind up the whole wretched business before we are further committed to what is going to be a substantial national loss.</P>

One could not help wondering, in listening to him, how he would manage to live in an insane country like England suppose it was his misfortune to have to go there. Suppose he found the Government spending millions of money on a terribly expensive business like the distillation of coal for production of motor spirit, suppose he found that a recent committee appointed by the Government had condemned that process from the economic point of view, but had stated that if war-time conditions were to be considered, it might be worth while having it as a reserve, what would he say?  How would he live in Germany, in Japan, in France, or in the United States? Have all these countries gone mad? In every one of these countries the Deputy will find that increasing efforts are being made to provide substitutes for mineral oil, and that not the least intensive efforts are in countries where mineral oil is produced in considerable quantities.  Poland has a big oil industry and it is giving more and more attention to the production of industrial alcohol.</P>

      <P>I think I should be entitled to say what I wish to say without interruption.  Why does not Deputy Dillon pay attention to this fact, that the great bulk of our public transport is now based on oil.  If a strike took place in Mexico what would happen?  I think there is a strike or a boycott on in Mexico at present. Any eruption in Roumania might leave us in Queer Street as far as our public transport services are concerned, so that even 1,000,000 gallons of spirit of native production would be very useful. So far from the expenditure of £175,000 being mere lavishness or foolish waste, it seems to me that it is hardly sufficient insurance against the prospects that seem to lie in front of us.  You must remember that every country in the world is at present giving attention to the prospects of war.</P>

We find that our nearest neighbor, Great Britain, is actually buying wheat a year ahead, and buying oil and all sorts of things for storage in the event of war.  Surely, it would be madness for this country to think that we can carry on in indifference. We cannot afford to be dependent upon Mexico, Roumania or <Col N="762" /> Venezuela, in order to keep our transport running.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, if the country followed Deputy Dillon's advice, it would be tantamount to committing suicide.  I hope I will never see this country following that advice.  There is one thing in this Bill about which I am not satisfied.  I notice that the Minister can fix the proportion of industrial alcohol to be mixed with petrol or hydrocarbon spirit, as he calls it, and that the company will fix the price, with his consent, at which industrial alcohol will be sold.  Apparently, he leaves the retail price to be fixed by the distributors, that is, by the importing oil companies.  I think he is chancing a great deal in that.  Up to the present we have had this protection, that the English price was there as a standard. The price here has been always about 1d. above the English price&mdash;a difference that has caused a lot of agitation. With the new conditions, are the distributors to be given the chance of fixing a price that may not be as fair to us as the price that prevailed up to the present?  They are not people that you would expect would pay a great deal of regard to public requirements, or consider the public interests.  Their aim, undoubtedly, will be to get some extra profit for themselves.  We know they do not like this Bill.  They do not <Col N="763" /> want any interference with their position. I should like the Minister, when replying, to tell us how he is going to guard against a situation where they can recoup themselves much more than necessary by reason of having to but the products of the Industrial Alcohol Company.  A farthing a gallon means a great deal to commercial transport and to the public utility companies.  Yet, without control, there may be an unnecessary advance of a farthing a gallon, and I do not think that would be a satisfactory development.  It has happened in other countries that the Government has fixed the retail price of the mixture.  Brazil, I know, is one country where that was done, and I would think that the Minister could go so far as to fix the retail price here. In arranging to grade the spirit&mdash;the imported spirit&mdash;the Minister is taking on a very interesting task.  I wonder what the effect of that will be on certain illusions that the distributors have tried to create up to the present?  They spend a great many millions on trying to create the illusions that there are no different grades of imported spirit.  At least, very many people think that they are illusions, and it pays the companies evidently to make the public believe that there are special grades.  Is he going to debunk that propaganda now by analysis and by, perhaps, announcing that there is only one grade?</P>
      <P>In my opinion, this Bill is very well justified.  I think that as time goes on we will have to do more and more of this kind of things so that, apart from war altogether, we may not be so utterly dependent upon outside eventualities as we are in our present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one peculiar thing I notice in the Bill; it is with regard to the system of Government accounting.  I would imagine that all moneys that are paid out and that are received in connection with a concern of this kind would be kept in a separate account, yet it is provided, for instance, in Section 8, that all moneys received in payment of loans advanced by the Government should be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister <Col N="764" /> for Finance may direct.  In other words, they are to be treated as general revenue.  That is a remarkable principle and I think it could not well be defended.  Suppose that the company were in the position to pay £20,000 in a year on a loan advanced to them&mdash;to treat that as ordinary revenue does not look to me defensible and I wonder why it is provided that the money is to be treated in that way.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that the Bill is a very useful measure and that this experiment is one that the Dáil should support strongly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister the matter of the £2 a ton and also the period for which the five factories will work in each season.  Does he hope that the five factories will work continuously from November until May&mdash;each of the five factories?  I would also like to know from him what is the acreage of potatoes necessary for the supply of each factory.  I do not think the Minister in his opening statement to-day has told us that.  He told us all right that the farmers were supplying potatoes at £2 a ton.  My reason for asking the acreage is that £2 a ton at the factory is no use.  It is like slavery.  The farmers are asked to go a long mileage with the potatoes to these factories for £2 a ton.  They cannot be grown at £2 a ton and delivered to the factory. The Minister has not informed us as to what is the factory area or whether he has satisfied himself that the position in each county where a factory is erected is that that county is able to provide sufficient potatoes for the upkeep of that factory in each season. I believe myself that some of the areas are not able to produce sufficient potatoes for these factories and I am well aware that where one factory is situated at the present time that not later than last year, for the ordinary needs of the people of that county, they had to get supplies of potatoes from their neighbouring counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">

They had to get the potatoes from a neighbouring county and, mind you, the potatoes they got from the neighbouring county they paid up to £3 a ton for them.  The Minister may make capital to the effect that the farmers are anxious to supply potatoes at £2 a ton.  They may for the very poor class of potatoes that they cannot export.  What was the market across Channel last year for ordinary ware potatoes?  Was it not up to £3 a ton? Is it not quite possible that it will be £3 10s. a ton next year?  If the market is £3 10s. for ware potatoes across Channel, in order to keep the factories going, is the Minister going to stop the export of potatoes?</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to answer how long during the past season have any of these factories been working, for what period they have been working?  I hope he will answer me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> There is another question I would like to put to him, and I hope he will answer it&mdash;the factory area&mdash;because if the farmer is to supply potatoes at £2 a ton, if the Minister wants to compel him to supply potatoes, which apparently is in his mind when he is going to keep the factories open, we will want to know the factory area and the distance the farmers will have to carry their potatoes to those factories.</P>
    <P>Now, there are some extraordinary sections in this Bill.  I do not know what is the idea of such sections or why there are such powers.  Take Part III, Section 23.  This company will get compulsory powers for practically everything on the land.  You have compulsory powers to acquire land, wayleaves, fishing rights, and other rights whatsoever existing over or in respect of any land or water.  I think it is necessary that the Minister should tell us a little more why there are such rights needed by the company if the factories are erected. Whether it is that the Minister is going to acquire rights and see that the potatoes are grown in spite of the people at £2 a ton in order to keep the factories going, I do not know.  He also comes along the same section, sub-section 4 (b)&mdash;in the case of the acquisition of any land give at least one month's notice, or if the land has an occupied dwelling house, three months' previous notice in writing to the occupier of the land.  Three months' notice! If this company liked they have the power under this Bill to order the farmer out of his holding inside three months and what is really worse the compensation that that man will get is only 4 per cent. He will be allowed, until the amount of compensation is declared&mdash;and it need not be declared for 12 months afterwards&mdash;only 4 per cent.  Now, I would say these are very drastic powers, and I think that we need some explanation of those powers&mdash; fishing rights, rights through lands, different rights, even that a farmer can be put out of his home, and his compensation not be paid, or need not be paid, for 12 months afterwards.  I <Col N="767" /> think that such legislation certainly needs amendment, and I hope that the Minister will see to it.  I would also like to ask the Minister to answer what Deputy Dillon put forward as to whether Irish contractors were asked to tender for these works&mdash;the erection of these plants?  Is it a fact that Irish contractors were asked to supply their tenders, their specifications and tenders for plant inside a very short period; that such tenders were not considered and that it was given to a foreign firm at their own price?  I hope I am wrong, but I am aware that this was done in the erection of some of the cement factories.  I am aware that Irish contractors were asked to tender on the basis I have mentioned, having no knowledge and no specifications and no facts before them.  They were asked to give their prices and estimates on such a basis.  The result was that the work was given to outside firms.  That is what I have been informed; I hope it is not correct. If it is correct I say that it is most unfair to Irish business people to be deprived of State business in such a way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the information of a company for the purposes proposed in the Bill.  I daresay when we hear a bit more about the development of our air force and about the modernisation of the ports taken over for imperial defence we can then see the use that can be made of the manufactured article.  I have however, considerable hesitation and I would say that in the present circumstances I could not possibly give a vote for this Bill because of the fact that the Minister proposed to acquire the raw material at a price, which I am sure, does not cover the cost of production.  The proposed company is to carry on on commercial lines in charging a certain price for the article.  If the proposed company is to carry on on a purely commercial basis it should be compelled to purchase the raw material at the ordinary commercial price and not at a figure which has unfortunately been <Col N="768" /> mentioned by the Minister during the discussion on this Bill.  Whether the potatoes are good, bad or indifferent it does not get away from the fact that the cost of production will be at least a certain minimum price.  I do not think that a commercial concern which it is proposed to establish under the terms of this Bill should get started, especially in view of the fact that the Minister is fixing in advance the price which will have to be paid for the raw material.  Unless the Minister changes his whole attitude in regard to the price to be paid for the raw material I propose to vote against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, it is proposed to do certain things which are going to cost the country a certain amount of money.  Whether we are going to get value for that money or not is a question of opinion.  In Great Britain they are installing plant for the distillation of coal.  They do not propose to instal a plant for the distillation of potatoes.  Instead of using potatoes for producing fuel, they are using the cheaper kind as a sort of feed for their stock.  The point that I wish to make on this Bill is much the same as Deputy Brodrick has already made &mdash;that the Minister in his speech gave no indication of the necessity for the very drastic powers that he is taking under this Bill.  I am aware that some of these powers are already in the Act with which the Bill deals.  I see that certainly not more than five factories will be required.  At the moment there is the difficulty about the supplying of the raw material. That confirms my view that not more than five factories will be needed.  I do not agree with the provision in this Bill which sets forth that land could be acquired at a month's notice. Even a local authority which is housing the poor has to have a considerable inquiry made before they can acquire land for housing.  Land for housing, to my mind, is much more important than land for the production of 1,500,000 gallons of industrial alcohol.  Certain powers are given in Section 30.  In Section 32 it appears to me that the Minister is given <Col N="769" /> power to override the courts, because the section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If, in the opinion of the Minister, the company or any person operating such transport works on behalf of the company has used such electrical power in contravention of such regulation... he may by order require the company to cease to exercise the powers conferred by such transport works order...</P>
      <P>In other words, the company may be brought before the courts and acquitted, and the Minister may say: &ldquo;You are not acquitted; you are guilty.&rdquo;  The Minister should not be given the drastic powers which he is taking under this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is, of course, inevitable that Deputy Dillon should take the attitude where anything which the Government has done or proposes to do is wrong.  He informed us that this was a mad scheme to start with, and that it is a still madder scheme to keep it going.  I think Deputy Moore replied very effectively to that point. If this is a mad thing to do, we are mad in good company, because practically every other country in the world is doing the same thing not, perhaps, for the same thing, not, perhaps, for the same reason as we are doing it, but they are doing it. France, Germany, Poland, and a number of other States are engaged in the production of industrial alcohol and they require their national compulsorily to use such alcohol in combination with petrol for a number of years. It may be that it is correct to say that the primary purpose behind that idea was strategic, that they were anxious to lessen their dependence on foreign fuel and to secure an alternative source which could be utilised in times of national emergency.  That was not the sole idea.  They also had the idea of assisting agriculture, and they were not concerned with the uneconomic use of land.  Deputies are aware that the land in France, Germany and Poland is more intensively utilised than the land in this country has been utilised or is ever likely to be utilised.  In those countries they have taken to the manufacture of industrial alcohol. Their reasons for doing this may be <Col N="770" /> lunacy, as Deputy Dillon has told the House.  The British Government has established plants for the production of industrial alcohol.  It is true that they are not using potatoes, but molasses.  The Australian Government is working on a plan whereby they produce alcohol from molasses because the material is available.  The British Government may be mad, as Deputy Dillon said.  The Australian Government may be mad, as be asserted.  We suggest that there is possibly another explanation, namely, that it is good policy and that the production of industrial alcohol is useful for many reasons.  Not merely is there an element of national security possible. They may have some other reason than their wish not to dependent on imported fuel.  It is desirable to take into account that the use of industrial alcohol as a raw material in industry is rapidly increasing, and the market for it is likely to be larger in the future.  Furthermore, there is an advantage in securing for the agricultural producers of the country another market for one of their products, and particularly for one of their products in respect of which there has been a most violent fluctuation of prices in the past.  I will deal with the price of potatoes at the moment.  I would like to mention, however, that when the first factory was started the prevailing price for potatoes, for which Deputy Brodrick says now he could get £3 10s. a ton, was 25/- a ton, and in the case of Donegal the price was £1 per ton.</P>

      <P>It does not make any difference.  I am not going to discuss agriculture.

That is due to circumstances of which many Deputies are aware and which I do not propose to elaborate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>America, in particular, even though there are very large oil-producing areas in that country.  We had also regard to the fact that it was an industrial raw material, the importance of which was growing considerably. We had further regard to the fact that employment would be provided in the manufacture of it but none of these factors constituted the real reason why this experiment was decided upon.  It was principally decide upon because it was considered desirable, in the interests of potato growers that this additional market should be made available.  It <Col N="772" /> is quite true that the circumstances have completely changed since then and that the market price for potatoes which, in 1934, when this scheme was started, was so low as to be ruinous to producers, has since increased to a point that is the highest reached during the last ten or 20 years.  In these circumstances, it is open to us to call this thing off and to ignore the possibility that the price may go down again but I do not think that is a wise thing to do.</P>
      <P>We can, of course, produce industrial alcohol from materials other than potatoes.  We can afford to pay the same price for starch content whether it comes from beet, molasses, or any other product but it is in the interests of the producers in the areas in which the factories are located that we should continue to use potatoes because in these areas they produce not beet.  If we want to turn over to some other product, we can do so.  We are told that it does not pay farmers to grow potatoes and sell them at £2 per ton. Deputy Davin announced it was his intention to vote against this Bill unless the factories are going to pay a competitive price.  Deputy Davin said he did not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a change of attitude.  Nobody suggested that the farmer was going to be taken before Civic Guards and made to sell his potatoes to the factory or be threatened with imprisonment if he did not do so.  The factory manager will go to the farmer and ask him: &ldquo;Do you want to enter into a contract for the sale of your potatoes to the factory?&rdquo; The farmer can say, if he wishes, that he does not think the price good enough, but as a matter of fact, <Col N="773" /> the farmers have said that they will enter into these contracts.  They find in Louth, Monaghan, and Donegal that £2 per ton, in the circumstances in which the potatoes are sold to the factories, is a better price than the prevailing market price.  They can sell their potatoes ungraded to the factory at that price.  It does not matter to the manager of the factory whether they are big potatoes or small potatoes provided they yield the requisite starch content.  When potatoes are sold in the market for human consumption they have to be graded.  The small potatoes and the bad potatoes have to be separated from the remainder of the crop.  For these graded potatoes there is undoubtedly a better price than £2 per ton prevailing at the moment, but the farmers think it pays them better to sell the whole of the ungraded crop at £2 per ton to the factory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the price offered.  With the exception of the Ballina factory we have got an adequate supply of potatoes in all cases.  The Ballina factory only commenced manufacture in March of this year and it is yet too early to say what our experience is likely to be there.  It is, of course, easy to talk about the price of this spirit being a &ldquo;cod.&rdquo;  It is quite true that industrial alcohol costs much more than we could buy imported petrol for.  It costs much more in every country but I should like to inform the House that <Col N="774" /> Deputy Dillon's statements concerning the value of industrial alcohol as fuel, merely showed his complete ignorance on the whole subject.  In Great Britain, last year, without any compulsion, the alcohol mixture sales were several hundred per cent. greater than the sales in 1936.  In fact, the highest type of motor fuel is a combination of petrol, industrial alcohol and benzol.  That is the highest grade of motor spirit used for aeroplanes doing record work and engaged on similar activities.  Industrial alcohol mixed in particular proportions with petrol and benzol is much the better kind of motor fuel.  Deputy Dillon's statement that it would damage motor engines merely shows that he did not take ordinary trouble to enquire into the facts of the situations. On its merits as a fuel, ad without compulsion, millions of gallons of this mixture were sold in Great Britain last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to take into account the fact that the petrol-distributing companies here are hostile to this development, that they have no interest in this country execept in so far as it can be exploited as a market for imported motor fuel.  We could not rely on their co-operation in marketing this industrial alcohol, and that is why we have taken power to compel them to do so.  That is the sole reason why these compulsory powers are necessary. Deputy Cosgrave raised some questions, which I could not quite follow, regarding the definition of industrial alcohol.  The definition has been changed, and I have explained the reason for that change.  I do not think it is necessary to elaborate it. It is, of course, correct that this Bill provides for compulsory powers to acquire land and to perform certain other operations.  It is necessary that these compulsory powers should be there.  It is the experience of all Governments that when land is being purchased by some Government Department, or by some organisation acting for a Government Department, it is impossible to get it at a reasonable price, unless there is power of compulsory acquisition at the back of it.  It is for that reason that powers <Col N="775" /> of compulsory acquisition have always to be given to public authorities, whether national or local, when there is necessity for the acquisition of land or other property.  This is a Government company, financed entirely out of Government money, and the same circumstances apply there.  In fact, of course, the powers provided for in this Bill have been in existence for the past four years.  They have been used on behalf of this undertaking for the past four years.  Most of the land which it was necessary to acquire has been acquired.  Most of the work which it was necessary to do has already been done, and the Deputy cannot produce one person who can contend with reason that he was unfairly treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <P>Not merely has it been the experience of Government Department that when they are engaging on the business of acquiring land the prices become exhorbitant against them, but it has even been the experience of purely private companies acting under statutory authority.  I mentioned here in this Dáil only a short time ago that it was my wish that the additional cement factory which is to be established should be located in a particular part of the country.  The directors of that factory have found that the price of land in that part of the country has become so high that one would imagine there was a gold mine under every acre of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Wicklow happens to be within the area specified. Directors of this enterprise, that is those who are now acting on the board which has been constituted by the Department of Industry and Commerce, <Col N="776" /> are as follows: Chairman, Dr. T.J.

The secretary of the Company is also an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon endeavoured to imply by means of a number of questions that there was something peculiar about the manner in which this enterprise was started or run, or something shady about the manner in which the contracts for the construction of the factory were given.  I do not propose to deal with the Deputy's questions. If he wants to throw mud be has got to take the risk of getting some of it on his hand.  He has got to state matters more specifically.  I will merely say that the contracts for the erection of the factory were given on the lowest tender.  There were in fact two firms associated with it, one a local firm and one an external firm. The contract for the supply of machinery was also given to the firm who submitted the lowest tender.  In fact, we have got industrial alcohol factories built, which are as I have said the most efficient in the world, and which could not be built to-day at double the price we paid for them.</P>

There is no foundation whatever for that.  In fact it would be incorrect to say that Mr. Maas's dissociation with the enterprise was a retirement.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon says this business will disappear in the course of four of five years.  I doubt that very much.  It is, of course, open to the Government to pursue in relation to this enterprise one or other of two policies.  We can regard those factories as a relief scheme for potato growers, operating them when potato <Col N="778" /> prices are low, taking surplus potatoes off the market and consequently fixing a price which will prevail all over the country, or we can keep them going year after year working on potatoes when we can get potatoes, and on molasses when potatoes are not available. The latter I think is the better course, but it is possible that the board of the company when established or some subsequent Government will decide to adopt another policy.  It is open to it to do so.  I do not think it would be a wise policy, but ther is undoubtedly a possibility of the policy being adopted.  At the beginning, I myself considered very carefully along which line to work, and we decided upon working towards getting the maximum possible production from the existing plants, utilising potatoes when potatoes are available, and continuing to work on molasses when potatoes are not available.  That is why molasses plants are being installed at the different centres, because it will enable production costs to be kept at their minimum, and the price of industrial alcohol to be reduced.  But there is an alternative policy which is quite defensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1937" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that imported molasses or molasses from the sugar factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is molasses from the sugar factories.  If we were to use imported molasses, which could be purchased much more cheaply, we could of course reduce very substantially the price at which industrial alcohol is being made available.  I do not think there is anything further which I need say at this stage.  Some of the points raised by other Deputies could I think be more conveniently discussed in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this industrial alcohol scheme is one which is worth while maintaining.  It is true that the price at which the alcohol is made available looks high when compared with the price of petrol.  It is not high compared with the price at which industrial alcohol can be purchased, but it is high as compared with the price of petrol.  Of course industrial alcohol is not substituted for petrol gallon for <Col N="779" /> gallon.  It can be utilised as a motor fuel only in mixture with petrol.  The effect of the production of 1,500,000 gallons of motor spirit and its utilisation and sale to the petrol distributors has already been experienced by petrol consumers, who have had the price of motor spirit increased by a halfpenny per gallon.  On the basis of 35,000,000 gallons per year, that involves an increased charge of £75,000 per year. But it is difficult, of course, to determine precisely to what extent the present price of petrol is justified by the charges which petrol distributors have to meet.  That may be a matter for inquiry at some time.</P>
    <P>I merely draw attention to the fact that the advantages which are being secured by way of direct employment for a number of workers, utilisation of native materials, the payment to the producers of these materials, and the lessening of our dependency on external sources for an article which has now become a necessity of life will exceed the cost of the additional charge.  It is on that account, I think, that not merely is it good policy to maintain this industry, at least to the extent of its present development, but that any future Government will come to the same conclusion.  There is, in fact, the possibility that it may prove at the same time to be good policy to extend this industry substantially and to aim at the production, not of 1,500,000 gallons, but of a much larger quantity.  I do not think, however, that it is desirable to contemplate any such expansion yet until we have completed the experimental stage in respect of the five distilleries we have. They will only commence working in full production in the coming season. Perhaps it may be found possible to overcome some difficulties that still remain, such as the difficulty of disposing of the by-product.  If that is done, then of course a substantial saving in costs may be produced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some farmers have contracted to supply potatoes; other <Col N="780" /> farmers have not contracted, but nevertheless will sell their potatoes to the factory if they find it in their interests to do so.  It is, however, a practice which the company is endeavouring to establish of getting farmers to contract to supply at the beginning of the year, and a number of farmers in various areas have made contracts for the coming season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>These will be contracts at £2 per ton.  Supposing the market price of potatoes goes up for next season, will the Minister consider allowing farmers in these areas to sell their first-grade potatoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer will have to take his chance as well as everybody else.  If he contracts to sell at a particular price, he may have reason to regret having done so if the market price goes up, but he may have reason to be very glad if the market price goes down.  The average farmer considers it much better to be certain of a sure market at that price year after year than depending on the off-chance of a higher price and a possible sale in the open market.  It is because the commonsense of that has appealed to the farmers of Cooley, Monaghan, and Donegal, that the factories have no difficulty in getting all the potatoes they want.</P>

      <P>I do not want to hinder the factories in any way.  In fact, I would like to induce people to grow potatoes.  My point is that if people have signed contracts, and the market price goes up to £3, will the Minister not give the farmers a concession by allowing them to grow what is known as first-grade potatoes and sell them at the market price?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat the references that were made to the failure of one afforestation experiment that was carried out 40 years ago.  Reasons have been adduced for that failure, one reason being that as considerable damage was done by fire the plantation had no chance of succeeding. It would serve no useful purpose <Col N="784" /> to hark back to that now.  Many places in West Galway were mentioned as suitable places for planting where land was offered for that purpose. I was instrumental in having many places put forward and I went to the trouble of having a committee selected.  I asked them to consider the possibility of getting suitable land but a great many of the places suggested were turned down.  However, some places in Connemara area have not been definitely turned down by the Department.  I remember that last year the Minister stated that some good work might be done in Recess and I was hoping that some scheme of planting would be undertaken before this Vote came on.  I draw the Minister's attention to the references I made to Recess last year, and I ask the Department to consider the possibility of having some planting done. It is very close to Ballinahinch where trees have been grown successfully.  I also referred to Secon near Oughterard. As the wood was cut there during the Great War the extraordinary statement was made to me, that the fact that trees grew there before was no guarantee that they would grow there again.  It is hard to get the public to accept a statement like that. The place is well sheltered.  I think the Department should pluck up courage and consider planting at Recess and Secon.  I also wish to bring to the Minister's attention a place at Rosmuck known as Crockadav or Ox Mountain.  It is not my intention to hurl complaints at the Department but to ask that these three places be considered for planting. The general opinion in Connemara is that trees can be grown there. I ask the Minister to take particular notice of these places with a view to having something done there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the advantage of reading the book that was referred to in such terms of praise by Deputy Dowdall.  The fact that the Deputy is a commercial man and interested in the production of wealth means, I have no doubt, that it is deserving of all he has said about it. Deputies who spoke on this Vote emphasised the value of considerable <Col N="785" /> expenditure under it.  Considering that it is the only Department of State that is engaged in active production, it is a surprise to me that the Minister has seen fit to reduce his Vote instead of increasing it, considering that in his Department he has officials who are very well versed in the carrying out of a great industry.  Every country practically in the world to-day has developed the question of forestry and has done it successfully, except this country, and I would remind the Minister that there is a huge area available to him, not alone all over the whole Irish Free State, but particularly in County Cork.  It was referred to by one Deputy as hundreds of acres.  I say thousands of acres are available.  Before this country took up the reins of government, private enterprise dealt very exhaustively with this particular class of industry and did so successfully.  I can refer to one particular landowner, Sir George Colthurst, in the City of Cork, who had developed the timber industry almost to a regular business.  He had a rotation estate where he planted and cut timber, and as soon as ever he could-after a very short interval&mdash;he planted again.  There are places of that description available to-day. Owing to the economic position of affairs in this country, landowners cut down their timber and they did not plant again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that a recommendation made by Deputy Brennan on a former occasion here is deserving of the consideration of the Minister, not in the small way that it was put by the Deputy where he suggested that four or five acres should be planted on the farms by the State, but it would be very well worth the while of the Minister to take up these unplanted lands or land where timber has been cut and for the sake of giving employment, for the sake of adding to the wealth of the State that he would plant them with timber.  There are further aspects centring round the question of forestry.  There is its great commercial value; there is the vast field that it gives for employment and productive employment&mdash;not perhaps in some directions where there is no productive value to be derived&mdash;and it is a <Col N="786" /> class of employment that I think would be very favourably entertained by those who require employment, that is in rural areas.  I say that is a vast field for the Minister to consider.  The Minister has promised to plant a very slightly increased area on his reduced Vote but we cannot ignore the fact that the Department which he controls is very conservative in their attitude with regard to the acquisition of land for forestry purposes.  In agriculture we found good land and we found bad land and even the very worst land is found and a living is derived from it provided there is adequate capital and experience.  The same can be got in forestry.  You can plant a class of trees that are suitable for an inferior class of land, even if you have a very prolonged number of years before you get results.  At any rate to plant these lands and bring them into production is a very essential thing for the Minister whose special care the production of land properly is.</P>
    <P>Now we cannot ignore the fact that there is a very small staff employed by the Forestry Department and I suggest that, having regard to the fact that the Minister has a very skilled staff in his Department it ought not to be difficult to train extra hands.  Reference has been made to the difficulty of procuring trees.  Well I am told that we have in the Cork County a nursery established and run by the Cork County Council.  It is not the business of a local authority to run a thing of that kind.  It is the business of the Minister and I suggest that the proper course for him is to take over that county council nursery and run it for the advantage of land holders in County Cork or the Southern area and also because it is in a very central position it is a land that is very suitable, and I am sure by the supervision which the Minister's department would be able to bring to bear that there is no question that that nursery could be run on up-to-date lines and on lines that would carry out the intentions of the Forestry Department.  I suggest to the Minister that those people who ran all this kind of thing as private enterprises in the past did not <Col N="787" /> question or did not look to whether the land was very suitable for it.  They simply planted it because they had the land to plant and I suggest that these lands are going waste and that it is up to the Minister to take up that particular side of it and to give consideration to the possibility of widening the scope of the activities of his Department and planting with the avowed object of giving the necessary employment which is so urgent in this country to-day and at the same time bringing into production those lands which in the past have been found absolutely suitable for plantation and which will be providing a great source of national wealth. Restrictions could be placed upon these people to prevent them cutting them down but as they are waste at the present moment I do not think that that is necessary so long as they give a guarantee to care these lands and to look after them and not to cut them down.  I do believe that that side of the question is worthy of the consideration of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there are 33 pupils for forestry purposes.  Well considering the area of Éire that is an absolutely inadequate number and I would ask the Minister to seriously consider the question of increasing that number with a view to increasing the production of his particular Department.  In County Cork there is in the neighbourhood of Glengowan and Carrignavar at least a couple of thousand of acres that are absolutely suitable for planting and there are other parts of the country adjoining the mountain formerly occupied by the Duke of Devonshire, which have been planted and in the immediate neighbourhood there are other areas which I have brought to the attention of the Department, notably Moville and Dungarvan, and also an estate that was mentioned by Deputy Corry here the last day, that is the Rostellan estate.  The Department of Lands has contemplated the division of that estate but, as apparently they cannot make up their minds as to its suitability, I suggest that the Minister would take over the whole of that estate and plant it.  The land is not exactly over good&mdash;<Col N="788" /> it would not be exactly prized by those amongst whom you would divide it&mdash; and I suggest that it is eminently suitable for the planting of forest trees, and having regard to the very large area that is available in the County Cork and the big tracts that are suitable for this particular purpose, I suggest that the Minister might extend his Department to a very much larger degree than what he is doing at present.  Instead of curtailing the Vote I suggest that he should increase it.  It is a Vote which, as I say, is the one which is likely to make for a direct production in the country, and as the Minister is controlled by a staff which probably comes to a good deal of money he might as well increase their activities without increasing the overhead expenses of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate only to make a plea for the wide opportunities that the constituency of West Cork&mdash;the County of Cork generally&mdash;but particularly that remote portion of the county which is included in the constituency of West Cork&mdash;offers to the Minister for an expansion of forestry operations.  A beginning has been made in the county, the western portion of the county, and a very modest beginning indeed.  I would urge the Minister that the wide opportunities that are there by reason of the large amount of land that is suitable for purposes of this kind should be a reason why this work could be expanded very considerably in that area.  Now I think we have a special claim in that area. We have not had any of the benefits in the way of factories or industries of the policy of the Government.  In fact the only State employment that is available there is the amount of work that is provided in the way of one relief scheme or another, and I think our location and the nature and description of the land available make the constituency eminently suitable for an extension of this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the plantations that exist and that are being carried on, I may also point to the fact that peculiar circumstances in the matter of wages will now exist.  Since the main Vote for the Minister's Department was before the House a change in agricultural <Col N="789" /> wages has taken place, and the position now would be unless the wages of forestry workers are revised immediately farmers will be compelled to pay, and properly compelled to pay, at a higher rate than the State Department pays for forestry work.  That is a very peculiar position, and I bring the matter to the notice of the Minister in the hope that an early announcement will be made indicating an increase in the wages of the forestry workers. There is in the area of which I speak as well as in other areas some objection to the acquisition of the land on the ground that it is unsuitable.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder whether it would be a practical suggestion that in the event of the land being found unsuitable for a certain class of timber, it might be possible to find another variety of timber not so valuable that would be suitable for planting there.  I put that suggestion forward in the hope that it may be considered as a good suggestion.  I will not now urge the value of forestry. There has been an emphasis during the course of this debate and indeed every other debate for the last 15 years on the importance of forestry.  The force of that is accepted and there is now no need to take up time unduly emphasising the importance of forestry. What we do want is an extension of the very worthy operations of this Department that are now carried on on a very small and inadequate scale.  We ask for a fair revision of the workers' wages and a continuation and an extension of the forestry policy as far as possible.  I do not think I should sit down without expressing my own appreciation at the courtesy and efficiency of the officials of the Department.  Anyone who has met the officials of the Department of Forestry has always found them courteous and helpful and most efficient in their work; it is a great pleasure to me to say so on this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was introducing this Estimate, he stated that forestry operations are now being carried out in 24 counties.  I happen to be one of the representatives of a county where no forestry operations have so far been undertaken.  That is rather an unenviable position in which to find oneself.  The Minister stated <Col N="790" /> that in the near future he would be able to extend operations to the other two counties.  I admit that in Meath we have no large tracts of land for forestry purposes.  We cannot speak about tracts of land of 2,000 to 3,000 acres being available.  We have at least put forward three schemes where we consider the land suitable for tree planting and unsuitable for tillage or pasture purposes.  I might specially mention Ballynabracky, Collon and the Nobber areas.  The only other areas that we offered to the Forestry Department comprises cut-away bog.  I understand that the experts who have examined these sites have turned down cut-away bog as unsuitable soil.  In connection with this matter, I wish to ask the Minister if investigations have been carried out in regard to the future possibilities of the bogs for forestry purpose, and whether any research has been made in connection with the treatment of uneconomic soil. If these cut-away areas could be planted with timber, it would be of inestimable value to the countryside and be a great national asset.</P>
      <P>I believe, in cases where a licence-has been granted for the cutting down of timber, there has been a general disregard of the policy of replanting.  I understand that where a licence is given to a farmer to cut down trees, there is a stipulation that the place should be replanted.  I fear that rule has not been enforced.  I find in a great many places where timber has been cut away, there have not been trees planted.  I would like if the Minister would say if there is any penalty for this transgression, or if the penalty is being imposed.  I know there is a penalty for cutting timber without first securing a licence.  I do not know whether there is a penalty where the owner will not replant the cut-away area.  I would also like to know, where there are small plantations planted as a result of such an order, if there is any supervision afterwards to see if the trees are being attended to in a proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am mostly concerned with the future of the furniture industry in County Meath.  We have an old-established furniture industry in Meath and that has been very progressive in the past few years.  That industry is <Col N="791" /> expanding and is giving a great deal of employment.  It is absolutely essential for its success that the raw material should be in close proximity to the centre of the industry, so that there should be no diminution in the supply.  After all, we are only custodians in this regard; the wealth of timber in the country should be preserved. This property has been handed down to us, and the least we might be expected to do is to see that there would be no wastage and that the trees cut down should be replaced. We should in no way reduce the potential value of this wealth.  I believe that the conservation of the timber stock in the country is of great importance, not only to the furniture industry, but to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The scheme whereby a subsidy of £4 an acre is given by the Department to a farmer who plants five acres of ground, or where two or three farmers combine together to plant five acres between them, has not proved successful. I think it will be found on examining the plan that the initial outlay is too much.  I refer to the outlay in preparing the site, purchasing the trees and planting them. The outlay is too much for the farmer who plants any considerable area under trees.</P>
    <P>All, of course, we could expect to secure as a result of this subsidy would be the plantation of shelter belts.  I do believe that there should be some co-operation between the Forestry Department and the Department of Agriculture in connection with the planting of trees.  In County Meath, under the Department of Agriculture, we have a scheme whereby a subsidy is given to farmers to a maximum of £3 for planting trees.  Last year some £420 was paid out in subsidies on that scheme.  The horticultural instructors ensure proper planting and treatment, and they act as foresters, or, at least, they supervise for some period afterwards. Here, again, however, you can only expect farmers to plant shelter belts. One cannot expect that they will go in for very large planting operations. Consequently, you find that mere <Col N="792" /> shelter belts and other necessary timbers are being planted by the farmers for their own use.  I would suggest that there should be some extension along those lines, or, at least, that it is worthy of the consideration of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>The machinery of the Department of Agriculture, through its county committees, could be very usefully employed.  What I want to emphasise is that small plots should not be despised.  At the moment we are not able to put up 300 acres, or, at least, there are only very few such tracts of land.  Practically every farmer, however, could devote a small acreage to forestry&mdash;from one acre upwards.  I know that the Forestry Department will not tolerate anything under the five acres for which they give a small subsidy.  However, I do believe that, with the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture, some scheme could be devised under which such small plots from an acre upwards could be taken over, and even though they would not become State property afterwards, possibly the land owner might be released of all charges for some years.  In regard to the planting of such crops, possibly the co-operation of the Board of Works could be obtained.  Through its unemployment scheme, possibly it would be in a position to have the ground cleaned and planted.  Afterwards, of course, the committee of agriculture could supervise the growing of the trees, to see that they were being attended to properly.  One of the horticultural instructors could act as forester, at least until such time as all the small plantations in the district would become so numerous that they would warrant the appointment of a full-time forester.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I wish to refer, namely, Arbor Day.  I cannot see why we should be confined to one Arbor Day in a matter of such tremendous importance as that of forestry.  We are not far removed from the time when we had an Irish Week, when it was considered patriotic to buy all Irish goods during one week of the year.  Our <Col N="793" /> commonsense now dictates that we should always buy Irish goods.  That has been made possible by Governmental action.  Something similar should take place in connection with forestry.  We should not be confined to one day in the year.  It should not be considered merely patriotic to plant trees on one day in the year. It should be considered a commonsense thing to plant trees every day during the planting season.  We cannot, of course, plant trees every day of the year but we could plant them certainly on every day during the planting season.  I think that by Departmental action farmers could be placed in that position that they would consider it the proper thing to do if they were given proper facilities and if it were brought home to them that they would benefit as a result.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary that a publicity campaign should be started. Other Departments have had their publicity campaigns.  You had &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Burn More Turf&rdquo; and other such slogans.  Now, I suggest that the Forestry Department should institute one more, &ldquo;Plant More Trees.&rdquo; I believe that, if we point out to the community their responsibility in this matter and point out to them the advantages to be gained by this country as a result of such planting, the response would be very big indeed.  I think it is necessary that you should win over public opinion in favour of going ahead with an afforestation scheme.  If you do that, at least you ensure in the country districts that you will have no illegal cutting of timber.  You will also ensure that where trees are planted they will be attended to properly.  The movement would be widespread; it would not be confined to restricted areas, or to Arbor Days.  I believe there is a big push forward necessary especially in counties where there are no large tracts available for planting but where small plots could be secured.  I believe there are three adjuncts necessary to the promotion of these schemes.  You must win the sympathy and the co-operation of the people.  Then you must be prepared to take over all the small plots offered <Col N="794" /> for planting and you must have the co-operation of the other Departments, the Department of Agriculture and the Board of Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate until I heard the statement made that the great difficulty experienced in the experts' department of the forestry section was that they found that the lands which were offered to them were unsuitable. As the debate has developed practically into a parish affair, I think I might as well intervene, because if the royal, rolling plains of Meath want afforestation, I am afraid our barren waste lands of North Cork need it far greater.  I shall make a fair sporting offer to the Minister.  If he considers that there is no suitable land for afforestation, I offer him land of two types, land that has not in either case grown pine or fir, but hard wood, for the last 30 years.  In the first case, there are large tracts of land on which timber was cut down during the Great War.  I do not think any expert could argue that they would not be suitable for afforestation.  In a large area from Mallow to the Kerry border, huge tracts of forest timber were cut away during the Great War, to the terrible loss of the countryside, not alone from the point of view of their value as shelter, but also from the point of view of the appearance of the countryside.  There is quite a large area there which I do not think anybody could question is eminently suitable for afforestation.</P>
      <P>There is also a second type of land I do not think the experts could say is unsuitable for timber growing.  That is the large tract in North Cork where the timber was burned down by the British military during the Anglo-Irish War. That area has been left practically derelict.  I think that if the Minister's experts could inspect these areas they would be satisfied that they are suitable for afforestation.  The areas I mention are a low line of hills running from west to east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If reafforestation schemes were carried out there, it would be of great value to the countryside, particularly from the point of view of shelter, because the countryside has become very barren and practically all the <Col N="795" /> shelter that was there, shelter from the prevailing south-west winds in that area, was taken away when those woods were cut down.  I want to refer to one other point, which I think was mentioned by Deputy Kennedy.  I am very much inclined to agree with him that the Department should consider growing something else besides ordinary soft woods like fir or pine.  I believe that if we did go in for hard woods, even though you might not have the quick result which you would have from the other type of plantation, you would probably have better value in the long run.  I would also suggest that one of the great drawbacks about the type of planting which is done by individuals in this country is the fact that when they plant shelter belts, when they plant two or three acres of waste land of their own with pine or fir or something like that, there is no great attention given to it after the original planting.  Instead of being properly thinned out when they are growing, the trees are allowed to grow to a certain height until they are of absolutely no value at all.  There is great lack of attention to a real knowledge of forestry purposes amongst individuals in the country.  I myself believe that there is no use in any Deputy saying there is not plenty of land available for afforestation purposes. From every point of view, if I were satisfied that a great number of people could be put working on reafforestation schemes at decent wages, I would regard those schemes as of great national benefit, not alone from the point of view that you would be creating a national asset but also from the point of view that for the expenditure of a little extra money you would be giving work to people who would otherwise be idle.  That would be of great value to the State.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of cutting down and replanting.  As far as I understand it, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Kelly that while there are penalties for the cutting of trees without licence, there does not seem to be any compulsion on people to replant.  Everybody seems to be <Col N="796" /> satisfied that there is a means of compelling them to replant, but, to my mind, it is never done.  Some people seem to have the idea that there is not enough land available for afforestation. I am perfectly satisfied that there is.  As I said, if the Minister sends an expert into the area I represent I will show him the two types of land which I mentioned&mdash; areas where trees were cut down during the war, when timber was valuable and a great lot of money was made out of it, no trees having been planted there since, and other areas where timber was cut down by the British military after ambushes, nothing having been planted there since.  I think if the experts look along those lines of hills they will be satisfied that the country would be deriving great benefit from the replanting of those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points to which I should like to refer on this Estimate.  Deputy Linehan has referred to the question of the experts, and their reports so far as our county is concerned.  Some years ago forestry inspectors visited certain areas in Kerry and furnished adverse reports on them.  They reported in one case that there was acid in the soil, while in another case they reported that the areas were wind-swept, and therefore unsuitable for reafforestation purposes.  In two of those areas when the Director of Afforestation appointed by our Government carried out a second inspection he approved of those areas as being suitable for afforestation purposes. That is one instance where we are shown the fallacy of those experts' findings and reports in so far as our county is concerned.  We believe that we did good work in obtaining that decision, and roughly about two years ago the Forestry Department did their utmost to press the matter to its conclusion. They asked the Land Commission to co-operate.  Some difficulties had arisen in regard to title and that kind of thing, but the Land Commission, I think, did not even reply to us.  There was no co-operation whatever. The officials in the Forestry <Col N="797" /> Department went all out to put the scheme into operation.  Although the scheme had been sanctioned, there was no co-operation on the part of the Land Commission, whose duty it was to facilitate the forestry section in regard to the transfer of title, the carrying through of agreement and so on.  Nothing has been done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a suggestion, the adoption of which I think would be a big step forward, and I should like the Minister to take a note of it. I would suggest that in any future inspections by the Forestry Department, an inspector representing the Land Commission should co-operate with the inspector from the Forestry branch.  In that way you will have cohesion.  Each inspector will represent a different type of administration, and both of them would have first hand knowledge of the difficulties confronting them.  That is a suggestion which I think should meet with approval both from the Minister and his Department.  In regard to commercial timber, I think the big snag at the moment is that the forestry section are concentrating altogether on the growing of what they call commercial timber.  They hesitate to approve of any area except one where an afforestation scheme will result in the growing of commercial timber, timber which will pay for itself within about 15 years.  The sooner the Department gets away from that line of action the better.  I would suggest that instead of concentrating on certain areas for the production of commercial timber they should extend their operations into those places which are referred to as wind-swept areas.  There are areas in South Kerry which, in my opinion and in the opinion of people who have some knowledge of afforestation, are second to none in the country&mdash;areas from Caragh Lake and Glenbeigh on to Caherdaniel.  Those areas are naturally suited for afforestation.  Their location, their southerly aspect, lends itself to a type of afforestation which would be of great benefit to the State. Deputy Linehan referred to the advantages of afforestation from the point <Col N="798" /> of view of the scenic beauty of the countryside.  I entirely agree with him, in so far as it is true that most areas in Cork and Kerry have been deprived of that great attraction.  During the Great War period large tracts of trees were cut down and the countryside destroyed.  If the Forestry branch would review the whole question as it concerns us, I am sure that the people of Kerry will be able to prove that these areas are on a par with the areas I refer to, that is the areas where the Director of Forestry proved that the inspectors were incorrect. The inference, of course, would be that the officials of the Department did not have expert knowledge.  In my opinion that is not so.  It could be explained in this way, that the inspectors who had heretofore carried out inspections probably did not intend to extend, and that is why they issued adverse reports in regard to the areas that were subsequently approved of by the Director of Forestry.</P>
    <P>As to the extent of the areas for planting, I could never understand why the Forestry Branch decided on 300 acres; why blocks of land comprising less than 300 acres could not be considered. Both from the economic and administrative points of view, I think that something less than 300 acres would suffice.  In the areas I refer to you could easily make it up by having a central plot of 50 or 100 acres and develop from that centre by having 40 or 100 acres, as the case may be, inside a radius of four or five miles.  I believe that that type of scheme would lend itself to the mountainous areas to which I refer.  I also suggest in connection with this afforestation scheme that there should be co-operation not alone between the Land Commission and the Forestry Branch, but between the Forestry Branch and the Board of Works as well.  The Board of Works could co-operate in so far as certain preliminary work is concerned.  Fencing and clearing and all that kind of thing could be carried out as minor relief schemes in the different districts.  It may be pointed out that one Department is responsible and that it would be difficult for another Department to work in that type of development.  However, <Col N="799" /> I make the suggestion with a view to voicing the opinion of the people in the rural districts and also my own views in regard to extension of the operations of the Forestry Branch.</P>
    <P>The main reason why I refer to shelter belts is that not alone should the Forestry Branch make it possible for operations to be carried on in certain scheduled areas, but they should also at the same time carry on extensive operations in these areas.  Why not go in for the planting of all types of timber? If it is a State charge, why concentrate on a certain output per year? As was pointed out by Deputy Dowdall the other day, it would take another 50 years before you get into your stride, before you reach the peak point in development.  If you concentrate on 1,000 acres per county this year and no more, you are still only on the fringe of the development of afforestation.  The main thing I want to impress on the Minister is that areas that might be rejected as not being suitable for growing commercial timber should be utilised for other types of afforestation which would beautify the countryside and give a good lot of employment and which would assist the people to develop their own districts.  I hope that any remarks that I have made will be found helpful and that they will get consideration by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate were it not for the statements made by Deputies, or rather lack of statements.  Most Deputies who have spoken come from the country, and I was never so amazed in all my life as I was when I listened to Deputies from the country and found that they knew so little about timber. One thing which caused me to intervene was the statement made the other day that there were two schools of thought in the Forestry Department with regard to the classes of timber which should be planted&mdash;one school which favoured resinous or soft timber and another school which favoured hard timber.  If there are two schools of thought, it is time that the people here who are responsible to the voters made up their minds as to what is the right policy.  If we are going to have hard timber <Col N="800" /> planted in the country it means that we must devote to the planting of hard timber good deep arable land.  You will not grow hard timber on any land except good land.  You will not grow oak, although it will stand more moisture than most of the other timbers, because it must have good heavy land. You will not grow elm except on exceptionally good land.  You will not grow beech or any of the other hard timbers except on good land.  We have not any good land in the country to devote to hard timber.  The hard timbers we are dealing with now were planted from 90 to 150 years ago to meet what men thought were the necessities of that day. When we go back 100 or 150 years and realise what was in men's minds at that time and how much these ideas have worn out we will find that there is no use now for the stuff these people planted.  Times have changed altogether and, in my opinion, there is no use whatever for hard timber in this country.  There will always be enough to meet the necessities.  There will always be enough hedge timber here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion a few years ago to sell timber&mdash;about 300 ash trees, 100 oak trees, and some sycamore.  These trees were lying for two years on the railway bank in Kilkenny and I could not get a market for them.  I venture to say that some of it was the best ash in Ireland with regard to strain.  I think the Minister will admit that I know something about ash.  He will remember the old days.  Very few people in this House, or in any other House, know more about the quality of ash than I do.  What is beech worth a ton to-day?  Can it be sold at all?  I would sell 1,000 tons of beech if I could get 4/- or 5/- a ton for it.  There is no one to buy it.  The bobbin trade for which it was intended is gone.  A certain amount of ash will always be in demand, but enough will be grown in the hedges to supply shafts and handles.  The fact is that I had timber lying at the railway siding for two years but no Irish firm would take it. It was hoped to get a trade for it in England, but the market went down because of the economic war or something like that.  The timber was lying <Col N="801" /> there until I got the railway company to buy it for building carriages.  The railway company also took oak for sleepers but principally for making frames for wagons.  Otherwise, the only demand for oak would be for coffins. That demand is met by white elm and brown elm.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to talk of planting hard timber to any extent in this country, because the market is gone, and the land that would grow it could be devoted to other purposes.  There is nothing left except resinous timber for which there are two or three markets, for pit props, wood pulp and for ordinary house building.  There is always a market for soft timber which comes in in a short time and gives a full return. There is another timber to which I direct the Minister's attention&mdash; Spanish chestnut.  This timber is of great value, and as it lasts longer it is better than ash for stakes.  It is next to pitch pine in that respect.  It may have some faults and be easily split. On going through England it will be noticed that copses that were planted ten or 12 years ago have been cut down, having realised from £60 to £70.  Young Spanish chestnut saplings are planted to meet the English trade.  All the hampers, packing cases and fences around bungalows are made from split sweet chestnut timber.  There is an everlasting market there for that class of timber, and I ask the Minister to turn the attention of the Department in that direction.  He should be well advised on this question.  It is his duty to know that he is being well served by the advice he gets.  I think the Department was responsible, since this Government took office, for the division of an estate at Castlemorris.  Some of the finest land in County Kilkenny was then planted with hard timber.  I had grazing there, and the only trouble with regard to the fertility of the grass was that it was a bit sour.  It produced the heaviest hay in County Kilkenny. I do not know why that land was put under hard timber.  A few of the workmen got four acres each, but that was in the boggy portion of the estate.  There is no going back on that now, but I think it was an undefensible <Col N="802" /> policy.  I could not understand why it was done.</P>
    <P>There is another market for ash if it is skilfully grown.  The best market is in this country for the making of hurleys.  I do not care whether it is grown on the flat or on the sides of streams, there is more value in young ash than in any other timber that can be grown.  I have seen ash that would make ten hurleys, about 10 to 15 inches square, sold from £1 to 30/-.  No other timber except walnut will give such a return for hurleys.  The soil, of course, has a considerable amount to do with the quality of timber, but strain has much more to do with it.  As I made more hurleys and won more championships than anyone in Ireland, I say that strain has a great deal to do with the quality of timber.  I have seen trees grown on the same fence, and while one would be the best in its class, the rest might be useless.  Strain has everything to do in ash.  I do not know anything about pollination.  The Minister would be well advised, wherever he is planting hard timber on banks or on streams, to concentrate on ash.  I do not promise that all he plants will be collected.  It would not in my time.  England is a country similar to this, but more timber is grown there.  To a considerable extent it is brain work there, and it is made the business of a man on an estate to be responsible for planting.  That man is thinking of nothing but of making the estate profitable.  It would be well worth while sending an expert over to see what is being done in the way of planting.  If Deputies do not agree with what I am saying about plantations of sweet chestnut, they would be surprised by what an expert could tell them of what is being done in England.</P>
    <P>Now, I know that there is a lot of influence brought to bear on the Department.  I know that a few people here interested in the timber trade have had a royal time in the last few years.  They have had businesses set up for them, plans set up for them, and their advice will be very prejudicial advice, and I warn the Minister to be very chary before he would accept it at all, and have it well examined.  I will <Col N="803" /> not mention any names.  The Minister ought to know himself.  On the question of hard timber&mdash;what does he get for hard timber, where can he sell it? Take an estate in my county, the Desart estate, sold to a merchant&mdash; McAnnish&mdash;I want to say, in passing, one of the decentest men in the trade, perhaps the decentest man in the timber trade&mdash;but there are other types in the timber trade I would not like to meet, who would take three or four years to settle their account. What was realised per tree or per acre for the Desart property that was sold? And what was the length of time since they were sold?  I do not suppose he knows, but if he could get definite information he would find it was a hundred years since those trees were sold.  I would ask the Minister to pay no attention to this campaign for hard timber.  There is no market for it, no use for it; its day is gone.  There is, no doubt, a market for soft resinous timber, two or three markets for it, a market for ash, there is always a certain market for ash of a good quality, a good market for oak and a small market for elm.  But that can be found in the hedges.  We will get enough off the hedges to bury all the people that we have.  There is very little left for the Minister except to turn his attention to the timber that can be sold in the free markets, for pulp and building material, and ash, and I think if he concentrates on that he would be doing wisely.  Our object is to get the most out of production, and you will not get it growing hard timber, and all the land that it is occupying for a period of 100 or 150 years is waste land.  Beech never gave a return.  We are selling it now at 2/- and 3/- and 5/- a ton.  It is useless.  The land it has been occupying for 150 years has been waste land, and not only that, but it is poisoning the country with its leaves.  When people here give advice they ought to know something of the advice they give and the value of it. As I said before, the Minister would be well advised in a big campaign like this campaign for afforestation to have the best expert advice he can get, no matter what he pays for it, and no matter what trouble he goes to to get <Col N="804" /> it.  At least it is his duty to know when he is well served in that, and if he is, forestry may be left in his hands.</P>

      <P>On listening to this debate, it is clear that there is one thing that is perfectly obvious, and that is that there is extraordinary unanimity in this House amongst all members and Parties that a forward <Col N="806" /> movement in forestry is necessary.  I am wholeheartedly in favour of such a forward movement.  I would like to say that I think the only reason why such a forward movement is not in progress in this country at the moment is because of the fact that the general public have not been educated up to the value and the importance of reafforestation.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about it that the officials of the Department with the limited resources at their disposal have done everything that could possibly have been done to forward the interests of the forestry movement and in reafforesting this country.  Before we can get anything done, it is necessary that a healthy public opinion should be created.  The place from which that healthy public opinion should be commenced is, I suggest, the Department Estimate with which we are now dealing.  From day to day we are discussing in these Estimates various sums of money for which we vote for the public good.  I divide these Estimates into two classes: (1) that class of Estimate which is introduced for the purpose of paying for certain services in respect of which there is no financial return, such as the Gárda, or officers of that kind in the State.  On the other hand, you have Estimates which are voted for the purpose of services which do give a return, namely, the Post Office service, and services of that kind.  But there is practically no money voted in this House which is going to give a return in the future as great as that of the money voted for forestry.  The Minister and the Deputies, I think, are in agreement with what I am saying now, and it is very necessary that it should be appreciated that the wealth that forestry can produce can not give a return in our generation.  We are dealing with a particular crop and a particular type of substance that grows in our soil, and which cannot give a return in this generation.  Therefore, no particular individual, be he ever so earnestly interested in the subject, is going to go out of his way to replant his land or to store up this wealth for <Col N="807" /> the future.  For that reason, this is a matter which should be the direct concern of the State, which never dies and which knows no generation.  We have all kinds of suitable timber that can be grown in this country.  I listened just now to what Deputy Gorey said, and I am very sorry to have to differ from him on one or two matters.  I do believe that there is a good market for certain types of hard wood in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy afterwards.  This is a matter which can be dealt with by experts. Fortunately, in the past six months I did not have the same sad experience in the marketing of timber that Deputy Gorey has had.  I will not discuss that with him here; I will give him the particulars outside.  But having some slight knowledge of the matter, having marketed timber myself recently and growing timber at present, I know that there is a market for certain types of hard wood.  There would be such a market in the future for certain types of hard wood which are suitable for growing here.  The importance to the State of the reafforestation is this, that it is building up wealth for the future.  They do not expect any immediate return from it.  The reafforestation of the land should be taken altogether out of the hands of private individuals and should be placed in the hands of the State.  It should be placed in the hands of a very large and substantially manned Government Department with enormous resources behind it.  Certain of our moneys and, if necessary, large sums of our moneys can be invested in it.  I suggest that should be done and, if necessary, the money can be raised on loan.  It will repay the money many times over and will repay it even with compound interest.  In investing money in the reafforestation of the country you are doing two things-you are building up wealth for the future and you are not asking the future generation to pay for it.  In addition to that, if reafforestation is carried out on very <Col N="808" /> large and very substantial lines, you will be placing a large number of people in employment throughout the country.  In that respect you get an immediate return for the investment of public money, and you will be building up resources which, in a generation or two, will be useful as security for loans if you want to raise money then for other purposes.</P>
      <P>This is entirely a matter for the State and particularly for the Government and the Minister who has charge of this Department.  It is for him to consider whether in the near future the Government will not embark on a much larger scheme than is compassed by their present policy. There has been some criticism from all sides of the House as to what class of timber should be grown and what sort of immediate return there is for the various classes already grown. That, I submit, is a matter for the Department and their advisers.  Once the general public realise the importance of reafforestation the experts will be in a position to give their opinion as to the most suitable class of timber for our soil.  Some experience in my own constituency in one or two reafforestation schemes shows that very good work is being done.  That is only a beginning.</P>

    <P>A Deputy on the Government Benches made a very sensible suggestion. He referred to places where portions of the land available for tree planting are near the foothills and the mountain ranges.  He spoke about such places in the West, places of the same nature as we have in County Wexford.  There are portions of land there which are eminently suitable for the growth of timber and unsuitable for farming purposes.  This is a work which should be undertaken by the State.  The reafforestation of the country does not appear to have been treated by any Party as a main plank in any of their platforms during the last two elections when appealing to the people.  I think this is a matter which should be beyond Party politics. It concerns each and every one of us. It is a matter which the country, if it wakened up to the possibilities of the situation, would readily adopt.  If <Col N="809" /> people began to realise that large sums of money could be raised and that these sums could be secured on the value put into the soil, it would be found that the people would come forward willingly and subscribe to a loan based on the amount of national wealth represented by our State afforestation schemes.</P>
    <P>Anyone who looks up history books, will realise that our climate and the climate of a country such as England, was suitable for the growing of a large variety of trees in the old days.  In fact the original condition of the country was that of a forest.  These countries were covered by forests which, in the course of time, were cut down.  As a result of experiments since carried out, our native timbers have been supplemented by a large variety of other timbers with the result that to-day we have a choice of a very large number of different types of trees which could be grown here.  Some of them might be ready for sale in the next generation and others the generation afterwards.  If the Government Department concerned is prepared to advocate, as a matter of Government policy, a very big expansion in afforestation in this country and if they educate public opinion up to the desirability of that situation, I think that there will be very little opposition from anyone who has the real interest, either present or future, of this country at heart.</P>

      <P>Deputies who have listened to the reply given by the Minister on the previous Vote can understand why I feel so nervous about again intervening in any debate in which the Minister for Lands and Forestry is interested.  I feel doubly nervous because I listened and read the rather able speech which was also delivered by my colleague, Deputy Finlay.  I should like to say one thing about Deputy Finlay.  In that reply Deputy Finlay suggested that I had run away from the debate.  I should like to inform him that I was not very many yards away from him when he was delivering that eloquent speech which I, for many reasons, do not like to interpret.  I raised a number of points dealing with forestry administration on the previous Vote of the Minister <Col N="810" /> and I can readily understand the reasons why he was unable to reply to some of the points.  I have also received from the Minister's office to-day a number of letters replying to most of the points raised by me during that discussion.  There is one point upon which I should like to encourage the Minister to put his views upon the records of this House.  I suggested&mdash; and I think it is on the records of the Department&mdash;that it is very desirable to recruit workers for employment in forestry schemes through the medium of the Labour Exchange.  If the Minister will give me a positive assurance that, in future, that procedure will be rigidly adhered to, I can assure him that I shall have no cause for complaint in the matter of the recruitment of labour for forestry schemes, whether under him or any other Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 27th April last I addressed a question to the Minister on that matter in regard to a forestry scheme at Clonaslee.  The Minister assured me then that, with one exception, all the workers had been employed through the medium of the Labour Exchange.  It is quite true that I have never adopted the practice of taking upon myself the work which should be normally done by the officials of this or any other Government.  I have made it a practice since I became a Deputy to pass on any communications of importance addressed to me to be dealt with by the Government Department concerned.  That I have always done in connection with land questions and I challenge the present Minister or any other Minister to say that I ever went into my constituency in advance of a Land Commission inspector or that I ever made arrangements to meet a Land Commission inspector or ever accompanied a Land Commission inspector in connection with his work in my constituency.  I have never interfered in any way with the activities of Land Commission officials.  I have taken the trouble, however, in view of the Minister's definite announcement on a previous occasion to make personal inquiries regarding the complaints that the Forestry Department were not recruiting local workers through the medium of the Labour Exchange.  The complaints were sent to me and some of <Col N="811" /> them were passed over to the Land Commission.  This practice is not being adhered to on the schemes at Kinnity, Stradbally, Emo, and Clonaslea. There is a very definite way of disproving these allegations.  If the Minister would get at a particular period the list of workers recruited at any of the forestry stations, and compare it with the list compiled by the manager of the local Labour Exchange, he would be able to check, as I have been able to check, the accuracy of the replies in these matters. I think that the Minister if he would look up his files in connection with these cases will find that his inspectors have admitted that the procedure has not been rigidly adhered to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I assure the Minister that if he makes further inquiries he will find that one man in the case of Clonaslee&mdash;not the forester in charge &mdash;left his employment and walked into forestry work on the following day. Naturally, in that case the man could not be employed through the medium of the labour exchange because his name was not on the books of the labour exchange.  I assure the Minister that he cannot dispose of these complaints to the satisfaction of the local people by just merely saying that they are without foundation.  I am quite prepared, now that the Minister has given his replies, to place these replies in the hands of the local people.  The local people are better judges than either the Minister or myself as to where truth and accuracy lie.  If I find out on inquiry that I made any allegation against the Minister or anybody else on any occasion that could not be substantiated, I have sufficient courage to come in here and apologise to the Minister for doing so.  I drew the attention of the Minister to the delay on the part of the Forestry Department in acquiring lands in Leix offered to them by certain landowners.  In connection with offers made with landowners of this kind in the Midland counties, I should like to ascertain from the Minister&mdash;I am sure he has <Col N="812" /> the figures and can produce them&mdash; what is the average price paid for lands suitable for afforestation purposes in the Midland counties&mdash;in Leix-Offaly, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Carlow and Kildare.  If the figures are available the Minister should produce them for the information of the House. I am speaking of places where land was offered without any condition as to price.  Many people would like to know what is the price paid for land said to be suitable for afforestation purposes in the Midland counties, as distinct from some of the Gaeltacht counties.</P>
      <P>I agree in the main with the speech made by Deputy Esmonde.  I travelled in a number of continental countries, and on a number of occasions I took advantage of those visits to visit the forestry stations there.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister for Lands that he should not decide his future policy on the basis of what he may read in books or what some other bookworm may put up to him in connection with the development of forestry schemes in this country.  If the money is available, and if the Minister could see his way to get the authority of the powers that be, he would be well advised in sending the heads of the forestry department to visit the forestry stations in some of those continental countries.  I think it would be found that their experience in those countries would be far more useful to them than what they may read in books or what may be put forward by some other bookworm in connection with forestry matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to refer.  Since the debate took place in connection with the rates of wages and the conditions of forestry workers in my constituency, I am very glad to notice, and so is everybody sitting on these Benches, that the Agricultural Wages Board have decided to bring into operation a new rate of wages for agricultural labourers as and from 23rd May.  That will provide a very curious picture for the farmers of my constituency.  In two forestry stations in my constituency the position from 23rd May will be that while in the Clonaslee area forestry workers will be paid at the rate of 24/- a week, <Col N="813" /> as they are being paid to-day, unless the rate is changed, and in the Kinnity area of Offaly the rate&mdash;unless it is changed in the meantime&mdash;will be 25/-, so that the farmers in those areas will be in a position of being compelled, by the operations of the same Government as is responsible for fixing forestry workers' wages, to pay agricultural wages at the rate of 27/- a week. Will any Deputy in this House representing an agricultural area say that the farmers in this State should be compelled by law to pay their agricultural workers at a higher rate than the Government of the country, which should be the best employer in the country, is paying their forestry workers, or those employed on minor relief schemes?  I hope the Minister will take immediate note of the action of the Agricultural Wages Board, and that without any further action on the part of the Wages Advisory Board, he will fix the rate for forestry workers, not alone in my constituency, but in every other constituency, at the proper figure, that is, above the rate to be paid in the future to agricultural labourers.</P>

      <P>In moving about the country I think everybody can see for himself in his own way the enormous tracts of land which are available for one thing and one thing only, and that is timber-growing.  I do not know whether previous speakers referred to one very important thing, and that is the question of game in association with young forestry.  If the Land Commission, through their Forestry Department&mdash;I am sure they have done so&mdash;would investigate the revenue which is to be secured by reason of the plantation of young forestry in conjunction with game, they would find that they were adding a very big advantage indeed to the country as a whole.  I think everybody here knows that young game thrive where there is young wood.  Even in the infant stages of young wood, it forms the greatest possible cover for the protection of different types of young game. I do not know what the value of game in this country is from the point of view of revenue, but I do know that game has very considerably diminished. Shooting rights are very valuable indeed for letting or renting to those who come to this country for that purpose, just as they come for fishing and other purposes.  If we let our mind's eye travel to the different parts of any constituency represented by any Deputy here, we will find ideal places which the Land Commission could step in and purchase for the planting of young trees, appointing a gamekeeper with a knowledge of forestry.  There and then you have a guaranteed revenue, and an added beauty to the country.  That is the first point I would like to stress. Secondly, I do not know what influence the Forestry Department has with the Department of Education, but I should like to say that a love of trees should be inculcated in the young, and I am sorry to say that a certain amount of vandalism takes place in the most <Col N="815" /> remote country districts.  In the schools we should inculcate in the young a love for trees, and a love for the scenic beauty which trees bring, as well as a knowledge of their wonderful utility.  I am satisfied that if the Forestry Department realised the importance of this matter from an educational point of view they would, through the Department of Education, ensure that it should receive the attention which is its due, and which has been neglected in the past.</P>

      <P>One thing evident from the debate is that the country is becoming forestry-minded.  Apparently, there is no disagreement, and I have been rather put in the dock.  The attack was led off by Deputy Roddy, who complained about the little headway we are making.  He, apparently, has been reading the same book as other Deputies, or, if he has not, he has been reading the articles in the papers.  He started off by telling us that experts had agreed that 18 per cent. of a country should be under forestry.  I have been asking experts about that, and what I mean by an expert is not what Deputy Tubridy said&mdash;a man who, when a Government does not want to do a thing, tells them it cannot be done. That was an unwarrantable and unjustifiable attack on the Government and on me.  The fact is that the people I rely upon are those who have given their <Col N="816" /> whole life to this subject.  Deputy Davin thinks we should go to continental countries and other places where trees are grown on a large scale.  That has been done.  The principal people in the Forestry Department travelled in these countries and worked and studied in foreign forests.  The Director of Forestry who was here for a short period was a foreigner, and had a wide experience of forestry in several countries.  None of these experts has been able to find out what authority there is for saying that 18 per cent. of a country should be under forestry. There is no such accepted percentage of forestry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy said that.  I think Deputy Dowdall said the same thing.  There are countries which have 18 per cent. under forestry, but there is a difference in every country according to the requirements.  I am not a forestry expert, and I have to rely on those who are, and I am going to rely upon them as long as I am satisfied, as I am satisfied, that they know their job.  There is no good in listening to people who have read a book by some person who takes an interest in literature and other things and who has a superficial knowledge of forestry.  I am not going to take my information about forestry from such a person.  I have to rely on those who have been able to deliver the goods and who have given their whole life to forestry work, and I think anybody else if he were in my position would do the same.  I am informed by these experts that there is no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also satisfied that we have made very considerable headway.  We have got very little thanks for the work we have done, and I think we have done amazingly well.  During Deputy Roddy's time in the Department it was not the policy, if I may put it that way to go <Col N="817" /> ahead in a quick way with afforestation. Deputy Roddy must admit that.  Since 1933 we have advanced from planting 3,500 acres, which was the figure then, to 8,500 acres lasy year.  When people consider what that means, they will have to admit, if they have any idea of what it means, that that is considerable progress.</P>
    <P>Complaint has been made that we have reduced the Vote this year and that that means we are falling back. As a matter of fact it is not an ordinary Vote.  This is a Grant-in-Aid, and money that is not expended in one year is carried over to the following year or the year after.  When it is a Grant-in-Aid it does not go back into the Exchequer.  This is a Grant-in-Aid  and there was bound to be sufficient money for our purposes in hand from the previous years.  In one year there was a sum of £109,000 as a Grant-in-Aid.  It was not found possible to expend that money that year and it was carried over.  After a close estimate this year it is believed that the £5,000 provided, with what is in hands from the previous years, will be sufficient.  If it is not&mdash; and I hope it will not&mdash;then we will come to the Dáil for more money.  But for more money than we are able to spend.  In 1931-32, £64,588 was spent on afforestation; last year the amount voted was £152,788.  As I say, the acreage planted has gone up from 3,500 to 8,500, and this year we hope to reach 10,000 and not to stop there, according as land can be got.</P>
    <P>The gentleman who worte this book which was referred to apparently does not see any difficulty in evacuating whole communities.  The fact is that the Forestry Department finds the utmost difficulty in persuading people to give up land which the Deapartment wishes to acquire for afforestation purposes.  As a matter of fact, where the Department have acquired land, claims have been made by certain people to grazing and turbary rights. In one case something like 3,000 yards of fencing wire was pulled down by people claiming those rights.  These are some of the difficulties with which the Department has to contend.  It is easy to understand that people who <Col N="818" /> have been living there and keeping their families on the proceeds of the grazing of these hills are not prepared to give them up without a lot of protest. One of the things that could be done by the society suggested would be to try and inculcate a better spirit in regard to reafforestation.  Undoubtedly there is opposition almost everywhere.  Practically everywhere we go we get opposition, and, in some cases, from quarters in which you would not expect it.  Deputy Tubridy, who was so kind as to say man that the Department simply sent a man down to an area to give us the advice that we wanted, to tell us that we could not do what we did not want to do, knows himself from personal experience of the opposition there is in part of Connemara to afforestation.  He was present with a deputation in my office when the strongest disapproval was expressed of any forestry work being done in a particular area.  They all want it done in some other place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mongan and other Deputies from Galway talked about a speech which I made at the Ard Fheis in connection with a forestry scheme carried out some years ago in a place called Knockboy.  I only mentioned that as an instance in which a very determined attempt w as made to plant in that area.  Unfortunately, I was wrong in the figures I gave.  I was given them in good faith by a junior offcial at that time.  The cost was not as high as I thought.  Deputy MOngan said that I was wrong and that I was insulting Connemara and all the rest of it.  That was merely political talk.  He knows well that I would not insult Connemara of all places in Ireland.  Then fact is that there was something like £9,000 spent on that scheme and, unfortunately, it was not a success.  It is not to be assumed because I referred to that case, or because that scheme was not a success, that the Department has not made every effort to get suitable land in the Gaeltacht for forestry.  It is one of the things about which I am most anxious and about which the Department are most anxious.  I can assure Deputies that the officials in charge of forestry are just as keen as any <Col N="819" /> Deputy, but they are not going to plant scrub, and I am not prepared to ask them to do that.  I think that the money we spend ought to be spent on work that would give a good return.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn suggested that we should have more regard to the amenities than to the commercial value of the timber.  That may be work for another Department, but the Forestry Department is concerned with the raising of commercial timber, and I think that is what it should be confined to.  If it is the wish of the Government or of the Dáil at any time that some other sort of work should be undertaken, like the growing of bushes and other things like that, that is another matter.  It is not forestry work.  I am not going to ask people who are experts and who know the proper sort. of timber to grow in different places to try to plant trees where they are not s atisfied, after very careful investigation, that the trees will be a commercial success.  I have been asked by several Deputies how it is that lands which grew trees that were cut down during the Great War will not grow trees now.  I am informed that any land which has grown trees so recently as that, or up to, say, 100 years ago, will very likely grow trees again on a commercial basis.  But where you see old stumps that peat has grown over, where the land has deteriorated, that land very often will not grow trees.</P>
    <P>Of course, every area is examined and reported on by people who are competent to give an opinion.  I do not know where you are going to get a Minister who will set himself out against the considered opinion of men who have given their lives to a study of this subject.  If Deputy Dowdall were looking for advice in his business, Nothing else can possibly be done.  If it is accepted that the Government is alert to the position, or if Deputy Tubridy's statement is accepted, that they are simply humbugging and do not wish to do anything, I say that once people know we are anxious to go ahead as quickly as possible with afforestation schemes, it may be taken that the officials will co-operate&mdash;as <Col N="820" /> they have co-operated wholeheartedly &mdash;in that respect.  I am quite satisfied that we have made very considerable progress and that we will continue to do so.  Deputy Dowdall said that we should have a survey made.  We are told that something like 3,000,000 acres are available.  No one knows the amount definitely.  I would like to have a survey, but I remind Deputies that that would require an expert staff of people who know all that there is to be known about forestry.  Their time would have to be taken up on that work.  Deputy Dowdall wanted a survey to be made rapidly.  It cannot be done rapidly.  It must be done carefully. When the survey is made the land would have to be acquired, so that we would only be starting where we are now.  In fact, we would not be as far advacned.</P>
    <P>I think the policy that has been adopted is a much better one.  Where we have been able to get land suitable for the purpose, we got it.  I think we have done very well, indeed.  If some land has not ben inspected, that is because the Department has not been able to reach on it.  The estates mentioned have ben examined, and when the results are obtained, it will be found that if the land is suitable it is taken.  I remind Deputies that they cannot have compulsion in the taking of forestry lands, for reasons that I indicated.  In several cases immense damage was done by people whose good-will we had not got.  It is not like taking land for the purpose of putting people on it.  That land could be taken compulsorily.  If you take land for forestry against the will of the people, very often they come in the middle of the night, or when there is no one looking, and the fences will be pulled down or burned.  As that class of land is always in remote places, we want to avoid anything like that occurring.  Compulsion in the main is unthinkable.</P>

      <P>To great extent it is. It is not easy to train a staff.  To get a man sufficiently trained to be what is called a foreman would take at least three years, and it would take <Col N="821" /> six years before he is a full forester. We have 33 students at present. That is the full capacity of Avondale. We will keep up that number , which is considered to be sufficient for the amount of land we are likely to get. I am satisfied that it is.  Personally, I take a very keen interest in this matter and I think it is rather hard to bear the Department, as I have so often said attacked as it has been. It got practically to credit for the big increase that has taken place.  I think that increase will be more rapid in future.  One of the greatest difficulties was in acquiring land.  Last year we took over an experienced Land Commission inspector who is accustomed to dealing with the problems of title and other matters.  We hope to be able to get land more quickly as a result of that inspector working for the Forestry Department. I am sure that will be the case.  Our nurseries have also been very much increased.  We are supplying a lot of our own requirements now in plants and increasing the amount of seedlings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that and, as far as I can get a decision Quickly, I will do so.  Deputy Davin asked about the average price per acre.  It is about £3 7s.  6d.  for the whole country.  Deputy Gorey told us about the different kinds of timber <Col N="822" /> that we could grow and that would be profitable.  That matter is being attended to by people who are thoroughly competent and who have studied the timber requirements of the country.  They have an intimate knowledge of the requirements of modern industry.  As experts they studied the question.  Generally speaking, I think they will be in agreement with Deputy Gorey.  About 10 per cent.  of the trees grown are hard timber, and that is considered sufficient to meet our requirements. The rest is soft timber for the English market.  I cannot deal with all the points that were raised now, but I am satisfied that very good work has been done, and that it compare with what was done before.  I am glad of the change in the Opposition.  Compared with what was done in the past, we have done very well indeed, and I hope next year that we will have 10,000 acres, and that, having the Land Commission inspector detached for the work, we will be able to go ahead more rapidly.

      <P>If the people who are most competent say that this land is not phantable I qam not going to insist. In some cases that will occur, and I am sure that the people are broad-minded enough to know that there may be a chance in some cases; there may be a toss-up and it would be well worth trying experiments in certain parts of the country.  I can assure the Deputies that the Gaeltacht areas are the ones we are naturally most interested in.  Dirriculties are very great there, and I think Deputy Mongan himself will know that a lot of the land that would be suitable for planting would be very hard to get.  I should draw the attention of Deputies to this: that in this country a lot of land that in other countries would have been under timber has been used by the people.  It is due to our history. The good lands .  as we all know, were cleared of the people and they <Col N="823" /> were made go out and exist on lands that in other countries would have been considered only suitable for forestry purposes.  Everybody knows that there are crowds of people where there would have been in normal countries only timber.  I do not see how we are to get over it, to change that whole situation.  It is very, very difficult.  All I can say is that, in the circumstances, the Department is doing all it can.  It cannot rest on its oars and it will not, but it certainly cannot do anything like what has been asked by the writer of that book and these articles.  That gentleman really is in the clouds altogether.  That is about the easiest way I can let him down.</P>

As a matter of fact that is done, and advertisements are issued every year, telling of the lands that are available for gale, and that matter is having attention.  I am not dealing with all the points raised; there was such a long debate I could not possibly deal with every point, but I will have the Deputies' speeches examined and if there is anything that calls for attention we will have it attended to and the Deputy communicated with.  I think that is the best way of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>Idir na Fó-Mhírchinn go léir tá £7,482 níos mó ann ná mar a bhí anuraidh, ach ina choinne sin tá laghdú £5,893 ann chomh maith..  Ina theannta sin tá laghdú £1,055 ins na Leithreasaí-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>Chun mion-eolas do thabhairt ar an méadú atá ann, budh mhaith liom a rádh go bhfuil £3,770 ag teastáil i mbliana thar mar a bhí anuraidh chun Monarchan na mBréagán i gCuan Eilidhe do chur ag obair, ábhar do cheannach, agus costaisí iomchair agus costaisí eile a bhaineann leis d'ioc. Chomh maith leis an méadú sin cosnóchaidh na Tionnscail Tuaithe £2,085 níos mó, idir ábhair agus costaisí eile, ná mar a dheineadar anuraidh agus cosnóchaidh costaisí marguiochta £590 níos mó leis.</P>

      <P>Ins na Fó-Mhírchinn a bhaineann le Tionnscail Tuaithe tá timcheall agus £300 de mhéadú toisc é bheith beartuithe beirt Bhan-Bhainisteoirí eile do cheapadh don dá ionad chniotála nua atá le hoscailt sara fada sa bhFód Dubh, Co.

    <P>Tá £90 de laghdú i bhFó-Mhírcheann D 2 toisc go bhfuair Teagascóir bás ag <Col N="825" /> ceann des na clochair.  Tá sé socair le tamall anuas gan folúntas den tsórt do líonadh.</P>
    <P>Tá athruithe fé Fó-Mhírchinn D 3, D 4, agus D 5, ach ní mór iad.  Sé is cuis leis an méadú fé D 5 ná scéim atá ann chun úrlaisí agus fearaistí a bhíonn in úsáid ins na tionnscail do choimeád i gceart agus i gcóir, agus na seanchinn do chur as feidhm do réir mar is gádh nuair a bhíonn siad caithte amach is amach.  Tá airgead ann leis chun úrlaisí breise do cheannach.</P>
    <P>Tá glaodh maith ar earraí na dTionnscal so againne anois, agus tá súil agam gur ag dul i bhfeabhas a bheidh an scéal so.  Mar sin, cuireadh isteach breis airgid fé Fhó-Mhírcheann D 6, chun ábhair agus eile a bheidh ag teastáil do cheannach.  Sé an dála céadna éle Fó-Mhírcheann D 7, ina bhfuil breis bheag mar ná raibh go leor ann anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Baineann Fó-Mhírcheann D 8 le Tionnscal na mBréagán, ach measaim nach gádh aon mhíniú do thabhairt air. Tá sé soiléir go leor ann féin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Ceilp agus Carraigín, tá laghdú ins na Meastacháin ach ní chuirfidh an laghdú san isteach ar an ngnó Tá an Roinn toilteannach an Cheilp ar fad a bheidh le díol do cheannach.  Cuireadh airgead isteach ins na Meastacháin anuraidh chun mile tonna Ceilpe agus roinnt feamainne do cheannach, ach ní raibh le fagháil ach timcheall is cheithre chéad tonna ceilpe agus tuairim is seasca tonna den fheamainn.  Tá ár ndóithin airgid curtha isteach i mbliana chun sé chéad tonna ceilpe agus cheithre chéad tonna feamainne do cheannach.  Niltear ag súil le níos mó ná sin, ach má bhíonn níos mó le fagháil ceannóchar é, agus rud eile, dhe, beidh luach níos fearr le fagháil ar an gCeilp i mbliana thar mar a bhí anuraidh.  Níl an ceannach céadna ar Charraigín mar bhiadh agus a bhíodh, ach tá iarracht á dhéanamh ag an Roinn Carraigín mar bhiadh do chur ar an margadh déanta suas ina mhalairt do shlighe, agus tá súil leis go n-éirgheóidh leis an iarracht so.  Tá an ghlaodh atá ar ghnáth-Charraigín go maith agus tá an Roinn sásta leis an socrú atá déanta le Comhlucht Gnótha lasmuich chun an Carraigín do cheannach.  Leis an socrú so ní fhanann aon Charraigín gan ceannach agus, <Col N="826" /> tríd is tríd, íoctar praghas maith air.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na Fó-Mhírchinn F 1, F 2, agus F 3, a bhaineann le díol na n-earraí, ní dóigh liom gur gádh aon chur síos ró-mhór do dhéanamh ortha.</P>
    <P>Tá breis bheag fé F 1, ach sé is cúis leis sin ná go bhfuil Bainisteóir Conganta ceaptha anois a dhéanfaidh gréas an bhréidín a ghlacadh mar chúram fé leith air féin.  B'éigean, leis, fear do cheapadh chun aire do thabhairt do sna bréagáin a bheidh le díol, ach san am chéadna ní gádh fear fé leith ón Roinn a bheith ag an Seomra Teasbeántais feasta mar tá socrú déanta leis an bhfear a dhiolann na hearraí go ndéanfaidh seisean freastal ann.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú fé Fó-Mhírcheann F 3 de bhárr feabhas bheith tagtha ar ghnáthchúrsaí tráchtála na Roinne.</P>
    <P>Tá airgead curtha isteach i bhFó-Mhírcheann G chun baid do cheannach i gcóir seirbhísí iomchair agus tá sé i gceist an tseirbhís idir Dún na Séad agus Oileán Cléire, Co. Chorcaighe, do fheabhsú, agus ceann a bhunú idir Oileán Chliara, Co. Mhuigheó, agus an tír mhór.  Má bhíonn iarrataisí ann le haghaidh iasachtaí eile tá airgead beag curtha isteach ionnus go mbeadh údarás ann, agus déanfar gach iarratas a thagann fén údarás sin do bhreithniú go cúramach.</P>
    <P>Ní gádh aon chur-síos fé leith do dhéanamh ar an ngnáthatharú atá ar an Meastachán do thuarasdal agus costaisí na nOifigeach a bhaineann le Scéim Tighthe na Gaeltachta.  Tá laghdú £1,500 ar an Meastachán do dheontaisí, ach níl annsan ach iarracht ar an Meastachán do thabhairt comhgarach don tsuim airgid a caitheadh le trí bliana anuas.</P>
    <P>Tá Fó-Mhírcheann H 4 ann i gcóir cróite cearc agus muc sa Ghaeltacht; bhí Meastachán Breise dó so anuraidh, le réidhteach mí-thuisgiona a thárla i dtaobh brígh an Achta.  Tá an tsuim airgid a luaidhtear anois curtha isteach do sna cásanna inar tosnuigheadh ar an obair sara bhfuarthas amach an dearmhad so, agus go mba éagcóir gan iad a chríochnú.</P>
    <P>Tá timpeal £1,000 de laghdú ar na Meastacháin atá déanta ar na Leithreasaí-i-gCabhair agus tá an laghdú so, nach mór ar fad, bunuithe ar na fáltaisí le n-a bhfuil súil ó Cheilp agus <Col N="827" /> ó Charraigín.  Tá dóchas ann go mbeidh an scéal so i bhfad níos fearr ach ní féidir deimhin do dhéanamh de.</P>
    <P>Chífear ón bhFó-Mhírcheann le haghaidh Leithreasaí-i-gCabhair cad é an méid airgid a híocfar leis na hoibritheóirí.  Tá an t-airgead san ag árdú ó bhliain go bliain agus is mór le rádh an méid sin, mar is chuige seo tá na Tionnscail ann chor ar bith.  Tá an ráta páighe go maith leis, agus tá na hoibritheóirí sásta.  Is féidir a rádh anois go bhfuil obair gan stad á soláthar ar feadh na bliana, go bhfuil tuarasdal sásúil á thuilleamh, go bhfuil an lucht saothair sásta agus gur ag dul i dtreise agus i dtairbhighe atá an obair i gcoitinne.  Maidir leis seo, chífear gur méaduigheadh an Meastachán i gcóir tuarasdail ó £12,500 i gcóir na bliana anuraidh go dtí £16,500 i gcóir na bliana so.</P>
    <P>Mar a dubhradh cheana ní mór dhá Ionad nua d'oscailt-ceann i mBun Beag agus ceann ar an bhFód Dubh-de bharr méadú ar an tionnscal cniotála. Tá an ghlaodh fós ar na hearraí i dtionnscal na figheadóireachta, agus tá súil leis go mbeidh in ár gcumas a lán oibre do thabhairt do sna figheadóirí i gCill Chárthaigh, i nGleann Chuilm Chille agus in Ard a' Rátha arís i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Sé an cuspóir atá ag an Roinn ná an margadh is fearr d'fhagháil agus do choimeád agus san do dhéanamh le hearraí foghanta a bheadh déanta as ábhair foghanta do chur ar díol, agus iad do bheith ar fagháil nuair a theastóidís ón gceannaí.  Tá cóir mhaith oibre dá chur i bhfeidhm chun ar gcuid earraí do chur ar díol ar fuaid na tíre. Ní bheidh síopa éadaigh sa dúthaigh ná beidh gníomhaire ón Roinn ag tabhairt cuaird air feasta.  An luach a bheidh á éileamh ar na hearraí beidh sé déanta amach sa ghnáth-shlighe, sé sin, beidh sé bunuithe ar chostas na n-ábhar, costas na hoibre, costas iomchair agus na mion-chostaisí uile, mar aon le cothrom de chostas na hOifige.</P>
    <P>Is féidir a rádh go bhfuil tosnuithe ar Thionnscal na mBréagán i gCuan Eilidhe.  Tá an gléas oibre curtha isteach agus táthar le fiche buachaill agus fiche cailín, atá tar éis oiliúint <Col N="828" /> d'fhagháil i gCéard-Scoil Bhéal an Mhuirthid, do chur ag obair aon lá feasta.  Is fiú £20,000 an margadh atá againn sa tír seo d'earraí den t-saghas atáthar le déanamh san Ionad so, agus tá brath againn ar roinnt mhaith den mhargadh san d'fhagháil dár gcuid earraí féin.</P>
    <P>I gcúrsaí Ceilpe, is cosúil go bhfuil deire leis an margadh a bhi ann don Iodin, ach má tá féin, tá an Roinn tar éis margadh eile d'fhagháil do Cheilp. Tá ghlaodh ar cheilp mheilte sa Bhreatain Mhór le n-a chur sa bhiada do stoc agus tá praghas cuibheasach maith le fagháil uirthe le n-a aghaidh sin.  Deintear an Cheilp do mheilt i gCathair na Gaillimhe agus tá deall ramh ar an scéal go mbeidh fás ag teacht i ndiaidh a chéile ar an margadh so.  Tá an Roinn ag faire amach do mhargadh d'fhagháil don fheamainn féin, sé sin, feamain thirm ón gcósta, agus i láthair na huaire tá an scéal so dá phléidhe le dhá Chomhlucht ag a bhfuil suim san earra.  Tá socrú nach mór déanta le ceann acu chun cúig céad tonna do dhiol leo. Thairis sin, tá súil leis go mbeidh glaodh i mbliana ar fheamainn mheilte agus go mbeidh luach maith le fagháil uirthi.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom a rádh annso go bhfuil cabhair agus có-oibriú againn á fhagháil ó sna Ranna eile Riaghaltais leis an gcúram atá orainn, agus de bharr an chó-oibrithe sin go bhfuil breis mhór airgid á chaitheamh ar ghnóthaibh Riaghaltais ar fuaid na Gaeltachta.

Ní thig liom a rádh go bhfuil an Rialtas chomh fial no comh flaitheamhail le Bórd na gCeanntar gCumhang nuair a bhí sé faoi lán-réim seoil againn dhá fhichid bliadhain ó shoin.  Tá monarchain go lor dá dtógail ar fud lár na tíre sa <Col N="829" /> Ghalldacht-monarchain alcohol agus siúcra-acht, faraor, níl dadaidh mar sin don Ghaedhealtacht.

Tá dualgas náisiúnta ar an Rialtas na daoine so a thógáil as umair an bhochtanais agus iad a chur ar a mbonnaí arís.  Ná bíodh sinne truaillighe no ceachardha leo.</P>

B'fhearr liom-sa dá gcaithfi an t-airgead so ar dhúnta na nGaedheal san Ghaedhealtacht. Seo iad na dúnta is fiú a chosaint agus ní dúnta na nGall.  Is ionnta a taisgeadh na seódaí is luachmhaire atá againn, sin teanga agus nósaí agus glan-intinn an Ghaedhil.

      <P>Ma tá rún ag an Rialtas sin a dhéanamh caithfidh siad an Gaedheal a bhunú go daingean ar a thalamh dhúthchais agus slighe bheatha a sheiftiú dó.

Acht ar ndóigh níor gheall Dia ariamh don Ghaedheal go mbéadh sé go síorraidhe i muinighin oibreacha fóirthine ar na bealtaigh móra no ar lorg na déirce.

Ní thabhairfinn ar siubhal iad ó n-a mbaile dhúthchais. Seo an dóigh cheart leis na cainteoirí dúthchais a mhéadú agus an Ghaedhilic a leathadh ar fud na tíre mar badh mhaith leis an Taoiseach.  Níl caoi no bealach pósda ag na daoine bochta seo fá láthair agus níl na páisdí ag éirghe aníos chugainn.  Tá na scolta ar bheagán scoláirí agus níl na tighthe pobail leath-lán.  Mar chidhim-se an scéal rachaidh an Ghaedhealtacht 'un báine má ghnidhthear neamairt níos fuide innte.  Sin leigheas a mholfainn don Rialtas.  Táthar á dhéanamh so ar mhór-roinn na hEorpa agus níl leith scéal ar bith againn gan é a dhéanamh in Eirinn.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an Roinn ag deanamh saothar mór le hobair a thabhairt do na figheadóirí i dTír Chonaill atá ag fighe éadaigh an Chluig Thuir.  Acht thiocfadh an obair seo a mhéadú go mór.  Is léir le mórán daoine a thuigeas an scéal go dtiocfadh a dheich n-oiread den éadach so a chur 'un margaidh gach bliadhain dá mbéadh gléas ceart díolachin ag an Roinn. Bíonn na figheadóirí díomhaoin go minic agus thiocfadh níos mó figh eadóirí a chur i gcionn oibre.  Badh chóir go ndéanfaí scrúdú cúramach ar an taoibh seo den scéal agus gléas díolaidheachta níos fearr a bheith ag an Roinn ná mar tá fá láthair.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The story that the Parliamentary Secretary unfolded to the House a short time ago is certainly not calculated, I think, to inspire enthusiasm amongst Deputies.  It was a dismal statement from beginning to end, and it does not hold out any hope or encouragement whatever for the unfortunate people in the Gaeltacht. Those members of the present House who were members of the Dáil in 1930 and 1931 can recall the speeches that were made by the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in Opposition, regarding the terrible conditions prevailing in the Gaeltacht and the necessity for doing something practical to relieve these conditions. Now they have been in office for six years, and at the end of that six year period the position is such as the Parliamentary Secretary has been forced to admit in the Dáil this evening.  In almost every single activity there has been a decline.  It is no use for the Parliamentary Secretary to say, as he used to say some few years ago, that owing to world conditions it is impossible to make any progress in the development of industries in the Gaeltacht.  It is perfectly true that world conditions may, to some extent, affect the kelp industry and the carrageen industry, but world conditions have not affected other industries in the Gaeltacht to any extent whatever.  What is the position in regard to kelp, which after all was a very big source of income to the small farmers living along the seaboard in the years prior to 1932, when the Fianna Fáil Party first became the Government in this country?  In 1931 kelp fetched a price of from £8 to £10 a ton; in fact, in some cases <Col N="832" /> it went as high as £12 a ton.  The Minister tells us to-day that the best price he can offer to the kelp gatherers is £4 a ton.  Last year kelp fetched only from £2 to £3 a ton, and even then only a limited quantity was purchased. This year there was a further decline in the amount purchased.  Last year it was 1,000 tons.  This year the Parliamentary Secretary states he will not be able to purchase more than 600 tons.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>Approximately 600 tons at a price of £4 a ton.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary should have offered some better reason than the reason contained in his statement for the huge drop in the price of kelp in the last few years.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have made some effort to explain the reason why the gatherers of kelp are being forced to sell at a price of £4 per ton, seeing that up to five or six years ago it was fetching £8 to £10 per ton, and even as high as £12 per ton.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself stated last year that he anticipated that there would be a better demand for kelp, but according to his statement this evening the demand will be even worse than last year, although the price may be slightly higher.  Two years ago the Parliamentary Secretary told us that he was engaged in carrying out certain experiments for the purpose of ascertaining whether, in view of the declining market for kelp, it was not possible to utilise the kelp product in the manufacture of certain classes of feeding stuffs and in the manufacture of certain high class manures.  I should be interested to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to what extent these experiments have progressed, or have the experiments been abandoned since.  Is he depending entirely on selling kelp to chemists on the other side for the purpose of conducting these experiments which I understand were begun on this side?  In any event, the fact of the matter is that the kelp industry is practically a dead letter, because it would not pay small farmers who. <Col N="833" /> live along the seaboard to gather kelp and sell it at the price which the Minister is prepared to offer this season.  Every Deputy who has any acquaintance with conditions along the seaboard knows that kelp gathering is the hardest kind of work in which any man could engage.  The kelp has to be gathered under exceedingly trying conditions.  Generally the best kelp is gathered when the weather is probably at its very worst.  The price of £4 per ton which the Minister holds out as an inducement is certainly very unattractive, and is not very likely to induce many people to engage in the work.  I should be very anxious to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, what are the prospects for the kelp industry.  Is there any hope at all of reviving it, or has he definitely and finally come to the.  conclusion that the industry is dying, and that it is useless to waste any further effort in trying to revive it?  One can only assume from his statement to-day that he has more or less come to that conclusion already. I should be glad if he would further state whether it is possible to utilise the raw kelp for any of the purposes which he indicated to the House some two years ago, either as a constituent of certain animal foods or as a constituent of very high class manures, and to what extent the experiments on which I understand he was engaged some two years ago have proved successful. The report goes on to deal with seaweed.  I think last year also the Minister gave the people along the seaboard and in the Gaeltacht to understand that there was likely to be a market for seaweed some time before the end of last year, but as a matter of fact even in this report to-day he can hold out no hope whatever that there is going to be such a market for seaweed.  Last year the people along the seaboard gathered seaweed in the hope that the Minister would be able to fulfil his promise of finding a market for it, but no such market has materialised, nor is it likely to materialise in the future.</P>

    <P>With regard to Gaeltacht housing, that was a favourite subject of Fianna <Col N="834" /> Fáil Deputies, especially those Deputies from the Gaeltacht, in the days when we were the Government of this country.  They were always stressing the needs of the unfortunate people in the Gaeltacht for better housing conditions. Now, let us see what the Fianna Fáil Government has done with regard to housing conditions in the Gaeltacht.  In reply to a Parliamentary question from Deputy Mongan on 7th December of last year the Parliamentary Secretary stated that in the financial year 1930 to 1931 the sum of £47,752 was set aside for the purposes of Gaeltacht housing. That was, I think, the first year that the Gaeltacht Housing Act came into operation.  In the following year, 1931-32, the sum of £125,640 was set aside for that purpose, and in the financial year 1935-36-the last year with which this Parliamentary question deals-the sum of £42,000 was set aside by the present Government for the purposes of Gaeltacht housing. Taking the amounts set aside by the two Governments during the years dealt with in the question, the previous Government spent £13,000 more on housing in the Gaeltacht in the two financial years 1930-31 and 1931-32 than the present Government spent in the four years from 1932 to 1936.  I notice in this year's Estimate that there is a still further diminution in the amount of money set aside for Gaeltacht housing.  Last year the sum of £49,000 was set aside, and this year the amount is reduced by approximately £1,500.  I understand from a report which I read I think some time last year that only one-third of the houses which are really necessary had been erected in the Gaeltacht.  May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary why it is that these activities have declined so much?  Have the officials engaged in supervising the housing operations in the Gaeltacht been withdrawn from this work, or is it that the Department is not getting the same work out of those officials as we were getting in the years 1930 and 1931?  The fact is at all events that there has been a considerable diminution in housing in the Gaeltacht notwithstanding the promises held out <Col N="835" /> to the people of the Gaeltacht by the members of the present Government, not merely when they were in opposition but at all the elections which have taken place since.</P>
    <P>Now, we know perfectly well, those of us who are living in seaboard counties, that the knitting industry is practically dead.  The Minister's predecessor, Senator Connolly, when he was in charge of the Gaeltacht Department, came to the conclusion that those industries should be run on business lines.  Inspired as he was by those high and noble business ideas, he proceeded at once to close down a number of those small industries. Surely every Deputy in this House will realise that you cannot regard industries in the Gaeltacht from the rigid business point of view; that after all, if we are to make any progress with the Gaeltacht problem we must be prepared to spend money, and to spend it generously, in that area.  Those industries have to be nursed and nursed very carefully for a number of years before they can hope to achieve the business standards which the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor evidently thought they should have achieved at the time he was in control of that Department.</P>
    <P>The fact is that those industries are dying one by one.  As a matter of fact, I think that to-day you could almost count on the fingers of one hand the industries which are left.  Yet, in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement to-day he holds out no hope that any effort will be made in the future to revive those industries and to give employment to some of the people&mdash; especially the girls&mdash;who are still leaving the country in such numbers in order to seek employment on the other side.</P>
    <P>So far as the trading section of his Department is concerned, he says that it has been the object of the Department to retain old customers and to secure additional customers.  I thought that was always the object of the Department, and that it was not necessary to restate it.  If it was not the object of that section of the Department in the past, it certainly <Col N="836" /> should have been its object.  Judging by the Estimates apparently he must not have secured many additional customers in the past, because the figures are almost identical with those for last year and the year before.  Apparently the number of customers is not increasing, although the amount spent on the maintenance of that Department is increasing.  There is a hiatus there which needs explanation by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He should tell us the reason why it is necessary that they should increase expenditure for the purpose of the upkeep of that particular section of his Department, whereas the number of customers apparently remains stationary.  The whole problem has been chiefly this: that the present Government has no policy and never had a policy for the Gaeltacht.  Then, unfortunately for themselves, in their desire for a reform they made the cardinal mistake of transferring to other Departments the officials who were in charge of the Gaeltacht offices, the men with experience of the work, the men with a policy, and bringing in new men who did not know the first thing about the work, and who apparently have made no effort to benefit from the experience of their predecessors.  After all, the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that an effort, a real and determined effort, was made by his predecessors in office for the purpose of helping the people in the Gaeltacht.  Money was spent generously in exploring various avenues for the purpose of devising ways and means of helping the people in the Gaeltacht.  Experiments were carried out in various directions with the object of finding suitable industries, industries which would at any rate help to cater for the needs of those people.  So far as we can see, nothing whatever has been done during the last six years to develop that policy, to extend it in any possible direction.  The record of the present Government in connection with the Gaeltacht has been a record of hopeless failure.  I do not think any Department of Government can boast of such an incompetent administration as the Gaeltacht Department.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to state <Col N="837" /> definitely whether he does intend to tackle this problem seriously, or is the Gaeltacht to be left to its fate? There is no use in voting money year after year unless we are satisfied that the Minister is applying that money in the best possible way and endeavouring to use it in the interests of and on behalf of the people for whom it is voted.  I do seriously suggest to the House that this money is not being properly spent at present and has not been properly spent during the last few years and that the country is certainly not getting value for the money allocated for Gaeltacht services.</P>
    <P>I admit, I always admitted, that the Gaeltacht problem is undoubtedly an exceedingly difficult one.  Nevertheless, the obligation of finding a solution for it rests on the Government of the day, and it is time that the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Minister to whom he is responsible, should tackle this problem seriously and earnestly and endeavour to find some better means of relieving conditions in the Gaeltacht than those indicated in the statement which the Parliamentary Secretary made to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with a good deal of interest to Deputy Roddy in his criticism of this Estimate, but I failed to discover any glimmer of a policy in respect of the Gaeltacht. I failed to discover in his statement any indication of a clear understanding of the Gaeltacht problem any more than I discovered in any statement made by his Administration when it was in office any understanding of the Gaeltacht problem, or any indication that there was a likelihood of their solving it.  I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary with much interest and much sympathy, and I confess that I was in the same position as I was when listening to Deputy Roddy. There was neither an understanding of the Gaeltacht problem, nor an indication that there was any planned policy for the solution of that problem. They are simply spending money here, there and everywhere on a slapdash policy&mdash;a patch here and a patch there, like the Cubist idea in painting <Col N="838" />&mdash;no planned outlook, no policy of any kind in this regard.</P>
      <P>What is the Gaeltacht?  It is a narrow strip of territory around this State wherein is still preserved the greatest portion of Irish culture in the shape of the Irish language and Irish customs and probably traditional music and other things of that nature in which is embodied the spirit and outlook of the Gael on world matters. The problem is not how we are going to preserve in the Gaeltacht all the people who at present live in the Gaeltacht, because the youth of the Gaeltacht, the boyhood and the girlhood, will leave the Gaeltacht just as well as others will leave the Gaeltacht and go elsewhere to seek better conditions of employment and living.  The Gaeltacht is no exception.  What we want in the Gaeltacht-and this is a problem which will confront any Ministry-is to create a normal, decent life for the people who are going to remain there.  That is the problem which confronts the Parliamentary Secretary-how to create a decent, normal life for the people who stay in the Gaeltacht, who marry and rear families there and want decent conditions of living.  I must confess that in his entire statement, whether made in Irish or English, there was no indication of any planned policy, any outlook, as to how that was going to be done-nothing whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the figures&mdash;they are eloquent.  I find that in headquarters' salaries there is an increase of £2,726. If these figures are incorrect which I am taking out rather hurriedly, I shall be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me.  I find there is a reduction of £3,585 in such vital matters for the Gaeltacht as kelp and carrageen. Does that indicate an appreciation of the Gaeltacht problem-an increase in the expenditure at headquarters and a reduction in the expenditure in the Gaeltacht itself?  I have totted up all the figures, and I find a sum of £36,244 for salaries and expenses.  The total Estimate is £89,139, and if I subtract one from the other I get a sum of £42,895 to be administered in the Gaeltacht itself. Therefore if my calculations are correct, <Col N="839" /> it takes £36,244 to administer £42,895.  If that is correct, it certainly does not show an appreciation of the difficulties that face the people living in the Gaeltacht although it may show an appreciation of the difficuties facing people in other parts of the country.  People in other parts of the country who may have difficulties may have them solved by the increased expenditure on salaries and expenses, but the difficulties that confront the Gaeltacht are not being solved by the expenditure made in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that part of the Gaeltacht which is in my constituency just as well as I do myself.  He knows the conditions along the seaboard of Clare.  He knows the position in Quilty, Liscannor, Cusheen, Gleninagh, etc., and all along the western seaboard.  I venture to ask him whether he thinks Government intervention has made any improvement of any appreciable kind in the state of these people for the past five or six, or 10 or 15 years.  When I was a lad I remember that there was a very flourishing market in the sale of seaweed from Quilty to the farmers of the surrounding districts for manure.  I remember strings of carts carrying seaweed to Ennis for sale as manure.  There is not one to be seen now-not one.  Like Deputy Roddy, I would be interested to know whether the experiments in which the Department was interested have been any way successful.</P>
    <P>Has there been any advance made in the utilisation of this seaweed for the fertilisation of the soil and the production of crops?  If the market for kelp has failed, and if the market for carrageen has failed, what does the Department propose to do in order to maintain a decent standard of living for people who still speak the Irish language and preserve Irish customs? If the market has failed what does the Government propose so as to maintain these people in some decent standard of comfort?  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that the market for carrageen and for kelp has failed.  The amount by which it had dropped in <Col N="840" /> the last few years is one of the most amazing manifestations of this Estimate. What is the alternative livelihood for these people?  I suggest that the problem facing the Government is one of providing a normal decent living for Irish-speaking people in the Gaeltacht. I confess to having a certain amount of sympathy with them when dealing with this question.  I believe the Government and the majority of the people in the country do not understand it.  There is no real genuine understanding of the Gaeltacht problem, and sooner than spend money in the haphazard fashion that it has been spent without any direction, it would be better to abandon the scheme altogether and say: &ldquo;We will leave the Gaeltacht to manage on its own sooner than carry on as at present.&rdquo;  I would sooner listen to the Parliamentary Secretary unfolding that as his policy for the future, than listen to him telling us what a failure the Department has been in the Gaeltacht for 15 years. In that period I include the failure of Cumann na nGaedheal just as well as the failure under Fianna Fáil.  I include the failure of both Governments to do anything for the Gaeltacht but talk sentimental slop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that the demand for &ldquo;Round Tower&rdquo; goods is still satisfactory and that it has been possible to keep the weavers more or less constantly employed in the Kilcar, Glencolumbkille and Ardara centres.  He went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Suitable arrangements have been made to improve the organisation dealing with agents so that every shop in the country will be visited at regular periods with samples of goods manufactured according to the best standards and varied according to fashion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not ask in a critical spirit, but I should like to know if any real attempt has been made to create, on what I might term the home market, a demand for that type of tweed.  I may be wrong but, in my opinion, the sales appear to be confined to the larger towns and cities.  I cannot say if the reason is that the tweeds are more expensive <Col N="841" /> than others.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate if any real attempt has been made to sell knitwear and Round Tower tweeds in country towns, and if agents of the Department are calling on shopkeepers in these towns to get them to become customers.  While I may be wrong, from normal observation I should say that very little Round Tower tweeds are sold in small towns.  They may be for sale, but they do not appear to be worn.  I am interested to know if there is a possibility of creating a home market in country districts for material manufactured in these factories; and whether there is any real hope of getting customers for the sale of such material.  Is it the position, that they do not like the look of the stuff or that it is too dear?</P>

      <P>Ní ceart aon Bhéarla a labhairt ar an meastachán seo, ach caithfe mé freagra a thabhairt ar an gcaint a rinne Deputy Roddy agus, ós rud é gur i mBéarla a labhair seiseann, bhéarfa mé freagra air i mBéarla.  Deputy Roddy on several occasions referred to money that has been set aside for housing and compared previous figures with these figures since this Government came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in favour of that, but what the Deputy should have done in all honesty was to compare the actual expenditure.  I had occasion to refer to this matter before in the Press. On the question of the Gaeltacht, it is difficult enough to get co-operation of all interested without misquoting. We all know that the problem was very difficult when our predecessors were in office.  It is no more easy now. As a matter of fact, it has become a more difficult problem since this Government assumed responsibility for the Gaeltacht than it was during the régime of our predecessors.  One reason was the economic war, and another was the stoppage of emigration which took place about 1931. Emigration affected the life of the Gaeltacht more than any other part of the country.  There is a good deal of confusion in the minds of the public regarding the Gaeltacht.  As I understand <Col N="842" /> the term, it applies to the districts in which Irish is the spoken language, but commonly the term is applied to what were known as the congested districts.  Of course, the conditions are practically the same in all these places, but when the Gaeltacht proper is referred to, and when we are asked what we have done over and above what was done by our predecessors, at least I can point out to a few things of real value.  I say that one of the best schemes for bringing money directly into the hands of the people there was the bounty of £2 payable to families with Irish-speaking children.  That was very much appreciated, and has done a great deal of good in the way of easing the burden on the people, and improving the language position.  Another matter which was very much decried and abused concerned unemployment assistance. I challenge any Deputy on the opposite benches to go to the Gaeltacht that I know when there is an election on, and to tell the people that he stands for the abolition of unemployment assistance, I guarantee he will not be elected.</P>

      <P>We did not promise that either.  We got in without a promise.  Deputy Roddy challenged the Government with not having a planned policy.  I say that the initiation of the schemes I mentioned is an indication that there was a planned policy.  Anyone who knows the facts realises that the kernel of the question as regards the Gaeltacht is the very uneven distribution of the population there.  Going along the coast from east to west, anyone who wades through the census figures will find that the distribution of population is in inverse ratio to the land.</P>

    <P>Ach, mar adubhairt mé tá seans níos fearr ag Ranna eile le maitheas a dhéanamh ná mar atá ag Seirbhísí na Gaedhealtachta, cuir i gcás an Roinn Tionnscail agus Tráchtála, an Roinn Talmhaidheachta nó an Roinn Riaghaltais Áiteamhail.  Tá mé cinnte nach bhféadfadh sé níos mó a dhéanamh leis an méid comhachta atá aige.</P>
    <P>The worse it is the more people you find on the land, and to remedy that situation our Government at least initiated a migration policy, and Deputy Roddy is one of the people who threw cold water on it.  I am quite convinced that no scheme of amelioration of the Gaeltacht can really bear any fruit until a better distribution of the population has taken place.  That is a huge job, a mighty job and a costly job, but I believe that that is true. A certain amount of good can be done, but these schemes would bear much better fruit if the population were more equitably distributed.  We have the question of housing.  I referred to housing already.  Housing in the Gaeltacht is governed by the terms of the Gaeltacht scheme, and it was not this Government that enacted <Col N="844" /> that Gaeltacht Act; it was our predecessors, and the conditions in the main, with the exception of one, are the same now as they were when it was enacted.  Under the terms of it we know that an applicant for a house cannot get a grant if his land is to be subject to rearrangement by the Land Commission, and unless the Land Commission can give a certificate that it is not so subject the man cannot get a house.  That condition holds up housing much more than anything else in the Gaeltacht.  It can be urged against us&mdash;I do not know whether it can be argued for or against&mdash;that we altered the Gaeltacht Act by confining it to the Fior-Gaeltacht, but the extraordinary thing about that is, when it was going through the House one Gaeltacht Deputy on the opposite side supported the change and another on the opposite side opposed it.  The same took place here.  I opposed it, and Deputy Donnchadh O Briain supported it.  So that as far as the change is concerned at all events it had no political significance, if one can judge by the way it was supported and opposed.  I believe it was a mistake myself.  I think that it should have been left as it was, because those portions of the Gaeltacht would benefit for the reason I have given.  That is, I do believe, a sound reason.  The large sums of money which have been referred to as being set aside for the purposes in our predecessors' time could have been spent.  It was not done because of these restrictions.  - Senator Connolly changed that policy, and he just merely set aside the sums of money that he thought reasonably could be spent.  It is very easy to throw dust in the eyes of the people by producing the Estimate figures, and you find at the end of the year, as we did with regard to figures produced by our precedessors, that in some cases less than half and a third was spent.  If the figures of expenditure were compared, you would find that they have increased during the last four or five years, but I am not putting forward that to discredit the work done by our predecessors.  I know that they initiated the scheme, and naturally you would expect a better result, so to <Col N="845" /> speak, from the work as time went on. I am referring to the matter because I think it is quite unfair in view of the difficulties of this Gaeltacht problem to have petty debating points like this put forward.  They are not helpful by any means.</P>

    <P>Dubhairt Mícheál Og Mac Pháidín go bhfuair Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall beagán beag bídeach, ach deirim-se nach bhfuair Gaeltacht Chonamara tada ar fiú caint air ach iad a choinneál síos.  An té atá thíos buailtear boc air.  Dubhairt an Leas-Cheann Comhairle, fear a bhfuil meas mór agam air agus fear a bheadh, tá mé ag ceapadh, dáiríre faoi'n nGaeltacht: &ldquo;Níl aon phlean ag lucht Fianna Fáil&rdquo; adeir sé &ldquo;ar an nGaeltacht&rdquo;. Mara bhfuil, ní easba Coimisiúnaí atá ortha.  Chuir na Sasanaigh Coimisiún ar bun le haghaidh na Gaeltachta agus nuair a tháinig Cumann na nGaedheal i bhféim chuir siad féin Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ar bhun. Níor shásuigh sé sin lucht Fianna Fáil ná an Seanadóir O Conghaile a bhí ina Aire&mdash;chuir siad Coimisiún de na &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; ar bun.  Na &ldquo;patriots&rdquo;, &mdash;bhfuil leitriú an fhocail seo athruithe? Sé an bealach leitrithe atá aca seo air &ldquo;pay&rdquo; in áit &ldquo;pat&rdquo;. Nuair a cuireadh an Coimisiún seo ar bun, Domhnall O Buachalla agus <Col N="847" /> Maitiú de Buitléir agus Pádraic O Máille, bhí an Ghaeltacht le chuile rud a fháil; ní bheadh duine ar bith bocht ann; bhí seacht luach le fáil ar chuile rud&mdash;má b'fhíor dóibh-san.  Ach an seanfhocal &ldquo;ar mhaithe leis féin a dhéanas an cat crónán&rdquo;.  Céard a thárla?  Rinneadh Cathaoirleach ar Bhord na nOibreacha Poiblidhe le £1,500 no £1,600 sa mbliain den tSeanadóir O Conghaile; rinneadh Seanascal de Dhomhnall O Buachalla, agus £10,000 sa mbliain dhó, agus indiú rinneadh Leas-Chathaoirleach ar an Seanad de Phádraic O Máille agus £700 sa mbliain dhó.</P>
    <P>Sin é tháinig as Coimisiún na Gaeltachta faoi Fhianna Fáil.  Na boicíní seo a chur suas, daoine uaisle a dhéanamh dhíobh, agus bocht na nGaeltacht a fhágáil mar bhí siad no a chur síos níos measa dá mb'fhéidir é. Sin é Cothrom na Féinne a fuair an Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh Coimisiún eile ar bun i ngeall ar Acaill agus an rud a d'éirigh do na daoine bochta ansin. Creidim nach bhféadfaimid mórán a radh faoi seo faoi láthair mar nach dtáinig an tuairisc isteach uatha fós, ach dubhairt an tAthair Séamus O Ceallaigh ag Ard-Fheis Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;Coimisiún mar dheadh.&rdquo;  Fágfa mé mar so é an t-am seo.</P>
    <P>Ní thaithíonn na figiúirí faoi na tighthe leis an Teachta Mac Phárthaláin&mdash;na figiúirí a fuair mise ar freagra ceiste d'iarr mé ar an Rúnaí Páirliminte. Seo iad anseo iad, béal na fírinne, sa leabhar seo.  An dá bhliain a raibh Cumann na nGaedheal i bhféim faoi Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht) thug siad deontaisí £173,431; an chúig bhliana atá Fianna Fáil i bhféim níor thug siad ach £159,784.  Dá réir sin thug Cumann na nGaedheal i dhá bhliain £13,000 a thighthe sa nGaeltacht níos mó ná thug Fianna Fáil i gcúig bhliana.  Agus an méid gaisge atá aca faoi dhéanamh tighthe sa nGaeltacht!</P>
    <P>Anois beagán faoi Cheilp is faoi Charraigín.  Feicim i Leabhar na Meastachán go bhfuil siad ag caitheamh £2,500 níos lugha i mbliana ná chaith siad anuraidh.  Chaith siad anuraidh níos lugha ná chaith siad athrú anuraidh agus mar sin ghá chur <Col N="848" /> anuas o bhliain go bliain.  Nuair a bhí Cumann na nGaedheal i réim bhí an Cheilp ag dul o £8 go £10 an tonna; anois an praghas is fearr atá Fianna Fáil a thairisgint uirthi £4.  Is dá mbeadh sé dhá déanamh féin chorrdhuine a gheobhadh é seo.  D'réir mo bharúl-sa ceilp ar £4 an tonna ní bheadh sé pingne sa ló ag daoine bheadh gá déanamh.  Agus a bhfuil obair ar bith chó hanróiteach léí? Fliuch, fuar o mhaidin go tráthnóna na daoine atá ghá déanamh&mdash;go minic iad go básta i bhfairrge.</P>
    <P>Ach cén tsuim atá ag oifigeacha Roinn na Gaeltachta annseo fhaid is tá siad féin íoctha go maith?  Céard a rinneadh d'Oileán Arann, Conamara, Acaill no a leitheidí o tháinig siad seo isteach?  Dheamhan faic, ach déirce dhá chuid féin a thabhairt don amadán.  D'iarr sagart pobail Rosmuc agus mé féin agus b'fhéidir cuid de na Teachtaí ar an taobh thall droichead a chur ar shruth Dhún Mánus i Rosmuc.  Dá ndéanfaí é seo dhéanfadh sé maith don tír; d'osclóchadh sé suas tír; bheadh sé réidh ag na daoine sa gceanntar sin a dhul go aontaighe Chasla, an Spidéil agus na Gaillimhe; agus bheadh sé réidh ar muinntir an Spidéil a theacht go Rosmuc agus a leitheide d'áit.</P>
    <P>Sruth an-chontabhairteach é seo. Báthadh daoine cheana ag dul treasna ann.  Cheapfá go ndéanfaí é seo mara mbeadh tada ann ach gur í ngar dhó seo a chaith an Piarsach laetheanta go leor.  Ar an spota seo a sgríobh sé &ldquo;Sean-Mhaitias&rdquo;.  Tá mé cinnte dá mbeadh sé beo go ndéanfaí é seo.  Nár dheas is nár áluinn an rud dhá ndéanfaí é seo, agus &ldquo;Droichead an Phiarsaigh&rdquo; a ghlaodhach air.  Tá mé cinnte go dtiúbhradh a dhriofúr cead é seo a dhéanamh; agus na daoine a thiocfadh ina ndiaidh bheadh a fhios aca gur chaith sé cuid dá shaoghal annseo.</P>
    <P>Má bhreathuíonn an tAire ar an rud adubhairt mise ar Vóta Choimisiún na Talmhan feicfe sé go bhfuil rud eicínt ann a dhéanfadh maith don tír dá ndéanfaí é.  Ach tá faitíos orm nach ndéanfa sé tada agus nach bhfuil fonn air tada a dhéanamh mar níor dearnadh tada o tháinig siad isteach.  Chuimhuigheadh sé ar an rud atá mé ag dhul a rá&mdash;is olc í an aithrighe mhall <Col N="849" /> admhuighdís a gcás mar tá sé sgríobhtha ar chlár ghlan a n-éadain nach ndearna siad tada.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a few questions which have been touched upon here in English.  The first question is in relation to housing.  I am not standing here to answer for what the Government have done in that matter. <Col N="850" /> The more the Government do in that direction, the more I like it.  As a matter of fact, it would be more or less up to me to criticise, as far as I could, the Government for not going far enough, but I find myself in the position of having to say that the Government have spent far more money in the Gaeltacht than any previous Government.  They have spent it very well, and it has not gone astray.  The people are very grateful to them, and I wish now, speaking here as a representative of the Gaeltacht, to thank the Government for what they have done.  They have certainly done marvellous work.  I did not myself believe that they would be able to do the amount of work they have done when I was before the electorate of Galway.  I should, however, like this question of the Gaeltacht to be tackled in a way entirely different from that in which it has been tackled by the British Government, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government or the Fianna Fáil Government.  I think that the commission established some time ago of which the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Moylan, is in charge, should be re-established as a Congested Districts Board.</P>

      <P>The Gaeltacht question is a very big question because the population there is dense, but the people there are not quite so dense. At present it is a question of migrating either to England or America.  The people cannot go to America, so they are going to England and the question before the people who represent these areas is: what are we going to do to keep the Gaeltacht alive and, at the same time, utilise the people there for the purpose of propagating the Irish language?  They are the survivors of the old Celtic people.  They are the people who kept the language going, and if we want to take this question seriously, if we want some return from the money that is now being expended in these areas under the various Departments, and have the activities of these various Departments co-ordinated, we must get a Department that will deal solely with these people in such a way as to enable them to earn a decent livelihood at home.  We want to ensure that they will retain the language and help in spreading the language throughout the country.  We are now spending a considerable amount of money under the Education Vote and other Votes for the propagation of the Irish language.  This Vote, of course, has no connection with the Education Vote but, at the same time, it bears a certain relation to it.  After all, the money spent in the Gaeltacht should be spent in a co-ordinated, orderly fashion.  I believe that if we consider it worth while to save the Irish language, and incidentally the people of the Gaeltacht, it is also worth while to re-establish some, board on the lines of the old Congested Districts Board. I said that when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office and I repeat it now.  I believe that I am voicing the feelings of the people in my area when I make that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised here about housing in the Gaeltacht.  It is very good to get housing grants and we appreciate them very much.  I dealt with this question of housing when I <Col N="852" /> was a Deputy in opposition and I hold the same opinions in regard to it now as I did then.  It does not happen that because I sit on the Government Benches I have changed my mind.  As regards housing, it is all very well to give the people very big windows and doors, in order to give the wolf a better opportunity of looking into the houses.</P>

      <P>Housing has certainly been looked after by both Governments. Our Government had done a lot more work on housing than was done previously, but the Cumann na nGaedheal Government spent a certain amount on housing also.  The Gaeltacht housing scheme was inaugurated by Deputy Blythe, I think.  We should, however, remember that no livelihood is attached to most of the houses that have been built, and that is a question that I should like to see tackled.  If you build houses in an urban area where industries are established, the people who occupy these houses can get employment and can pay the rent; but when you build houses in a Gaeltacht area, unless you build them on a holding of land, you are building them without giving any tangible method to these people which will enable them to pay the rent.</P>

      <P>The Government have certainly done a lot of work.  We hear <Col N="853" /> much criticism nowadays about emigration to England, but I heard the very same people who are now criticising the Government say from a public platform some years ago: &ldquo;What is the use of bothering about these people; they will be gone to America in a year or two.&rdquo;  That was said in my presence, that because the people in the country were emigrating to America, it was no use doing anything for them. That emigration was a very welcome development for the Cumann na nGaedheal Government because possibly these emigrants would be voters who would not support them.  Now they are going to England, and we hear all this criticism about emigration. Emigration was always there. As far as I can remember anyway, 30,000 people emigrated from this country every year.  Now a lot of them are staying at home and getting work here.  The Government are doing what they can in regard to that matter.  I wish they were doing more, and I should like to get the assistance of the Fine Gael Party in seeing what else can be done.</P>

I am only speaking for my own part of the country, and I know that this emigration to England is nothing compared with the amount of emigration to America in my youthful days.  Those who went to America were scarcely ever seen in this country again.  Those who go to England are coming back yearly and taking their holidays here.  They are not completely lost to the country. They may be of very great assistance to us over there at some future time.</P>

      <P>However, there is no use in getting heated in this debate. I should like to get the opinion of the people opposite, who represent the same type of people as I represent in the Gaeltacht, on the question of re-establishing the Congested Districts Board.  If we agree on other things, surely we can agree on the important question of the best method of dealing with the people in the Gaeltacht.  If we could agree on this matter of having money put at the disposal of the suggested board, and giving them unlimited power as regards the spending of that money, we would be doing a lot of good for the people in the Gaeltacht.  I think no Party in this House should use the position of those people for any Party purpose.  I think if we could unite in our efforts to deal with that problem, we would be doing a very good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of things which this Vote has disclosed.  It has disclosed the continuing existence of a Parliamentary Secretary for this Department.  We heard so little about him during the past 12 months that I thought he had been dissolved or something.  This Vote reminds me of whipping a dead horse.  I feel that one degrades oneself and wastes one's time in discussing it.  It is an insult to the intelligence of anybody with any capacity to spend time in discussing the matters which are here put before us. I am sorry to see that Deputy Tubridy has left.  He says that this Government has done more for the Gaeltacht than the last Government.  That may be true; I am not going to discuss that matter for the moment.  What have they done?  During the year we have had in this House all this hypocritical parade about the preservation of the Gaeltacht, the preservation of the Irish language, and the necessity for preserving the Gaeltacht in order to preserve the Irish language.  If this Vote here represents the efforts of this <Col N="855" /> House and of this Government to save the Irish language, then I say nothing more hypocritical than the palaver which we have listened to here in this House during the past 12 months can be conceived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Gaeltacht is going to be preserved, it must be preserved by giving a livelihood to the manhood of the Gaeltacht.  Deputy Tubridy tells us that this Government has done more than the last Government in that regard.  I do not know what the last Government did.  I am not going to worry about that: I believe in dealing with to-day and to-morrow.  The Gaeltacht extends from Fanad Head, the most northerly point in my constituency, down to somewhere below Kinsale.  Let us see what money has gone to the manhood of this area from the Government which has done more for the Gaeltacht than the last Government. It is going to give them £2,800 for kelp and seaweed.  There is no indication as to how much per ton is given for the kelp or for the seaweed, but the gross sum is £2,800.  To take care of that £2,800, which the entire Gaeltacht is going to get, the costs are as follows:&mdash;Transport and storage, £1,200; Grinding, screening, bagging, etc., £660; Analysis and testing, £5; Stores, stationery, etc., £500; Miscellaneous expenses, including casual labour, £150; Assistance by way of cost of transport of seaweed sold by gatherers, £100.  The costs are £2,615, and the manhood of the Gaeltacht from Fanad Head in Donegal down to the most southerly point in Cork are going to get £2,800.  Yet this Government has done more for the Gaeltacht than any other Government! Has the Deputy any conscience when he can get up in this House and make statements of that kind, expecting them to be published in the Press for his constituents to read the next day or some other day?  I think that we here in this House, irrespective of Party, should pass a resolution of utter condemnation of this Government which is handling that problem.  Put that as a commercial proposition to any board of directors, and ask them to adopt it.  Kelp and carrageen together in the entire Gaeltacht <Col N="856" /> will get £3,112, and the costs of that are £3,361.  Yet an enlightened gentleman like Deputy Tubridy comes before this House to tell us what this Government has done and to prate about the Irish language.  Is not that enough to sicken anybody?  Is not the thing disgusting?  This is to save the Gaelic race.  The thing is too contemptible to discuss, as I said already.</P>
    <P>Some five or six years ago, when the present chairman of the Board of Works was Minister for this Department, I put up the proposal here that if you were going to do anything for this area you would have to go into the homes of the people and in some form or another give them reproductive work.  There is something to be said for what Deputy Tubridy stated.  I know what he means.  He talked about giving this £2 grant in the Gaeltacht. I am going to be straight and blunt. Is this House going to turn this entire area, that is to preserve the Gaelic race, into a huge workhouse where there will be no self-help and no self-reliance? Is that going to be the home of the Irish race, where every man and every woman will be standing like beggars waiting for money from someone and not one act of self-help done? The amount of money represented here divided up over that area is contemptible. There is no use in suggesting that that money is going to do anything for that area.  I know an area in my constituency, along a coast line of about four miles, into which eight or ten years ago £3,000 or £4,000 went for kelp and salmon in one year.  I know the people who got it.  And this miserable sum of £3,112 is going to do for the whole coast line of this country!</P>
    <P>This House apparently can give up any hope of this Government doing anything for the Gaeltacht to preserve its manhood and womanhood and to preserve it as the cradle of the Irish race and of the Gaelic tongue.  I was jeered at six years ago when I suggested that you should go into the homes of these people and give them something to do in their own homes. I remember Deputy Norton telling me that I was suggesting pigs and porridge for them.  I did not suggest that at all.  I think that a lot could be <Col N="857" /> done for these people, but I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister is going to do anything for them.  How could they?  What acquaintance have they with this huge problem?  How much work have they put into the organisation to do anything for this area?</P>
    <P>The old C.D.B. has been referred to. It makes one writhe to compare the present administration of this area with the work of the old C.D.B.  Think of the men who were on that board, think of their ability, and of the time and the energy they put into the work.  One of the greatest men this country ever produced was on that board and threw all his energies and talents into dealing with that trouble. Now we are asked to believe that we are going to save these people by the expenditure of £3,000.  I remember the late Cardinal O'Donnell applying all his talents to that mighty problem, because that is what it is.  Look at the Micawber attempts that are being made to-day to deal with it.  Think of all the men who were the Cardinal's colleagues on that board.  They did do something for that area.  More could be done, but no more could be humanly done with the resources that they had at their command than they did.  They applied their talents, their genius, and their energy to it. They put backbone and spirit into the people of that area and they maintained them during all these years. What is being done now?  I will not apply any term to this.  Deputy Bartley and Deputy Tubridy have done that.  We have given them the dole and we have given the £2 grant for children speaking Irish.  These people want that £2.  I know they do. But think of giving £2 to people for speaking their native language.  Where is that going to get them?  What are their fathers doing?  They should be out gathering kelp and selling it.  That is what I want to see these people doing.  I have been told that the market for kelp is bad.  That is untrue. There are times of depression in connection with any industry.  The curious thing is that while this Government are only giving a nominal price for kelp, British buyers are <Col N="858" /> coming to Rathlin Island, round to the Six-County area where kelp is gathered, and giving as much as £10 per ton for it.  That is not being done for charity.  That is not being subsidised by a Government Department. That is being done by British speculators, private individuals, who have some object in view and that object is not charity.</P>
    <P>This Department has the External Affairs Department, the Trade Commissioner in London, trade agents everywhere, and ambassadors in Berlin, Paris, Rome and New York to get into touch with.  English merchants are buying kelp for some purpose, and they are not subsidised by any Department.  They are not doing it for charity.  There is something else behind it.  Does the Government Department know anything about that?  While we are prepared for such subsidies in these areas, we want to get some results and not this sort of thing.  The Parliamentary Secretary must know that British merchants who deal in kelp are in the market and are giving £10 a ton. What is the explanation for that?  The curious thing is that they did not buy kelp in our territory.  Was that because of the economic war?  Has the Parliamentary Secretary any information about it?  I have no method of getting it, as I have not the organisation behind me that the Parliamentary Secretary has.  He has the Departments of External Affairs, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, as well as trade agents abroad, to go to. What information do all these supply as to the prospects of this industry? It is being subsidised so as to pay an economic price, but the bill for storage appears to be the most important part of it.  Deputy Tubridy spoke about re-constituting the Congested Districts Board.  What is happening? The men who went out after the tide to gather kelp and who carted it are going out of the business altogether. If the tradition is not maintained in the homes of the people, the industry will die out.  In these areas there are only two things for the people to depend upon, kelp and fishing.  The sea fisheries are dead.  I cannot deal <Col N="859" /> with fisheries now, but I say that they are part of the same problem, and that these two Departments should never have been separated.  They should be under the same control. The Parliamentary Secretary states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The reduced Estimates for marine products is, in effect, more notional than real, as the Department is willing to take all kelp offered for sale.  In the Estimate for last year provision was made for something in the nature of 1,000 tons and a quantity of seaweed, but actually only some 400 tons were offered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is clever.  The trend of the whole situation is that this industry is going down and down, and will ultimately disappear.  That industry brought great wealth to these people. I admit that the work is hard.  I would like to see the people paid for hard work.  It is a slavish job saving and carting kelp.  While the Department estimated for 1,000 tons, it only got 400 tons.  Imagine only 1,000 tons from the whole western seaboard.  Ten years ago 1,000 tons would be gathered on six or seven miles of the shore in County Donegal.  I remember that the then departmental head wanted to send a ship to Limerick from Donegal to carry 1,000 tons of kelp.  At the same time two other boats were chartered from Glasgow to carry kelp from Burtonport, Tory Island, Fanad and Malin.  It is worthy of speculation as to whether this Government will not completely destroy the spirit and manhood of this area. I do not know if what Deputy Tubridy stated has been the cause, or if the giving of the dole has put people out of employment.  I am not going that far.  If it is, it is tragic.  This Government has attempted to commit many crimes against the country, but if that is true it is the greatest crime of all.</P>
    <P>Perhaps as another generation grows up, young men will not go out to fish in small curraghs in storms in which perhaps they might lose their lives, and will not go to the sea shore before five or six o'clock in the morning to pull out and save seaweed, if money is to be got easier.  Is that what the Government <Col N="860" /> is doing for the Gaelic race?  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what he is really going to do.  Has he any really constructive policy, or is he going to abolish the present organisation and delegate his functions, covering fishing and everything else, to some other body, by giving it a considerable sum of money and saying: &ldquo;Here you are, go into this area and enter into production as far as is humanly possible?&rdquo; Of course, I will be told that it is easy to criticise, and I will be asked what suggestion I have to make with regard to kelp.  In that connection, I see no justification for British buyers and Scottish agents coming to Rathlin Island, and giving £10 a ton for kelp unless they were storing it up for the purposes of war.  The Parliamentary Secretary can get information of that kind and he should.  If these people who are individual business men in this business are prepared to take that risk, very well we will support the Parliamentary Secretary in taking it.  I want to keep these men in all this area working. I want to keep them working at the sea so that the tradition will remain there even though the industry has struck a bad patch in regard to prices. I do not want to say anything that would grate on anybody's nerves or temper.  This House has voted large sums of money in the last few years for very futile and idle things.  Would it not be far better than these silly schemes, ridiculous schemes, a reflection on this House, if the money were used for this purpose, paying we will say, since the decline in the price of kelp began, a flat rate of £5 per ton&mdash; a guaranteed rate of £5 per ton?  In that way, some of the money that has been wasted, wasted from the point of view of the taxpayer, for which there is no justification whatever, would be spent on work like this.  Had we a board like the Congested Districts Board, manned with men of the calibre of the men of that board, that would be handed over a sum of money of that kind, does anybody suggest that we would get a production of this kind? Not at all! We have here 400 tons of kelp and seaweed, both combined, you will remember.  Apparently, there is <Col N="861" /> some seaweed bought too, whatever it is bought for.  Whether the Department burn it themselves I do not know.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have the moral courage to get up and say: &ldquo;Very well, I have been a failure at this thing.  The thing is a fiasco,&rdquo; tender his resignation to the Government and say: &ldquo;Set up some other arrangement to deal with it, because I cannot.&rdquo;  It is not right for us to do these things, carrying on a sham of this kind and then make it appear that we are doing something to build a citadel of the Irish race.  Let us be quite frank about it.  Open confessions are good for the soul.  Let us have one.</P>
    <P>Now there was another very interesting thing, equally ridiculous, so ridiculous that I am ashamed to think that I am here and that this thing is produced by the Department&mdash;loans for industrial purposes, loans for the purchase of machines and equipment for rural industries&mdash;£10.  The industries of the Gaeltacht are going to get £10! Loans for the purchase and repair of turf boats&mdash; £10&mdash;some fresh paint put on them, I suppose.  Loans for the purchase of boats, carts and draught animals for use in connection with marine products and industries&mdash;£10.  Loans for the purchase of boats and transport services&mdash;£1,000.  Miscellaneous loans £500.  What are these loans for boats? I think we had a special Bill here during the last session to purchase, or rather either to purchase boats or to maintain a service from the harbour in Galway to some islands west of Galway.  I think it would be much better, if this fits into some service that the Gaeltacht Department are running, that there should be some co-ordination.  There was a Bill before the House and these should be put into the general thing and not have this thing of scraps here and scraps there and no co-ordination anywhere.</P>
    <P>I see that a new knitting factory is going to be opened in Bunbeg.  I give that my blessing in so far as it is a success.  I give it my condemnation in so far as it is only opened to be ultimately closed.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary expect success from <Col N="862" /> this or is it merely under pressure from somebody, that simply money is voted and a factory is opened and, of course, to keep it open for a time and then close it down again?  That is taking place down in the County Donegal.  I do not want any more shams of that kind.  If a factory is opened down there for knitting or any other purpose, I want it to be opened as an economic proposition, run on business lines and run successfully.  I do not want a factory being opened this month and closed down six months hence or some other time. The thing is awful, scrapping machinery and wasting everything, staff and everything else being thrown as scrap on the market.  Thousands of pounds worth of this stuff will be lying at Beggar's Bush until somebody buys it as a job lot.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan has referred to the tweeds.  Now, I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what is the actual position in Beggar's Bush.  What is the nature of the stock that is on hands at present?  Have last year's patterns been cleared?  If they have not, what amount is lying over?  If there is a substantial amount of last year's stock remaining on hands, what is the explanation of its lying on hands?  I do not want a repetition of what occurred some years ago.  Some enormous amounts of these tweeds of various kinds, running into a huge sum, lying there and ultimately sold for scrap price.  I remember the sneering of Senator Connolly, then the Minister for Lands, in this House on the position that he found in that connection.  Accepting what I see in these Estimates, there is no improvement yet.  I hope that the innovation of designers will mean an improvement.  I am anxious to know from the Parliamentary Secretary the actual procedure.  Have last year's patterns&mdash;the entire stock of last year's patterns&mdash;been cleared?  If they have not been cleared, what is the amount, at their wholesale price, that is remaining on hands at the end of the season, and if there is any substantial amount of them lying on hands at the end of the season, what is the explanation of the failure to <Col N="863" /> market them?  Was it due to intensive competition?  Was it due to quality, or was it due to not having the proper patterns?  The House is entitled to know this, because if public money is being voted to assist these areas and if for lack of design or some technical defect of that kind the industry has been strangled, the House should know that and should see that steps are taken to put an end to this.</P>
    <P>I would suggest&mdash;I made the suggestion before, and my colleague, Deputy Dillon, also&mdash;to the Parliamentary Secretary, that if he purposes to occupy the position that he now holds, that he should take steps and ask the Government for sufficient money, or the necessary money, to get these people into full production of kelp, and offer them, we will say, a flat rate of £5 a ton for it.  It is quite clear, looking at things humanly and looking at the abominable world that confronts us, that the whole of Europe is going headlong for a war.  That is an abominable prospect.  There it is&mdash; human vengeance and human jealousy. If that is so, of course, in a few years there is going to be an enormous demand for kelp.</P>

      <P>I agree, but, unfortunately, we cannot stop it.  I say the Parliamentary Secretary should make inquiries into that matter and consult with his own technical advisers. He should be advised by his representatives abroad, too.  I think then that, horrible as the purpose may be, there would be some justification for carrying on this kelp industry so as to keep our people in production. What is the Parliamentary Secretary doing about carrageen?  I understand that we have a staff at the British Empire Exhibition at Glasgow. Will carrageen be on exhibit there? Is the Parliamentary Secretary himself going to Glasgow?  He is getting paid for doing his job.  Is he going himself?  Has he a lady demonstrator there to demonstrate the uses to which carrageen can be put?  If not, why not?  The State is <Col N="864" /> paying rent for the stall at this exhibition, and we are paying a representative to look after that.  What part will the Parliamentary Secretary play at that exhibition?  Is he taking a first class demonstrator to demonstrate the various uses to which carrageen can be put?  If not, why are we, as taxpayers, asked to foot the bill for this huge expenditure for this exhibition?  The Parliamentary Secretary should go there himself; it is his job, and he should do it.  He should be in a position himself to see what successes are attending his efforts in this direction.  He should find out what orders are being booked. I hear some jeering on the Government Benches.  Why should they be jeering when one is speaking against this waste of money and a slipshod method of doing business?  No wonder some people jeer and snarl.  They are drawing a very substantial sum themselves.  Do they think they will not be called to account?  Why, if this work was well looked after, there would be three, four or five times the amount of kelp produced in the country than there is, and a market found for it through the Glasgow Exhibition and through the great advertisement the industry could be given there.  I saw in the Press recently that our representative, Mr. Dulanty was up there to receive Her Majesty.  Very well let us get something out of it that will be of some benefit to our people; otherwise why should we be there at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being done about pushing the tweeds at this British Empire Exhibition at Glasgow?  Have we there a first-class exhibit of the very latest products?  Have we a sales agent there, booking orders?  What are the prospects for Irish tweeds?  Are there models there of men's sports wear made from these tweeds?  Have we ladies there as mannequins exhibiting ladies' sports wear to be made out of these tweeds?  The Government have an opportunity, and an opportunity such as will not come to them every day, to advertise these goods now before the whole world.  Let us, when a business opportunity presents itself, grasp that opportunity to the full.  If <Col N="865" /> the Parliamentary Secretary fails now to grasp that opportunity, when does he hope to get another opportunity? There will be people at that Exhibition from all the Commonwealth Nations, from America, and from most of the continental countries.  Surely this is the best sales opportunity he will get for years to come.  Is he going to see that there are exhibited there the very latest patterns and cloths of the highest quality at the right prices?  I think it is of vital importance that the Parliamentary Secretary should have these things carefully looked into. Will he tell the House what has happened up to the present with regard to these sales and what are the prospects now with regard to kelp and carrageen?  I again suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should ask the Government to sanction sufficient funds so as to give a flat rate of £5 a ton for kelp.  That would be a reasonably economic figure. The people around the coast, at that price, would go on burning the kelp, and in slack times it could be stored up until a favourable opportunity arose for disposing of it at a profit.  That is the way in which the industry could be kept going.  It would be money well spent.  I do not mean to say that these people were ever living in luxury or that they had any great wealth from this industry, but a great many of them were fairly well off.  They were people who did not expect too much.  If the industry is again revived it will be a great help to these people.  These are some of the matters to which I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give his urgent, earnest and energetic attention.</P>

      <P>Táim ag éisteach le leath-uair leis an Teachta McMenamin ag rádh a lán mar gheall ar cheist seo na Gaedhealtachta.  Labhair go leor Teachtaí eile freisin ar an gceist chéadhna ach is beag an t-eolas a bhí ag a bhfurmhór ar an sgéal.  'Sé mo thuairim-se go mba cheart do dhuine éigin a innsean dóibh cá bhfuil an Ghaedhealtacht agus beagán a innsean dóibh fúithi.  Sin a bhfuil d'eolas ag a lán acu air.  Chuala mé Teachta annso a rádh nach bhfuil an Riaghaltas ag déanamh oiread is ceart dóibh a <Col N="866" /> dhéanamh do mhuinntir na Gaedhealtachta. Táim féin lán-tsásta go bhfuil siad ag déanamh a ndicheall ar an gceist sin a réidhteach.  'Séan chéad rud a rinneadar dhá phunt a thabhairt in aghaidh gach páiste atá ag dul ar scoil sa nGaedhealtacht. Cabhruigheann sé sin go mór le neartú leis an nGaedhilge sa nGaedhealtacht.</P>

Tá an oiread Gaedhilge dhá labhairt sa nBreac-Ghaedhealtacht is atá sa bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht.  Nuair do bhí Riaghaltas Chumann na nGaedheal i gcomhacht chuireadar i roinn na Fíor-Ghaedhealtacht na scoltacha sin a raibh aithireacha agus níathaireacha na bpáistí ar a dtaobh agus tá siad sin ar a dtaobh go láidir fós.  Thugadar an Bhreac-Ghaedhealtacht ar na scoltacha bhí ina n-aghaidh.  Tá fhios agam féin faoi'n sgéal sin.

Nuair a bheas an Riaghaltas ag cabhrú le tionnsgail na ceilpe beidh siad ag cabhrú leis an nGaedhilge cho maith.

Ba cheart eolas a bheith ag gach Teachta ar an nGaedhilge is cuma liom cén chuid den Teach seo a bhfuil sé.  Ach tá an Riaghaltas ag déanamh a ndíchill ar son na ceilpe agus an chairrigin.

      <P>I think this is an Estimate that calls for some explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary. That explanation is in my opinion rendered all the more necessary because of what we have heard from the Fianna Fáil Benches this evening.  The only thing that the Fianna Fáil Government has to its credit in dealing with the Gaeltacht, is unemployment assistance and the grant of £2 for each child in Irish-speaking families.  Yet, these Deputies pride themselves on all they have done since they came into office. Deputy Bartley referred to the amount which the present Government has spent on housing as compared with the previous Government.  If Deputies will look at the Estimates for 1931-32, they will find that the total Estimate <Col N="868" /> for Gaeltacht services in that year was £141,000, while the total Estimate to-day for 1938-39 for Gaeltacht services is £91,000.</P>

Can the Parliamentary Secretary account for the fact that under sub-head A, salaries, wages and allowances, the headquarters staff in 1931-32 cost £14,453, with 40 people employed on that staff and that in 1938-39 we have 45 of a staff costing the State £16,545, although the total expenditure has been reduced by £50,000 inside five years?
