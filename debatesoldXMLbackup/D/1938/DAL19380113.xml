The preparation of a revised design has been entrusted by the board of health to a consulting engineer.  As regards the second part, it was considered that an improvement in the design submitted for the water tower at Rush could be secured by a rearrangement of the steel reinforcement and that such improvement should be incorporated in a fresh design for Finglas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it has been brought to his notice that a number of people who were removed from slum clearance areas in Cork City to the houses erected by the Cork Corporation&mdash;Spangle Hill&mdash;are not entitled to receive unemployment assistance at the rate applicable to unemployed persons in Cork City, and that the people concerned are not eligible for employment on relief schemes promoted by Cork Corporation; whether in fact the Cork Corporation has requested him to amend the Unemployment Assistance Acts so as to extend the rate of benefit applicable to city workers to include unemployed men residing in the Spangle Hill area, and, if so, whether he intends introducing proposals for legislation for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that a number of persons formerly resident in the County Borough of Cork were, in the process of the clearance of slum areas, transferred to a place outside the borough boundaries and I have been requested by the Corporation of Cork to amend the Unemployment Assistance Act so as to extend the rates of unemployment assistance applicable to residents in the county <Col N="3097" /> borough to persons resident in Spangle Hill, which is, I understand, situated outside the boundaries of the county borough.  It is clear that the rates of unemployment assistance payable within the county borough cannot be paid to persons resident outside that area and these rates cannot be extended to certain persons resident in the immediate neighbourhood of, but outside, the city boundary without general extension.  I do not propose to introduce legislation to meet a case of this description.  If the Council of the Cork County Borough, which is the body responsible for the transfer of the men in question, might see fit to take steps to extend the boundaries of the county borough, so as to bring those persons into the city, or provide some other form of compensation, I would raise no objection.  I should add, however, that wherever the city boundaries are placed, there will be recipients of unemployment assistance just outside them who therefore cannot receive the city rates.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to the Commissioners of Public Works by the Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation and by the Great Southern Railways for the enlargement of the Carlisle Pier at Dun Laoghaire harbour.  The present pier is capable of taking at any stage of the tide the largest type of boat likely to be used on the cross-Channel service and, while some inconvenience is occasioned at peak periods of traffic, the pier is large enough to accommodate the normal numbers utilising this service.</P>
      <P>There are several bodies concerned in the use of the pier and the Commissioners have already intimated their willingness to have any specific proposal or plan examined and considered. Up to the present no such proposal has been submitted.</P>
      <P>The dues collected in respect of Dun Laoghaire harbour form part of the appropriations-in-aid of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings out of which Vote the cost of maintaining the harbour is met.  The dues received from the railway company during the past three years, i.e., 1934-37 amounted in the aggregate to £54,937 7s. 11d The expenditure during the same years amounted to £43,719 12s. 5d.</P>
      <P>The dues received from the railway company for the preceding three years, viz., 1931-34, amounted to £53,652 15s. 2d., whilst the expenditure for the corresponding three years amounted to £60,588 4s. 2d.  It must be realised that, apart from normal maintenance, extensive periodical repairs arising out of storm damage, to which the main breakwaters are always liable, have to be undertaken from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has already been made by more than one Deputy to the hardship inflicted on certain members of the community in relation to unemployment assistance.  I refer to persons who were removed outside the county borough areas.  I do not want to say any more on that question now as that phase of it has been discussed. I feel, however, that there is something in the challenge that was thrown out by the Minister from time to time, and that was just as frequently not answered when discussing matters of this nature, involving huge sums of money.  Suggestions are made by the official Labour Party, but nothing concrete has ever come from them.  The Minister asked for alternative suggestions from the official Opposition, but has more often directed that question to the Labour Party than to any other Party.  As far as my experience goes, they have always evaded the Minister's challenge.  For instance, no later than last evening the Minister asked the Labour Party to put forward any other scheme or any useful suggestions and to indicate how they were to be financed.  So far nothing has come from the official Labour Party but a lot of high-falutin' schemes that could never be put into practice.  It is admitted that there is destitution and poverty, and the very fact that this Bill has been introduced, to supplement assistance to these unfortunate people, is sufficient evidence that the Minister and the Government acknowledge that there is more destitution and more poverty prevalent now than when the first measure of unemployment assistance was introduced.  It seems to me, between the official Labour Party and the Government that the position is a Dickensian one, that &ldquo;Codlin is your <Col N="3104" /> friend, not Shortt&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Shortt is your friend, not Codlin.&rdquo;  The Government asked the Opposition Parties how they were to find the money for this purpose.  They frequently asked if they were to tax the food of the people.  We all know that the food of the people is sufficiently taxed.  They also asked what alternative there was, or if they could suggest the taxation of any other commodities.  Any answer that was given failed to satisfy me, and for that reason I sympathise with the Government on this question.  My sympathies are with the provision in this measure of attempting to stop the flow of people from the urban areas into the cities.  I approved of that section last night when the Minister was making his speech, and I endorse his remarks when he said it was because of certain conditions that operate in rural areas that he did not want to encourage people to go from these areas to the cities and, accordingly, he had this particular section inserted. It is all very fine for certain members of the Labour Party to stand up and advocate the expenditure of more money on the unemployed, but I suggest they have no solution of the problem.  I pay this tribute to the Government and to the Minister, that at least they are doing their little bit to help in some way the unemployed in the position that has been created by the Government and their erstwhile colleagues, the Labour Party.  I offered a suggestion to the Government on one occasion, and I charge the Labour Party with aiding and abetting the Government in inflicting misery and destitution on the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>A Party of officials. I want to suggest that when measures were brought before the Dáil involving very considerable sums of money being expended, on what I considered to be absolute luxuries, we had no opposition from the Labour Party.  I refer to the creation of a new Army. <Col N="3105" /> What is the necessity for a new Army in this country?  None.  It involves the expenditure of a large sum of money, and on the Army Vote we had no protest and also no protest against the huge pensions that are being paid to able-bodied persons in this country. I made my protest then and would be prepared to make it at all times, no matter how much unpopularity or hostility I incurred in doing so.  It costs the Labour Party nothing to get up here and advocate the expenditure of millions of money on wild-cat schemes, but what would they do if they themselves were ever in office?  I am really hopeful that they will be in office some time.  I am sure they would get very short shrift from the public, because the public having had one experience of them in office would find that it was an experience so dearly bought that they would never return a dozen of them to this Dáil again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one word that I have to say in conclusion, and it is that there is a tendency on the part of the Government to shirk their responsibilities to the people.  The Government, instead of financing the whole of these schemes, call on the local authorities and the various county boroughs and urban councils to help in the financing of them.  I regard that policy as wrong.  While I am prepared, and I think every decent citizen should be prepared, to put his hand deep down in his pocket to help to allay the sufferings and the misery of our unemployed brethren, at the same time I think that duty should become a national charge by means of direct Government taxation.  We want all the people to help our unfortunate brethren who are unemployed.  That should be done by the Government by direct taxation, getting all the people to put their hands into their pockets to help and not by going to the local authorities for part of the money.  Of course, in the final analysis all taxation, whether it be local or national, comes out of the pockets of the people, but if what I suggest were done it would, I think, be a splendid experiment.  It would be the acid test of sincerity to ask people to put their hands into their pockets to make <Col N="3106" /> some little contribution towards relieving the position of the many thousands of unfortunate people who now find themselves unemployed.  I hope this is the last measure of the kind that we shall ever have occasion to discuss in this House.  I hope that at the end of another 12 months some scheme or schemes will be devised which will have the effect of putting all our unemployed to work.  If that is not done you will eventually create the dole mind in this country; and once that is done&mdash;it has happened in another country&mdash;it will be very hard to get people back to work again.  I speak for thousands and thousands of unemployed who come to me day after day.  All those men want work.  They do not want the dole.  If the Minister could devise some scheme, or a number of schemes, which would have the effect of putting those men back at work, he would have done something that would be of real benefit to the persons concerned and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for the purpose of calling the Minister's attention to one point that I had intended dealing with when the Bill was last before us.  My second reason for rising is to refer to some of the remarks made by an erstwhile member of the Labour Party.  Having listened to him for some little time, I have a doubt as to who is bringing in this legislation.  I think it is not the Minister for Industry and Commerce at all, but Deputy Norton on behalf of the Labour Party.  I think that is the only conclusion that any reasonable person could come to, having listened to the speech of Deputy Anthony.  The Deputy intimated that the Labour Party had done nothing except to advocate the spending of money.  He also said that the Labour Party were going to get us money to indulge in all kinds of wild-cat schemes.  If the Deputy would look at the Order Paper he would see a motion on it in the name of the Labour Party asking the Minister to take steps to increase the amount of unemployed assistance.  Evidently, Deputy Anthony's cure for all the unemployment that there is in the <Col N="3107" /> country is to come here and attack individuals or perhaps a Party.  If the Deputy continues in that strain, I think it is safe to predict that there will be considerably more unemployment than there is at the moment in Cork, which he represents.</P>
      <P>The one point that I want to bring to the Minister's notice is in connection with the Unemployment Period Orders which he makes.  I think the Minister mentioned that the £150,000 which he is spending would be increased.  I suggest that sum will not be spent because of the application of these Period Orders which run, I think, from June to October in each year.  The making of them causes a good deal of hardship, especially in certain towns that have not town commissioners. A single man resident in a town not under the control of town commissioners is deprived of unemployment assistance for possibly the five months that a Period Order runs. That is a peculiar anomaly that arises in some towns in North County Dublin.  In Balbriggan, for instance, you have town commissioners.  A single man there is eligible, under certain circumstances, for unemployment assistance during the summer months, but in the town of Skerries, four miles distant and with practically the same population, a single man is not eligible for unemployment assistance during this particular period because the town has no town commissioners. In Howth they have an urban council and in Balbriggan the town commissioners.  I would ask the Minister to take this peculiar anomaly into consideration when making his Unemployment Period Orders.  At present great hardship is inflicted on the unemployed in those towns which have no town commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to the speeches of Deputy.  Anthony and Deputy McGowan.  Deputy Anthony made a speech which in some ways, was highly commendable.  I should say that he had the courage to face facts, and the first fact is that if you are going <Col N="3108" /> to get benefit you have got to pay for it.  That is one fact which the official Labour Party are not prepared to face at all.  They think that there is, apparently, some unnamed, undiscovered, unidentifiable pool out of which money can come: that an indefinite amount of money can be taken out of that, and delivered to this service or to that service without the burden actually coming back on the people.  That is complete nonsense, and the commendable part of Deputy Anthony's speech was that he recognised it as such.  There was a considerable amount of comment yesterday in relation to a speech made by myself. I took the trouble to look it up, at any rate the portions of it which had been attacked, for the purpose of seeing whether there was anything in it which I had any cause to regret.  I have no cause to regret anything I said.  What I said was said in the spirit that you cannot get blood out of a stone, and that if you are going to get services you have got to pay for them.  I am prepared to repeat every word of that speech and to say that I agree with it.  I may say that at the time it was made it was not, in essentials, challenged by anybody.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony dropped from that high standard of courage and intelligent democracy, which is represented by stating that the public must pay for what it gets, into the doctrines which have been preached by the official Labour Party: by Deputy Corish for instance, and by people of that mentality&mdash;people who seem to think that there is something radically wrong in taking money in the form of local taxation and something, apparently, almost spiritually right in taking the same money from the same people in the form of central taxation.  I want to come to agreement with Deputy Anthony and with the House in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in this case, because here we are facing facts.  The first fact is that if anybody wants anything he has got to pay for it.  The second fact is that the same people pay the taxes whether they pay them to the <Col N="3109" /> local authority or to the central sources.  Broadly and generally, the same people pay the local and central taxation.  The whole urge behind the story of what is called making it a national charge&mdash;making roads a national charge, making unemployment a national charge, making afforestation a national charge, making drainage a national charge&mdash;is not to shift the burden from one to another, but to hide the fact that the burden is there.</P>

      <P>That is where the thing is wrong.  In relation to unemployment, for instance, at the present moment, in relation both to their subscription to the central Unemployment Insurance Fund and in relation to their subscription to funds for unemployment, it is the policy of the Government that the local authorities shall contribute something and that they shall contribute something for the specific purpose which Deputy Anthony has declared&mdash;that it shall be brought home to them that they are paying.  As long as local councillors, local mayors, local representatives, can blame the central Government for the height of taxation they will claim without any hesitation, conscience, or reserve, apparently, that money should be spent on local services.  But, when they are asked to tell their own constituents, to tell the people to whom they are going to apply for votes, that they themselves are responsible for taxing those local people in that capacity even to the smallest extent, then they hesitate very grievously as to how they will or will not raise the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could quote time after time from the records of this House that there is something dreadful about local taxation.  Why?  It is because a man who has no hesitation in allowing the central Government to have the responsibility for taxation is afraid to take that responsibility face to face with his own constituents in the form of local taxation.  Why should a local authority not contribute to the relief of unemployment?  Why should a city as rich as Dublin, with the lowest unemployment burden of any portion <Col N="3110" /> of the country, be relieved from the necessity of meeting, out of its rates, some of its own obligation to its own poor?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not relieved of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Why should it be relieved of the obligation of doing more, as it could do more?  Take Dublin County and Dublin City, the richest portion of the country, with the lowest unemployment or poverty burden of any portion of the State. Is it contended that there is something wrong in those who are elected by the citizens of Dublin going to the citizens of Dublin and asking them to do more for the relief of unemployment? It apparently is immoral; it is very inconvenient.  It is very inconvenient in Wicklow; it is very inconvenient in Wexford; it is very inconvenient in the City of Cork.  But the fact that they have to bear some of that burden openly is their claim to a right to interfere with, to criticise, to supervise; and it is a very direct inducement to them to see that efficiency is shown both in the spending of that money, in the selection of the works, and in other things of that kind.  It is for that reason that I am in favour definitely&mdash;it is not a question of choosing between two evils&mdash;of local authorities having to contribute to this Unemployment Insurance Fund. I am in favour of local authorities having to contribute openly and clearly to unemployment funds in order that those in whose area the benefits of these works are shown shall have the responsibility of having contributed to them, and shall have the responsibility, and the power involved in that responsibility, of supervising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case, in relation to unemployment insurance, only in certain districts, and on a calculation of previous expenditure that used to be made by these districts, in lieu of that previous expenditure made by these districts for the purpose of dealing with home assistance, have they been asked to contribute.  It is a perfectly legitimate thing to do.  Carrying out the same policy in relation to relief works, every local authority which is in a position to do so has been asked to contribute, and every one of them <Col N="3111" /> has been asked to contribute on the basis of their power to contribute.  Is there anybody going to quarrel with that as a principle unless you object to the inconvenience of bringing home to the people in the local places the fact that the central taxation has to be paid by them?  In distributing the unemployment fund at present that money goes to every county and to every district and, as far as we can effect it, to every man in every county and in every district in proportion to his necessity.  Every single authority is asked to contribute to that fund, not on an equal or uniform basis, not in the measure of their necessity, but in the measure of their power.  The poorer the district, the more money they get; the poorer the district, the less they have to pay in proportion to the money they do get.  Is that a just and proper way of doing it?  The only argument I can see against a local authority having to face openly the responsibility of contributing to it is the inconvenience of the local councillors who have to stand over the job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey last night alluded to a speech made by me.  I do not want to trouble reading it again here, but I have read that speech and there is nothing in that speech which I have any cause to regret in any way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the passage. It suits me perfectly.  I was dealing with a speech made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;What he dragged in to-day for his gramophone record were the poor &mdash;the poor upon whom all these taxes are being put, the poor who are to be taxed out of existence, the poor whom he never taxed, the poor, the taxing of whom he would not tolerate.  Now we are all familiar with this: that whenever any vested interest is challenged, such, for instance, as breweries, all the shares are held by the widows and orphans. In exactly the same way, when any tax is put on which is an indirect tax, the only people who pay it are the very poor.  Now, everybody knows that is not true.  The one thing that I agree with in the whole discussion, on both sides, is the fact that this Budget has brought people up against the facts, and I am glad they are brought up against the facts &mdash;both sides of the facts.  One of the facts is that all the tobacco, all the butter, all the bacon, all the tea, and all the entertainment is not consumed by the poor.  Tobacco, sugar, tea, is eaten, consumed or drunk by every member of this Dáil, by every member of the Strangers' Gallery, by every member of the Reporters' Gallery, by every member of the Seanad, by every member of the Chamber of Commerce, by every member of every golf club in the country, by everyone of the thousands of people who have been storing up knowledge of the doctrines of Cobden in the last few weeks. Everybody knows that, and why anybody should have the effrontery&mdash; Deputy Davin is not the only one, not by any means&mdash;to get up in this House and keep on speaking, deliberately ignoring the fact that every member of the House knew he was talking nonsense, I do not understand. Does anybody now deny that <Col N="3113" /> all of these things, which we are supposed to be only extracting from the very poor, are consumed by the whole community, and, if they are consumed by the whole community, on whom better, or more rightly, should the taxes be put?  Deputy Anthony says that these are taxes which fall upon the working-classes. Why should they not fall upon the working-classes?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Somebody here interjected a remark and I went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is there anyone saying that taxes should not fall upon the working-classes? I think we were told by Deputy Davin that the only asset to the country were the people who are working.  We believe, Deputy Davin believes, the members of the Opposition and members of the Government all believe that three-quarters of the population of this country are made up of the working-classes of one kind or another.  Is anyone here going to say that three-quarters of the total population shall be exempt from taxes, and, if they are not going to say that, what is the grievance?  But, perhaps they will say: could you not choose taxes none of which would be paid for by the poor?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I have said all I required to say.  I simply got up to raise a point which to me is very important.  That is the question as to whether or not it is right that local authorities, in their capacity as local authorities, should be asked to contribute to schemes such as unemployment assistance, unemployment relief and other schemes of that kind.  The contention which I have put to the House, in relation to all these schemes which it is now suggested should be made national charges, is that it is merely a matter of hiding the burden and not of shifting the burden; that in so far as the local authorities are concerned with the unemployment problem in their midst, in so far as they are concerned with the administration of the schemes which they carry out, and in so far as they are concerned with unemployment assistance and rates of unemployment assistance benefit, they have a very definite right and a very definite obligation to contribute to them, to do it openly, and in virtue of that contribution they have the right to criticise and supervise.  If the whole of the money came from central sources there would be very little justification, in theory at any rate, or in democratic practice, for the continuance of the local authority. Representation should go with local taxation; the people who pay shall govern.  That is the principle on which democratic government has worked.  If local authorities are, in relation either to roads, drainage or anything else, relieved of all taxation, then their claim to authority as local authorities seems to me to fall to the ground at <Col N="3115" /> the same time.  What I am principally anxious to do is to see that, in relation to matters of that kind, in which local authorities have a direct benefit in expenditure, they shall openly tax their own constituents for portion of the money which is used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the Parliamentary Secretary is suffering from some kind of confusion.  I have yet to learn that the local authorities have anything to do, good, bad, or indifferent with the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not relieve home assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  Statistics do not show that at all.  When the Bill was introduced in 1933, we were told, when the Minister was about to ask the local authorities to levy a rate in order to assist the Unemployment Insurance Act funds, that there would be an equivalent saving under the heading of home help.  Statistics have proved otherwise and I cannot understand how the Parliamentary Secretary can come to the conclusion that the local authority benefits in any way by the Unemployment Assistance Act. They have nothing, good, bad, or indifferent to do with its administration. The Parliamentary Secretary is probably mixing up the rotational schemes of employment under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  There again they have very little to do with the administration and perhaps that is all to the good, because there is a better distribution of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talks about certain councils or certain local representatives having to face the responsibility of levying this rate.  As far as I am concerned, I think he appeared to think that I objected to that.  I do not object to it at all.  What I object to is that in consequence of the fact that rotational schemes have been carried into operation in the last two or three years, the Unemployment Assistance Act has been <Col N="3116" /> relieved and there is less money being paid out in unemployment assistance than there was a couple of years ago. Notwithstanding that, the local authority is still called upon to pay the same amount of money although there has been a lesser sum paid under the head of unemployment assistance. The Parliamentary Secretary states that taxation levied either by the Government or by the local authority hits some people.  I interrupted to say that that did not apply in this particular case and I want to prove it now.  The Parliamentary Secretary apparently does not know that the county councils are not called upon to levy any rates at all in respect of this service and I suggested to the Minister yesterday that there were certain areas within the jurisdiction of the county councils which had populations of three or four thousand and which were governed by what are known as town commissioners. These commissioners have no authority to levy rates.  The rates are levied for that area by the county council and I asked the Minister to give permission to the county council to levy a rate in an area such as that which was governed by town commissioners, because the cost of living in a town with a population of three or four thousand is just as high as it would be in a town of over 7,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, is wrong in his contention that in this connection the same kind of people pay the tax or the rate, because it is only certain numbers of people who are called upon to pay the rate. Up to this, it has been people living in urban areas with a population of over 7,000. They are called upon, according to the Act, to pay 9d. in the £, but strictly speaking they have to pay 10d. in the £, because, in order to get the gross result of the 9d. rate it is necessary to levy a rate of 10d. in the £.  Here in Dublin they probably have to strike a rate of 1/7 in the £ in order to get the proceeds of 1/6 in the £, as there are certain rebates in relief of local taxation which, of course, affect the rate. The Minister insists, as I said, on the gross result of the 9d. rate or the 1/6. rate as the case may be.  I am not <Col N="3117" /> against the principle, but the Government, when they were assuming office in 1932, told us very definitely that they accepted it as their responsibility to relieve unemployment.  What I object to is that, having accepted that responsibility, they now throw the onus on the local authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been twitting this Party about where they would find the money. I forget the kind of answer which Fianna Fáil used to give the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when they were in power and were asking that question, but I have a distinct recollection of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in opposition asking for things that they consider impossible to give now.  They were not ready with an answer when they were asked where the money was to come from.</P>

They were not harebrain schemes when they were put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in opposition.  It was very interesting to listen to Deputy Anthony's speech.  I, for the life of me, cannot understand why he wanted to get up at all.  He told us he wanted to say something about the Bill before the House, but his whole time was taken up with an attack on the Labour Party.  It is also very interesting to hear the Parliamentary Secretary agreeing with him.  It is the first occasion on which I remember any kind of an agreement between the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Anthony.</P>

He has re-echoed the sentiments of people who have always been against the unemployed getting any measure of support. <Col N="3118" /> I think it is patent to everybody now that Deputy Anthony has not the confidence or the support of either the working people or the unemployed people of Cork City.  The things he now criticises the Labour Party for asking are the identical things that he himself used to ask for when he was a member of this Party.  It was very interesting to hear him being commended by the Parliamentary Secretary, and getting a &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from Deputy Gorey.  It is certainly a combination we have no desire to join.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I was not here during the whole of the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary, but I take it from the portion of his speech which I did hear that he was defending the section of the Act which was putting responsibility on certain local authorities for raising a certain part of this £150,000.  His main defence of that was to give them a sense of responsibility, so that he will get full value for the money spent in their particular districts.  Of course, that does not hold water as a defence, because, if that were the reason, it would apply to every local authority in the county, and not merely to a very small number of the total number of local authorities. The Parliamentary Secretary read again that long and interesting speech which he made on a former occasion regarding taxation, and the burden of taxation on the poor.  I do not know why he should have troubled himself and the House by reading at such length, because it was all contained in the one phrase: &ldquo;Why should they&rdquo;&mdash;that is the taxes&mdash;&ldquo;not fall upon the working classes?&rdquo;  That is what I said last night, but he denied that he had made that statement, and said I had quoted him wrongly.  I told him I was not purporting to quote him, but simply giving the House what I considered to be the gist of his remarks on that occasion.  His quotation to-day has confirmed that statement of mine. He went on to talk to-day as if any person in this House had objected to any portion of taxation falling on the working classes.  It would not be possible for even a financial genius like the Parliamentary Secretary to conceive a form of taxation that would <Col N="3119" /> not, either directly or indirectly, fall on the working classes.  What we did object to, and what we now object to, was that the working classes and the poor were bearing an undue burden of the taxation, and they are to-day carrying a heavier proportion of national taxation than perhaps ever before in this country.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary, of course, is a very plausible and convincing speaker, or rather he was at that time, because he was making, shall I say, his entry into public life in this country.  The people of this country did not then know the Parliamentary Secretary as they know him to-day, and perhaps they were not in a position to place the full value upon his words in the lengthy speeches of the period.  We have not got to the position where, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, if you want to help the working classes you must abolish income-tax; if you want to help the working classes you must put your taxes upon your foodstuffs.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talked about the local authorities contributing to the unemployment schemes, and said it was only right that they should do so.  The local authorities are contributing to unemployment schemes.  He talked about the representatives of local authorities being afraid to stand over increased rates or over the proposed schemes for the relief of unemployment in their particular area.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that it is not true of the majority of public authorities. I myself, as a member of a very small local authority in this country, recently proposed a scheme which will <Col N="3121" /> exhaust to the full the borrowing powers of that particular local authority&mdash;a scheme for which the estimate would be, I think, something around £35,000, which, I think the Parliamentary Secretary will admit, is a very big burden for a local authority with a population of less than 4,500 to shoulder.  That local authority, however, is prepared to shoulder the burden so far as their capacity will enable them to do so.  Every local authority in this country is contributing to the relief of unemployment, either willingly or as a result of Acts passed by this House.  Cannot the Parliamentary Secretary admit what is the real meaning behind all this? The real meaning behind it is this: It is an attempt to disguise from the people that Fianna Fáil have failed to carry out the very definite promises they made to the people of this country.  It is an attempt to spread the taxation.  The Government will not raise £150,000 through national taxation&mdash;that might not be favourable to the Budget&mdash;but if we can pass it on: if we can rob £50,000 additional from the fund which was created to provide for those persons who were formerly employed but who now, unfortunately, are unemployed, well and good; and if we can force local authorities to raise another portion of it, well and good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing the Second Reading of the Bill yesterday, told the House that this Bill was being introduced because the Government were now in such a position that they could afford to give more to the unemployed, and in his closing speech he said that this sum was so small because the country could not afford any more.  I am sure that the Minister will have no difficulty in reconciling these two statements&mdash;none whatever. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance may be an authority on finance or he may not, but the achievement of the Parliamentary Secretary, as the person who was appointed about four years ago, I think, as chairman of a committee that was to provide employment, or rather to recommend novel schemes to the Government to secure employment for <Col N="3122" /> the unemployed of this country, has not been an outstanding success, to say the least of it.  The product of that massive brain has been what is known as the rotational scheme, and I say that it is not a credit either to the Parliamentary Secretary or to the Government of this country.  It has not worked except in so far as it has enabled the Minister to say that there has been a reduction in the amount of unemployment assistance paid out.  It did not improve the position of the unemployed very much.  In actual cash, the improvement was very small, and I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if there are only six days' work to be given in any particular area to a number of men, that six days' work should be given in one week rather than in two weeks. That would meet the situation to some extent at least.  I do not want to travel too much outside what we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. John Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure, Sir, but there are one or two points to which I should like to refer in connection with the administration of the Act.  Certain anomalies are apparent with regard to the application of the means test under the previous Act, so far as my constituency is concerned at least, and I hope that some steps will be taken under this measure to remedy these anomalies. Probably, the Minister will say that machinery is already in existence to deal with that matter, but I should like <Col N="3124" /> to stress the fact that, in certain areas, the administration of the previous Act has not worked out in the way one would like to see it work out, and has not resulted in the benefits that the people desired and that we hoped would result from the administration of the previous Act.  I might mention that, in certain electoral areas, the interpretation of the means test was not exactly what one would have expected under the terms of the Act.  In certain areas a different interpretation appeared to be put on with regard to local values, and we can never understand why it should happen that the results of the Act were different in different electoral areas.  I should like to be assured that some steps would be taken in connection with the measure now before the House to ensure that people who have been suffering injustice during the past few years will, at long last, get the benefits, to which they are entitled, under this new Act.  As far as I can see, from the working of the previous Act, either the people administering the Act have been putting a wrong interpretation on what was meant by the means qualification and did not know their work, or else there must have been some differentiation as between the different applicants.  That is the only explanation we can offer in our county. In the past two years we have been pressed by people in our part of the country to ask for a general revision of the means test in South Kerry.  It may seem a strange thing to make such a statement at this stage, but it is a fact nevertheless.  I have already made representations to the Department in this connection, and I must say that the Department officials have done their utmost, but it is a strange thing to say that the value put on the means of these applicants three and four years ago is taken as the basic test, and no matter what officials come along they still regard that as being the basic principle or test to go on.  Consequently, these people can never get the benefits of this new measure unless there is an adjustment or a general revision.  In that case I make a special appeal to the Minister to see that that revision takes place and that the people concerned will get the benefits that are conferred under this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to give the House some better explanation than has been offered so far, as to why there is an additional impost to be placed upon local authorities arising out of this particular scheme.  Originally, when unemployment assistance was introduced, the expenditure under it the first year was estimated at £1,500,000.  The following year it was estimated at £1,600,000. While the Government take great credit to themselves for providing that money, the fact is that they were providing a sum of £400,000 or £500,000 for administration, but on the basis of the contribution of £1,500,000 the local authorities were asked to give something like £196,000 annually.</P>
      <P>Some two years ago the Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech, gave the House the information that he was setting up a committee to consider the extent to which it was practicable to devise a scheme of useful and desirable public works to be carried out within a period of four years with a view to reducing the expenditure on unemployment assistance to a minimum.  As a consequence, some money was collected from various sources for this unemployment scheme, but the local authorities' liability remained where it was, £196,000, even though there was £100,000 taken from the Road Fund, and the local authorities were expected to put up something like a quarter of the entire £2,500,000.  Now we have got to a point where a very much lesser sum is being distributed in connection with unemployment assistance and the Minister seeks to put a greater impost still on the local authorities.</P>
      <P>If the original calculations were wrong, the Minister ought to tell the House.  If there is any other reason for placing an additional burden on the local authorities, we ought to be informed.  The policy seems to be to promise much and to do little and, whatever little is done, to get it from somebody else rather than from the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the speeches made in the course of this debate would be more appropriate to an Estimate discussion rather than to a <Col N="3126" /> motion for the Final Reading of this Bill.  I will endeavour to deal as far as possible with the points that were raised, covering general questions of administration in relation to the unemployment assistance code.  The main matter which has direct relation to the Bill was raised, first by Deputy Anthony, and was now referred to by Deputy Cosgrave.  It refers to the justification for imposing any part of the total charge arising out of the provision of increased rates of unemployment assistance upon certain local authorities.  I mentioned yesterday that until the Unemployment Assistance Act became law it was the accepted theory of government here that the relief of distress, the amelioration of conditions arising from unemployment, was solely the charge of local authorities.  In fact, I think a few years earlier there was no provision at all for dealing with destitution amongst able-bodied persons outside the poor law institution.  The Poor Law Relief (Dublin) Act became law in 1929, if my memory serves me correctly.  Before that there was no provision for the payment of even home assistance to able-bodied persons in Dublin City.</P>
      <P>The State, when it took over in part the responsibility for the relief of distress due to unemployment, had regard to that previous position and had to take into account the fact that it was, by its action, about to relieve these local authorities of what had previously been their sole responsibility.  Deputy McGilligan quoted figures yesterday the purpose of which was designed to convey the impression that there had been, in fact, no diminution in the number of persons receiving home assistance since the unemployment assistance scheme came into operation. If such impression was formed by those figures in the mind of any Deputy, it is entirely incorrect.  Home assistance is paid to all classes of persons. Home assistance was instituted for the purpose of relieving distress amongst persons other than those for whom the unemployment assistance scheme was designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some persons receiving unemployment assistance are also receiving home assistance.  That is correct.  In giving figures relating to persons receiving home assistance, I am deleting from those all persons other than able-bodied persons.  In 1933, before the Unemployment Assistance Act operated, the average number of persons receiving home assistance was about 14,000.  In 1937 the average number was 4,000, so obviously there has been a very substantial reduction in the number of able-bodied persons receiving home assistance. That may be attributable to a number of causes, but I submit it was mainly attributable to the introduction of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to the total number receiving home assistance, I am referring to the number of able-bodied men to whom home assistance was paid.  The great majority of those receiving home assistance are children, and to quote these figures as having relation to our unemployment situation is entirely erroneous.  The relief of distress due to unemployment or to any cause was, and always has been, the primary responsibility of the local authorities. There are, surely, definite considerations in relation to this unemployment scheme which justify a special impost upon the particular local authorities which are being called upon to contribute. We could have instituted an unemployment scheme providing for uniform rates of assistance all over the country.  If the sole charge of financing that scheme was to be placed upon the national Exchequer then uniform rates of benefit would appear to be called for.  The working man in West Mayo who buys an ounce of tobacco or a pint of porter pays exactly the same contribution to the Exchequer as does the working man in Dublin.  But the working man in Mayo is not getting the same scale of <Col N="3128" /> benefits as the working man in Dublin because this scheme provides for a higher rate of benefit in the cities and large urban areas than in the rural districts.  Therefore, it is proposed to levy against the particular areas in which these higher rates are paid a special charge for these higher rates. Deputy Cosgrave spoke yesterday as if there were something inequitable in increasing the charge on the rates in Cork City by twopence.  That was done by reason of the fact that higher rates of benefit are provided for the working man in Cork City.  The charge of twopence on the local rates is going towards recouping the higher rates of benefit paid in Cork City over and above the rates of benefit paid in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That twopence charge on the local authority will very much more than recoup the cost of the extra benefits.  Did I not put to the Minister the fact that a couple of years ago the Exchequer supplied £1,500,000 towards the Unemployment Fund and now that is being brought down to £1,000,000?  The charge on the rates in Cork that time was 1/6 in the £; now it is 1/8 in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has missed my point.  If we paid in Cork County Borough the same rates as in Cork County the charge upon the Exchequer would be less, but by reason of the fact that we are paying a higher rate of benefit in Cork City, obviously the charge upon the Exchequer has been increased.  The amount recovered by the Exchequer from Cork City does not exceed the amount of increased benefit paid to the working men there due to the fact that higher rates are paid in Cork City.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is by reason of the fact that a higher rate of benefit is being paid to the unemployed.  We are justified in levying this charge of two pence for the purpose of compensating the Exchequer for the higher rate paid in Cork City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the sum paid in the Cork County Borough is, the amount we are getting does not compensate us for the additional cost caused by the higher rate.  The additional amount in 1936-1937 was £28,500. In addition to that the additional amount which will now be paid in Cork, that is the difference between the highest rate now being provided for and the rate paid in the rural areas will be about £7,000.  In other words, the differential in favour of Cork City has been increased by £7,000 while the additional imposts will bring in £7,900. Cork City is getting out of the unemployment assistance scheme a sum over and above that which it would get if the unemployed in Cork City were <Col N="3130" /> treated as the unemployed in other parts of the country.  The unemployed in Cork City would on the basis of the rural areas scale get a sum of money considerably less than they are now getting out of this scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think we are justified in taking these contributions from the Unemployment Fund.  Deputy Morrissey spoke as if the security of the insured persons was being diminished, as if their prospects of drawing benefits were reduced.  Everybody knows that that is nonsense.  Until last year the Unemployment Assistance Fund consisted of a deficit.  It was only last year that this deficit began to disappear and a surplus accumulated. During all these years benefits were paid whether there was a deficit or a surplus.  Therefore, the contributors will be in the same position now as in the past.  The benefits provided by law will be paid and the deduction of this £50,000 will not affect their position in the slightest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Again I say we are justified in making that contribution because these insured contributors are getting the same benefit by reason of the reorganisation of the scheme. Other people are also getting that benefit.  But, nevertheless, we have to recognise the fact that the worker who was formerly entitled to benefit only for a limited period is now entitled to get that benefit and that after the limited period has passed the unemployed are still entitled to the benefit.  Under this law he is entitled to decide whether he will avail of his rights under the Act; he has the right to opt whether he will receive the unemployment assistance benefit or the unemployment insurance benefit.  He can draw the unemployment assistance and leave stand the amount due to him under the unemployment insurance scheme.</P>

I know that there is in the minds of some Deputies a desire to see the rates of benefit still further increased.  My sole purpose has been to try to impress upon these Deputies the fact that a further increase in benefits will involve an additional impost upon the taxpayers, and over and above the additional impost on the taxpayers an additional impost upon the local authorities or upon special classes in the community.  The money to pay for the higher rates of benefit must be got somewhere.

      <P>&ldquo;Standing&rdquo; is the word.  Many references have been made to the cost of living.  I want to make clear that the rates of unemployment assistance provided for in legislation are not directly related to the cost of living.  As I said yesterday, I think it is undesirable that we should accept without question the contention of the Labour Party that the rates of unemployment assistance fixed in 1933 should fluctuate with fluctuations in the cost-of-living figure.  We must approach consideration of the level at which these rates are to be fixed, having regard only to the amount of money we can provide for the service, and, having determined that amount of money, we must endeavour to secure the most equitable distribution of it.</P>

      <P>I was about to make some reference to the various speeches made on the subject of the cost of living in relation to this measure.  Deputy McGilligan purported to quote me as denying that the cost of living had increased.  I have never denied such an obvious fact as the increase which has taken place in the cost of living.  I set out to prove&mdash;and I think I have proved beyond the possibility of dispute&mdash;that the rise in the cost of living here since 1933 was less pronounced than in many neighbouring countries and proportionately less than in Great Britain.  It was, certainly, less than in the United States, and it was, in any event, due to causes almost entirely outside the control of the Government. Deputy Norton quoted the actual prices of a number of commodities in 1933 and 1937.  Some of these commodities were farm products, some were manufactured foodstuffs, and others were articles of clothing.  So far as the farm products are concerned, there has been a rise in price.  The whole aim and object of Government policy was to effect that rise in price.  It is good for this country that a rise in agricultural prices has taken place.</P>

      <P>I want to get the Deputies clear on this fact: so far as there has been a rise in the price of agricultural products, it is a good thing for this country.  If the situation can be further adjusted so as to secure an additional rise in the price of agricultural products, it will be a good thing for this country.  It will mean a higher national income, more employment and greater prosperity.  Such a rise in price in respect of these matters is not to be deplored.  It is a thing on which we can congratulate ourselves.</P>
      <P>Let us turn to the question of manufactured foodstuffs.  The rise in price which has taken place in respect of manufactured foodstuffs is due to the same cause&mdash;a rise in the price of primary products.  It is also due to the rise in wages paid to labour.</P>

There is no relation between these two figures.  The figure you get by dividing one into the other proves nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion that Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy McGilligan <Col N="3136" /> and ex-Deputy Mulcahy used to arrive at&mdash;that the standard rate of wages was going down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That conclusion was due to the fact that employment was going up.  Because employment was going up, the number employed on the 1st October was always higher than the number employed on 1st January. Consequently, the division of the number employed on 1st October into the total wages paid during the year gave an average wage lower than would be the case if the actual facts were properly presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <P>Deputy Norton complained yesterday that clothing cost more in 1937 than it cost in 1933.  He must know quite well that there has been a very substantial increase in the wages paid to clothing trade workers between these years.  We could get back to 1933 prices if workers would get back <Col N="3137" /> to 1933 wages.  I do not propose to ask them to do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not object to the increases in price.  There are quite a number of them I do not object to. I have said that some of these increases are matters for congratulation. when people spoke about the economic depression that began in 1929, and caused industrial dislocation and widespread unemployment all over the world, what they meant was the fall in prices.  It was the fall in prices that began in 1929 that was the essence of the industrial depression, and that depression continued as long as prices kept falling.  World conferences were called; meetings of experts were held, for the purpose of devising some plan to arrest the fall in prices. Finally, the various measures taken by the different Governments were successful, and the decline in prices was checked in 1933.  In that year, recovery began, and by recovery I mean an increase in the price of primary products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with that only it would take too long. I have been reading here during intervals in the debate the World Economic Survey published by the League of Nations, and I refer Deputy Heron to it.  It would repay him to read it because it deals exhaustively with the effects of the depression and the recovery in the purchasing power of the workers of various countries.  I have dealt with this matter merely for the purpose of getting clear the attitude of the Labour Party, and I think I have now got it clear.  I was left under the impression that they were deploring all the increases in prices to which Deputy Norton referred yesterday.  He read out a long list of different commodities and gave the average retail price in 1933, and also the average retail price in 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not quite obvious why he did that, when you have the first Bill in 1933 and then this Bill in 1937?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was all that Deputy Norton, wanted to prove, I think he could have made his case in a manner which would have created less uncertainty as to his attitude.  In so far as there has been an increase in prices, I want merely to make clear that it is possible to find out, with a considerable degree of exactitude, why that increase took place.  In so far as the increases were due to rising prices for primary products, rising prices paid to producers&mdash;in this case, to the farmer&mdash;they are something to be welcomed and something which tends to promote prosperity in this country.  In so far as they are due to rising wages, in many cases, they are also to be welcomed because they represent an improvement on conditions which were generally regarded as unsatisfactory, although, in some cases, I think it should be possible to offset the actual higher earnings of individual workers by securing a better output, and thus secure the benefit of the higher standard of living for the individual workers concerned without raising prices on the rest of the community. In the particular case I mention, I think it would be well worth the <Col N="3139" /> while of those directly concerned with the industry to examine the position to see whether they are giving the community what could be described as a square deal.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the relationship between the cost of living and rates of unemployment assistance, I repeat that there is no such relationship, but if Deputies insist on making such a relationship, I say that even if we take 1933 as the base year, the percentage increase in the cost of living which has taken place is less than the percentage increase in the unemployment assistance rates which we are now providing.  I say, however, that 1933 is not the base year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if he advisedly stated that the rates of unemployment assistance paid must have no relation whatever to the cost of living and that if it were three times what it is the rates would be the same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that, but I would say that we should have to have regard to a number of other circumstances as well; and the primary consideration is the amount that can be made available for this service.  A very substantial increase in the cost of living might be accompanied, as the Deputy very properly pointed out yesterday, by an equally rapid expansion in national income which would make available for such a service a much larger sum than we are now providing. It might be due to causes which might occasion a contraction of national income and make impossible any similar expansion in expenditure on a service of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the persons transferred from Cork City to a rural area.  I dealt with that by way of Parliamentary Question to-day, but I should like to say to the House that on the motion of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn, I have agreed to an arrangement under which those workers transferred from Cork City out to Spangle Hill will still be eligible for employment on relief works in Cork City on precisely the same terms as if they had continued to reside in <Col N="3140" /> the city and be eligible to draw unemployment assistance at city rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister making a mistake when he mentions Deputy Hugo Flinn, instead of Deputy Hurley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that on the motion of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, I have agreed to this arrangement by which these workers who were transferred outside the city boundary will continue to be eligible for employment within the city on relief schemes financed out of the Central Fund, on the same terms as if they had continued to reside in the city and be eligible to draw unemployment assistance at city rates.  That was one of the points raised by Deputy Hurley. Deputy McGowan was misinformed with regard to period orders.  The estimated cost of the Bill which I gave is based on the assumption that unemployment and period orders will be made in this year for precisely the same periods as last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These employment period orders affect all single men outside the special urban areas where the intermediate rate of unemployment assistance is paid.  The employment period orders will operate in Balbriggan equally with other towns in County Dublin.  there are only ten or 12 urban areas not affected by them.  They are urban areas specially mentioned in the Principal Act, the population of which exceeded 7,000 when the 1926 Census was taken.  In this Bill however, as Deputies are aware, we are taking power to extend the intermediate rate to urban areas of smaller size, after consultation with the urban authorities, and with the consent of the Minister for Local Government.  One of the advantages of securing that extension, apart from the removal of anomalies, to which Deputy Corish referred, would be to take these workers from outside the scope of the unemployment period orders, if these orders are made on precisely the same basis in the future as in the past.  It is desirable that we should secure that general extension of the intermediate rate to these small urban areas.  We <Col N="3141" /> are making it possible for the urban authorities in these areas to take the initiative, and to secure that extension, or we leave it open to ourselves to take the initiative.  Generally speaking, I think that is desirable in towns of almost similar size and character in the same locality, where the same conditions prevail, rather than have this more or less artificial distinction between one class of urban area and another, according to the size at the most recent census.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the unemployment period orders not apply to an unmarried man or widower with no dependent whose place of residence is not within the county boundary or in a town having commissioners under the Towns Improvement Act, 1894? Might there not be this anomaly, that you could have a town in County Dublin, having a population of, say, 2,500 unaffected by the unemployment period order, while in another town practically next door, but without town commissioners, a single man without a dependent would not get assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Certain anomalies will arise in connection with unemployment assistance on a national scale.  They arise where, for one reason or another, there are separate areas established.  Reference has been made to the anomalies that occur where different rates of assistance are payable on each side of a particular borough boundary.  I think it is true to say that in Kilkenny a large number of workers live outside the town boundary and are entitled to unemployment assistance only at the rural rate. These anomalies cannot be avoided. There must be a boundary somewhere with unemployment orders and some general classifications must be given. Those within the classification are affected by the orders and those outside are not.  It is inevitable that there will be anomalies.  We tried to consider various methods by which these anomalies could be reduced, but came to the conclusion that it was not possible to do more than we are doing.  We can discuss the effect of particular period orders as they arise.  We have <Col N="3142" /> done so in the past and, I have no doubt, we will do so again.  The general effect of the exclusion is, I think, sound, and, so far, all the evidence we have been able to secure indicates that it causes no real hardship.  Deputy Flinn referred to complaints that had arisen in South Kerry concerning the assessment of means.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is not responsible for the assessment of means. That is carried out by the officers of the Revenue Commissioners.  These officers act upon instructions which are designed to secure that valuations placed upon particular assets will be uniform everywhere.  Their instructions are similar to those issued to old age pensions officers, and while undoubtedly certain differences may arise in the assessment of value, on the whole, the operation of the Act is fairly uniform. In any event it is difficult to see how a different arrangement could be made to one which ensures that expert and trained officials make valuations which are subject to the appeal which the Principal Act provides.</P>

      <P>I understood that was the point raised by Deputy Hurley and by Deputy Flynn.  In any case I would like to put this point to the Minister, that the Principal Act operates to exclude certain persons from receipt of <Col N="3143" /> unemployment assistance.  I will not go into that particular question now. I suggest to him that the time has come when he ought to take counsel with the Department of Finance, to ensure that even if the Act operates to exclude certain persons from unemployment assistance, that exclusion should not be extended to prevent them getting employment on unemployment assistance schemes.  The operation of the Act has created terrible hardship when extended to prevent these persons getting work on unemployment relief schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no direct rule between unemployment assistance and relief schemes, except that those responsible for relief schemes administration are naturally desirous that the money provided will go where it is most needed and, so far as they can arrange, that employment will be given to those whose circumstances are such that they most urgently need it. It is difficult to provide a rough and ready method of deciding between the needs of one person and another.  The simplest method that they have been able to devise is this, that persons in receipt of unemployment assistance are more in need of work than persons who are not qualified to receive unemployment assistance, and, as between persons in receipt of unemployment assistance those who are getting most are those who are in most need.  That is only a sort of rule of thumb but it decides the means of applicants for work.  On the whole it works fairly.  I admit that in individual cases it might not.  It is difficult to provide any more effective method which will be as simple.  Any method operated must be simple or it will break down, or open the way to undesirable practices.  I mean that individuals may be placed, irrespective of their claims, by those immediately responsible for the selection of men. We were anxious to try to eliminate that individual favouritism on the one hand, and, at the same time, to secure a simple rule of differentiation on the other hand.  I think that is the only rule that could be devised.  The purpose solely is to ensure that where <Col N="3144" /> there is not enough work for everyone, such work as is available will be given to those relatively in the greatest need.</P>

      <P>At the initial stage some rule of thumb must be necessary to get a scheme going, but I submit that the time has now come when there ought to be an inter-departmental inquiry into the way that rule operates, and into the hardship that that rule has given rise to.  If there was an inter-departmental inquiry instituted, the Minister would discover that a certain considerable class of people is suffering under a very real sense of grievance. I think the Minister will agree with me that, where such a situation exists, steps should be taken to abate that sense of grievance.  I think that can be done by occasionally directing that certain schemes be excluded from the rule of thumb.  I see the difficulties which confront the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, but I believe they can be overcome.  I submit that an inter-departmental inquiry would meet the requirements of the case.</P>

      <P>It does not always follow that the man who has the greatest grievance gets work.  Take the case of a British ex-service man with a pension of about 8/-.  He has no other means of income.  In accordance with the size of his family, if he had not that pension, he would get, in Wexford, for instance, 15/- unemployment assistance, and from now on 17/6. I submit that, in the rotational schemes of employment, a man in that position should be given his turn with those on the 15/- rate.  He is in the same degree of need, but in consequence of the fact that he has this pension he is put at the end of the list and does not get his turn.  Perhaps the work is exhausted before the end of the list is reached.  The same would apply to an ex-national army man in receipt of a pension of 7/- or 8/- a week.  I think the Minister should give consideration to cases of this kind.</P>

The haphazard methods which are being adopted cannot be said to be providing work for the unemployed. If someone is asked to prepare a scheme locally and it is sent up to the Department, that surely cannot be described as a national scheme. What I would like to know is if the Minister's mind is working on the idea of having a national scheme of work, and whether he is thinking of having a committee of inquiry that would lay out a field of work.  Let us have a scheme of reproductive work, if possible, or useless work if reproductive work cannot be found&mdash;something that will keep people working and not have them getting into a chronic state from continued unemployment.  That is a matter that the Minister should direct himself to.  I think that the remarks made by Deputy Anthony found an echo in the minds of most Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion that the Bill was before the House this amendment was very fully discussed. The gist of it is to ensure that the 48-hour week will be preserved, and that if the Minister gives permission to a <Col N="3146" /> shopkeeper to work his employees in excess of 48 hours a week that he will have to pay them overtime.  The section as it stands strikes completely at the root of the idea of a 48-hour week.  It would give the Minister power to direct that overtime could be worked, and that overtime rates need not be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that I think it is desirable to have power to make an Order, after consultation with all the parties likely to be interested&mdash;representatives of the workers and the proprietors of shops&mdash;to extend the ordinary hours of work in a particular trade at particular periods.  The only objection which could be offered, in my opinion, to that is as to the manner in which that power might be exercised, but as I say I think it is desirable that the power should be there.  I agree that, the power being there, it might be used for the purpose of negativing the whole purpose of the Bill, but I think that is most unlikely.  Once a 48-hour week is established as the normal working week under the Bill, it is unlikely to be departed from: that is to say, that the hours of work are unlikely to be extended by Order except in cases where it is obviously desirable in everybody's interest to do so.  Sub-section (5), of course, makes it possible to reduce the normal working hours below 48 as well as to increase them.</P>
      <P>The appearance of this sub-section in the section is due to the experience we have had of the operation of the Conditions of Employment Act relating to industry. I have no doubt that very exceptional and unusual cases will arise where it would be agreed by everybody, workers and employers alike, that some modification of the conditions of the Act should be made, and it is desirable to have the power to make a modification in such circumstances.  I would be very slow, indeed, to agree to deprive the Minister for Industry and Commerce of that power.  I think he should have it, even though I think it should be exercised only in very exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that he is prepared to stand over an employer working his <Col N="3147" /> employees for more than 48 hours and not paying them overtime rates for the work they do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. What I want to convey is this, that I do not know the circumstances of every trade.  I think that, in relation to the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, there were many industries the conditions of which were so unusual that a very extensive use of the exemption powers under the Act had to be made in order to permit them to be carried on at all.  It is quite conceivable that there may be shops in respect of which arrangements would be made between the proprietors and employees to work, say, 40 hours in one week and 54 hours in another week, and to observe the 48-hour week, not by having a limit of 48 in each week, but by a limit for the month as a whole.  It may be no less the desire of the proprietor as the desire of the workers that a continuation of that practice should be facilitated.  The existence of this section enables us to do that.  We would not be able to do it if this power of exemption were not there.  So long as it is provided that the power of exemption may not be exercised without consultation with the organisations which are representative of both parties, I think there is a reasonable safeguard, because the Deputy may be assured that, if there is any abuse of the power, any attempt to operate these orders for the purpose of negativing the policy approved by the Dáil, the matter will come to the Dáil and be rectified here.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 39, to delete the words &ldquo;forty-eight&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;forty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to secure that a 40-hour working week should apply to shops.  It will be observed by Deputies that in the United States a 40-hour week is now applied universally, and in many cases large firms are moving towards a 35-hour week.  Earlier to-day the Dáil discussed, amongst other things, the rates of unemployment relief, and I think that under modern methods of production in industry, and also better methods of distribution through shops and otherwise, it should be possible to make a contribution towards the solution of unemployment by shortening the hours of employed workers.  That, no doubt, is part of the Minister's intention in introducing this Bill; but I do not see any reason why this country should not be in the forefront of the movement for a shorter working week.  Personally, I think that a 40-hour week is reasonable, and, therefore, that the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the amendment.  It is, of course, a matter upon which one could initiate a debate which might last for days; but, as I have no desire to do that, I content myself by saying that I do not think the circumstances existing here are such as to justify us in requiring by legislation a maximum working week in shops of 40 hours.  I think that the general adoption of a 48-hour week will be a sufficient improvement of the present conditions to make us feel satisfied that we have done enough in this measure.  I notice that Deputy Dockrell has an amendment to increase the hours from 48 to 50, and, perhaps, we should discuss both together.  I should like to say, however, in reference to Deputy Heron's remark, that it is theoretically possible to abolish <Col N="3149" /> unemployment by reducing the hours of individual workers, provided their earnings are reduced in proportion to their hours of work.  A reduction of hours of work without a reduction of earnings, however, could have no effect upon unemployment whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true in some cases that it has happened, but it is true in other cases that it has not happened. In that connection, I should like to refer the Deputy to a report prepared by the United States Government upon the effect of the reduction of hours of work in industry in America presented by them to the International Labour Office.  The Deputy will, I am sure, be able to get the report in the Library in one of the publications of the International Labour Office.  He will find there that the effect of the reduction of hours varied considerably from industry to industry and the variation was so great as to lead one to the conclusion that no general deduction could be made at all as to the effect of the reduction of hours on output or earnings.  What I say is that theoretically it is possible to abolish unemployment by reducing hours of work and at the same time reducing earnings.  In so far as they have abolished it in Germany and Russia, that is how they have done it. Everybody was put to work, the standard of living was fixed, and the earnings of the individual were determined by the amount available.  He had to do his work in any event and he got what could be made available for him.  Here and in Great Britain, France and the United States of America the movement has been towards effecting a reduction of hours of work for the purpose of increasing the leisure of workers and giving them in leisure the benefit of the technological developments which have taken place without reducing their standard of living.  So long as we work on that theory, and I think it is a fairly sound theory in our circumstances, we must however conclude that no solution for <Col N="3150" /> the problem of unemployment is to be found in a reduction of hours, whatever other advantages may be secured, and the solution of unemployment must be found by a different method. That, however, is a theoretical discussion and I do not want to start a debate upon it.</P>
      <P>I carefully considered before introducing this Bill what were the maximum hours of work that we would provide for.  In relation to some trades, it was with considerable hesitation that I fixed the maximum at 48 hours.  I think there would have been no comment if the maximum had been fixed at a higher figure in respect to certain trades where existing agreements recently made provided for a longer working week.  However, I felt it was better to take a reasonable maximum and make it uniform.  That is what the Bill proposes.  I do not think a 40-hour week in distribution would be regarded as a reasonable maximum, nor do I think it possible to introduce it without considerable dislocation, particularly having regard to the fact that the maximum hours of work in occupations much more strenuous than those usually involved in retail distribution are longer than Deputy Heron proposes should operate in the retail trade.</P>

Does that mean that after the passing of this Act it will be no longer possible to sign indentures with an apprentice, except under rules made by an apprenticeship committee because, as the Minister is aware, there are no rules applying to apprentices working in retail shops under the Apprenticeship Act of 1931? At the present time apprentices simply sign indentures in the ordinary way. Will it be open to sign indentures in the ordinary way after the passing of the Bill?</P>

Section 16 which we passed places a restriction on the employment of an undue number of juveniles and we excluded from the definition of juveniles certain people, that is, those who are now employed under an indenture of apprenticeship.

      <P>I considered this matter and I do not think the circumstances are precisely the same.  The nature of work in a shop is different from the nature of work in a factory.  I think the main objection to the employment of juveniles for unduly long hours in a modern factory lies in the monotonous nature of the work.  Persons engaged in these factories, particularly juveniles, are usually employed upon a continuous repetition of the same process. That stunts their mental growth and is detrimental to their general health.  Employment in a shop is on a different basis.  There is not the same monotony attached to the work.  There is variety occasioned by the fact that they are in direct contact with members of the public and in these circumstances I do not think that it would be detrimental to juveniles that they should be required to work 48 hours in shops.  If that conclusion is correct, I think it is simpler to leave the hours of work for juveniles the same as for adults because it will of course simplify considerably the enforcement of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the extent to which they are employed on shop work.  If they are not employed on shop work they are not covered by <Col N="3153" /> the Bill at all, consequently there is no restriction on their hours.  I do not know that it would be held that a 48-hour week in such an occupation is unduly long.  I do not think it is unduly long.  It is a matter upon which a certain amount of difference of opinion might arise but in my view shop work for 48 hours a week is not unduly harsh on any juvenile.  Some of them at present are working 70 or 75 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill, I think it will be agreed that there is nothing to prevent a juvenile working overtime or being asked to work overtime by his employer.  In view of that circumstance, I think that Deputy O'Brien's amendment should be accepted.  A juvenile should not be expected to work more than 40 hours a week.  I think the Minister is familiar with the terms of the British Shops Act of 1934 and, in that particular legislation, a juvenile's week is limited to 48 hours and overtime is expressly prohibited. In other words juveniles may work 48 hours a week but they cannot work overtime.  If there was something of that nature included in the Bill, this amendment would not be necessary but owing to the fact that such a provision is not present, we are definitely of opinion that this amendment should be accepted by the Minister and that this measure should be on a parallel with previous Bills that have gone throught the Dáil concerning children in industrial employment, by which they are limited to a 40-hour week.  I cannot see that there is any difference between the conditions under which children work in industrial employment and the conditions under which they work in shops.  In fact, in many cases you will find that the work of a juvenile in shops is far more difficult than that of a juvenile in industrial employment.  Industrial employment may consist of holding a bobbin, carrying a basket or standing watching machinery whereas a juvenile employed in shop work has different types of work to attend to.  They have to run here, there and everywhere and go out in all kinds of weather.  Generally speaking, the work of a juvenile in a shop is as hard if not harder than the work carried on by juveniles in industrial <Col N="3154" /> employment.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. I think it is in keeping with all the principles of Christianity that juveniles should not be asked to work any longer than 40 hours per week, taking into consideration of course that in this particular Bill overtime is permitted to a very considerable extent.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be practicable to prohibit overtime entirely, nor does the British Act to which Deputy McGowan referred prohibit overtime entirely for juveniles. Juveniles between 16 and 18 years of age are permitted by that Act to work overtime during not more than six weeks in a year.  I would be prepared to agree that the overtime provisions in this Bill, which were framed with adults in mind, are unduly liberal when considered in relation to juveniles, and that we might impose in respect of juveniles further restrictions upon the working of overtime than are contemplated in respect of adults.  I do not know that it would be practicable to enforce a complete prohibition of overtime, but it may be possible to do so in respect of juveniles under 16 years.  However, I have in mind the idea of restricting the working of overtime by juveniles rather than its complete prohibition, and while certain difficulties have yet to be overcome, it was my intention to produce on the next stage an amendment dealing with that matter.  If the Deputies of the Labour Party would put their minds to work upon the type of limitation of that kind which they would prefer, and produce an amendment, I think it would be preferable.  In so far as the proposal to reduce the ordinary working week of juveniles is concerned, I would be compelled to resist it, but an amendment to restrict the working of overtime by juveniles would have sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I will consider it.  There are certain administrative and enforcement difficulties, but they might, I think, be got over by having less liberal provisions in respect of juveniles than in respect of adults.  It might be a wiser course to adopt the practice in the British Act and allow overtime for persons over 16 years, but that means dividing assistants into more than two classes&mdash;that is adults and juveniles&mdash; and introducing a third class, which, I think, is to be avoided if possible, because it involves considerable difficulty of enforcement where it is not easy to ascertain the age of a worker.</P>

      <P>I think the proposal to avoid Oliver Twist conditions either in shop working or factory working will receive sympathetic consideration from all sides of the House, and I believe that this kind of legislation is the kind of legislation that might be carried through this House with pretty near unanimity, but I do urge both on the Government and on the Labour Party that they should approach those restrictive proposals cautiously, so that they can be carried with genuine unanimity. The Labour Party particularly have at their disposal among their own officials abundant knowledge of the working conditions that obtain throughout the country.  What I want to remind the Government and the Labour Party of is this, that they ought to try and differentiate in their own minds between the conditions obtaining in the cities and those obtaining in the rural areas, because there is very substantial difference between the two.  Nobody wants to see children working night and day.  On the other hand, do not create a situation in which you will make it impossible for people who want to get their children trained in what may subsequently turn out to be quite profitable vocations for those children.  Let us approach this matter with moderation, and if possible devise a plan on the lines which the Minister has suggested, restricting by all means any attempt to turn a child into a slave, but at the same time making it possible to carry on business where juveniles are employed.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 46, to delete the word &ldquo;sixty&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;fifty four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The idea of this amendment is to limit the overtime to six hours, in the event of the working week being retained at 48 hours.  Generally speaking, overtime arises through necessity.  Perhaps on one or two days in the week, due to a special rush of business, the proprietor of a shop may have to ask the employees to work overtime.  That generally happens in the vicinity of some holiday, when the employees might have to work overtime for two days in the week, and three hours per day ought to be sufficient.  The idea of this amendment, therefore, is to ensure that six hours per week should be the total amount of overtime worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The overtime provisions of this section are similar to those in the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  I have from time to time given this matter consideration, because I do not think it is necessary to have quite the same provisions for overtime in retail distribution as in industrial occupations, and I think we might be able to modify them to some extent, but the item in respect of which I would not be prepared to modify them is the maximum number of hours which might be permitted in any week. Having regard to the circumstances in which retail distribution is carried on, I think it is necessary to permit a 60-hour week very occasionally.  In certain seasons of the year, during the week immediately preceding Christmas of 1937 for example, I am sure that a very large number of retail <Col N="3157" /> establishments worked their employees for a 60-hour week.  That would be about the only week in the year in which they would find it necessary to do so.  The same situation might arise in various towns, when some special occasion arose&mdash;a civic week or something of that kind.  It might be desired to carry on for unusual hours during such a period. and the need for working overtime would hardly arise at all outside that period. I think, therefore, that we should preserve the provision which permits of the working of overtime up to 60 hours in the week, even though we might reconsider the number of weeks during which the 60 hours could be worked, by a modification of the proposals at (b) and (c) of this sub-section.  I am not at all sure as to what the general view of the persons most intimately concerned is in regard to the need for those overtime provisions.  I think it may be reasonably assumed that, when the law provides that a 25 per cent. increase in wages is to operate during hours of overtime, employers will not use overtime unnecessarily. It is, of course, the policy of the Government to discourage the working of overtime as a regular practice or except in circumstances of necessity, and although we recognise that it must be permitted because of the possibility of unusual circumstances occurring or to meet the conditions of particular trades, we are anxious to ensure that it will be resorted to only when, in fact, there is no real alternative. I think that that is also the view of the labour organisations catering for workers in the distributive trades.  I think that their official policy is also to discourage overtime. I may say, however, that that is not the view of all trade unions and, as Deputies opposite know, there are some abuses in that regard by means of which men in certain occupations are permitted to work overtime to the detriment of their own health and to the detriment also of their colleagues so far as the earning of wages is concerned. I presume that the attitude of labour organisations, in general, would be against overtime, <Col N="3158" /> however, and I know definitely from statements that have been made, that the trade unions catering for these distributive trades have publicly declared their hostility to any practice of working overtime as a general policy.  That is also the view of the Government.</P>
      <P>That being so, and having regard to the imposition of the higher wage rate and the known attitude of labour organisations, the question arises as to whether any harm is being done by allowing to remain in the Bill such provisions as it now contains or whether it is necessary to restrict these.  That is a question that I have been asking myself.  At the moment, I am disposed to reduce somewhat the provisions under paragraphs (b) and (c), but I think it would be a mistake to reduce the provision under paragraph (a).  If there were any question of the need for reducing overtime at all, it would arise in respect of a special week, and in that week I think it should be permitted up to a maximum of 60 hours.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that it would be very seldom that an employer would be anxious to pay overtime, except in the case of a charge-hand or somebody in a similarly important position.  Where the employer has got to pay 25 per cent. extra in wages for overtime, it would not seem to me to be an advantage to an employer to work overtime except in certain special cases, but it does seem to me that, unless there is a fair amount of freedom given both to the employer and the employee, the cutting down of overtime might be very serious in certain cases where there would be a particular rush of business and where there must be a certain number of hands to deal with that rush.  If you are to force these people to get out in such circumstances, what is to be done?  You might get in casual hands, but in an ordinary country town it would be extremely difficult to get in casual hands, and it would be practically impossible to get a trained casual hand.  For that reason, I think that a reasonable amount of laxity should be allowed so far as overtime is concerned, and I venture to say that, in practice, it will be <Col N="3159" /> found that it is the hands who will be anxious to get overtime and that the employees will be anxious not to give them overtime.  That will certainly be the case in a certain class of trade at any rate.</P>

As a matter of fact, I think you may take it that, due to the fact that trades unions function more effectively in a city than in the country, the conditions under which shop assistants work in country towns are far worse than those under which shop assistants work in the city.  However, am I correct in assuming that the Minister will undertake to bring in an amendment, in the event of this amendment being withdrawn, to reduce the provisions under paragraphs (b) and (c) in sub-section (3), thereby reducing the total number of hours worked in a particular year?</P>

      <P>That is what I have been considering, but the Deputy is aware that there are two further amendments in Deputy Norton's name designed for the same purpose.  I am not quite sure how he arrives at his figures, but I think we might provide that, if we allow 60 hours in any week, then we would not allow 60 hours in more than a certain number of weeks in a year, thus reducing the maximum period.  I have an idea that we can safely reduce the term provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) without creating too much risk, and while I should like to have an opportunity of considering the matter further, I would indicate a general intention of producing an amendment on the next stage in respect of these matters without being definitely committed to it.  I suggest that if the Deputy would leave the matter over for the present, he would be at liberty to reintroduce this amendment in the event of my not finding it possible to accede to this.</P>

      <P>(a) if such shop is situate in the area comprising Greater Dublin&mdash; 56 hours, or</P>
      <P>(b) if such shop is situate outside the area comprising Greater Dublin&mdash;60 hours.</P>
      <P>(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the immediately preceding sub-section, the proprietor of a shop which is a refreshment house, may permit any member of the staff of that shop to do shop work in any week for a period in excess of fifty-six or sixty hours (as the case may be) so that the number of hours of shop work done by such member does not exceed&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) seventy hours in any week, or</P>

      <P>I intimated already that I was not prepared to agree to that.  I will admit that I had very grave doubt in my mind as to the practicability or advisability of including refreshment houses and similar establishments within the scope of this measure at all.  However, I came to the conclusion that, whatever arguments there might be for excluding them from the scope of the Bill, there were much stronger arguments for including them, and I felt that, if included, the workers in these establishments could very reasonably protest if they were being subjected to conditions less favourable than those of other classes of workers whose work is very similar in nature.  It is quite true that refreshment houses and similar establishments are not likely to be required, under the Hours of Trading Act, to reduce the hours of trading to 48 hours in the week or 56 hours in the week. There is very little public need for requiring places of this kind to close at any hour at all, and consequently there will arise the position that the hours of trading will be different to the maximum hours of employment permitted by law for assistants.  That situation, of course, has arisen, in effect, in connection with licensed premises in Dublin in the past, where the maximum hours of trading permitted by law were in excess of the hours of employment of assistants permitted under the agreements concluded by the proprietors of the establishments with the trades unions concerned.  I think that, in due course, the proprietors of these refreshment houses will be able to adjust their working arrangements so as to permit of their assistants enjoying the same hours of work as the assistants in other classes of establishments. <Col N="3162" /> In the majority of retail shops it will be possible to arrange that the hours of trading and the hours of employment will coincide and that no difficulties will arise on that score.  But, in refreshment houses and similar establishments, that will not be so and, consequently, some special arrangements may have to be made.  I am aware that organisations of employers and employees have, in some places at any rate, been considering, in relation to the City of Dublin for example, what these special arrangements might be, and I feel quite satisfied when the need does actually arise that arrangements which will be generally satisfactory will emerge everywhere. This is also a question to which I have given very careful consideration.  I was fully aware that it would be raised here or, if not here, it would be raised by the persons directly concerned and, having ascertained so far as I could all the relevant facts, I came to the conclusion that I would have no justification for legislating for longer hours of work in this trade than in other trades.  Therefore, I propose to resist Deputy Dockrell's amendment.  I think the proprietors of refreshment houses will be able to get over whatever difficulty is caused for them by the enactment of this measure.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="3164" /> As the section stands, the effect is, as the Minister admitted, that it will be more difficult in every way for applicants to get licences.  It might be that in certain districts where there is an extension of this trade farmers might like to get into the business.  They might not be satisfied with the competition that exists and they might think that they were not being fairly treated.  It is to give the farmers an opportunity of setting up in business themselves if they desire to do so and to make it easy for them to get a licence, that I put down this amendment. I think the amendment more or less speaks for itself and I do not think the Minister ought to have any serious objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event I would like to support Deputy Bennett's amendment.  I am supporting it with this reservation, that I was extremely disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to accept the amendment introduced on the Committee Stage.  Has the Minister made up his mind that he wants Section 2, as introduced, to stand?  I think that he ought at least to accept this amendment.  As Deputy Bennett said, where you find an association of people who are themselves producers and who decide to do the business side of the trade and go in with the object of providing a better market and more competition, with the object, possibly, of securing better prices for their own products, I do not see that the Minister could have any objection to facilitating them.  Subject to correction, I believe that a similar provision has been put into other Acts of a somewhat similar nature.  I do not think that the Minister can say that this amendment, which is seeking to allow an association of producers who intend to go into the business end to get a licence under the provisions of the Principal Act, is going to do the section any harm.  I do not think the Minister can visualise that you are going to have six applications from the one street.  One of the Minister's <Col N="3165" /> objections to the other amendment on the Committee Stage was that you might have six applications from the one street from people who felt they should have a licence.  I do not think he can advance the same objection here.  He cannot advance the objection that you are going to have applications from persons who have been turned down time and again.  It is perfectly evident that the people who would apply for a licence would not expend their capital and build factories or any thing of that nature unless they were reasonably certain of getting a licence.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister need worry about the danger that there would be such a terrible spate of applications for licences if this amendment were passed.  There is little danger that he would have a number of applications from people who had been turned down.  I suggest that the amendment is perfectly reasonable. There is no reason why associations of producers should not have a chance of going into the business and putting themselves in the position where they would be able to get better prices for their own products, to create healthy competition, and so do something that will benefit the agricultural community through their being allowed to go into this trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister should agree to the amendment. A similar clause was inserted in the Pigs and Bacon Act and, as we know, the trouble is that not enough have availed of it.  If more had availed of it, it would relieve the Minister and the bacon curers also of much of the criticism that has been heard now and again.  If the farmers get a licence and if they fail to make a success of their business then much of the criticism levelled against the Minister and the bacon curers would be got rid of.  The more applications that come from organised farmers the better.  The arguments yesterday made use of by the Minister for refusing to accept an amendment do not apply in this case. His argument on that occasion was that there would be too many applications and that too much expense would be involved in sending out inspectors to <Col N="3166" /> report on these applications.  That argument would not apply here because you cannot get 200 or 300 farmers to get together who will acquire premises to start this business unless some very strong reasons can be advanced for it.  When an association of farmers go to such great expense as is essential in such circumstances, it is only right that the Department should send down an inspector to report on the premises before granting a licence.  I can see no reason why the Minister should not grant a licence to enable farmers to embark in this fresh meat trade themselves.  Such a body of farmers should be treated as fairly as the curers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The acceptance of this amendment will decide the question whether the Government is in favour of co-operation or whether it is not.  Our contention is that where a body of producers of live stock or any other agricultural product wish to go a stage further in their own industry and are desirous of taking on the sale of that product in addition to its production, they ought to have the right to do so. This amendment is designed to provide, where a group of farmers come together, put up the requisite capital, construct adequate premises and then come to the Minister for a licence to embark upon the export of fresh meat, that the Minister will be obliged to issue the licence within the terms of the Act and thus give the farmers the power to control all the operations connected with the export of their fresh meat products.  Unless some such proviso is put into this Bill what is going to happen is that the existing vested interests in the export business of live stock products will object to any competition which groups of farmers propose to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that he wanted the amending Bill which we are now considering in order to get power to refuse to grant licences for the export of fresh meat without assigning any reason.  He said unless he had that power he might have six people setting up in the same street and going into the fresh meat export business.  Then he went on to say that under the Pigs and Bacon Act he had <Col N="3167" /> power to grant licences and that the only representations he ever got were vigorous protests when he proposed to grant such licences.  Now these vigorous protests came from the existing vested interests.  If vigorous protests were made by people from the locality where bacon curing was already operating; if they protested against the Minister granting licences to the owners of a bacon-curing industry in another district to serve the farmers of that district, it was because, as they said: &ldquo;If you serve the farmers of that district you will be doing a disservice to the bacon curer of this district, and we say that the interest of the bacon curer should be served because he gives us a job and is a neighbour of ours, and we want his interest to be protected; we want you to serve the interest of the bacon curer and to neglect the interests of the farmer in Innishowen and to neglect the interest of the farmer in North-West Donegal; and we want you to do that while the interests of the bacon curer in South Donegal will be served.&rdquo;  I have no doubt that the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who represent North-East and West Donegal will assert themselves and see that a bacon factory is established which will profitably dispose of the pigs of these areas.  When people have lambs and porkers to dispose of they want to claim the right to get for their products what, I have no doubt, Deputy Friel and other Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party are agitating to get for the pig producers of Donegal West and Innishowen.</P>
    <P>We want, under this amendment, to create a situation under which, if a man who already has a licence to export fresh meat products, objects to the granting of a licence to another exporter in an adjacent are on the ground that his proportion of fresh meat will be reduced, the farmers of any particular area can come together and say: &ldquo;Our interests can best be served by granting a second licence, and unless a second licence is granted we are not going to get the best price for our producers; therefore we are going to form a co-operative society for the export of <Col N="3168" /> fresh meat; we are going to demand from the Minister a licence to export fresh meat.&rdquo;  When that demand is made by our farmers, this amendment is designed to see that a licence is granted.  The Minister may, however, reply that there is nothing to prevent his giving them the licence.  He may say: &ldquo;I can do so without your amendment; if I think well of it there is nothing to stop me giving a licence.&rdquo;  But we want to protect the Minister from the same kind of representation as those with which he is deluged at the present time when he contemplates granting a licence for the establishment of a bacon factory in North-West Donegal.  We want the Minister to be in the position to say: &ldquo;There is no use coming to me protesting. Under a clause in the Act these farmers have the right to demand a licence and I cannot refuse them so long as they have proper premises; so long as they comply with the regulations I cannot withhold my licence.  I am bound to give it to them.&rdquo;  Surely that is a desirable situation to create.  Do Deputies consider that the farmers of this country are such fools that they will throw themselves into a co-operative society to export their fresh meat if such a society is foredoomed to failure?</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is the case. So long as the farmers had an open market for the export of butter, they got along all right and the vast majority of co-operative societies formed for the export of butter not only did a profitable trade in the export of butter but extended and developed into other branches of trade.  May we not hope that under this section they will establish co-operative societies for the export of fresh meat, and, having so established them, develop them along broader lines and serve a very useful public service in their own areas? Surely the enterprising farmer who is prepared to stand on his own feet and do the whole job for himself is entitled to that amount of consideration from this House&mdash;that he will get the chance to prove himself.  That is all we are asking for.  We are not asking for a grant or subsidy or any kind of Government assistance, good, bad or indifferent.  All we are asking is that <Col N="3169" /> if a group of farmers should come together and undertake to put up their own money, undertake to do the entire job themselves, they will have the right to do it and will not be stopped from doing it by some established vested interest.  Is that an unreasonable demand?  I think not.  Notwithstanding that, when we challenge a division on this amendment, I venture to prophesy that all the Fianna Fáil T.D.'s who profess to represent small farmers will stump into the lobby to establish the principle that the vested interests at present exporting fresh meat under Government licence will be maintained in their present position and have the right absolutely to veto any attempt by a group of farmers to embark on the fresh meat export business themselves.  When Deputies opposite do that, they will be betraying the purpose for which they were sent to this House.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party who do that will be betraying the interests of the people who sent them here.  They will not do that for the first time, but I hope they will do it for the last time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On certain questions arising out of this amendment, very plausible arguments can be put forward, but when we come down to what we all know the practice to be, I think that any reasonable Deputy will agree that the amendment is not desirable. I said last night that if I had accepted the amendment down then, I might get six applications from one street. If I were to accept this amendment, I might get six application from one townland or one street.  We all know the sort of associations which have been set up in this country to represent, as they claimed, farmers.  When they claim to represent farmers both economically and politically, who is to say whether they represent farmers or not?  It is hardly enough that they should say that they represent farmers to be entitled to a licence.  I do not want to argue on the wording of the amendment, because a Deputy might say that, given time, they could frame the amendment in the proper way. Even if the amendment were so worded as to provide that these associations would have a paid-up membership of <Col N="3170" /> farmers, I think the amendment would be undesirable.  Experience has shown that.</P>
      <P>I am going to say what Deputy Dillon prophesied&mdash;that I have the option of granting a licence where it is considered desirable I should do so. Wherever it is thought that a better price will be given to the producer, I think I may say that a licence will be issued.  This Act has been in operation for seven years and it has been operated on the understanding that the Minister had this discretion.  On that assumption, licences have been granted and preference has always been given to the application of a co-operative society.  Within the past couple of years, applications from co-operative societies were refused for a reason which I shall explain.  When you have seven or eight co-operative societies operating in a country, they have a fairly intimate knowledge of the business carried on by one another. If one society is doing fairly well because it is in a certain line of business, whether cheese-making, turning out cream or engaging in the fresh meat trade, the other societies, when they see that, want to go into the same trade.  That is our experience. If one society were doing well in the fresh meat trade, every other society in the area would be claiming a licence.  For that reason these applications were turned down.  Deputy Bennett and Deputy Linehan know the thickly populated type of area which I have in mind.  If all co-operative societies were granted a licence in these areas to deal in pork or lamb, they could not possibly get a sufficient supply to make the business pay. Naturally and inevitably, there would be a loss on the business to every one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of the co-operative societies doing well when there was free export of butter.  He said that the co-operative societies developed and extended and did well when that was the case.  If Deputies will cast their minds back to 1927, they will find that there was chaos amongst the co-operative societies at that time. In many cases, they set out to compete against proprietors.  The same <Col N="3171" /> might happen if absolute power were given to a co-operative society to engage in the fresh meat business. When the creameries set out to compete against the proprietors, the proprietors set out to kill the co-operative societies.  The result was that in 1927, when the reorganisation of the industry was attempted, a number of co-operative societies were bankrupt.  It cost a great deal of money to get all the creameries under co-operative control. It involved buying out the proprietors and bolstering up the weak co-operatives.  There was no power at the time to refuse a licence to a co-operative society or to a proprietor in order that they might be prevented from entering into the making of butter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very specious explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the case.  If the Government had had, for some years preceding that, the power of refusing applications from co-operative societies or proprietors for leave to enter into the dairying business, that state of chaos would not have occurred. Since then the creamery business was reorganised.  The Minister was given power to refuse licences, and, as a result, things have been very much better. Deputy Bennett and Deputy Linehan will also be familiar with this position : you will get a group of farmers who ask themselves why they should be bringing their milk three miles to a creamery.  They say that they will start a creamery of their own.  That occurs very often. Their application is refused by the Minister in many cases. Deputy Bennett will admit that if these applications were not refused, not only would these groups of farmers ruin themselves, but they would succeed in injuring the surrounding creameries by taking supplies of milk from them.  Were it not for the power to refuse these applications, many groups of farmers would have done themselves this injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that, in principle, it is wrong that the Minister should have this discretion as regards applications, but every Deputy realises that before <Col N="3172" /> the Minister gives his decision on an application like that he is advised by the different classes of officials&mdash;the inspector on the spot, the head inspector, and those engaged in the administration of that branch who have a certain amount of experience of the work.  Acting on that advice, to a great extent, the Minister grants or refuses the application.  I admit that in principle it is wrong that the Minister should have this discretion.  I have some hope that if we had this long-expected Co-operative Bill passed there might be a <i>via media</i> found for such cases, because we would then have a ruling authority over the co-operative business and possibly a certain amount of the authority now vested in the Minister might be vested in it, so that they would be in a position to say if any co-operative society were to apply for a licence for a creamery or a fresh meat factory: &ldquo;We consider that in the interests of the co-operative movement in general this licence should be granted, or should be rejected.&rdquo;  Whether you would bind the Minister either to accept that opinion or to take it into account, I do not know; but that could be done when the Co-operative Bill comes up, which I hope will be during this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that we have acted on the assumption all the time&mdash; it is not a new principle&mdash;that the power which we seek in this Bill to put beyond doubt was vested in the Minister.  We turned down applications and we granted others.  I do not know whether any great mistake has been made&mdash;I do not think so&mdash; and I know that Deputies opposite will agree that the power was not abused in any way.  In exercising that power both my predecessor and myself acted in what we thought was the best interest of the producers.  It may be wrong in principle&mdash;I am quite prepared to admit that&mdash;but I think it is the only practicable way of carrying on business at the moment.  As I say, the only other solution I can find is that when the Co-operative Bill is passed and an authority set up to preside over the whole co-operative movement, it might be the proper authority <Col N="3173" /> in which to vest some of the powers now vested in the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations generally on the principle embodied in this Bill, which principle has been attacked in two amendments, one yesterday and one to-day.  My objection to the Bill as it stands is to the giving of a discretion to the Minister which he himself admits is wrong in principle; but in any remarks that I have to make in attacking that aspect of the Bill I wish it to be clearly understood by the Minister and by the House that I do not for one moment suggest that the Minister, or any successor of his, would invoke the aid of Section 2 for the purpose of dealing unjustly or unfairly with any application for a licence that might come to his Department.  This is one of the first measures which we are about to pass since the new Constitution came into force, and, as a lawyer, and a citizen of this State, I will bow to no one in the respect I will pay to that Constitution and the words contained therein, but I submit that the principle <Col N="3174" /> embodied in Section 2 is in direct conflict, if not with the letter, at all events, with the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>If the House will pardon me for a moment, I shall come back to the relevant Articles of the Constitution in support of that argument, but before I reach that stage, there are a number of reasons, apart from that which I have just stated, why I suggest this Bill should not be allowed to go on to the statute book in its present form. It will, I think, be admitted by everyone, as it is admitted by the Minister, that it is wrong in principle to grant to a Minister, or to any official of this State, an absolute discretion to refuse or to grant a licence similar in character to this.  There have been, during the past few years, a number of Acts put into operation in connection with agricultural produce.  There have been statutes passed in connection with eggs, in connection with butter and in connection with creameries, and now this Bill deals with fresh meat. In none of those statutes can I find this absolute discretion given to a Minister who is the Minister in charge of the Department dealing with their administration.  There is, however, in another similar Act an absolute discretion given to the Minister.  That is the Act which deals with milling licences.  We have listened to a great deal of discussion here on the result of the operation of these licences, and the limitation of the number of mills, and I think we must come to the conclusion, as a result of those discussions, that enormous profits have been made by the millers through the granting of those licences.  That is the only statute I could find, in the short time at my disposal for a search, in which an absolute discretion is given to the Minister to refuse or to grant a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that it is bad in principle that the Minister should have this discretion. He admits it himself, and I say that he should come to this House and convince it with arguments that could not possibly be refuted on the grounds of expediency and on every other ground, in order to get the members of this House to accept the position that he should have this absolute discretion, he at the time admitting <Col N="3175" /> that it is wrong in principle.  I am a great believer in the institution of Parliamentary representation.  Unfortunately, if we cast our eyes around the map of Europe, or the map of the world, we find that the Parliamentary institutions of the different countries are crumbling into dust.  We can flatter ourselves that in so far as we have a Parliamentary institution, it is beloved and cherished by the people, and I hope it always will be.  But there is always the thin end of the wedge; there is always the little crack that can be made in the ramparts, and I suggest that by giving the Minister for Agriculture the right to do what he seeks in this Bill, you are driving the first blow into the ramparts and walls of Parliamentary institutions and creating a dangerous and an alarming experiment.  The Minister stated on the Committee Stage that the reason why Section 2 is necessary was, in the first place, to obviate the expense of sending inspectors to inspect premises proposed to be licenses.  I may be wrong in that, but I gather that that was the tenour of the Minister's remarks, and that it was deemed desirable to have a certain amount of monopoly with regard to slaughterhouses and the resultant licensing of exports therefrom.  If that is so.  I cannot see that that is an adequate ground for introducing this section, especially having regard to the fact that the Minister stated that since the original Act was passed in 1930 he had on numerous occasions, in virtue of his office, carried out the administration of that Act as if this section were embodied in it, and had the meaning purporting to be given to it at the present time.  If the Minister has acted on the assumption that he had the absolute right of veto on licences of this kind, and had not been challenged on it, or if he has unfairly operated that end of the Act, why the necessity to put in this dangerous section here?</P>
    <P>I have only a few other observations to make before I refer Deputies to some of the relative Articles of the Constitution. There is no question whatever, but this section is designed in such a way that it will tend to create <Col N="3176" /> a monopoly.  We have only to look to a great country like the United States of America for proof of the life and death struggle that is going on there in order to abolish the system of monopolies and trusts that was created there.  Of course we are not as big or as rich as that country, and we do not deal in millions as they do in America, at the same time, monopolies, even in a small way, are dangerous when introduced.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputies that, while the Constitution has been enacted by the people, we stand between the people and the Executive, in order to see that the people get the rights that have been given to them, and to see that they are not lightly taken away.  The Minister in charge of this Bill is, I might say, an expert on the Constitution, because I read recently that he delivered a lecture on the subject in his constituency. Therefore, he will perhaps appreciate the observations I wish to make on the subject.  I ask the Minister to consider Article 45 of the Constitution. Is he of opinion that if he insists upon this Bill passing with this section in it, that he is not breaking his trust to the people who are alleged to have enacted the Constitution? Article 45 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The principles of social policy set forth in this Article are intended for the general guidance of the Oireachtas.  The application of those principles in the making of laws shall be the care of the Oireachtas exclusively, and shall not be cognisable by any Court under any of the provisions of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is our exclusive care, both Ministers and Deputies, to see that the principles of social policy set forth in the Article are carried into effect.  According to paragraph iii of the Article the objects are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>iii. That, especially, the operation of free competition shall not be allowed so to develop as to result in the concentration of the ownership or control of essential commodities in a few individuals to the common detriment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that the result of this section, when carried to its logical conclusion, will be to deprive <Col N="3177" /> certain individuals of the right of free competition, and to place the control of commodities, that is to say, the export of fresh beef, in the hands of a few.  I suggest that that is to the detriment of the citizens of this State.  Has the Minister or the Government considered whether the delegation of that absolute right to the Minister in regard to the licensing of exports is a detriment to the citizens of the State?  Have they considered whether that is not a breach of faith under the Constitution they piloted through this House?  It is not my intention to suggest that the Minister would in any way act unfairly.  I am not so much really concerned with this particular Bill as with the principle being introduced into Parliamentary institutions.  I say that it will affect the future of Parliamentary government.  I ask the Minister to consider the matter in that light. As this is one of the first Bills to be passed under and by virtue of the new Constitution is it not breaking faith with the people who passed that Constitution to have this section in the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Esmonde looks up certain Acts that were passed here he will find that this power or discretion in the Minister is embodied in a number of them.  I mentioned the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, where the Minister took power to refuse at his absolute discretion licences for the manufacture of butter.  In the Export of Potatoes Act the Minister had power to refuse to issue licences for the export of potatoes at his discretion. Other Acts have been passed since containing that provision.  For instance, a person cannot start a maize mill without licence from the Minister. He cannot start as a wheat dealer without a licence.  There is also the instance of the bacon factory.  There are other things, such as the manufacture of meat products, where <Col N="3178" /> licences are necessary.  These are the only ones that I can recollect at the moment.  I am sure that there are more if we had time to search through the various Agricultural Acts passed during the last 10 or 12 years.  This, therefore, is not an uncommon power. In fact, in all these Acts dealing with the better production of agricultural commodities, whether for internal consumption or for export, that power has been taken.  Deputy Esmonde asked me if we had acted on the assumption that this power was already vested in the Minister, why we brought in the section.  For the reason that a certain amount of doubt was cast on it.  I was advised that if an applicant for a licence, on being refused, were to appeal to the courts he might possibly get an order compelling the Minister to issue a licence on the grounds that the Minister had not the power to refuse it.  It was to remove a doubt of that kind that the section was brought in.</P>
      <P>Lastly, with regard to the Constitution. I have stated here on many occasions that I do not like being put in the position of arguing with lawyers on legal subjects.  I do not think, however, that the Article quoted by the Deputy has reference to a case such as this.  My reading of that Article is that we would not permit a person engaged in any trade to wipe out everybody else in it, and then, having got complete control of that particular trade, to recoup himself for any losses he might have incurred in becoming a monopolist, by making unduly large profits.  I think this is not a parallel case at all.  Although the Article in the Constitution which has been quoted speaks of monopolies, I think it does so from quite a different angle. It refers to giving a monopoly to people already in a business which, of course, we are not doing here.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to provide that where a chemist's assistant does not serve more than 96 hours in any period of two weeks he may serve 52 hours in one week without becoming entitled to overtime.  There may be something to be said for these amendments, but I do not think that there is.  If there is, I think that it would apply to any <Col N="3181" /> class of shop assistant as much as to a chemist's assistant, and I should like to hear the Deputy state why he considers an amendment of this kind would be advantageous.  I, of course, contemplate the possibility of there being some trades in which the hours of work in one week may necessarily have to be different from the hours of work in another; but, in the ordinary course, I would not regard the business of a chemist as coming within that class.  I should imagine that to an extent even greater than in the case of, say, a drapery or clothing shop the hours of work in a chemist's establishment would be the same in one week as in another, and that variations in these hours would not be necessary. The Bill provides for a 48-hours week for chemists' assistants.  I have no very strong objection in principle to making that a 96-hour fortnight if there is need for it, but I should like to have that need demonstrated.  I do not quite see what the need for it is, and I do not see if there is need for it why it applies only in the case of chemists' assistants.  It is purely a matter of meeting the circumstances of each case and not a matter of principle. I do not suppose there will be from any quarter of the House objection to providing for a 96-hour fortnight instead of a 48-hour week, but, from the point of view of administration, the enforcement of the Act, and the checking up of records to secure that the law was being observed, a 48-hour week would be preferable. However, I am prepared to consider the case if it is made, but up to the present I have not been able to understand what particular advantage proprietors of chemists' shops think they would get from a change of this kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister has very fairly said that theoretically he does not see any objection to this.  He asks what is the difference between a chemist's shop and any other shop. The essential difference is that the chemist has to open on a Sunday. After all, a chemist's shop is not in the category of an ordinary shop in that the chemist sells a number of things which may become absolutely vital necessities for people.  I would not think of bringing in the amendment <Col N="3182" /> for an ordinary shopkeeper without some extraordinary difference in his trade being revealed.</P>
      <P>I think the fact that a chemist has to open on Sunday or leave the people in a very serious plight on that day puts the matter in an entirely different category.  Somebody may say: &ldquo;Yes, but the chemist would be knocked up.&rdquo; If he is not going to be allowed to open on Sunday, or if he does not open on Sunday, he will probably have departed from the premises and the Minister may find that somebody has died by reason of not being able to get the necessary medicine from the chemist.  In that way I think chemists are in a special class.  The fact that they are serving the community by opening on Sunday, and that they probably can only sell certain things on that day, should evoke favourable consideration for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not quite see what the Sunday opening has to do with it. Admitting that chemists will open on Sunday while a number of other traders will be permitted to open on Sunday also, what is the advantage to the chemist to have the hours of work of his assistants fixed at a maximum of 96 per fortnight instead of 48 per week?  The Deputy did not make that very clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite right.  I did not attempt to make that clear.  The position is that the assistant works a long and a short week.  He works on Sunday in one week, and in the other week he does not work on that day.  If this idea were adopted, the staff could be divided so that one week an assistant would work on Sunday, which would be the long week, and in the other week he would not work on Sunday.</P>

      <P>I have stated I have no objection in principle to the amendment. It seems to me a matter of little importance whether we fix the maximum hours of work of chemists at 96 per fortnight or 48 in the week. If the persons affected consider that it will be a convenience to them, I am prepared to consider it.  Perhaps the Deputy might hold over the amendment. <Col N="3183" /> I have no objection to the principle whatever.  The only objection I can advance at all is that administration and enforcement might be simpler if there were uniform hours of work permitted in each week, but that is not a very serious objection.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Norton, I move amendment No. 66:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section 4, line 59, to delete the words &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands, it provides that in the event of overtime being worked, the rate to be paid for such overtime shall be increased by not less than 25 per cent. of the rate for ordinary working hours.  The idea of the amendment is to substitute 50 per cent. for 25 per cent.  In the parlance of the man in the street, it is simply equivalent to paying time and a half for overtime.  I suggest that is not an unreasonable amendment.  I think it has been the practice in a good many other trades to pay time and a half for overtime.  I suggest that that rate should be provided for in this Bill.  I think&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that under the Conditions of Employment Act, in which overtime was calculated at weekly and daily rates, the effect was that the rate would be time and a half.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the rates of wages in shops are very low, I think it is not unreasonable to ask that for overtime 50 per cent. should be added to the rate paid for normal working hours.  If the rate of wages were higher in shops, it might, perhaps, be unreasonable to make such a demand, but, taking into consideration the general standard of wages paid in shops, I think it is not unreasonable to suggest that time and a half should be paid for overtime. Hence the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to agree to the amendment.  I think the minimum statutory requirement that <Col N="3184" /> overtime should be paid at time and a quarter is reasonable enough.  A further reason why I could not agree to the amendment is the fact that the Conditions of Employment Act of 1936 provides that time and a quarter shall be paid for overtime, and any amendment of this Bill in the direction suggested by the Deputy would inevitably lead to an amendment of that Act also. There is, of course, nothing in the legislation to prevent an employer paying more if he wants to, or entering into an agreement with his employees to pay more.  So far as the law is concerned, I think we will have effected our purpose if we provide that overtime shall be paid for at the rate of time and a quarter.</P>

Although he may not work more than 48 hours in the week, if he works in excess of nine hours per day, he will be paid at the overtime rate in respect of these excess hours but the rate is time and a quarter.</P>

      <P>I suppose it has, Sir, a blood relationship to the former amendment, but certainly the question arises of a period in the year during which it may be very difficult to obtain labour in certain parts of the country where such establishments as are referred to in the amendment have to cope with rush conditions.

      <P>I think the exemption which the Deputy proposes here is much too wide and sweeping.  he is, however, attempting to deal with a problem which requires attention, and I am not yet satisfied in my own mind how best to deal with it.  Hotels and refreshment houses in tourist centres during the comparatively short tourist season may require exemptions which would not ordinarily apply to establishments of the same kind in other parts of the country.  There is, of course, power in sub-section (5) to make certain exemption orders, but I should like to have an opportunity to consider the matter further in order to see whether it is necessary to go beyond that and give a more specific exemption in respect of houses of the particular kind and in the particular localities I have in mind.  I intend to consider that further.  I would not be <Col N="3186" /> prepared to agree to the rather complete exemption which the Deputy proposes, but we might go some distance to meet the particular problem with which he is aiming to deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, page 11, to add a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>This section shall not apply to the proprietor of a shop which is licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would submit to the House that this Bill as it stands is not really applicable to the licensed trade, and cannot be worked successfully in connection with that trade.  Licensed houses have been regarded in English legislation, as I am sure the Minister is aware, as on a different footing to other houses, and one of the main reasons is that they are under a statutory obligation to remain open for a certain number of hours.  The hours, of course, vary in different cases.  In county boroughs they remain open for 68½ hours per week.  In urban areas they have to be open for 71½ hours, and in country districts, in addition, where there is a seven-day licence, they have to do their <i>bona-fide</i> business.  They are bound to supply to the public during those hours.  In a great part of the country there is no very definite arrangement, as far as I know, between the owners of licensed premises and the employees of licensed premises as to the number of hours during which they should work.  In Dublin there is an arrangement, I am informed, by which the employees now work for a period of 56 hours per week, but that is exclusive of two hours cleaning-up time, which are necessary in a licensed premises.  The result of this Bill coming into force as it stands would be that that 56 hours would be cut down not merely to 48 hours but below 48 hours, because it is necessary for those assistants to come before opening time to get the shop ready and cleaned up, and to remain also for cleaning-up purposes after closing time.  Therefore as far as <Col N="3187" /> actually serving the public is concerned, the 48 hours would not be 48 hours.</P>
    <P>Let us take the present 56 hours as the figure, leaving out for the moment the question of cleaning-up time.  If that is cut down to 48 hours, it will mean the employment of another assistant, because I think it must be fairly obvious that in a licensed premises, where the business must be on a cash basis, it would be an impossible risk to take in a casual employee to carry on for a few hours per week. That would be utterly impossible.  You could not trust a casual person, who was just taken in for a few hours a week, with the receipt of money, there being only the slight check which the ordinary cash register provides.  If the 56 hours is cut down to 48 hours, that means eight hours off.  If you take on an extra hand, unless you already had six employees you will have one man doing less than the others.  He will be paid, but he will not have the full work to do.  For instance, suppose you are employing three men, and the 56 hours are cut down to 48; that means that 24 hours are taken off the working time of the three assistants.  There must be another whole-time hand.  In other words, there will have to be a man for doing 48 hours' work in the week, whereas there are only 24 hours' work for him to do.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this legislation, as it stands, cannot be applied to licensed premises without very grave dislocation of the entire trade.  In the country districts, of course, there is a great number of shops which do not employ any assistants at all, and this Bill does not touch them, but if you take a shop in a small town, which employs only one or two assistants, it seems to make it impossible for them to keep open, as they are bound to keep open, and at the same time have those shorter working hours.  I understand that there is a move amongst some licensed traders to have the number of hours' compulsory trading considerably shortened to meet the terms of this Bill.  I do not know if the Minister has considered that question, or whether he has made representations to the appropriate Department.  Of <Col N="3188" /> course, I know it is not the Minister's Department that would deal with an alteration in the licensing laws; it would be the Department of Justice. I wonder whether the Minister is considering or has considered making representations to that Department as to the cutting down of licensing hours, certainly in the urban areas.  My arguments on this matter have been put rather concisely.  From what the Minister has said about hotels, I have a fair idea of what he is going to say about the licensed trade.  I have put my arguments as concisely as I can, without developing them, but I hope that I have brought the major features to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any of the arguments advanced by the Deputy can be regarded as applying to the licensed trade exclusively.  I think precisely the same case could be made in respect of any class of establishment where the hours of trading are considerably in excess of the 48 hours permitted by this Bill in regard to the employment of assistants.  All the difficulties which the Deputy foresees as arising in regard to licensed premises are due entirely to the fact that the trading hours will be longer than the maximum working week permitted.  If those arguments are valid in respect of the licensed trade, they are equally valid in respect of tobacconists' shops, or chemists' shops, or refreshment houses or other shops in respect of which the hours of trading are longer than the maximum working week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference.  The licensed house has to keep open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only a theoretical difference.  The Deputy says a licensed house must keep open; in fact, a tobacconist shop will keep open.  It may not be required by law to keep open, but it will still keep open. Perhaps the force of economic necessity will prove just as effective as the force of a Statute.  Therefore, we might say that a tobacconist's shop must keep open also.  That may or may not be true.  Perhaps it is not true.  I do not anticipate that the licensed traders as a whole will experience any particular <Col N="3189" /> difficulty in operating a 48-hour week for their assistants.  I have discussed this matter with the representatives of the licensed trade, and heard their views.  It is true that they intimated the possibility of their making representations to the Department of Justice to have the hours of trading restricted, but whatever case there may be for that&mdash;I do not know what the attitude of the Department is likely to be&mdash;I do not think it is necessitated entirely by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In very few licensed houses is it a fact that business is brisk all through the day.  in a great majority of licensed houses there are certain busy hours and a very large number of slack hours.  In, possibly, a majority of licensed houses, the busy hours are in the evening.  But that is not always the case.  In the case of some licensed houses the busy hours would be during the morning&mdash;that is, licensed houses in, say, the vicinity of the cattle market in Dublin or in the vicinity of Glasnevin where funerals congregate. In the case of such houses, their busy hours are in the morning, while in the case of other houses the busy hours are in the evening.  It is precisely on that account that I do not think an alteration of the hours by law would meet the difficulty of all the traders, nor do I think it would be welcome by them.  In any event, however, I do not think there will be the difficulty that the Deputy seems to anticipate in adjusting the working hours so as to meet the requirements of this Bill. So far as Dublin is concerned, the licensed traders are experienced in the problems involved in operating the working hours during the period in which trading is permitted.  That may not apply throughout the country, but in the country, more particularly than in the city, it can be said that trade is only brisk at special times during the day or on special days in the week, and there need not be any insuperable difficulty in adjusting the hours of work so as to ensure that the assistant will be present when the pressure of business would require his presence and that he would have his hours off at a time when the establishment does not require his presence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>But as far as I understand it, the hours must be definitely fixed.  For instance, you cannot say at any time to an assistant: &ldquo;I am likely to be short to-day&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am only going to work you for three hours to day.&rdquo;  Surely, you must have a more permanent arrangement than that, and, as I understand it, a notice with regard to the hours must be put up in the shop.</P>

That publichouse will do the bulk of its trading after six o'clock in the evening, that is to say, after people have come home from their work.  That is the most likely time at which they will come into the publichouse and spend their money. Then, however, you have something special coming along for some particular occasion, such as a fair or a market, and different conditions will obtain on a fair day or a market day. The Minister talks about overtime in connection with the special conditions, but the fair day or the market day may more than exhaust the overtime, and if the working arrangements were from 6 o'clock until 9 o'clock, or whatever the hours might be, with a blank in the middle, if their overtime was exhausted on the one particular day, they would be completely lost when some other occasion came along in the town.</P>

People come in on the days when business is done, and it must be remembered that the publicans in an ordinary country town of 2,000 to 3,000 inhabitants do not live on the population <Col N="3191" /> of that town, but on the population of the surrounding country.</P>

      <P>The Minister may by order made in respect of the week in which Christmas Day falls extend the hours mentioned in this section during which it may be lawful for the proprietor of a shop to permit the staff of that shop to do shop work.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the Minister power, if representations are made to him, to extend the hours of work for Christmas week. After all, there is a very considerable rush period around Christmas in certain trades.  Not only has the public to be served, but the stock has to be kept in some sort of order.  At any rate.  I should like the Minister to take these powers.  If he does not consider the representations made to him to be proper, then he need not grant the extension, but I think he ought to have power to grant an extension for that period.</P>

I think we might find it desirable to alter the provisions of sub-section (5) so as to make it possible to make one order which will automatically expire.  As I read sub-section (5), it is necessary for the Minister to make an order granting exemption for a special period and <Col N="3192" /> then to make another order revoking that at the end of the period.  The only other thing, if it were necessary at all, would be to provide for a special period also, and if that change is effected then the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary, because the power would be there already.</P>

At the present time, as the Bill stands, the employer has the right to avail of the overtime provisions, and I take it that the extra work that is involved in the Christmas trade can be met by the overtime provisions. If there is increased trade at Christmas time, the shopkeeper, by reason of that increased trade, is making more money, and I do not see why his increased profit should not also go towards increased wages for his staff for overtime work.</P>

There is, of course, the work done during the opening hours of the shop, or just before opening, and there is, possibly, a half an hour or so after closing time for cleaning-up purposes and so on; but normally the time for overtime is when there is stocktaking going on or at some period such as the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>In respect of certain classes of shops, it may be necessary to work even more than 60 hours in special circumstances.  I do not know whether the circumstances of 1937, just immediately before Christmas, would come within that category.  I have in mind provision shops of one kind or another during, not merely a bank holiday, but three holidays in succession, where in order to meet the convenience of the public and enable orders received to be disposed of, very exceptional hours were worked.  I am sure that was the case in most of the provision shops in Dublin in the days immediately preceding Christmas.  It might be necessary to have power to deal <Col N="3193" /> with such cases.  It is quite true the majority of shop proprietors would have no objection to making an additional payment to their assistants in respect of the long hours they work immediately prior to a bank holiday of that kind.  I think an addition of 25 per cent. in respect of the overtime would not be regarded as unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I may be unduly apprehensive as to the difficulties we are going to meet, but I know that under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, we ran into circumstances that we had not visualised and it was necessary to use our powers fairly liberally in order to adjust the requirements of the law to the circumstances of the particular trade.  I do think the same thing may arise in relation to special trades under this Bill and, therefore, I think it is desirable that sub-section (5) of Section 18 should be as wide as possible, bearing in mind there is the provision for consultation.  In any event, the general policy is made clear in the Bill and the extensive use of the powers under sub-section (5) would be contrary to that policy.  I do not think any Minister is likely to use the powers of sub-section (5), but the powers should be there.  I am quite satisfied that when we come to administer this measure we will, time and again, come up against circumstances in which we will have joint representations from the workers and the employers for the making of Orders.  That was our experience under the 1936 Act and I am sure it will be the experience again. The only change I propose to make is one to convenience administration.  As I read it, the Order can be made and revoked and it can apply to specified shops in a specified area.  We should have power for a specified period so that the making of a second Order may become unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows the type of shop which is worked by the proprietor.  There is generally a living room behind the shop, and the people come out to serve a customer.  In that type of establishment it is not easy to enforce regulations as to hours of work and keeping of records, which must be done in the case of a large <Col N="3195" /> type of establishment.  I have abandoned the idea of trying to regulate employment of that kind; I think it is completely impracticable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question, and I am surprised it has not cropped up on Section 18.  The maximum time is 11 hours.  If we come down to paragraph (a), relating to overtime for the week, it is 60 hours, and paragraphs (b) and (c) follow.  I think paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are very fair, and I do not think that the employer would like to work people for extraordinary periods or beyond these hours.  I would like to put before the Minister the position of an employer who finds that he has got a certain number of assistants in his establishment and it is necessary to catch up some arrears of work. I agree with a good deal of what has been said from the Labour Benches about overtime&mdash;that the employees should be properly remunerated for working overtime.  At the same time, in most cases it is not the employer's fault that overtime has to be worked, and the employer need not be scalped. I am not making any point about the addition of 25 per cent. for the overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to compare is the amount of work that is permitted on one day.  Take a shop that is working 48 hours a week.  They are probably working 8½ hours a day for five days and the balance on a short day on Saturday.  When the employer finds that he wants overtime worked he will consult the staff.  If the job is not urgent and merely requires to be done he will say to the staff: &ldquo;There is an accumulation of work, and we will have to stay in next week, and what day will suit you?&rdquo;  Immediately employee A will say, &ldquo;I have something on on Monday,&rdquo; and employee B will say, &ldquo;I have something on on Tuesday,&rdquo; and employee C will say he has something on on Wednesday.  The employer then will probably say, &ldquo;Choose between yourselves, but I want the overtime worked on one or possibly two days in the week.&rdquo;  Having arrived at that point, the employer is allowed to work 60 hours a week. <Col N="3196" /> The difference between 48 and 60 hours is 12 hours.  He is allowed to work the 12 hours in the week, but he is only allowed to work 2½ hours each evening.  That means that if he wanted to work the 60 hours he would have to work overtime on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  I suggest to the Minister that the overtime allowed, the maximum working hours, are too short, and under the special circumstances that may arise the employer ought to be able to work a half day extra.</P>
    <P>Now, that would run to probably 13 hours, and I would like to suggest to the Minister that that would suit the proprietor and probably his assistants much better, that they should work a half-day on one day or possibly two days in the week and then have the other hours free for whatever leisure they would require.  I would like to suggest that this system of only working 2½ hours each night is really too little, having regard to the fact that crises of a minor character may occur.  We know the Minister may say to me that storm, flood and fire are excepted, but in a retail establishment everything that knocks a business out of gear is a crisis, and I would like to suggest that a period of one hour overtime is too short, having regard to the fact that in a lot of cases they work 8½ hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell made a very good case, and I am impressed by it.  I am not sure, however, that if he carries his calculations a little further he will not find a certain flaw in them.  If an employer wants 60 hours from an employee in the week&mdash; that is, to work the employee the maximum lot, subject to the payment of overtime, right up to a 12-hour day period&mdash;then in the two days which the Deputy has in mind he might work 15 hours a day, and that would be an excessive period.  If he wants the employee to work a 60-hour week the overtime will have to be worked on more than two days a week.  On the whole I am inclined to meet the Deputy's point.  The 11 hours, which is exclusive of the time spent at meals, is an unreasonable period.  It means that a man starts at 9 o'clock in the <Col N="3197" /> morning, with an hour for lunch and half an hour for tea, and continues to work until 9.30 that evening.  On the face of it that seems a long period.  I know it has been the practice in some establishments to work longer hours than that.  I am not sure that it is desirable to permit it.  We could deal with the particular point the Deputy has raised by increasing the number of hours permitted in sub-section (1) and put into sub-section (3) the number of hours for constituting a normal day. The time worked over and above these normal hours is, of course, at overtime rates.  I am not sure that the Deputy's point is as strong as he made it appear.  I think, in the ordinary course, in the majority of establishments the hours of work from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. in the evening will be the maximum.  I am not sure that it is wise to permit long hours with overtime pay or otherwise.  It is a matter on which I would like to hear the views of other Parties in the House.</P>

      <P>We have already had a certain amount of Opposition views to the 11 hours stated in sub-section (1).  That was due in a sense to a misunderstanding. What was intended to be provided there was that 11 hours was to be the maximum.  I do not know whether, if we were to consider an alternative of the number of hours provided for in sub-section (1), it would not be better to delete the section altogether and to deal with it by the <Col N="3198" /> provisions in sub-section (3).  There will be difficulties in doing it.  One of the objections which would not apply in the trade which the Deputy has indicated would apply in certain trades.  It is possible that the section might not work out in a reduction of working hours for assistants, but in increased rates of pay.  It is not clear that in some establishments they would not continue to work the same number of hours as at present and merely provide for increased remuneration. It is a matter which I should like to consider further.</P>

      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Act relating to intervals for meals, the hours of employment of a member of the staff of a shop shall not on any day be divided into more than two spells, and the period between any such spells shall not be less than four hours in duration.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 29, to delete the word &ldquo;shop&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;refreshment house&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section permits the working day to be done in two spells with a minimum interval of four hours.  We do not see that there is a case for all employers to have these privileged spells.  This amendment proposes to limit the privileges to certain classes of shops, namely, hotels, restaurants and refreshment houses.  We do not think it is a case for every class of shop having this division of the working day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite get Deputy O'Brien's point.  The object of Section 19 is to ensure that there shall not be an undue break by the employer in order to ensure that the <Col N="3199" /> provisions of the Act will be complied with while the service of the assistant will be retained when required.  What is provided here is that it will not be possible for an employer to say to his assistant: &ldquo;Come in at 9 o'clock and work till 10; then take an hour off until 11; come back then and work until 12; then take an hour off until 1 and work until 2; come back at 4 and then at 5 o'clock take another hour off and come back in the evening.&rdquo; The idea of the section is to make that sort of thing impossible.  What we provide for, therefore, is that the hours of work shall not be divided into more than two spells and that between each spell there must be a period of not less than four hours.  That is designed to make impossible the spasmodic type of work which might be resorted to when the 48-hour week becomes a statutory provision.  The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to confine that safeguard to refreshment houses.  The Deputy has, however, lost sight of the difficulty that the section, as it stands, cannot conveniently be applied to refreshment houses at all.  Deputy Dockrell, in the next amendment, is proposing to ensure that this section shall not apply to refreshment houses, whereas Deputy O'Brien is proposing that it shall apply only to refreshment houses.  I have had representations from the trade union concerned that power should be taken to exempt refreshment houses from the operation of this section.  They say that it would interfere considerably with the method of working in hotels, particularly, if this provision applied, that it is not unusual for a waiter to be employed during the breakfast period, which is generally regarded as ending about 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock, for him to come on again for the lunch period, which commences about 1 o'clock and ends at 3.30 or 4 o'clock, and then to come on again for the dinner period.  The union representatives I met are anxious to continue that arrangement, and suggested that we should amend this section so as to permit of its being continued. The section has to be reconsidered in relation to employment in hotels, in <Col N="3200" /> any event, but I think it should be preserved as it stands in relation to shops.</P>
      <P>In view of the explanation I have given, perhaps Deputy O'Brien would reconsider his amendment.  In relation to the ordinary shop, it is desirable to ensure that there will be some barrier to the breaking up of the period of employment.  If we exempt the ordinary shop from the section, something else will have to be substituted, because, if we were to take Deputy O'Brien's amendment, we would be removing employment in the ordinary shops entirely from the safeguard of this section and leaving it possible for an employer to work his assistants an hour on and an hour off, or two hours on and two hours off.  We want to prevent that, and to ensure that no period of employment will be divided into more than two spells, and, if divided into two spells, that there will be not less than four hours between them.  That may not be the most effective type of safeguard, but it is the one that occurred to me, and I think it is generally agreed by the parties who are interested in it that it will be effective.  The representation that came to me from the Trade Union Congress urged the exemption of hotels from this section or the adoption of a provision which would enable some different regulation to be made in the case of hotels where the intervals between spells are likely to be more than four hours and the spells themselves to be more than two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be all right as regards hotels but what case is there to be made for the ordinary shop?  Does it not mean that there could be a very long spread-over?  You might have a break of four or five hours.  It must be not less than four but it might be five or six, and you might have the working day staggering over 15 or 16 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is designed to prevent that.  Of course, that may happen.  In the case of licensed premises, which have already been discussed, an assistant might be employed during the morning, get the afternoon off and come in after tea.  I am not <Col N="3201" /> at all sure that they do not work that system in a number of licensed premises in Dublin at present in order to secure the effectiveness of the 56-hour week agreement.  What we have really in mind in this section is to ensure that, if there are intervals, they will not be less than four hours and that spells will not exceed two, so that the much more objectionable system of working can not be operated&mdash;that is, an employee getting an hour off during the slack period in order that he may work an hour later in the evening. The effect of Deputy O'Brien's amendment&mdash;I do not think he saw this&mdash; would be to remove all safeguards in respect of the periods of employment because it would confine those safeguards to refreshment houses.</P>

It is designed to provide that where a spell of work commences before 5 p.m., a juvenile employee will not be required to work later than 8 p.m.  I think everybody will agree that one of the purposes, and, possibly, the main purpose, of this legislation is to protect juveniles in shops, because, in small shops in particular, there is a great deal of exploitation of juvenile labour, and it seems to me to be reasonable that advantage should not be taken of the spell system to keep young girls in small shops working until all hours of the night.  Under the Bill as it stands, I suggest that a girl or boy in a shop might be required to work in two spells, one commencing at 7 in the morning and finishing <Col N="3204" /> at 12 noon, and another commencing at 5 in the evening and finishing at 11 at night, so that in fact the working day would last from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m., with one break of 4 hours in the evening.  I do not think that is desirable and I think the Minister should accept this provision, that where a spell commences before 5 p.m., in the case of juveniles, it should end not later than 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>Is it not a rather fanciful set of circumstances the Deputy has in mind?  I have been trying to think of any type of occupation in which hours of work of that kind might be resorted to and I have not been able to think of any.  The Bill permits the employment of juveniles until 10 p.m. and that, of course, is subject to the 48-hour week, and to certain exceptions set out in sub-section (2) of Section 17. Unless I have some specific case brought to my notice, I would not be disposed to modify that provision, nor is it necessary to alter the final hour up to which work can be done in order to deal with the precise type of case to which the Deputy referred.  If there is any danger of juveniles being worked in the particular manner suggested by the Deputy, I think we could insert some provision which would definitely exclude it, but the Deputy's amendment is merely to prevent juveniles who work in spells being employed after 8 p.m.  That does not meet entirely the difficulty to which he has referred.  I do not know that it is necessary to legislate against the employment of juveniles after 8 p.m. under any circumstances.  I think that having regard to the circumstances of particular types of occupation, we can permit the employment of juveniles until 10 p.m. as we propose.  I am speaking somewhat in the dark because I cannot visualise circumstances under which the dangers which the Deputy foresees will arise, or the types of occupation in relation to which they might arise, but so far as I can see, it is not necessary to go beyond the proposals in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that in Dublin, and, I presume, in all cities, there are a large number of small shops <Col N="3205" /> employing juvenile staffs.  Many of those shops stay open almost 24 hours. Some of them open at 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning and stay open until 2 o'clock, or, at any rate, until 1 o'clock the next morning.  There are a large number of such shops, particularly in the suburbs of the cities, and I suggest that in those shops there is some need to provide that juvenile employees will not be kept working until late hours at night.  They should get a working day which will enable them to have a reasonable amount of time off at a reasonable time.</P>

I do not quite see that there is any danger of juveniles, or anybody else, being employed from 7 o'clock in the morning until 2 the next morning.  It cannot happen under the Bill because there is a maximum of 11 hours and that can be worked only for a limited number of days in the week.  However, I shall look into the point, but I am anxious to have the regulations under the Bill confined to what is absolutely necessary.  The more unnecessary regulations we have, the greater will be the difficulty of enforcing them.</P>

      <P>I have only one remark to make, and possibly I might make it now.  The Second Schedule, paragraph 3, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to Rule 1, where the hours of work include the hours from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., an interval of not less than half-an-hour shall be allowed between those hours for tea.</P>
      <P>I do not know the habits of the persons who work in shops in Dublin, and I cannot say whether it is their habit to take afternoon tea, but I know that in the country towns, it is not.  I do not think that any shop assistant would like very much to be turned out for half an hour to spend quarter of an hour going home for the purpose of gulping down a cup of tea.  As a matter of fact, he or she would stand outside during the half hour.  That assistant would rather work three hours and then go home for his tea and have his evening entirely to himself.  I have no amendment down and am merely drawing the Minister's attention to it with a view to his considering whether he should make that applicable only to county boroughs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 75a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1), line 52, to add the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided however that it shall be lawful for the proprietor of a shop to make such changes in the hours to be worked by and the intervals for rest and meals to be allowed to such members of the staff of that shop as may from time to time become necessary by reason of the illness or absence of any such member or the occurrence of any emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the change of hours of workers due to illness and I was prepared to discuss that matter with him.  I hope that he will give more reasons than he gave then.  While something might be said for the amendment, I see very considerable difficulty in the way of accepting it, in that the enforcement of the provisions of the Act would be very considerably impeded if these rapid changes in the notice as to hours of work were permitted.  In fact, if this <Col N="3208" /> amendment were accepted in its present form, it would make the whole provision prescribing that notice should be displayed of very little value, and practically inoperative.  I do not know what type of emergency the Deputy has in mind.  I do not think it could arise in the case of an ordinary shop. There might be some type of establishment where the illness or the absence of some member might necessitate changing the hours of work of members of the staff.  In such cases, some provision should be made for that, but in the great majority of shops, the hours of work and the hours of opening will coincide, and there will be no very great difficulty in meeting the type of case the Deputy has in mind.  In some types of establishment that will not be the case, and in these the illness or absence of one member might require changing the hours of another member, other than the employment of another member on overtime rates for hours in excess of those in the Bill.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I do not see quite clearly why there should be a special provision for that, and I would be glad if the Deputy would elaborate the point.  I would prefer not to accept the amendment in its present form, or in any form, as it destroys very largely the effect of the section.  The effect of the section is desirable for the purpose of ensuring the effective enforcement and display of the notice contemplated by the section.  It will also facilitate the inspector in ensuring that the provisions of the Act are being carried out.  If such a notice could be changed in the manner contemplated by the Deputy, obviously it would be of little value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment framed to meet a case which, I think, is very common &mdash;that is, where extra services have been agreed to and incorporated in an increased rate of pay.  For instance, there may be two assistants working side by side in a shop, and one of them is paid extra money for performing extra services.  The idea is that if this section is agreed to as it is worded, it might be argued that the wages for the extra services were standardised at the increased rate of pay, and that the <Col N="3212" /> assistant would have to be remunerated again for those extra services according to overtime rates.

      <P>(4)  If the proprietor of a shop shall terminate the employment of a person to whom this Act applies merely because of the operation of this section, such proprietor shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to have inserted a provision that the dismissal of an employee, merely by reason of the operation of this section, will be an offence under the Act.  The Minister, I am sure, will recognise the fact that evasion is a very usual thing under Acts of this kind.  There will be a fairly large number of employers who, no doubt, will try to evade the provisions of the Act by dismissing <Col N="3213" /> employees.  You will have a number of bad employers who, by reason of the restriction of hours and the necessity of paying overtime if the hours worked are longer than the hours provided, will dismiss their employees in order to evade the provisions of the Act.  It is suggested that conduct of that kind should be made an offence.  I can see that the Minister may raise the point that there will be difficulty in establishing the reason for dismissal in such cases.  While admitting that difficulty, I think that the insertion of an amendment such as this would in itself safeguard the position of at least a certain number of employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A provision of this kind would be perfectly futile.  The Deputy himself practically admits that.  He thinks that it might act as a deterrent on employers.  If he cannot make the provision effective there is no use in putting it in.  If you put that section in you will never get a prosecution because no employer will ostensibly dismiss an employee for the reason stated.  He may give any other reason &mdash;that he does not like the colour of the assistant's eyes or hair or something else, and immediately he does that a prosecution does not lie.</P>

      <P>As the present section stands, a person absent from employment owing to illness or any other reason over which he has no control for any period exceeding one month would be debarred from certain benefits under the Bill, the principal one being annual leave.  The purpose of the amendment is that one month should be extended to two months.  In a good many instances a person who is ill or absent through no fault of his own is not paid for that period, so that he is therefore not inflicting any great hardship on the employer, and I think it would be for the benefit of everybody concerned if that period of one month was extended to two months.  There might be an odd employer who might perhaps lay a person off for a certain period each year which would bring him beyond the period of one month by, say, a couple of days and thereby deprive the employee of his right to have his annual leave.  I do not think this is unreasonable, and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Section 25 of this Bill is similar to the corresponding section of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  In fact, that applies in great measure to the whole of Part IV of this Bill.  I do not like pleading the 1936 Act as a reason for not having amendments here, but there is an obvious advantage in having the least possible variation between the provisions <Col N="3216" /> of both Acts which are designed to provide exactly the same things for two different classes of workers.  On its merits, however, I think that the provision in this Bill as it stands is reasonable and that it is undesirable to extend beyond a month the period of absence which will not be regarded as an interruption of continuous employment for the purpose of that part of the Bill.  This provision for payment for holidays is, of course, less onerous on proprietors of shops than it is on proprietors of factories both by reason of the fact that the number of persons employed in shops is much smaller and that quite a number gave paid holidays to their assistants in the past.  Therefore, it might be argued that a more lenient provision in relation to matters of this kind could be adopted.  But, when one considers all the circumstances, one will see that it is possible to go too far in such matters.</P>
      <P>Here we are dealing with the question of spasmodic employment.  The Deputy, of course, has referred to cases where the absence of an employee is due to illness.  That, of course, was not the principal type of case we had in mind in farming the section in relation to the 1936 Act or this Bill.  The principal type of case we had in mind was the person who is employed fairly continuously but has occasional breaks, where it was felt these breaks will operate to prevent such a person from getting paid for his annual holiday on the ground that his employment was not continuous.  We, therefore, had to get a definition of continuous employment which would bridge these gaps in employment due to temporary cessation of work, temporary reduction in the weekly quantity of work, and other temporary causes, including illness.  There, however, the question arose as to what period of gap should be bridged, and it seemed that one month was not an unreasonable provision. There are, of course, other conditions&mdash;the condition that the person whose employment is interrupted does not get employment elsewhere, that is a new contract of employment with another employer, and that at the end of the interruption he returns to the original employer, the employer who becomes liable to pay for his holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3217" /> These all indicate the type of cases we have in mind.  If a person is employed in a shop and for some reason the shop closes, or because of some temporary cause the employment of the worker is interrupted, then, subject to these conditions, and to the interruption of the employment not being more than a month, we regard him as having been continuously employed and consequently entitled to his full rights in respect of holidays. If, however, the period goes beyond a month, I think it becomes a hardship on the proprietor, and I would be disposed to resist the amendment both on these grounds and by reason of the fact that it is, from the point of view of administration, a very substantial advantage to keep the provisions of this Bill and of the 1936 Act in conformity.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider dealing with the question of sickness separately from the other considerations he mentioned?

      <P>Is it in the interest of the employee?  Will the Deputy look at it in the other way?  Here we are dealing with the case of an employer who is willing to take back an employee who has been absent by reason of sickness.  If the employer terminates the employment he can get out of this obligation altogether.  It is only if he takes back the employee into his employment at the end of the period of sickness that he becomes liable to make this payment in respect of annual holidays.  An employer will do that in the case of an employee if the period of illness is not too long. But if it becomes too long, I think that whatever attachment there may be for the particular assistant will be worn thin and he will get out of the obligation by refusing to take back the employee into his service.  Therefore, I do not think it is altogether in the interest of the assistant to make the period too long.</P>

The specific point we had in mind was not the man who was ill, but the building trade worker who does a job, is laid off for a couple of weeks, goes to another job, is laid off for a couple of weeks, and then goes to another job.  We wanted to make his employment continuous despite the period he is laid off.  That type of interruption rarely occurs in the retail distribution trade, but it might occur, and we are putting the same provision in here.  If you are dealing with the case of illness, it is necessary to bear in mind the point I made that it is only where an employee returns to the employment of his employer that this arises at all, and I think the wisdom of extending the period beyond a month is very doubtful from any point of view, and I urge that on Deputies opposite.</P>

The Minister has said that, of course, the employer can make the point that he does not require his services. I think in certain cases it might be very difficult for the employer to find out whether the employee is sick or has gone away.  The employee might return and contend that he had been sick and that he was willing to resume work.  In that case, I think where illness is going to be claimed, the employer should be given notice.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that employees of shops which are refreshment houses will get a half-holiday commencing at 1.30 instead of at 3 o'clock as provided by the Bill. The generally established view of a half-holiday is that it should permit one to take the whole afternoon free from work, and a half-holiday commencing <Col N="3220" /> at 3 o'clock could hardly be regarded as a half-holiday at all.  I might mention in this connection that it is the practice at present in many places to give the half-holiday at 1 o'clock or at 1.30.  It is, I think, actually the practice in the licensed trade in Dublin, for instance, at the present time.  I feel that a half-holiday commencing at a later hour than 1.30 for employees who had started to work in the forenoon does not conform to what is generally understood to be a half-holiday.  The Minister might meet the point by agreeing to insert 1.30 instead of 3 o'clock in this sub-section.</P>

The Deputy should remember that it is 3 o'clock or five hours after the work commences, whichever is the earlier. If he starts at 9 o'clock the half-holiday must be given at 2 o'clock, and if he starts at 8 o'clock it must be given at 1 o'clock.

An employer may come down to his shop and suddenly see that an employee has done some very trifling service for the day on which the employee is to have his whole holiday.

I do not know if Deputy Norton fully appreciated that where certain classes of employees receive no half-holiday, they are given the right to two whole holidays in the month, two whole holidays which may be given in half-holidays if it suits the convenience of the employer.  In those classes of shops it is considered more convenient to provide for the giving of those holidays to those employees in that way, rather than to give them one half-holiday in each week.  That is the practice at present.  It is the existing law.  I have had no representations from anybody that it is desirable to change it, and consequently we are providing for its continuation here. An employee is entitled to two whole holidays in the month in lieu of the half-holidays&mdash;two whole holidays which may, at the discretion of the employer, be given in half-holidays.  I think it is desirable to leave that provision. It has worked fairly well.  I have no recollection of anybody making any representations in favour of the changing of it.

      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Where annual leave is allowed to a member of the staff of a shop, which is either a refreshment house or licensed premises, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the proprietor of such shop shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to have allowed such member one whole holiday in the month in which such annual leave commences;</P>
      <P>(b)  no part of a day falling within such annual leave shall be deemed to be a half-holiday for the purposes of sub-section (2) of this section.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is obvious.  It is to provide that the proprietor of any class of shop mentioned will be deemed to have allowed an assistant a whole holiday in the month in which that assistant's annual leave commences, and that no part of a day falling within such annual leave shall be deemed to be a half-holiday for the purposes of the section.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we will have to make clear what is precisely in mind. What is intended, of course, is that the holidays shall count for the purpose of calculating the number of hours worked in the week.  Otherwise, there would be no point in having a provision with regard to a holiday at all. I am not sure that it is necessary to have such a provision, but I think it is better to have it in order to prevent any doubt on the matter.  If a person gets a whole holiday or a half-holiday in the week, then the maximum number of hours that person should work must be regulated accordingly.</P>

      <P>If that is so, why put in the provision for 48 hours in the Bill at all, since everybody must get a half-holiday?  If a half-holiday is provided for, then it is only in connection with a whole holiday that such a provision should be made.</P>

      <P>Section 30, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 31.</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the proprietor of a shop does not allow a member of the staff of that shop a whole holiday on a Sunday in any week, such proprietor shall allow to him on some day (not being a day on which such proprietor allows him, in pursuance of any other provision of this Part of this Act, a whole holiday or a half-holiday) within that week&mdash;</P>

      <P>(1)  Except as regards shops in which all, or any, of the businesses mentioned in the Fourth Schedule to this Act are carried on, it shall not be lawful for the proprietor of a shop to permit a member of the staff of that shop to work on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The sub-section, as it stands, does not prohibit Sunday work, but it allows what one might call compensatory holidays to members of staffs of shops working on Sundays and so on.  The purpose of the amendment submitted by Deputy Norton is to prohibit Sunday work except in certain cases as set out in this Fourth Schedule.  I do not propose to read out the list of cases set out in that Schedule, as it is a very long list, but it includes shops the business of which is the sale by retail of intoxicating liquors, the sale of meals or refreshments for consumption on the premises, the sale of table waters, sweets, and so on, the sale of newspapers, periodicals or magazines, the sale of milk, cream, bread and so on, and the sale of motor, cycle or aircraft supplies.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 10, to delete the word &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This arises out of the same thing about compensatory days, and the idea is to change the number of hours mentioned from four hours to three hours and to entitle an employee, who works for three hours on a Sunday, to a compensatory holiday.  In certain towns in Ireland, such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick, certain assistants in licensed premises work from two to five o'clock and, according to the present wording of the section, they would not fulfil the conditions of the Bill so as to entitle them to a compensatory holiday.  The idea of this amendment is to bring them in and grant them a compensatory day in lieu of the hours worked on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment looks very innocent, but I am afraid it would effect a very great change in what is intended by the Bill.  As the Bill stands, an assistant who works three hours on a Sunday is entitled to a half-holiday, and if he works for more than four hours on a Sunday he is entitled to a whole holiday.  I am afraid I could not accept the amendment because <Col N="3230" /> it would effect changes which would be too much to contemplate, and, in fact, it is more than has been asked for.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 105, standing in Deputy Norton's name:</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The proprietor of a shop shall not permit any person not a member of the staff of that shop, who by virtue of this section may not be employed on a whole day or on a half-holiday (as the case may be) in a shop if he is a member of the staff of such last mentioned shop to do shop work for him on such day or half-holiday (as the case may be).</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the provisions of the Bill will not be availed of by an employee working in a shop other than the shop in which he is normally employed.  Its purpose is to ensure that that would be made impossible.  It may be said that there is already a provision dealing with that situation in the case of the annual holidays, but the purpose of the amendment is simply to provide that, in respect of hours of work, the same protection will be given as is given in the case of annual holidays, and that a person cannot be on duty in a shop other than the shop in which he is normally employed and thus evade the hours provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that that is necessary, and in any event I am not quite sure that it is the best way to do it.  I think that what the Deputy has in mind is that a person who is entitled to a holiday from one employer must not be permitted to spend that holiday in working for another employer. The way to deal with that situation would be to deal with it as we dealt with similar cases in the Conditions of Employment Act, and that is to make it illegal for the employee to take such employment.  Instead of making it illegal for the employer to employ the person concerned, I think <Col N="3231" /> the best thing would be to make it illegal for such a person to take that employment.  If you deal with it in the other way, it might prove to be unfair to the employer, who might not be aware of the circumstances.  The employee, however, knows what he is doing and, if he commits the offence, he should be punished.  The employer would always have the defence that he employed this person as an extra hand for a day or a half-day, not knowing that in doing so he was committing an offence, but the person who takes the employment does so knowing full well what he is doing.  That is the way we dealt with it under the Conditions of Employment Act&mdash;not merely making it illegal for the employer, but also making it illegal for the employee to take the work.  It was the only effective way to do it.  Of course, there is not so much danger of that kind of thing arising in this connection.  It might arise in some cases, but it is not very likely that, in any particular district, a shop assistant will get a holiday on a day when trade will be so considerable that other shop proprietors will be considering the employment of additional staff.  I think that the danger of that type of practice developing is remote.  Apparently, however, there is some danger&mdash;the danger I mention is confined to the licensed trade&mdash;and because of that danger I am prepared to consider a provision of that kind, but it would be a provision designed against the employee himself and would be designed to see that he took a holiday when he got it.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether he would also deal with the question of the voluntary worker as distinct from the person who takes employment.  I am referring to the person who gets, say, a half-day off, and who is a brother or a cousin and comes in and works in the other man's place for him. I was told some years ago, at a time when, in fact, every public-house in Dublin, even though the law allowed them to keep open until 11 o'clock, had to shut at 9 o'clock because the employees would not work after 9 o'clock. <Col N="3232" /> As the law then stood, every public-house could remain open till 11.  The law did not compel them to shut, but they had to shut at 9 o'clock because the employees all went home, or at least left the shop.  I was told that there were many houses, however, which were owned by individuals who kept open until 11 o'clock because they were working themselves.  Shop assistants from other shops, having left the place in which they were employed, used to come down and help their friends, not for money, but simply because they wanted to do a good turn to a friend.  That condition of affairs may never occur again, but at the same time I think the Minister ought to deal with voluntary as well as paid labour.</P>

      <P>Not quite.  I promised to look into the proposal of Deputy Dockrell that, instead of working 48 hours in the week, chemists' assistants might be limited to 96 hours in the fortnight.  That was probably designed to meet somewhat the point Deputy Keogh is now making.  I take it that Deputy Keogh has in mind the case that, where a chemist's assistant works on a Sunday, the chemist will be excluded from the obligation of giving the extra half-day in the week in lieu of the Sunday work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesKeogh" hpid="Dr. Myles Keogh Dr. Myles Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Myles Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is tantamount to that.  Speaking generally, this Bill is welcomed by me as a definite advance in the social legislation of this country. The public understand that the services of pharmaceutical chemists on Sundays and bank holidays are as important for the welfare of the sick as are the services of the medical profession. Many cases are found to be sufficiently serious to warrant the calling in of medical aid on Sundays and this is invariably accompanied by the need for obtaining medicines suitable for the particular malady.  It is essential, therefore, that facilities for the dispensing of such medicines should be made available.  The agreement between the association and the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks is considered very satisfactory. It provides that the assistants may be worked on alternate Sundays without receiving any special time off in lieu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pharmaceutical chemists are distinguished from chemists and druggists; they can only compound under the Pharmacy Act.  There are many in Dublin and throughout the country. There is usually the master man and his qualified assistant, his legally qualified assistant as distinct from the fully qualified man.  Let us assume that he does 120 hours' duty in the city or the country and he gets the alternate Sunday. The master will say to him, &ldquo;You will be on duty this Sunday and I will be on duty next Sunday.&rdquo;  If that man is to be let away for the whole day the master will have to get in another person.  It would be necessary for him to have someone qualified behind the <Col N="3234" /> counter.  If he needs a man he cannot ring up the labour exchange to get such a man.  There is no such thing here as a Pharmaceutical Assistants' Bureau, where a man can be obtained for the day at 10/- or 15/-, or whatever the rate may be.  If he has to pay that man it may not be a case of the cost of living going up, but of the cost of dying going up, because it may mean more for your prescriptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a terrible reflection on the chemists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesKeogh" hpid="Dr. Myles Keogh Dr. Myles Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Myles Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter I hold a brief something similar to that of Deputy Cole, inasmuch as he and I, out of the 138 Deputies here, find ourselves the only registered pharmaceutical chemists, though, fortunately or unfortunately, we are not engaged in the shop business.  It is the public we have in mind in connection with this thing.  It is possible that a man might want a little digitalis or some of the other things that are essential in the medical profession.  The shops engaged in this business are mostly lock-up shops and it is possible that a man would sooner close up the shop, as it might be more convenient from a business point of view or as an economic proposition.  For instance, the chemist might prefer to shut up the shop and give his man the day off. I am not now touching the side of the business dealing with the sale of hairbrushes, lipstick or port wine; I am not entering into that portion of the business.  I have more in mind prescriptions and things of that sort.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that there are certain privileges given to students who desire to become pharmaceutical chemists.  If they put in a certain number of years in the chemists' shops they are let off for lectures.  The work is different to that of the man who has to tot up figures or cut linen behind a counter.  Perhaps the Minister could see his way to accept the amendment I have tabled.  The Minister knows all about this, and so do the Labour Party. I am perfectly satisfied that the combination of both makes one too many for me.  I think they ought to admit that the chemist should get a look in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Keogh has gone somewhat outside the terms of his amendment.  We think that if the Bill becomes law in its present form it will seriously impair the essential public service which the Pharmaceutical Society renders.  Pharmacy is part of the medical and health service and if you restrict its practice you might as well restrict the medical profession altogether.  It would be impossible, notwithstanding the facilities of the tabloid concerns with which we are so much acquainted now&mdash;it would be impossible, even with the assistance of those combinations, for a medical man to carry on.  I have known cases in the country when we were called up in the middle of the night to telephone for serum, which it would be impossible for the medical man to carry, because these things must be kept fresh.  If we restrict altogether the members of the Pharmaceutical Society or restrict interference with them it would be better.  If this Bill is passed as it stands it will be a very serious matter not only for pharmaceutical chemists but for the general public.  I think it will be a relief to many pharmaceutical chemists who are called to act on various emergencies. It would be a serious inconvenience and loss to the public at large for people will not be able to get their requirements.  They cannot get medicines in unexpected cases.  I think this Bill should not interfere at all with the qualified pharmaceutical chemists who should be exempted from it altogether irrespective of the sort of work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Keogh has said, the pharmaceutical assistants are different altogether from the ordinary shop assistants.  To begin with, the pharmaceutical chemist must keep a qualified assistant.  If he leaves his place of business he must leave a qualified man behind him.  Now, if these restrictions are put on, what will happen? The qualified man will not be employed.  It would be very difficult for such men then to get employment and there will be a big addition of a new class of man on your unemployed list.  Deputy Keogh said that although the pharmaceutical chemist has certain grievances he has not nearly as much <Col N="3236" /> now as in the old days when he had to work from 8 in the morning until 11 at night.  Even after leaving the shop he had to make up his books and then perhaps read up for an examination that was coming off.  These days are now past.  The pharmaceutical assistant agrees that the services now required of him are moderate and agreeable. A young man going in for that business has a long course.  Sometimes he has to board and lodge away from home; he has lectures to take out.  He has to get a certain amount of time in which to do that and that is not allowed for in the Bill.  He has to attend those lectures during the day and sometimes during the evening.</P>

The union have agreed to terms that are quite reasonable.  If the Bill is to remain as it is, it will mean that the services performed by members of the Pharmaceutical Society will be very seriously impaired. I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  At the time when the Juries Bill was going through the House we had some negotiations with the late Kevin O'Higgins.  We wanted the Pharmaceutical Society exempted, and eventually the Minister for Justice reconsidered the matter and exempted them.  If the Minister now realises the responsibility he is taking on, he will, after consideration, see that pharmaceutical chemists are exempted from this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to pharmaceutical chemists opening on Sunday to carry on business purely and simply as pharmaceutical chemists.  We are quite aware of what it costs to become a qualified chemist. We know the chemist has to attend lectures, and we know the amount of money that has to be spent on his education.  We do not know that the chemist or his assistant has to go to the university and pass examinations in order that he may be qualified to <Col N="3237" /> sell white-wash brushes, face powder, sheep dip, or things of that sort.  That is our difficulty.  If a chemist would open on Sunday and confine his activities purely and simply to selling the things within his own line, there would be no objection.  But there is a very strong objection to their doing what we all know they have been doing in the past ten years&mdash;transgressing into selling other things, and opening their premises on Sundays to sell them. Their sales activities extend now to cameras, face powders, sheep dip, and in fact it is difficult to say what particular article of merchandise is immune from the activities of the chemist.  We would have no objection if they confined themselves to selling medicines and drugs.  Everybody with a sick head on a Sunday morning should be entitled to go into a chemist's shop to get something to cure it; but nobody wants to buy white-wash brushes, sheep dip, or face powders on a Sunday. I do not know why they should be permitted any exemption for selling these things.</P>

We are dealing with the Bill that is limiting the hours of work for shop assistants, and if shop assistants in the drug trade are working 14 hours a day, and half the night as well, it seems to me that that is the best possible case for bringing them under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that the chemist cannot, by ringing up the exchange, get another man.  The rule that generally obtains is that the chemist has one assistant.  The chemist himself manages to put in some hours one Sunday and his assistant does it the following Sunday.  The Bill will work in such a way that the chemist, because of an hour or two on Sunday, must have a third man.  If that is so, then the cost of dying will go up.</P>

      <P>I think the chemists have some sort of a case to argue, but in the present instance both Deputies Cole and Keogh have pressed the case so unduly that they would prejudice anyone against their proposal.  The only question here is whether the existing agreement between the chemist and his assistants, which provides for the assistant working two hours on alternative Sundays, should be allowed unchanged or whether the previous Bill should operate which necessitated giving half a day during the week to the assistant employed on Sunday. That is all.  What it has to do with the cost of dying or this sudden demand for serum for which special trains have to be chartered and dispatched is a thing I cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person gets sick at 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning after this Bill is passed, he would be in the same position as at present. The voluntary arrangement made by the chemists and their assistants has nothing to do with the Bill.  There is no provision in the Bill requiring the chemist to close at any time.  All the Bill does require is that the 48-hour week should operate, and that certain provisions as to half-holidays, restrictions upon Sunday work and leave should apply.  The point made by Deputies Cole and Keogh is that the <Col N="3239" /> present arrangement with pharmaceutical chemists who work on Sundays for two hours and then only on alternate Sundays, subject to the preservation of a 48-hour week, should be sufficient without imposing upon the chemist this further liability of giving a half-day as compensation for the two hours on the Sunday.  The amendment is to exempt them from this provision entirely, irrespective of what changes may take place in the practice or what the practice may be in particular parts of the country.  There is no legal validity behind the agreement between chemists and their assistants in Dublin, and I do not know that that agreement applies nationally.</P>

That, however, is different from what the Deputy's amendment proposes, and it is, I think, in fact, the practice.  If that will meet the point of the chemists, then their point is met, but I got the impression that, upon a slender basis, they have been trying to build a case for exemption from the Bill as a whole.  They cannot get that, nor have they made any case for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 108 on behalf of Deputy Lawlor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 50, to delete the word &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;fourteen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under Section 33, employees in special-trade shops are entitled to 14 days' annual leave, but employees in non-special-trade shops, such as hardware shops, are entitled only to 6 days' leave. The purpose of this amendment is to secure that there will be no distinction between special-trade shops and non-special-trade shops as regards annual leave&mdash;in other words, that the employee in hardware premises should get the same leave as an employee in licensed premises.  I do not think that any case can be made against that proposal.  In recent times, arrangements have been arrived at between employers and trade unions with the result that, in a great many trades in Dublin and other cities and towns, employees are granted 12 days' leave per annum, plus Sundays and bank holidays when they occur within that period.  The purpose of this amendment is simply to give legislative sanction to what has already been agreed upon by trade unions with decent employers in Dublin and elsewhere.  It is rather unfair to penalise decent employers who have agreed with trade unions to grant their employees 14 days' leave per annum by allowing other employers who are not quite as decent to get away with a leave allowance of six days per annum.  This amendment will be pressed by the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the proposal for 14 days' leave in these cases.  The reason for the difference between special-trade shops and non-special-trade shops is that employees in special-trade shops are <Col N="3244" /> not given the right to six holidays on public holidays during the year.</P>
      <P>The employees in the non-special-trade shops get six public holidays with pay, and, in addition, six consecutive days' holiday with pay.  The employees in special-trade shops do not get the six public holidays, but, as compensation, their annual holiday period is fixed at 14 consecutive days. They are, therefore, similarly situated and there is no necessity to amend the section to secure for one section terms as good as those given to another. The intention is to ensure that, and it is believed that the arrangement here does in fact provide that the employees in both classes of shops have, in essence, the same provision made for them.  We are, however, here providing for a minimum statutory provision in respect of annual holidays for shop workers.  We set out that the minimum holidays, other than the annual holidays, shall be six consecutive days. That is the same provision as was made for industrial workers under the Act of 1936.  It is, of course, not so framed as to preclude the possibility of an employer giving more holidays, or entering into an agreement with an organisation of workers to provide a longer period of holidays.  We are setting out here what the legal minimum will be and I do not think it is desirable at this stage to fix the legal minimum beyond six consecutive days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGowan mentioned trade union agreements providing for longer holidays.  There may be such, but there are not very many of them.  I have no distinct recollection of ever having seen an agreement of that kind providing for longer than six days. Except in special cases, such as the special-trade shops which I mentioned here, the great majority of the trade union agreements provide for six days. In any event, I think we should be satisfied at this stage with raising the legal requirement to that level.  It will ensure for a very large number of workers in the distributive trades an annual holiday this year for the first time, and I do not think we should try to push that too far.  I know, of course, that if I had brought in a proposal to give workers 14 days' holidays, <Col N="3245" /> the Labour Party would have proposed 21 days or 28 days.  They had to raise my ante in any event, but in this particular case, I am quite serious in my belief that it would be unwise to push this legislation too far or too rapidly.  If we can succeed in having this idea of annual paid holidays generally applied and enforced on the basis of six consecutive days, we shall have done as much as we should attempt to do at this stage. There is, of course, no limit being fixed in respect of the future, no barrier being placed against giving longer holidays, or against trade unions seeking agreements for longer holidays, but we are not proposing to make the statutory provision more than that at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is quite justified in saying that if the Bill provided 14 days, the Labour Party would have suggested 21 and so on.  The fact of the matter is that in putting down this amendment we had in mind that the prevailing practice for shop and office employment is a fortnight's holiday each year.  I think the Minister will recognise that that is a very common practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means when he speaks of the prevailing practice, but if he determines that in relation to the numbers of persons employed, I should say that the prevailing practice is to give no holidays at all.  In certain of the larger shops, they do give more than a fortnight's holidays, but only in certain shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the purpose of legislation of this kind is to bring bad employments up to the level of reasonably good employments, and while there are people engaged in shop work who get more than a fortnight's holidays in the year, it is a very common practice, and certainly the prevailing practice in the decent employments in the towns and cities, for assistants to get a fortnight's holiday with pay, and I think the Minister might very well accept that principle and ensure that every shop employee will get a fortnight's holiday.  A fortnight <Col N="3246" /> is not a long period and it is a very common thing in shops and offices for workers to get a fortnight's holiday each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sufficient to make the legal minimum requirement.  I am not going to express an opinion as to what holidays a shop assistant requires. What we are doing here, and I emphasise it again, is fixing the legal minimum, and not determining what the practice will be in any particular trade or part of the country, and I am satisfied that we should not at present attempt to fix the legal minimum higher than six consecutive days, plus, of course, the six annual holidays.</P>

    <P>That is all right in the larger businesses where he is transferred from one type of business to another; but take the case of, say, a confectioner <Col N="3247" /> in the suburbs or country town, who puts out a table with a few bottles of lemonade on it on a bank holiday. Will that bring a person into the special class?  I think the Minister might very well look into some of the ramifications of this section in respect of some of the smaller general shops. Would a confectioner have to keep time-sheets for his assistants in order to say what people might be engaged on this type of special trade?  I should like the Minister to look into that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>His employment must be continuous for a year, in any event. If it is very casual, or intermittent, or of a very short duration, I think it is in the interests of the proprietor to ensure that the mixture of employment does not take place at all.  I think that could be easily arranged. It is necessary to make some provision, and I think the best provision to make is to ensure that if a person can come in under one head or the other, he gets the best conditions of either. If you do not provide that, you must provide something else, and the only alternative is that he shall get the worst.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, in the <Col N="3248" /> name of Deputy Norton, is to provide that the leave period will be during the summer.  As the Bill stands the employer will select the period at which the annual leave will be given.  It may be argued, if this amendment was inserted in the Bill, and even if there was an agreement between the employer and the employee for a period outside the summer period, that the summer period would still have to be adhered to.  That objection might be overcome by a slight alteration.  There is a great deal to be said for not leaving it entirely to the employer to choose the leave period.  Annual holidays are normally taken in the summer, and if they are not taken then they lose a good deal of the advantage to be derived from them.  I suggest that the Minister should either accept this amendment, or indicate that he will be prepared to insert some such amendment at another stage, something that would provide that the normal leave period would be in the summer, and that the employer would not be permitted to give leave at a time when it would not be beneficial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the amendment but, in practice, it would be difficult to provide for it.  The proprietors of large shops, in which a number of workers are engaged, will, in fact, have to spread the holidays over a longer period than that contemplated in the amendment, just as in the public service at the present time civil servants are, in many cases, required to take their period of leave late in the winter or early in the year.  I think that is unavoidable.  In the great majority of cases the proprietors of shops will endeavour to meet the wishes of assistants.  It is very rarely that cases will arise where assistants will be compelled to take their holidays at utterly unsuitable times, but, having regard to the circumstances of cases that may arise, it is necessary to ensure that holidays should be taken at the discretion of the employers.  I do not think that it would be wise to provide for the exclusion of any period of the year whether with or without the consent of employers.  We had discussions <Col N="3249" /> about this on the Act of 1936, and the question was raised on a number of occasions since by different organisations of workers and other persons and, in every case, when I looked into the matter I came to the conclusion that it was not possible to intervene.  I know of many cases where agreements were made with employers for the drawing up and the carrying out of a scheme of holidays designed to meet the convenience both of employers and workers.  In fact, I think that was the normal practice.  In trades of a special kind or of a seasonal character it was found impracticable to give the employees holidays in the summer months, and they had to be satisfied to get them at other periods of the year. Quite possibly the same question will arise now, and that the one period of the year when the services of employees would be fully occupied would be the period that the rest of us ordinarily regard as the holiday period.  In such cases, presumably, the giving of holidays would take place at other periods. I have sympathy with the idea behind the amendment, but I think it is impossible to give practical effect to it.</P>

      <P>One aspect of this question has not been dealt with.  If this amendment were passed, would its provisions be mandatory?  I think employers try to give their employees holidays at a period that suits them, spread over a certain period.  Of course <Col N="3250" /> the months of June, July, August and September may be the busiest months of the year and accordingly that period is altogether too short.  An English poet wrote: &ldquo;Oh to be in England now that April is here,&rdquo; but apparently the Labour Party do not think that the ideal time for a holiday.  In any event, I do not think the holidays could be squeezed into that period.</P>

      <P>I would be very reluctant to do so.  I think it has to be left to negotiation in each case. That might be the only period of the year when the services of employees would be fully occupied.  I do not know if any great difficulty arose in that regard under the 1936 Act.  In some cases there was adjustment.  I think you must leave the period of holidays to the employers.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Norton, I move amendment No. 120:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In pages 25 and 26, to delete sub-sections (6), (7), (8) and (9) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 13 of the Shops Act, 1912, as modified by Section 21 of that Act, it shall be the duty of the sanitary authority for every district, as part of their duties under the Public Health Acts, to enforce the provisions of this Part of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the section that makes provision with regard to sanitary or other arrangements in shops.  Sub-section (1) requires that suitable and sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided and maintained.  There is another provision which gives the local sanitary authority the right to make certain exemptions and sets out the conditions which must be complied with before they can do that.  The object of the amendment is to secure that the local sanitary authority shall not have this power, as it is considered that in a good many instances the local board <Col N="3255" /> exercising the authority would be composed of shopkeepers, and, therefore, the giving of this power to local sanitary authorities is not to be commended. In Section 49 &ldquo;the expression &lsquo;suitable and sufficient&rsquo; means in relation to any shop or part of a shop suitable and sufficient having regard to the circumstances and conditions affecting that shop or part&rdquo;.  I submit that that definition sufficiently protects the proprietor of a shop.  I think it will be agreed that in a good many parts of the country, probably not intentionally but perhaps through neglect, the requirements contemplated in this section have been allowed to get into a deplorable state, with the result that shop assistants in many places are living under intolerable conditions. If you leave this power of exemption with the local bodies they will be subject to local influences and so on, and as members of boards are human the result will be that the intention of the Bill will not be carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the sanitary authorities may grant an exemption from the provisions regarding sanitary arrangements only where they are satisfied that alternative accommodation and suitable and sufficient washing facilities are otherwise conveniently available.  That is on the face of it a reasonable provision.  I think what the Deputy has in mind is that sanitary authorities are not fulfilling their duties properly.  That, however, is a somewhat different matter.  So far as this part of the Bill is concerned, we must set out reasonable requirements, set out what the law is, see that the law is reasonable, and then subsequently there arises the question of seeing that the law is enforced.  It is reasonable, in my opinion, to ensure that these requirements as to the sanitary arrangements in the Bill may be met in certain cases where the sanitary authority is prepared to grant exemption when satisfied that alternative arrangements and suitable and adequate facilities exist, and I would not be prepared to change the law in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disposed to agree that it may <Col N="3256" /> be necessary to consider the general question of enforcement, and I am quite prepared to bring that matter to the notice of the Department of Local Government, which is the Department directly concerned, and ensure that they will impress upon local sanitary authorities the desirability of carrying out properly their duties in respect of these Acts.  I do not think, however, that we should go further than to set out in the Acts themselves what we regard as a reasonable provision, and not allow ourselves to be provoked, by the failure of certain authorities to do their duty, to make the law appear on the face of it unreasonable.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that in sub-sections (6) and (7) provision should be made for appeal against the refusal of a sanitary authority to make the original order.  It seems to be a logical conclusion from the other provision.  If you can appeal against the cancellation of an order, you should be able to appeal against refusal to make the original order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to read the question and the reply to it, as the Minister did not read his reply, which <Col N="3259" /> was afterwards circulated.  The question was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the Land Commission have acquired from Mrs. Connolly, Flat House, Dunboyne, County Meath, the Mabestown farm, which was subject to a fee farm rent, and if he will state (a) the price paid Mrs. Connolly for the holding, and what deductions, if any, were made from such moneys; (b) the price paid to the landlord; (c) the names of the persons to whom the land was allotted, and the amount of the annuity fixed for each allotment; (d) the number of houses, if any, erected in connection with the sub-division, and the cost of construction of such houses; (e) the cost of any fences built, and any other costs arising out of the distribution of the lands; (f) the total all-in cost to the Land Commission of the acquisition and development of the lands for the allottees; and (g) the loss or profit made by the Land Commission in the acquisition and distribution of the lands.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply the Minister stated that the purchase price of the estate was £2,500, to which was added in aid of costs, £100, making a total of £2,600. The funds were allocated by the judicial commissioner as follows:&mdash;For rates and costs relating thereto, £44; for redemption of fee farm rent of £148 15s. 2d., £2,200&mdash;that is what the landlord got; for arrears of above rent, including income tax and costs relating thereto, £274; costs of sale were £77. The balance of the purchase money unallocated, which it is proposed to give to this tenant of 205 acres of the best land in Meath, is £5.  It is not finally known whether she will get even that sum.  There you have this splendid farm of land taken from this woman, and all she is to receive, after these various deductions, is £5.  The lands were allotted to a number of allottees, whose names I need not specify, but the total of their unrevised annuities amounts to £129 13s. 10d.  It is stated that the annual sums, representing the annuities of the various allottees, are subject to the usual <Col N="3260" /> reductions of 50 per cent. under the Land Act of 1933.  The Land Commission sanctioned the erection of five dwelling houses with out-offices on new holdings created on the allotment of the land and a contract has been placed for their erection at a cost of £1,490 of which £250 represents advances repayable by allottees.  The Land Commission sanctioned sums of £178 for fencing, £367 for roads and £14 for a pump in connection with the allotment of the land.  The resale price of the land apart from improvements expenditure was, I am informed by the Minister, less by £20 than the purchase price.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister know that this woman's husband bought this farm in 1914, pre-war, for £1,600, that he worked it well and spent a lot of money on improvements?  During the War he was offered £10,000 for it.  On his death, he left it to his wife conditional on her paying certain debts.  After her husband's death, in 1925, she put it up for public auction and she refused an offer of £3,000 for it.  The Revenue Commissioners subsequently made her pay death duties on a valuation of £3,500.  Having failed to sell the farm, she approached the Land Commission with a view to having the holding purchased under the Land Act of 1933. The place was then visited by inspectors. She was under the impression that the visit was in connection with her application to have the farm purchased. Later, she was informed that the Land Commission proposed to acquire the holding for sub-division. Finally, the land was taken from her and so far she has got no compensation whatsoever.  The lands were divided and evidently the only compensation which she is to receive is the £5 which is unallocated, according to the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>The only description which I can apply to this whole proceeding is deliberate confiscation.  I am sure that members of this House never intended, when the Land Act of 1933 was being passed through the House, that it should operate to the detriment of any citizen in this way or never thought that any citizen would be treated in this way, that a farm of 205 acres of the best land in County Meath would be taken from any person for the miser <Col N="3261" /> able sum of £5.  The Minister will notice that the rent was £148 15s. fee farm grant and that the new rentals, unrevised, are £120, so that the landlord received practically 20 years' purchase of what the Land Commission now considers a fair rent, or if the Minister likes, 15 years of the rack rent.  In other words, the Land Commission can put out the tenant, the landlord gets 20 years' purchase and this poor woman gets £5.  I want to know definitely from the Minister whether anything is going to be done for this woman.  There is no use in telling me or telling this House that this is the law.  If it is the law, it is bad law and the Minister would not stand for it, if it were his own mother's property that was involved. I would ask the Minister to go into this case and to see that this woman receives just compensation for the property taken from her, a farm of 205 acres of the best land in County Meath. I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this case and to see that justice is done to this woman.</P>

      <P>As one of the Deputies whose names are appended to this question, I wish to verify everything that has been said by my colleague in connection with this case.  It is, no doubt, the hardest case brought before this House since land division started.  Here is a widow who had plenty of sorrow through life and who should have the sympathy of an Irish Government in her advancing years. She is to-day the victim of harsh laws, unable to defend herself.  Her husband bought this farm in 1914 and spent large sums in improvements.  He was offered £10,000 during the War for the farm and after his death his widow was offered £3,000.  It is difficult to understand what prompted the Land Commission authorities to act in such a barbarous manner.  When the names of the allottees are examined, it is found that one is a Dublin businessman who, so far as I know, has no connection with the district and he does not even propose to reside on the holding. The only qualification he has, so far as I can ascertain, is that he is a brother, or at any rate a relative, of <Col N="3262" /> an ex-Deputy of the Government Party.  This lady has only a life interest in her present holding, which is heavily in debt at the moment.  She had hoped to fix up her nephew in the Mabestown farm.  When that failed, she asked the Land Commission to give her nephew a holding on the estate but it seems that request was refused.  He was a man who supplied milk to the Dublin market and Mrs. Connolly has now to keep his cows for him on her farm.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government what they intend doing in this case.  Are they going to do the dirty work for which we cursed Cromwell in days gone by? This woman is now left with a load of debt which she can never clear off. Her farm was taken from her and she has not received one penny compensation. I would ask the Minister why she was not offered an alternative holding if this holding was required for congestion.  I live in County Meath and I am quite satisfied that if there was congestion in that area there are tens of thousands of acres between Dunboyne and the Hill of Tara, large ranches, which could have been divided for the relief of congestion.  The very fact that the present Government can bring migrants into County Meath from other parts of the country proves that there is no congestion in that county. I would ask the Minister to give this case his earnest and serious consideration. Large land holders in this same area were allowed to sell their farms about the same time this farm was taken over.  I want to ask the Minister why they were allowed to sell their farms and she was not.  They could sell these farms by public auction, and the Land Commission did not bother to know whether they sold them or not. It is a funny state of affairs to see the landlord in this case getting every penny, while the unfortunate tenant gets practically nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those opposed to land division.  In fact, I have fought for the last 20 years to get the ranch land of Meath divided amongst the people and to establish more people on the land.  I stand for the same policy to-day, but I do not stand for doing Cromwell's work in 1938.  If it is necessary <Col N="3263" /> that the Land Bill should be amended, to prevent cases of this kind occurring, I hope it will be amended immediately, because it is not an isolated case.  I am going to bring up an identical case&mdash;in fact, it is one of more severe hardship&mdash;which is pending in Meath.  I would ask the Minister to stay his hand.  In fact, I will mention to him at a later date the farm to which I refer, so that he will stay the Land Commission from doing this injustice to those unfortunate people. I know the Minister is one of those good-hearted Irishmen, and that when he is told about a grievance he will certainly do his best to rectify it.  I would ask him in God's name to give this lady some consideration, and not to send her into her grave with a pile of debt around her neck.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I should like to say that I do not know whether the procedure which the Land Commission adopted in this case is down in any section of any Act. I think it is more a policy than anything else, and that that policy is being pursued regardless altogether of the right of a tenant on the holding.  Tenant right has been established in this country for many years, and this Government by their operations seem to be ignoring that tenant right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will not go into it further.  When the Government set out in this case to do State work, in the interests of the State, they did it at the expense of the individual and not at the expense of the State.  If the State in their wisdom&mdash;I have no objection to their doing it&mdash;decide that certain land should be acquired, they ought to do it at the expense of the State and pay the people who occupy the land the market value of it.  It is very easy to be generous at the expense of the individual.  This individual or any individual in a similar position is denied the rights of citizenship.  She is denied her rights under the Constitution. I want the Minister to look at <Col N="3264" /> that aspect of the policy, before pursuing it in this direction or any other direction.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to one matter which I forgot to mention. Is the Minister aware that this woman who took this farm was told by her husband to pay certain debts?  Those debts have now been transferred to the farm on which she is at present, and she has only a life interest in the farm. I do not think it is a big farm, and I am told that the transfer of those debts leaves her with no income whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of the last matter to which the Deputy has referred. This farm may have been well worked in years gone by&mdash;I do not know anything about that&mdash;but when the Land Commission went to inspect the farm they found it was very much neglected. It was non-residential; it was set in grazing.  No employment was given, except to the herd.  The drains were overgrown with weeds, and there had been no manuring and no tillage done. I think that will be admitted.  The owner objected to the acquisition. The objection was disallowed on the grounds that the farm was not being run on proper lines of husbandry; that it was non-residential; and that that being the case, the Land Commission were entitled to come in and take the farm.  There was an objection raised in regard to price.  The Land Commission fixed a figure of £2,192, and that was appealed against.  The Appeal Tribunal raised that amount to £2,500, and costs were allowed to the owner of the farm.  As far as the Land Commission has been able to find out, the lady was making practically nothing out of that farm.  The outgoings were about equal to the rent she was getting from lettings.  As far as they could discover, she was making practically nothing at all.  The land was acquired and divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is a fact that a Dublin businessman was given some of the land.  I should be very much surprised to hear that that was so, but as I had no intimation that such a point would be made, of course <Col N="3265" /> I cannot answer it.  As Deputies are aware, the allocation of land is not a matter for me.  I will inquire into it to find out whether there is any truth in that statement, but it is the first I have heard of it.  The land was given to a number of people.  I might mention the reason why I did not read out the reply yesterday. Deputy Fagan himself will admit that it was a very long and detailed answer, and I do not think he could have done himself justice in regard to it unless he had an opportunity to study it. Deputy Dillon of course, as usual, suggested that I was trying to suppress it.  I was not trying to suppress anything. The land was divided amongst 14 allottees.  Four of those were small holders in the vicinity.  They had their holdings enlarged.  The herd was given a holding.  Five landless men were provided with holdings, and in addition four accommodation plots were supplied to cottiers in the district. I think that was making good use of land which had been very much neglected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say how the landlord got the land, or how any other landlord got it. What I do know is that, if that land had been worked in the manner in which Deputy Fagan tells me it was <Col N="3266" /> worked by the lady's husband, the Land Commission would not have interfered with it.  They found it neglected, the drains overgrown with weeds, no manuring, no tillage, and set at a price which scarcely gave any return.  The actual loss to the lady in question, therefore, must have been very little.  She had been getting very little out of it for years past.  We consider it is bad policy to have big farms of that kind neglected in that way when there are people in the neighbourhood anxious and willing to work the land if they can get it.  The land was divided.  I am very sorry that the lady should be put in that position, but there was no way out of it.  If the land had been properly worked it would not have been interfered with.  I am also given to understand that this lady has no children, and she has at present other lands comprising 202 acres, the valuation of which is about £186.</P>

      <P>She may be up to her eyes in debt; I am not aware of that. What I do know is that she still has 202 acres.  As I say, she has no children, and, judging by the way the farm had been worked, I do not think there is very much hardship.  If the land had been properly worked it would not have been interfered with at all, but we do not like to see farms going derelict like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Land Commission in future not take into account that, in a case where the husband dies, the widow may be in bad circumstances for a few years?  While I agree that if land is not properly worked it should be divided, I think the Land Commission should have considered the fact that this lady's husband died recently, and that it was a special case.  I think the Land Commission should devise some machinery whereby the landlord would not get all, while the poor tenant who has been working all his lifetime gets nothing.  The machinery should be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this farm thoroughly, and while in the last few years it may not have been worked as it should be worked, it has to be considered that after her husband's death this lady was involved in a long and costly lawsuit which took practically every penny from her.  Were it not for that, this would be a model farm.  She also lost £500 fighting the case at the time the Land Commission took it over.  Her husband was one of the most model farmers in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been let for about five years, because the husband has been dead for seven or eight years.  At the same time, there was a large farm in the same area which should have been divided, but it was allowed to go for sale by public auction while the Land Commission came down and took this lady's farm.  If she were allowed to sell that farm by public auction, surely she would have some money out of it to-day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will inquire into such cases, but I must say that where farms are in that condition, not worked, non-residential, and generally neglected, the Land Commission is going to acquire them and divide them amongst the small people in the district who are willing to work the land properly, and give what they consider a fair price for such farms.  Naturally, I should like that special consideration should be given to the case of widows, but where land is not worked and neglected, as I have said, the Land Commission is going to acquire such land and divide it.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like to make.  I thoroughly agree that, if lands are neglected, they should be acquired and divided amongst those who will work the lands, but does the Minister say that the fact that lands were neglected under such circumstances as have been submitted by the two Deputies here justify what is nothing else but absolute confiscation such as has occurred in this case? Suppose that these lands were put up for public auction, surely there should be some value to be got out of them? Even if they had been neglected for the last ten years, still, at public auction, there should be some value for them and in cases like that, even though there may be every justification for the Land Commission to take over the lands, surely it is not right that the immediate tenant should be left penniless while the landlord gets 99 per cent. of the amount fixed by the Land Commission. I say that that is point-blank confiscation by the Land Commission, and nothing else.</P>
