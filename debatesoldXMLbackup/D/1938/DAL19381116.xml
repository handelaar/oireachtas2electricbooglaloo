      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in view of the fact that the provisions in regard to rates remission on new houses expired on 1st October last and a considerable volume of work has been held up, he will state whether he intends to continue these provisions; and, if so, when proposals for legislation will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to extend the remission of rates on new dwellings completed before October, 1941.  I hope to introduce a Bill to implement this at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I may say that I am very pleased to hear what he has said, but does he realise that all transactions in houses are held up pending the introduction of this measure?  I suppose there are some hundreds of houses stopped, and the employment that would be given on their construction is stopped also, and in the circumstances I am sure the Minister realises the urgency of making an official pronouncement so that people may know where they stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite see the point of the Deputy's statement that the buildings were held up.  They need not be held up.  People were told before, and they will be told again, that it is intended to have the remission of rates provision, contained in the Local Government Act, extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the building need not be held up, but the position up to to-day has been that no purchaser would buy a house without knowing where he stood as regards the remission of rates and no builder would commence a house without some idea of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider issuing a statement from the Department intimating that houses now in course of erection will be covered by the remission of rates, pending the passing of the necessary legislation?  I think that what Deputy Dockrell says is quite true.  Builders are uncertain as to whether a remission will apply to houses now being erected and purchasers are reluctant to enter into arrangements for the purchase of houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether it is his intention to appoint a representative committee to inquire into the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, and to consider how far it is practicable to increase the cash benefits payable under these Acts, and also to provide additional non-cash benefits for insured persons and their dependents; and, if so, when the appointment will be announced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government actuary is engaged on the preparation of a report on sickness experience in Éire, based on material supplied by <Col N="644" /> the Unified Society and by the Department.  That report is expected early in the New Year and it will then be necessary to investigate what changes are desirable in the financial structure of the scheme.  In making that investigation consideration will be given to the matters which are the subject of the question under reply.  It is clear that it will not be practicable to increase the cash benefits or to provide the other benefits referred to without a corresponding increase in the rate of contribution.</P>
      <P>I cannot yet say whether it will be necessary to refer the matter for consideration by a representative committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the acute unemployment existing amongst the employees of woollen mills due to shortage of orders; if his attention has been directed to the correspondence from woollen mill workers published in the Press in which it was alleged that over 60 per cent. of the trade in woollen cloth is supplied from British sources; if in recent weeks he increased the import quota for British woollen cloths, and if he will state what steps have been taken to ensure that foreign cloth of a description similar to that manufactured by the Irish mills will not be imported under the quota arrangements; and also if, having regard to the present position of the woollen industry, he will consider restricting the importation of woollen cloths to those materials that are not normally manufactured in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that at the present time there is acute unemployment in the woollen and worsted industry.  I have seen the Press correspondence referred to by the Deputy. The quantity of woollen and worsted woven tissues which will be permitted to be imported under licence in the quota period from the 1st November, 1938, to the 31st May, 1939, is the same as that which was permitted to be imported in the six-monthly quota <Col N="645" /> period ended on the 31st October, 1938.  As regards the latter part of the question, I have endeavoured to achieve what the Deputy proposes by granting licences only, save in the most exceptional circumstances, for cloths costing less than 3/6 per square yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that there are certain importers of that cloth that he gave a licence for, who have never used any Irish manufactured cloth in their articles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that people who have previously given in orders before the month of October have not yet given any orders?  I understand the idea is that they will ask for a certain supply when the period is approaching and then they will not be able to get these supplies and they hope to get a licence to import a certain amount of cloth.  Is that possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible, but the quota has now been fixed for the period and, while I would not like to bind myself to increase the quota, I think it could be assumed that there will be no increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister investigate the point raised by Deputy Hurley, that people who never used Irish cloth are actually getting a large quota?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of the quota is prescribed by law.  There is very little discretion given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The total quota is fixed and must be distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that some of those importers have never used Irish manufactured cloth in their establishments&mdash;I am speaking now of the ready-made clothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person is entitled to be registered on the register of <Col N="646" /> importers.  It does not follow that any person will get a quota for any quantity. In the distribution of the quotas regard is given to the extent to which the importer was previously engaged in the business of importing or distributing cloth and, while it is theoretically possible that people who have never purchased Irish cloth may be given a licence to import cloth, I should say it is most improbable, or that the quantity of cloth allowed would be in any sense considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take any steps to see that a certain proportion of Irish manufactured cloth will be used in those establishments that are making ready-made clothing before they get a licence to import foreign material?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the quota based on what these firms did import in 1934? Is the Minister aware that so far as my information goes certain manufacturers are not using any Irish cloth because of the fact that their quota of imported cloths is sufficient for their needs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he granted any concessions, facilities or inducements to the promoters responsible for the establishment of a new cloth factory in Ballina, and, if so, what was their nature; whether he can state the nationality and country of origin of the promoters of this concern; whether before authorising the establishment of the mill in question, he caused an inquiry to be held into the closing down of the woollen mill at Sallybrook, County Cork, and, if so, what was the result of the inquiry; and whether, if no inquiry was made, he will take steps to institute one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new plant at Ballina will engage in the manufacture of types of cloths not at present made in this country and <Col N="647" /> known in the trade as shoddy.  At present all the cloths of this type required by clothing manufacturers are imported and the Ballina plant, it is hoped, will gradually supply the market in respect of these cheaper types of cloth.  No special concession or inducements other than the facilities normally given to new industries are being granted to the promoters in this case.  The promoters, who are of Czechoslovak nationality, are associated with certain Irish nationals in the creation of a new Irish company to carry on this business.  I am fully acquainted with the circumstances of the closing down of the mill at Sallybrook, which was a small blanket mill employing under 50 workers.  The Ballina plant will employ ultimately more than 500 workers, so that the Deputy's suggestion in respect of Sallybrook seems impracticable. In any event, the promoters decided on Ballina as a site for the new industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, is it a fact that the Galway woollen mill was making material similar to that manufactured at Ballina?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that allegations have been made by woollen mill workers that the existing quota arrangements relating to the importation of woollen cloth are being evaded and that cloth has been imported outside the descriptions authorised in the permit; and whether he will consider making regulations requiring proprietors of ready-made clothing factories to whom permits to import foreign cloth are granted to use a specified percentage of Irish-made materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the quota restrictions in respect of certain woollen cloths are being evaded.  If specific instances of any such evasion are brought to my notice, I will have them investigated.  As regards the second part of the question, the object <Col N="649" /> which the Deputy has in mind has already been largely achieved by a serious restriction of imports of foreign cloth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, I would like if the Minister would say that he is prepared to insist that these importers of foreign-made cloth, or the firms who use it in their factories, will be compelled to use a certain percentage of Irish-manufactured cloth.  The Minister is aware, I take it, that in the flour milling industry flour millers are compelled to use a certain percentage of home-grown wheat.  Then why not compel those people who manufacture ready-made clothing to use a certain proportion of home-manufactured cloths?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should understand that there are many different classes of cloth used in these factories and that some of these cloths are not made here.  Many ready-made clothing factories may not use woollens or worsteds at all of the type that is the subject of these orders.  There is another type of cloth of which large quantities are allowed to be imported because such cloths are not made here. It would be quite impracticable for us to interfere in some of these cases. We have, in fact, interfered seriously in the matter of cloth manufacture by Irish millers and that interference did, as a matter of fact, bring new orders to the Irish manufacturers; the information we have got indicates that the Irish millers have got new orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are trying to do, but the Deputy will appreciate the difficulty of the Department in dealing with these matters. The nearest approach we can make to <Col N="650" /> that type of legislation is to limit the import licences to certain cloths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister is aware at the present time it is calculated that 60 per cent. of the cloth used in this country by ready-made manufacturers and others is being imported and only 40 per cent. of Irish-manufactured cloths used.  I am sure the Minister will agree that in this respect there is room for curtailing imports.  I understand that there is a case being made now by British manufacturers to capture some of the 40 per cent. of the trade that is given to the Irish mills.  Will the Minister see that instead of any portion of that 40 per cent. being captured by the British manufacturers he will see that an opportunity is given that some of the 60 per cent. of the trade now captured by foreign manufacturers will be captured by the Irish mills?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in view of the excessive profits which are being made by the flour-milling interests he will consider the taking of immediate steps to bring the industry under public control in the interest of the citizens.</P>

      <P>The Government are of opinion that the price of flour is unduly high and propose to take measures which, it is expected, will have the effect of securing a reduction.  I am not prepared to accept the implication in the Deputy's question that the high price of flour is due solely to excessive profits taken by flour-millers.  It appears to be clear that other factors, including higher costs of production attributable to higher wages, the smaller size of the average mills, and the guaranteed price of Irish wheat, are operating to keep the price of flour in Ireland higher than in the United Kingdom.  It is not intended to modify the Government's wheat production policy, and it is, therefore, clear that any plan which will secure a reduction in the price of flour must be designed <Col N="651" /> to effect reductions in the other elements that enter into the cost of production as well as to keep millers' profits within reasonable limits.  Proposals for legislation are being prepared and will be submitted to the Dáil when ready.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that in the case of one Irish mill there has been an issue of its shares on the market twice within recent years and that the latest proposal is to sell these 5/- shares for 17/6 each?  Will the Minister consider, in view of profits of that magnitude in the flour-milling business, some of which profits are made in this country, whether there is not a necessity for bringing the flour-milling industry under public ownership and control so that the necessary articles of food used by the people will not be made the subject or the means of amassing substantial profits by the flour millers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the questionnaire relating to the generalisation of the reduction of hours of work in industry, commerce and offices issued by the International Labour Organisation has been brought to his notice; and, if so, whether it is his intention, in his reply to the questions therein, to indicate that the Government is in favour of the reduction of hours of work in industry, commerce and offices on the main lines outlined in the questionnaire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The questionnaire issued by the International Labour Office relating to the generalisation of the reduction of hours of work in industry, commerce and offices is at the moment under consideration.  The <Col N="653" /> Government are in principle in favour of the regulation of maximum hours of work by statute and this policy is expressed in the Conditions of Employment Acts.  The attitude of the Government towards this questionnaire will follow generally the lines of policy contained in the Conditions of Employment Acts.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, these Acts do not provide for the generalisation of the reduction of hours of work but permit of separate action, after due investigation, in respect of different forms of work.</P>

      <P>The applications for unemployment assistance made by Peter Whelan of New Road, Portlaoighise, on the 27th July, 1938, and the 8th September, 1938, were refused on the ground that he did not satisfy the statutory condition requiring him to be genuinely seeking but unable to obtain employment suitable for him. These applications were fully considered by the court of referees and the applicant appeared before the court to support his case on two occasions. The court recommended that the applications be refused.  These recommendations were accepted and given effect to by the unemployment assistance officer.  The applicant was not offered work by my Department. I have had inquiries made into the case and I am satisfied that the applications were properly determined.  If the applicant thinks that he is now in a position to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance it is open to him to make a fresh application.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the revival of the cattle trade since the end of the economic war and the prospect of a larger continental demand for our cattle, he will formulate some scheme, such as the heifer scheme of some years ago, to help farmers to restock their farms with breeding cattle.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that many farmers in the country to-day have not half the stock they had six years ago, and have not the wherewithal with which to get them?  This having been a very expensive year and a very bad year on the farmers&mdash;many of whom have lost half their corn and so on&mdash;if they do not get some help to enable them to restock their land, they will be down and out.  It is funny to think that money can be found for everything else, but that no money can be found to help the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Admitting that there is a substantial number of heifers in the country, is the Minister satisfied that they are effectively distributed, particularly amongst the small farmers, so as to ensure the best usage of the holdings of all small farmers; or does he think that there is grave maldistribution of good heifers as a result of the last four or five years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Keating, I should say that, generally speaking, the amount of livestock in the country is as high at least as it <Col N="661" /> was six years ago and, especially, the number of breeding heifers and cows is as high as, and perhaps higher than, it was a few years ago.  With reference to Deputy Dillon's question, I should not like to say, offhand, that I am quite satisfied about that, but we are looking into that matter, especially into the question of the provision of premium bulls and so on in order to see that the breeding of milking cows is improved in certain counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>The enrolments in national schools in recent years have been affected to some extent by certain incidental factors, viz.: (a) the increase in the number of boys and girls in attendance at secondary schools and vocational schools and classes, and (b) the raising of the age for enrolment of pupils in national schools from three to four years of age as from the 1st April, 1934.  Inquiries lead me to believe that the fall in the enrolment of pupils in national schools during the period referred to in the Deputy's questions is due mainly to the decrease in the number of births.  The issue is, therefore, a social, not an educational problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of such expenses as are incurred in carrying into execution any Act of the present Session to make further and better provision in relation to the purchase and sale (including export) of eggs by way of trade, whether wholesale or retail, and for the registration and control of persons engaged by way of trade in purchasing, selling, exporting, preserving, or otherwise dealing in eggs and to make provision for divers matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the present Eggs Acts the receipts to Appropriations-in-Aid as given in the Estimates this year were £4,500, and the estimated expenditure about £6,900.  We believe that under this legislation there will be additional expenditure of roughly £10,000, which will principally be for the payment of the additional inspectorial staff. Additional receipts from fees will amount to about £10,000 in an average year.  That will come from a levy of 2d. instead of 1d. on 30 dozen of eggs for export.  The new levy will be 2d. for every 30 dozen of eggs either for <Col N="673" /> export or for home sales.  There will be an estimated additional receipt in the first year of about £3,000, but that will not be recurring.  That will be fees for registration of dealers.  The sum total is an additional expenditure of about £6,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I question as to whether this money is being well spent for the purpose set out in the Resolution, and I doubt if this House adverts at all to one of the inevitable consequences of the Bill, which the Resolution is designed to provide for.  If this money is spent in accordance with the terms of the Bill now before the House, one of the effects is going to be entirely remote from the egg trade altogether because you are going to introduce a virtual revolution into the whole system of rural trading.  At present eggs are used very largely as currency in the trade of what we, in rural Ireland, know as the country shop. There the shop is not one in a town or village but one on the roadside or outside the town.  In towns and villages business is usually transacted on the ready cash or credit system.  In country shops business is very largely conducted by payments made in kind and very frequently these payments are made in eggs.  A great many of these country shops employ additional carts, and these carts, going from door to door, offer their merchandise to the farmers' wives.  We, who live in the country, know that there is no ready money in the house, but the woman of the house buys what she requires and brings out whatever eggs are on the dresser and pays for her requirements with these eggs.  That is the way trade is done.  If the lady in Rathmines is entitled to get her groceries delivered to her twice daily, why should not a woman living in any townland in the country enjoy the same amenity, if she is prepared to pay for it?  Why should we, by law, forbid the country woman, in effect, having her groceries delivered into her house, and compel her to go two or three miles over a country road to do her marketing in town, if she does not want to do so? Supposing we passed a law here that ladies in Donnybrook and Terenure must foot it to town and bring their <Col N="674" /> requirements from Grafton Street in a basket, there would be a revolution, a revolution led by the wives of Ministers and, on this side, by the wives of people sitting on the Front Opposition Benches, and I would not blame them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am submitting that this Bill is going to impose that obligation, in effect, on every country woman.  If you do it it is going to be worth £1,000 a year to me.  I am a shopkeeper in a country town, and you are going to drive these people into me.  You are going to make them deal in my shop. That is true of every shop in every country town.  It is going to be an advantage to country towns, but do you think it is an advantage that you are entitled to impose on country people?  I do not think it is.  If the country shopkeeper is to justify his existence he must afford the country people the services they want.  If he is not prepared to give them that service, then he ought to go out of business. If I am not prepared to compete with the services given to the country people by country shopkeepers&mdash;and I ask you to bear in mind the difference between the country shopkeeper and the town shopkeeper, in the rural sense of these terms&mdash;and to deliver my goods to their doors, if they want them so delivered, then I ought to go out of business.  The only justification for the existence of the shopkeeper is that he gives to his customers a service that they otherwise could not get.  If you want by the law of this House to force a customer to conduct his business on the terms that shopkeepers want, then the shopkeeper has no reasonable justification for existence.  He is not giving service; he is imposing obligations. Is it the will of this House that no country woman can have her goods delivered to her door?  If it is, this Bill will do it.  I do not think that reasonable.  I do not think it the right thing to do without weighing up the merits of the issue.  This House should make up its mind as to whether the people are to get the services they now enjoy.  I put it to the Minister that the obligation devolves upon him of confirming what I am saying, and I think he will be obliged to confirm it, that <Col N="675" /> the regulations he intends to make are going to put an end, in effect, to the travelling shop.  Does the Minister think that a right thing to do in all the circumstances?</P>
    <P>It is true that it is going to result in a substantial addition of profits to shopkeepers in country towns. Although I know that many of my friends will disagree with me, on mature reflection I do not believe that it is an advantage to make these additional profits available to shopkeepers, who after all, are employers of labour, and valuable citizens in their own way. Nevertheless, I do not believe the advantage of affording them additional profits outweigh the disadvantage of denying the country woman the same amenities that she had been enjoying, if she is prepared and desires to pay for them.  My second reason is that this Bill was designed&mdash;I believe, in consultation with egglers, people who deal in eggs as opposed to those who produce eggs&mdash;to lift off the dealers' shoulders the responsibilities they ought to carry.  I do not think any man in this State, or in any other community, is entitled to a living if he is not prepared to give the community in which he lives some service in exchange.  The man who deals in eggs can make a good living out of it, if the trade is not spoiled by Government interference, but if he makes a good living out of it he ought to give the community he serves some return for the living he gets.  My submission is that the eggler's function, the thing he is being paid to do, is to sort out the bad eggs from the good eggs, to collect the eggs in a proper condition and sell them on the markets that are available to him.  It is his job to see that the eggs come forward for consumption in a proper condition.  I know from experience, for I was for years in the egg trade myself, how difficult a job that is to do, but, unless they have that job to do, what are they being paid for? They are the persons who come in contact with the producer and, if they want to give a fair return for the profits they are going to earn, it is their job to see that the eggs they take from the producer and put into consumption <Col N="676" /> are good eggs and eggs presented in a clean and proper condition.</P>
    <P>This Act is designed to enable the eggler to take in a woman's basket of eggs, put a docket on top of it and leave them there and, if the inspector does not come in and grab the basket or the container into which he has put them with the woman's name upon them and go out and prosecute the woman, the eggler seems to be substantially free from responsibility.  I think that is a mistake.  There is a third snag here.  I will not deal with that yet because it is a technical matter which will arise later.  I submit that a very much better method of achieving the purpose we all have in view, that is, getting the eggs on to the British market in a proper condition, is to suspend very largely the attempt to inspect eggs down the country because the attempt to inspector eggs exhaustively in every registered egg dealer's store and in every producer's home is simply going to multiply inspectors and produce very little results.  I, therefore, suggest that, instead of wasting money on inspectors, you should create in every port in the country from which eggs normally pass on their way to Great Britain, a bottle neck through which every egg, no matter what part of the country it came from, would have to pass.  I would let the registered dealer send up to that bottle neck, which I would describe as the registered exporter, any eggs he wanted to try and export and, when they got there, I would open his package, I would go through it, and any egg in that package that was not fit for export I would dispose of it and give him nothing for it.  He would be paid only for the good eggs which he submitted for export and nothing for the bad ones, nothing for the dirty ones, nothing for the stale ones, and let him go and arrange in his own district not to get dirty eggs, or stale eggs or bad eggs.  That is his business and if he is an egg dealer and if he knows his job he ought to be able to provide against that.  And he can provide against it.  I know because I was in the trade.  I handled eggs for years, and I know perfectly well that if the egg dealers of this <Col N="677" /> country are satisfied that you cannot get a bad egg or a dirty egg or a stale egg out of the country and sell it they will stop buying them.  There is no other way in which you will stop the export of unsatisfactory eggs, except by making the eggler do his job or by putting an inspector sitting down beside every hen in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no half-way house between Rome and Babylon.  You have got to have an inspector for every hen or the bottle neck at the port, and you are simply wasting money by sending inspectors cruising around the country trying to enforce a code of law as envisaged by this Act.  It will not work.  But if you set the other scheme on foot, if you make it clear that no eggler is going to get away with a bad egg, you are going to make out of every eggler in this country an inspector on his own and he is going to be a much better inspector than the inspector who works for the Govern ment because the eggler is going to be an inspector who is working for himself and no man works as well for a master as he works for himself.  It will be in his own interest.  Many of the Deputies in this House will say: &ldquo;Had not we all this kind of regulation before and still the egglers bought the bad eggs.&rdquo;  I want to tell you why&mdash;because they thought they could get away with it, and what happened was&mdash;there would be five shopkeepers in an area and they would all be looking for custom.  A customer would stop the travelling shop of the first shopkeeper and she would give her command whatever it was, and when it came to paying for that order she would tender him a basket of eggs. He would say: &ldquo;I cannot take these eggs; they are dirty.&rdquo;  She would say: &ldquo;Go on, I never sent for you.  It was yourself stopped me.&rdquo;  She would give him his parcel back and he would drive away.  The next fellow came along and would say to himself: &ldquo;I never got an order from that woman before.&rdquo;  He would stop his car and canvass an order, and, to his amazement, would get the order, although he knew she was a customer of the man in the car that had gone ahead of him, and when she would tender him the <Col N="678" /> same basket of dirty eggs he would say to himself: &ldquo;If I do not take these I will never get an order from her again,&rdquo; and he would bring them home and wash them.  Half of them would be stale eggs, and he would trust to God that out of the forty-two consignments that went down to the ship that day the inspector would not happen to light on his.  If he did light on his consignment it was just too bad.  He lost a case of eggs or a pound, but he prayed God that he would not light on them, that he would light on some other fellow's, and that, in the rush and bustle of getting the eggs shipped, his consignment would slip through, and seven times out of ten it did.  The only way to stop that is to make the eggler consign his eggs to the export agent in Dublin and to tell him: &ldquo;It does not matter whether you send ten eggs or ten million eggs, every one will be handled and examined and repacked, and every bad egg will be smashed, any trade egg will will be disposed of and you will get nothing for it.  We do not give two fiddle-de-dees what you do.  We are not interested in your activities down the country.  Do what you please, but, if we get a dirty egg, a trade egg or a stale egg, you will not get paid for it, and if you want to sell your groceries and the rest of it for eggs that you are not going to get paid for yourself you will not last long, you will quickly disappear from the trade.&rdquo;  That, at first, will have little effect, because they will think of the grand old days when you could slip them through, but then they will begin to discover that if they take a dirty egg or a stale egg it is money thrown away.  The country shopkeepers of this country are no fools.  They do not throw away sixpence without the hope of getting nine-pence, and they are not going to buy dirty, stale or bad eggs if they know they will not get paid for them.  You will make out of every eggler in this country a far more effective inspector and an inspector who is going to every house in the country.  You are going to turn these five shopkeepers who go around looking for trade into five inspectors, with this difference, that they <Col N="679" /> are not the kind of inspector who are a plague and persecution to the country woman.  They are her neighbours.  She does not mind them coming to her house when she is not prepared for a visitor, and, mind you, a lot of Deputies in this House think that is nonsense.  It is not nonsense.  It is a disagreeable thing for a country woman, who is busy about the house, not suitably attired for visitors, to have strangers dropping in on her.  She does not mind neighbours, who know her position.  If you send five shopkeepers to that woman's house every morning to look at her eggs and say if they are dirty: &ldquo;No, ma'am.  I cannot take them.  They are dirty.  You will have to eat them yourself&rdquo;, she will begin to say to herself: &ldquo;Something will have to be done about this. I will have to get them clean and see that they are fresh.&rdquo;  In that way, and in that way only, will you make the eggs of this country what we want them to be.</P>
    <P>There are two other difficulties, Sir. One is, and mind you this Bill makes no provision for it, strict prohibition against any registered dealer washing an egg.  There is this difficulty, and I see the difficulty in my own plan just as it is in the Minister's plan; that is, if you are too draconian about prohibiting the egg dealer from washing an egg you may get the country women washing them themselves.  I can wash an egg and do it very little harm. Many hundreds of eggs have I washed in my day, and may wash them again if the occasion arises, because I know how to do it; but a country woman's idea of washing an egg usually is to get water at a temperature which will melt the dirt, but unfortunately water which is at a temperature to melt the dirt will also boil the egg.  You very frequently get a lot of eggs, where a country woman is trying to wash them, half boiled, so that I am not quite sure that we ought to be so severe about the washing of eggs, at least in the early stages, though I admit this difficulty, that if you permit the eggler to wash eggs, it is practically impossible to stop dirty eggs.  I mention the difficulty, not for the purpose <Col N="680" /> of condemning the Minister's scheme in that particular case; I am not altogether sure that he is not right; but hear in mind that if a man goes to a country woman's door and she learns by experience that she cannot sell a dirty egg, she washes the eggs.  When a man goes later on to the same door and she hands out the basket of eggs it is not easy to recognise a washed egg unless you candle it. You cannot candle every egg on the side of the road.  Some eggs you will see are washed without candling them, but you cannot be certain until you do candle them.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask himself how is the registered dealer to know whether an egg is washed or not.  If he cannot know, might it not be wiser to reconsider the position in regard to that problem now?  Of course, I agree that under this measure there is a provision that the inspector may come in and examine a basket of eggs having on it the indication of whether they came from.  In the store they could examine them and candle them, and they would be able to tell whether any individual egg was washed.  But I think he would find it hard to satisfy any court that an egg was washed and came from an individual producer if that producer appeared in the court and swore that she never washed an egg.  I put it that, if the Minister would consider the plan which I have outlined, we can get somewhere, and after we get that we can deal with the quality of the egg we want produced.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of the present position is that we are not producing any eggs at all, that the egg business is practically finished.  The worst of it is that it is the thriftiest housekeeper who has gone out of eggs.  Here again I am speaking from my own experience.  I have known country women, the very best housewives in the country, coming to my window and asking the price of 1 cwt. of meal.  When I tell their husbands the price, I have seen those women touching them on the shoulders, saying, &ldquo;Do not bring it; I will choke them first before I pay that for it.&rdquo; And they did choke them; they went home and choked the hens, boiled them or got rid of them in some way, and <Col N="681" /> they stopped selling eggs because they made up their minds that hens could not be made pay with the cost of feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>We have to bring down the cost of feeding stuffs and, having done that, we have to bring home to the minds of the country women that the price has been reduced and that it is now an economic proposition to feed fowl.  The next thing to do is to get those people selling eggs early next year.  Personally, I consider the destruction of the fowl population is so awful at present that I would be prepared to get them next year to sell any eggs they can lay hands on.  Then in the year to come we can build up the fowl population in the country.  The important thing is to get back the trade that we have thrown away to Denmark, and to do that we ought to be prepared to sell any kind of egg.  Let us get people back to the habit of dealing with fowl and selling eggs, because they are getting out of that habit.</P>
    <P>The money here voted can be effectively used to put the industry back on its feet, first, by virtually abandoning the attempt to inspect egg production from the hen all the way up, and to concentrate attention on the ports and effectively stop every unsatisfactory egg there; and, secondly, to reduce the cost of the industry and bring home to the minds of the people that it is the fixed intention of this House to see that the cost of egg production will never be allowed to rise unduly again. I believe that if we do that we will get somewhere; that if we do not do it, we will get nowhere, that we are going to waste a lot of money under this Bill and achieve nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows quite well that the egg exporters to date have done very little to deserve his gratitude. They have achieved very little indeed to help the egg industry or do anything of a co-operative nature in order to improve the attractions of the egg business for the country people.  It is an immensely important industry to the whole of rural Ireland and it is one for the revival of which I am in a position to offer the Minister the whole-hearted co-operation of the Opposition in this House.</P>

      <P>I desire to remind the House and the Deputy who has just spoken that on the Second Stage of a Bill the House approves of the principle of the measure and that the purpose of the Money Resolution is to make provision for the Bill so approved, and not for such a Bill as a Deputy might desire to substitute.  I am sure it was not with the deliberate intention of circumventing the Chair that Deputy Dillon set forth in his speech a scheme which he had submitted in the form of an amendment and which was considered out of order by the Chair as intimated in a note to the Deputy.  That scheme is too wide a variation of the principle of the Bill as approved a Second Time. I should, therefore, like the House to realise that the Money Resolution deals with the financial provision for the Bill as already approved in its main terms.  The scheme which the Deputy has outlined, even if it were adopted by the Minister, would necessitate the withdrawal of the Bill and its reintroduction in new form.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I went outside the rules of order in the observations I made.  I understood the Money Resolution was designed to carry into effect the purposes set out in the long title of the Bill and that the subsequent sections were the Minister's idea of how best to do that, and I understood also that those who desired to were entitled to refer to various matters on the Money Resolution. However, whatever is the ruling of the Chair, I accept it.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to restrict debate, but the Deputy may be aware that here and in another place the whole question, place of and necessity for a Money Resolution has been discussed.  It should certainly not be made an occasion for a Second Reading debate.  It seems to me that the Deputy's speech to-day would have been appropriate on the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite evident from the speech which I have listened to with very great pleasure, and which <Col N="683" /> has been delivered by Deputy Dillon, that he has benefited to a considerable extent by his recent contact with Commonwealth political friends and that a good deal of the valuable suggestions he has put before the House have emanated from the bag he has brought back from Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Deputy, who, on many occasions, censured members of this Party for advocating and supporting socialistic schemes, for coming round so quickly to the Labour Party point of view in regard to propositions of this kind. Having delivered the speech to which I have listened with such pleasure, I daresay the Deputy will not repeat the offence of censuring members of this Party in the future in the same way as he has done with such eloquence in the past.  However, the members of this Party have given very careful consideration to the matters mentioned by Deputy Dillon and, on behalf of this Party, we appeal to the Minister to withdraw it and by withdrawing the Bill for the present to consider carefully the proposals put forward by Deputy Dillon, proposals which are deserving of attention from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to repeat, and I will not attempt to repeat, in view of what you, Sir, have just decided, the points dealt with, nor will I go over the ground of the scheme outlined by Deputy Dillon.  I submit, Sir, that on its merits that scheme is much better than the scheme outlined in the present Bill.  I believe, with my limited knowledge of business of this kind, that Deputy Dillon has outlined a scheme that is likely to have greater effect towards increasing the export of eggs to the British market than the Minister's scheme as set forth in the Bill.  No doubt the object of the Minister and his advisers is to increase the quantity of egg exports to the British market; to increase the quality of those exports, and in this way to increase the return to the producers. Personally, I am not very much concerned with the egg dealers, because <Col N="684" /> in both schemes they are going to get profits out of the business in some way or another.  What I am concerned with is getting better prices for the egg producers.  I share the views of my colleagues in this Party in saying that the scheme put before the House by Deputy Dillon is more likely to bring that object about than the scheme set forth in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to give his most favourable consideration to the scheme now set forth by Deputy Dillon.  The scheme is one that is entitled to consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a great pity that Deputy Dillon was not here for the Second Reading of this Bill, because if he had been he would have found from my speech, outlining the objects of the Bill, that he had an entirely wrong conception of what this Bill sets out to do.  The Deputy spent a considerable amount of time to-day telling us that the Bill would make it impossible for the travelling shop to bring groceries, etc., to the country producer, collect eggs and bring them back again to his own place.  There is nothing in the Bill to warrant that view.  I am surprised that Deputy Dillon, who has the reputation of being intelligent, and who also has the reputation of being honest, should have that conception of what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to say that I do not want to get into any quarrel with the Minister.  If I am mistaken in anything I said, I am quite prepared to withdraw it if the Minister corrects me.  I referred to the provision in the Bill where the Minister has power to make orders as to the conditions under which a person will buy eggs; to protect them from the atmosphere and so forth.  The Department and the Minister want to prevent a fellow handling eggs out in the rain and carrying them back in the same car with cheese, etc.  That is what is in the minds of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if I am wrong, correct me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured he is wrong.  If he will read <Col N="685" /> Section 2 of the Bill he will see in the definition of the word &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; that &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; includes purchase and also purchase by barter, etc.  Surely I would not put that in if I wanted to do what the Deputy suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is going to make it impossible for the travelling shop to barter or to purchase eggs by barter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are not going to do that.  We shall make regulations under this Bill, it is true, to see that the eggs are properly protected and that they are brought in by the dealer without being exposed to the weather and so on.  But the taking out of groceries and the bringing back of eggs do not arise in this Bill at all.</P>
      <P>The second point the Deputy made was that this Bill appeared to be drafted after consultation with the people in the egg trade.  I do not think the Deputy can support that statement by quoting any section in the Bill.  As a matter of fact, the only consultation I had was with the Consultative Council.  That was with regard to what I was going to put into the Bill.  Then, when the Bill was printed each member got a copy; the Consultative Council in general approved of the Bill unanimously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I did not libel the Minister if I said he consulted the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consulted the trade as well.  Deputy Dillon said I consulted the trade only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made this point&mdash;that the eggs should come from the producer in proper condition. These are the words I used on the Second Reading&mdash;to see that they are brought forward in proper condition. And having them in proper condition means that we expect to get a better price for them and so increase profits to the producers.  It is not true to say that the collector can take any eggs from the producer and leave them <Col N="686" /> there.  There is a section in the Bill which prohibits him doing that.  He must deal with them in the time prescribed. That is a new regulation. Up to this what happened was that the collector brought in his eggs and kept them in his place for some time if the market were rising.  When the exporter got them he, too, kept them for a little time if the market was rising.  Then they were sent to Dublin or elsewhere and they were dealt with there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister hopes to stop that under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot do it under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going to stop this by nationalisation.  He said it could be done by an exporting agency at every port.  He would have Government inspectors inspecting every egg. We would have an inspector there to inspect 300,000 eggs a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not mean inspecting every egg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because every bad egg must go back.  How can you do that without this inspection of every egg?  The Government will carry on this agency to find a market for the eggs.  Well, if that is not nationalisation, what is nationalisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is Denmark doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Denmark is doing that, it is nationalisation.  I am not against nationalisation at all.  I agree with Deputy Dillon and Deputy Davin in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, why eat the face off me so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not examine the question of nationalisation now.  I say it is quite possible that we would do the business better than the other exporters because where the Government have gone into business they have done business as well as the people in the trade.  But we must face those facts.  However, that would require a <Col N="687" /> separate Bill.  In the meantime while we examine that we ought to go on with the present measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not my proposal in fact amount to this, that the egglers in the country would be required by law to form a combination and export eggs through an export agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who would manage the agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be carried on certainly under the supervision of the Minister.  I have no hesitation in recommending that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.  I do not say at all that the Deputy is wrong in that.  I think it may be a very good scheme, but I want everybody to realise that what Deputy Davin says is, to a great extent, true&mdash;that is, that it amounts to nationalisation.  I am not going to condemn the scheme merely because of that, because I do not think it is any the worse for being called that, but I am coming to the point of washing, which has been referred to.  I do not know if the Deputy can wash eggs in a way that could be undetected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if so, he is one of the very few people who could do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, apart from that, there is the other question.  The Deputy objected, in a way, in one of his statements, to the docketing of the producer's eggs&mdash;at least, he disparaged that.  Now, if we have the docket on, that docket goes along until the eggs are tested, and the person who tests the eggs&mdash;whether he be the collector, the wholesaler, or whoever it may be, knows whose eggs they are and, if there has been washing, he knows who is washing the eggs, and he replies back and says: &ldquo;Do not take any more eggs from these people if they do not stop washing them.&rdquo;  Accordingly, there is some reason for, and some advantage in, docketing.  I do not exactly say that the person concerned should be prosecuted, but at <Col N="688" /> least there is the advantage that such persons can be told that no more eggs will be taken from them unless they stop that practice.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy came back to the old trouble of dear feeding stuffs and so on, and about the decline in production.  I made two observations in connection with that, on the Second Reading, which will not fit in with the Deputy's point.  The first point I made was that the decline started in 1929, and that it was just as steep from 1929 to 1932 as it has been from 1932 up to the present.  The second point I made was that the decline in Britain has been just as bad as it has been here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Denmark?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about Denmark, but if the Deputy were asked by somebody in Great Britain to explain our decrease in production from 1929 to 1932 or from 1932 onwards, he would have to give some other reason, because the decline there has been just as bad as here.  As a matter of fact this year, for the first time since 1932, our production is going up; so that none of these facts will fit in so easily with the point made by the Deputy.  As I said on the Second Reading, and as I say again on this Bill, I wish the Deputy were right, because if the Deputy were right in saying that it was due entirely to the maize-meal mixture regulations, then we could help the situation by dropping these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister would do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But that does not explain the decline in Great Britain, for instance, nor does it explain the decline from 1929 to 1932.  As I have said, if the Deputy were right, I should be very glad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake to drop the maize-meal mixture scheme right away?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, we have quite a comfortable majority here.  I think I have dealt with most of the points that have been raised.  There are some other points that, I think, would arise more appropriately in connection with the sections of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether we will be in a position, when this Bill is passed, to export eggs under a Government guarantee.  I understand that our competitors, the Danes, send their eggs to the British market under Government guarantee, but our eggs have not such a guarantee and, very often, our eggs arrive on the British market in anything but the condition which they are represented to be in.  If we are going to compete in the British market against the Danes, we must be in a position to export our eggs under a Government guarantee.  The only way to achieve that is the way in which Deputy Dillon suggested the work should be done.  Under the present scheme, as I understand it, you cannot export, your eggs under Government guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to do so, but it is a colossal job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the right thing to do.  If you handle this very important business in the way suggested by Deputy Dillon, you can export under Government guarantee. I have been told by people who are in the egg business on the other side that every create of Irish eggs is opened and examined, while Danish eggs, side by side with ours on the same market, are sold there without any examination whatever.  My informant made it his business to inquire into the reason for this and he found that Danish eggs <Col N="690" /> come in there under Government guarantee and that, therefore, the purchasers were quite satisfied, in purchasing Danish eggs, that the eggs were what they were represented to be.  The Danish Government guaranteed their eggs.  It is different in our case.  When a crate of Irish eggs is opened, the first few layers may be all right, but when you go down further in the crate, the eggs are not so good, and the dirty and stale eggs are down at the bottom.  That is what I have been informed, and that is an aspect of the case to which the Minister and his Department should give more attention.  If you have not that Government guarantee, no useful purpose will be served by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should realise what Deputy Dillon's scheme means.  Leaving aside altogether the question of nationalisation, I should say, on a quick calculation&mdash;naturally, I cannot give exact figures&mdash;that such a scheme would require about 100 inspectors at each port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister does not wish to mislead the House, any more than I wish to mislead it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I may inform the Minister that, during the busy time of the year, we do trade-testing in the egg trade.  The Minister can ask his own officials about that.  I have been working on this job for years, and I have exported millions of eggs.  From March to July we do not candle individual eggs; we trade-test them.  I know what I am talking about.  I have exported millions of eggs under the Minister's supervision, and there is no obligation on me, as an individual, to candle eggs between March and July. When I was exporting eggs, during the peak period of the year we trade-tested the eggs, because eggs were falling in price and everybody wanted to get rid of them before prices fell, but during the slack period of the year we are obliged to test them individually.  I know there are difficulties, and I am not minimising them, but do not exaggerate the difficulties.  An organisation would be required, but after all it <Col N="691" /> would be only about one-twentieth the size of the organisation that Denmark has in existence.  Denmark is sending to the British market about 20 times as much as we are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are sending more than 5 per cent. of the British import of eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, Denmark is sending a far larger quantity than we are, and it has a much bigger organisation than we would require to handle the situation.  No matter what size the organisation might be, however, if it pays us, would it not be the right thing to have such an organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be so.  I do not want to misrepresent the Deputy, but my point is that if we were to ensure that every single egg going out should be Government guaranteed&mdash; and, by the way, I think that the home market is just as important, if not more important, in that connection&mdash;it would mean that we would have to candle every single egg.  Otherwise, you could not have security.</P>

If we are going to beat the Danes at this job, we must be in a position to give the same <Col N="692" /> guarantees as they are giving.  Otherwise, we can never beat them.  We must go as far as they are going.  I would say to the Minister that he ought to examine the position as far as possible, and export eggs under Government guarantee.  We are not going to improve otherwise.</P>

      <Col N="693" /> In page 4, line 38, to insert after the word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; the words &ldquo;eggs sold but not delivered,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are two points in this.  I think as the section stood, if an inspector were to go into a shop and point to a certain lot of eggs saying, &ldquo;look at these,&rdquo; the shopkeeper might say that those eggs had already been sold to some customer but not delivered.  The amendment is just to cover a possible evasion in that way.</P>

I did deliver them, and I am just obliging him.&rdquo;  Why do you want to say &ldquo;but not delivered&rdquo;?  If the eggs are in a man's store I think he is liable for them.</P>

      <P>Does not this go substantially beyond the existing position? I do not think there was an obligation on us heretofore to employ nobody except a person who had a certificate from the Minister.  We were urged to employ only such persons, but if there were good men available who had never taken the examination or never applied for the certificate they could earn money at this job too. Is it not rather harsh, considering the conditions under which the trade is normally done, that those individuals must go through some from of examination, or that it should be in the power of an inspector to put a fellow out of his job?  Surely, if you are going to settle the responsibility <Col N="694" /> on the registered dealer or the exporter, it is up to him to determine whether a member of his staff is inefficient or not, and power should not be handed over to a Government inspector so to say?</P>

I think that all those Agricultural Produce Acts passed within the last four or five years at any rate contained this provision, in order to prevent the proprietor of a premises from evading the inspector any time he might come along, so that he would be able to say no document had been served on him.

      <P>That is so.  I quite admit that.  Perhaps neither the Deputy nor I have in mind the little details that are important.  Very often when an inspector calls he has with him one of those loose-leaf books on which he writes a direction in regard to some small matter which he would like to have put right.  He likes to hand it to the proprietor before he leaves the premises.  I suppose when he goes back he has other things to think about than the posting of that document to the proprietor.  Perhaps it is as well that he should serve it on somebody before he leaves the premises.  It is not a big point, and I can assure the Deputy that it is not going to be abused.</P>

    <P>The word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; is being taken out here because there are cases where notices are sent out to proprietors giving them some new regulation with regard to stamping or dating, and so on, and in sending out a very big number of notices like that&mdash;for instance, to the collectors of eggs, where the number may run up to 2,000 or 3,000&mdash; it is an immense job to register all the letters, and I think it is quite sufficient that they should be sent out by post.  As a matter of fact, I am told <Col N="698" /> that in the Interpretation Act the sending out by ordinary post is interpreted as being the serving of a document.  I should say, perhaps, that in practice if it is in regard to a serious matter such as threatening a man that we will withdraw his registration, we make full sure that he receives the document before we do anything serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fee was one penny on a case of 300.  That sounds very little, but if the amount is increased to twopence now, it means in the case of an egg wholesaler handling, say, 450 cases a week, an increase of nearly £2 a week.  That is a lot of money in such cases.  I wonder if Deputies realise the margin of profit made by egg wholesalers, and the amount of eggs that are lost.  I should say that three weeks out of ten there is a loss on the shipping of eggs, and during the remaining weeks the wholesaler hopes to make up the loss.  The wholesaler thinks himself lucky if he makes a net profit of two- <Col N="701" /> pence or threepence a case on cases that might be worth 27/-.  If selling 300 eggs of all types at 9/-, after debiting overhead expenses, he might only make threepence a case.  Of that threepence, one penny is going to be taken away now.  While it seems very little, taking the average wholesaler in the country, the question is: how many of them are making £4 a week?  How many people handling 450 quarter cases are making a net profit of £4 a week? A fee of twopence a case represents £4. Of course it will be said that the wholesaler passes the charge on to the producer. It is not so easy to pass it on to the producer.  I should like the Minister to explain why he wants this extra penny to be levied.  I assure the Minister that if he looks into it from the point of view of the weekly charge, rather than from the microscopic point of view, the charge is going to amount to a big thing to a man in a small way. What is the urgent necessity for doubling the fee?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has under the Act power to make any regulations he likes from time to time.  He can make any regulation controlling the export of eggs, <Col N="704" /> lay it on the Table, and it has statutory effect as from the date it lies on the Table, and yet he wants power to withdraw the licence from anybody who acts in a manner which is, in the opinion of the Minister, prejudicial, not to the eggs, but to the reputation of the eggs.

That has been put in by some zealous bureaucrat in Government Buildings who is sick and tired of wrangling with solicitors and who wants a blunderbuss to level at the head of anybody who dares to assert his statutory or constitutional rights.  That is what that is.  If any man says, &ldquo;Summon me to court.&rdquo;  He will say, &ldquo;If I cannot catch you under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), I will catch you under (i).

I do not want to stickle over details in a complicated measure of this kind, but that is bad principle and ought to come out and I would be glad if the Minister would signify that, if I put down an amendment for the Report Stage to delete the words after the brackets in line 32, he will consider accepting it.</P>

That is not a desirable position.  I believe in giving the Minister the widest scope in such a highly technical and complex measure, to make regulations subject to their being subsequently corrected by Parliament, but I do not believe in blunderbuss sections of that kind and, remember, that section will be quoted as a precedent to us in a variety of other statutes if it is passed now.

      <P>(1)  Any inspector shall be entitled at all reasonable times to enter any premises registered in a register kept in pursuance of this Act or in respect of which an application for registration in any such register has been made, and there do all or any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  inspect all or any part of such premises and the equipment, appliances, and fittings therein;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (e), line 33, after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>provided that nothing contained in this section shall require a person to <Col N="707" /> furnish the inspector with information tending to incriminate such person.</P>
    <P>The wording of the proposed amendment, I think, ought to convey pretty clearly the defect which it is intended to cure.  In other legislation objection has been raised by members of this Party and the suggested amendments have been accepted on the lines, for instance, of the Shop Assistants Bill. I think it is wrong for an inspector to be given the power to compel a person to give such information as is likely to incriminate himself, and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment for that reason.  I would point out that amendments of the same kind have been accepted by other Ministers in connection with legislation of a similar nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is practically a redraft of the section we have been working on since 1924, and I do not think it has ever been abused, because an inspector would be very foolish to abuse that.  The courts naturally will not convict.  In fact, they would be very prejudiced against any case if they found the inspector had tried to incriminate a man on his own word and, of course, the higher authorities in the Department and the Minister would be naturally against the inspector trying anything like that because, if for no other motive, they would not get a conviction.  The courts would not give the inspector a conviction if he tried to incriminate the man on his own word.  It would make it extremely difficult, on the other hand, to administer this Act if that amendment were put in, because the proprietor, if he is any sort of a smart man, will probably inveigle the inspector into asking him a question which would incriminate him, and the case would be dropped if it came before the court.  I think the Deputy would be better advised to leave it as it is.  I am afraid we would almost have to give our inspectors a legal training if that amendment were put in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, it seems to me to be a power which should not be vested in any inspector, to require the registered proprietor or any person employed by the registered proprietor of a premises to furnish the inspector with such information as the inspector may deem necessary for the purpose of the administration of this measure. It is bad enough to give a junior inspector of the Department of Agriculture the right to walk in and ask certain questions, with full statutory authority to prosecute the persons if he fails to answer them; but it is worse to give him power to go to a man's servants and apply the interrogatories to them, and it is still worse to vest the discretion of a junior <Col N="709" /> inspector with full statutory effect. Remember it is any question that he thinks and not any question that the Minister thinks.  This applies to any young lad going out as a new inspector, and perhaps appointed the day before yesterday.  If he thinks it necessary for the due administration of the Act, it becomes a statutory offence if a man does not answer.  Does the Minister not think that that is going a bit far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the general principle remains that if the proprietor refuses to answer a question which he thinks is altogether unreasonable and if the inspector went to the court, the district justice is certain to stand by the proprietor if the question is unreasonable.  I think from experience that the district justices do always give the benefit of the doubt to the person who is against the Government, whoever that person may be, and there need be no fears whatever that this thing is going to be used in an unreasonable manner.  The real difficulty arises when you start limiting the inspector.  The proprietor may get a legal tag that he will catch on to and when a proprietor goes to the court he will prove that this person has no right to ask such a question and the case is dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be considered offensive, but does the Minister realise what he is saying, that the important thing, when drafting, an Act of this kind, is to strip the citizen of all his rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it amounts to.  What the Minister suggests is that if you try to limit the inspector the registered exporter raises some legal quibble in court, proves the question to be <i>ultra vires,</i> and upsets the prosecution. Is not this what the Constitution was written for, that I have certain rights which may not be taken from me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Try to avoid quibbles if you can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And if you want to override any personal right which I enjoy, there is machinery at your disposal. There is a certain right vested in the citizens, but if, in the interests of the public, it is necessary to override that, the Minister may present, a Bill or an order for that purpose, and he may challenge a debate upon it.  What you must not do is to delegate that immense power to a young chap whom you appoint an egg inspector, power to be exercised 24 hours after he is appointed.  The Minister says that if the registered exporter is brought into court, the district justice will take a very lenient view.  I do not like being brought into the District Court.  I do not enjoy having to apply to a district justice of this country to take a lenient view.  I do not want any leniency from any district justice.  I want the letter of the law, and I want to know what my legal rights are.  If an inspector calls on me, I want to receive him with civility, and go the limit of his jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know my rights <i>vis-a-vis</i> that inspector, and I want to know his rights <i>vis-a-vis</i> me.  I do not want to be told, if he thinks it is expedient in any given case to sweep away my constitutional rights for the due administration of the Egg Act, that I commit a statutory offence in refusing to agree with him, and I must apply for leniency to the district justice if the inspector prosecutes.  Surely that is not right.  Surely individuals have some right as against the Government. We all know where this section comes from, and I sympathise with the man who wrote it, some exasperated permanent official who has got two or three bad upsets in the District Court, who is trying to persuade the Department of Finance that the legal costs were not excessive, and who is determined the next time he throws his lasso that he lands his man.  That is just what happens.  I can see the unfortunate man imploring the officer responsible for this Bill to insert this <Col N="711" /> paragraph, and licking his chops anticipating the time he meets the next cute attorney down the country. It is great fun for the official and for the cute attorney, but between the upper and the nether mill stones the unfortunate individual will be crushed. I look upon this as an unnecessary intrusion, and it ought to be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdrew a previous amendment because the Minister said that if it were inserted it would upset the whole administration of the Act. The administration of this will depend, largely, on the experience and judgment of the inspectors.  If you have inexperienced men&mdash;and I suppose a lot of them will be inexperienced&mdash;if you have the busybody type, they may bring a person into court on a very flimsy case.  As Deputy Dillon says, it is no satisfaction to go through court proceedings, and even, in the end, if you find a district justice on your side, you will be put to unnecessary trouble all the same.  There ought to be some method of meeting reasonable objections of this kind.  That was the reason I put forward the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise that.  I think Deputies ought not to argue this matter so much from the point of view of theory.  They ought to have some regard for realities.  They know there is no junior inspector connected with any Department who can bring a person into court on his own initiative. The action must be sanctioned by a higher officer and a case will not be permitted unless there is some justification for it.  Deputy Dillon says he knows what happens here, and he painted a very fine picture of the man who failed in actions in the court and who put forward these proposals so as to get his man some time or other, and they find their way into a Bill.  Of course that is all nonsense.  I might as well suggest to the Deputy that the exporters, or importers, or dealers, got on to him and put their viewpoint before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in arguing in theory about this measure.  Of course every citizen has his rights and we do not alter the Constitution for the purpose <Col N="712" /> of a Bill like this.  We think that if any cases go to the court they should be argued on their merits before the district justice.  The fundamental right of the citizen will remain in any case, whatever we do here.</P>

      <P>Inspectors are human beings.  Take potato inspectors. Does the Minister get reports about what potato inspectors are doing down the country?  Is he aware what happens in the country under these Bills? Deputy Dillon has mentioned about these young men who write reports from the country and we all know what happens.  I was down in the country during the harvest and I heard there what some of the young inspectors said. I knew a case where the inspector described potatoes that he was shown as potatoes that came out of a black scab area.  He made most violent threats against the farmer.  If he made them against me I would take very drastic action against him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> Before sub-section (2), page 15, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2) Whenever the registered proprietor of registered premises desires to make structural alterations in those premises, he may apply to the Minister in the prescribed form for the approval thereof in accordance with this section, and the Minister shall, as soon as may be after the receipt of the application, intimate in writing to such registered proprietor his approval or disapproval of the proposed alterations.</P>
    <P>I think this amendment covers the point raised by Deputy Davin in amendment No. 9.  The point of Deputy Davin's amendment is that a person might make structural alterations and find when these structural alterations were completed that they were unsuitable or insufficient and that they would have to be pulled down again.  However, it is no harm to put in the amendment I am moving. In practice we have always done this. The proprietor would be sensible enough to consult one of the senior inspectors before involving himself in any expenditure.  We are now putting it in the Bill so that the Minister will have the right to get the opinion of the inspectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 16, line 7, to delete the words &ldquo;or a registered dealer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the powers sought by the Minister in this section so far as they apply to registered dealers are very severe and likely if enforced, or if the Minister gets the power to put the Bill through in its present form, to drive the smaller dealers out of business. <Col N="715" /> This might be all right in the case of the wholesaler, but the Minister is going farther than he intends in seeking to extend this section to registered dealers, to prevent registered dealers from doing any kind of business except in connection with the administration of the measure.  I think the Minister should look into this and say whether he intends to drive people now in the business out of business or else confine them solely to this particular side of the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very drastic sub-section.  Of course, the Minister can give his consent to carrying on the business, but again you introduce this question of influence and pull, and the torturing of the Minister by politicians and so on.  I think that is a power that should not exist, and I think the House should agree that this part of the Bill cannot be operated so far as the local merchant is concerned who is carrying on this as a collateral part of his business. All these types of shop are a part of the machinery for the selling of eggs.  You cannot get a small shopkeeper down the country in a business purely confined to eggs alone.  It would not pay him.  In the second place, suppose that such a man applies to the Minister.  In that case, perhaps, somebody may object to him and, on the other hand, somebody may support him, and again the wangling goes on.  I think that this business of the permission of the Minister should be done away with.  The Minister knows that it is the local grocers that carry on this business.  It can be said, of course, that a man could have the egg-packing business away from his premises&mdash;in his yard, for instance&mdash; but that is not right, because anything in his store or yard is legally part of the premises.  I think that sub-section should be modified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I don't think the Deputy is right about the matter of the premises.  The premises need not be a separate building.  What I have in mind is that a man can carry on his ordinary grocery or hardware business, or whatever it might be, and <Col N="716" /> that if he had a separate room, under the same roof, but preferably with a separate entry, for the egg business, that would cover the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I do.  I was reared in the country just the same as the Deputy was, and I know that it is not unusual to have a separate room.  You cannot have this business properly carried on if it is to be mixed up with paraffin oil and so on.  I say that a separate room under the same roof will be sufficient, and that it can be regarded as separate premises. Perhaps that clarifies the matter for Deputy McMenamin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If it is within the same curtilage, within the yard, or within the walls, no court of justice would listen to you on that point.  That is the real weakness here.  I am anticipating that the eggs will be packed in a loft or a store of some kind out in the yard.  That might not matter so much, because the eggs would be collected in a van out in the country and taken into the store.  The point, however, is that the moment that is done, even though the eggs are in a store outside the shop itself, they are legally within the premises.  That is my objection.  What the Minister has in his head is quite simple, I know, but it is not law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>But you are not doing that, because the moment you do that it is legally within part of the premises.  It is the same premises, and no district justice would listen to you for a moment if it were contended that that was not part of the same premises.  Take the licensing laws.  I <Col N="717" /> do not know whether the Minister has any experience of them or not, but does he suggest that if he is caught in the stable or the yard of a public house he is not on the licensed premises?  Of course he is, Even if you are in the stable with a horse, you are on licensed premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be bad law. I cannot help that.  The point is that it is the law.  I think the Minister should modify this, because what will happen is that, if we let these things go through this House an inspector will go down the country and stand on his rights, and if you go to court the district justice will say: &ldquo;That is the law, and if you object to it you must go back to the Legislature, but it is not for me to make the laws.&rdquo;  How many times do you not see that kind of thing happening?  The district justice says: &ldquo;That is the law and I must administer it; go back to the Legislature if you want the law changed.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has been in small shops in rural Ireland. He knows that there is generally the kitchen and the shop in front, and perhaps there is a parlour, bedroom, and so on.  Where will the man put the eggs?  Will he put them in the parlour? <Col N="718" /> There may not be a parlour. Will he put them in the bedroom or the kitchen?  Where does the Minister expect the man to transact his business? Does he expect him to build a new apartment?  If he does, he is going to put that man out of trade.  If these regulations are to be enforced, the small shopkeeper will be put out of trade.  You are going to have a development here of the Danish kind, of which I do not approve.  I know, of course, what is in the Department's mind. They want to make the collection of eggs a separate thing from the distribution of merchandise.  They want a man either to be in the egg business or in the general grocery business, and they are leading up to segregating the two business to a point in which it will become virtually impossible for anybody in a small way to engage in this business.  I admit that there is a good deal for that point of view.  I admit that it is arguable, but I think that there is a good deal more to be said against that point of view.  I think the Minister does not realise what this means, or else he is not telling the House.  Surely he must realise that the powers given under this sub-section are all designed to make it impossible for the small shopkeeper to handle eggs? Does he agree with that?</P>

      <P>Well, the Deputy need not ask what I meant by that.  We must have a separate compartment, but I said to Deputy McMenamin that it may be under the same roof of the shop. Deputy McMenamin says that I might find myself in the stable with the horse. That does not arise at all.  I hold that &mdash;whatever the rule may be about publichouses or anything else&mdash;as long as we keep within the Constitution we can make our own laws here as far as premises are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>But you have not defined them in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have.  If the Deputy will go back to the definitions, and put them all together, perhaps he will find we are all right.  I quite admit that what Deputy Dillon says is right; there may be cases of a very small shopkeepers where the amount of business they are doing in eggs would not pay them to construct a separate premises for the business.  That may be, but Deputy Dillon started off by saying that I ought to beware of the people in the egg trade, and that I thought of nobody except those in the egg trade, and did not think of the producers at all.  Now, in every amendment that is brought in here, his one concern is to save the exporter a certain amount of trouble, or to save the dealer a certain amount of trouble.  If we do that, we cannot do anything for the producer, and that is the end of it.  I think if a man is doing a trade in eggs, he can either acquire a room and have it fitted up properly, and have it registered as a premises for the egg business, or build another room if it is worth his while.  If he is doing a good business in eggs, I presume it would be worth his while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin said the Minister should not have discretion to allow them to use that premises for other purposes.  I cannot oppose that very strongly.  Personally, I find that those discretions which the Minister has are a nuisance, because, as Deputy McMenamin says, when a person writes up and wants permission to do something, he points out that the Minister has the discretion.  It is really a nuisance.  I will tell the House why it is put in, and if the House wishes me to bring in an amendment to take out that discretion, I am quite satisfied when, I know what the position is.  The position put up to me is this: take the small man again.  He sets a room aside for the egg business, and he does that egg business for perhaps seven or eight months of the year, and not for the remainder of the year.  He engages, say, in the poultry trade at Christmas, and if there is no discretion there, we come along and say: &ldquo;You must not <Col N="720" /> use that room; you must get another room for your poultry.&rdquo;  We may find it impossible to give permission, in a case like that, to a man who is not using his premises for eggs at a certain time, to use them for a purpose of that kind.  I do not know whether I could mention anything else; poultry is the only thing I have in mind.  Certainly, there is no question of using that discretion to say to any shopkeeper: &ldquo;You can carry out your egg business in the shop without constructing a separate room.&rdquo;  The only question is to allow them to use a room or premises, which they might have for the egg trade, for another purpose at a time when they would not be in the egg trade, that is, at a slack time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want the House to do is this: to act with their eyes open. I do not think the Minister is treating us as ingenuously as he might.  I think the Minister has a studied purpose. Why does he not say it quite plainly? That purpose is to put the small man out of the egg business, and to leave nobody in the egg business who is not going to be primarily an egg merchant. All I want the House to understand is this: if you are going to do that, you are going to make a revolutionary change in the rural system of economy, and I do not believe half of them know what is the significance of that.  I do not think they are even adverting to it at all.  I want them to advert to it because they are going quite casually to do something which will have very considerable repercussions on the everyday life of the people.  I should say that seven out of ten of the existing small shops which provide an outlet for eggs at the present time will go out of business now.  They will have to, because it would not be worth their while to build a new room and equip it to meet the Minister's requirements. That means that a woman living in Tibohine may have an outlet for her eggs because there is a man living near her who finds it worth while to build that room or house.  But take the case of a person living in Redbridge who normally dealt with a cross-road shop, and that cross-road shopkeeper drove his cart into the town twice a week and bought supplies and sold the eggs. <Col N="721" /> That woman in Redbridge hereafter will have four miles to walk into the town to dispose of her eggs.  If you think that is the right thing to do, well do it, but do it with your eyes open. You are going to make a fundamental change in that woman's whole way of life.  You are going to do something else.  That small shop depends for its existence on the fact that the woman in Redbridge can dispose of her eggs there.  If she has got to come into the town to dispose of her eggs she will buy her requirements in the town.  That is into my barrow.  That is worth £1,000 a year to me.  If you drive all the people around Ballaghaderreen into the town of Ballaghaderreen it is worth a lot of money to me, because I will get their custom, but it is not fair in my judgment, because you are going to destroy a number of small shopkeepers who are half farmers and half shopkeepers&mdash;people of the kind we all know.  You are going to take their livelihood away from them.  I do not think you are right in doing that.  I think you are making a mistake, the same kind of mistake as you made when you tried to put trawlers on the sea instead of inshore fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to say is that there are a lot of occupations in this country which are really half time.  The economy of the rural area depends on people dividing their time between two occupations.  Destroy one and you reduce them to the level of peasant penury.  They raised themselves from peasant penury by keeping a little shop, doing a little fishing, or by having some little ancillary occupation. Do not destroy that.  If the House makes up its mind that it is for the common good, that that should be swept away for this new state of affairs, that is the business of the House.  But do not sweep it away <Col N="722" /> without adverting to it.  There is no need to quarrel about this.  We may differ on fundamentals without getting vexed, but I ask the Minister, if a stipulation is made for regulating egg dealers by requiring them to have a separate room and putting them on anything like a parity with the standard required of the wholesalers, does it not occur to him that seven out of 70 shops of the roadside character will chuck the business?</P>

      <P>I believe the Minister intends to have this Bill administered in such a way, as to make it possible, in future, for the wife of the farmer or the agricultural labourer to sell eggs for cash, and to get a better price from whatever egg dealer is in the district, rather than, as in the past, having to bring in eggs and sell them at a lower figure, in order to get tea, sugar and other necessaries.</P>

      <P>I want to see egg producers getting a better cash price, and I want that policy developed in other directions, as far as farmers are concerned, because it is the only policy which will make farmers independent, and not dependent, as in the past, on the goodwill of some local trader or pawnbroker.  While I am with the Minister in pressing for a rigid enforcement of the section as it stands in the case of all new dealers looking for registration, I think rigid enforcement of the measure, worded as it now is, would have the effect of driving some small business people out of the egg trade.  I am at one with the Minister when he says that he is not going to allow licences to be issued to old or to new dealers who store eggs where petrol was previously stored.</P>

I do not want to have the power that the Minister asked for enforced in such a way as to drive out of the egg business existing traders who are prepared to comply with the reasonable requirements of the Bill.  It is a reasonable requirement to see if a small room could not be specially set aside for the proper storing of eggs, apart from other commodities sold on the premises, or that are likely to injure the selling price of eggs on the home or the foreign markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the Deputy appear to be overlooking an important point.  The Minister talked about the provision of a room for eggs.  I know of people engaged <Col N="724" /> in the egg trade who could not possibly provide an extra room, for the simple reason that their premises are so situated that there is no space on which to build.  The houses are so small that they could not afford to give one room for that purpose.  From the discussion that took place it seems to me that they may be driven out of business.  If that is so it should be stated.  There is no use pretending that these people will comply with such a requirement because, in many cases, it is impossible to do so.  Deputy Davin wants to ensure that producers will get better prices.  It seems to me to be a new way of ensuring better prices by reducing competition.  That is what is going to happen.  If this section is enforced, it will mean in many cases giving a complete monopoly in the egg trade to one buyer in a district covering a wide area.  I am not dealing with the type of shop referred to by Deputy Dillon, the roadside shop.  I refer to the ordinary country village where the small shop is generally hemmed in on both sides of the street, and where it would be utterly impossible in many cases to provide a separate room for eggs.  I think the Minister will agree with me there.  The other point is that this Bill may succeed in reducing producers to the position that there will be only one buyer in a district.  I do not know if that would be desirable.  I think it would lead to much greater abuse than Deputy Davin had in mind.  Speaking for the part of the country that I know, I do not think the system of barter that the Deputy spoke of exists. As far as I am aware people take their eggs and sell them at the highest price in the shops and, on being paid in cash, purchase groceries.  What Deputy Davin mentioned may prevail in other parts.  I am sure the Minister appreciates the fact that many people engaged in the egg business, even with the best desire to provide an additional room would, if compelled by law, find it impossible to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin should realise that the vast majority of people in the egg trade are in it as a sideline, and that grocers must buy eggs if they are to retain their trade.  If a country woman goes into a shop with a basket of eggs, and is prepared to barter them for a certain price, it is on the understanding that she is going to buy groceries.  That is different from the position mentioned by Deputy Davin.  In order to secure the order for tea and sugar, the shopkeeper must be prepared to give a good price for the eggs; otherwise the owner would go elsewhere.  In other words, she is going to use the order she places in the shop as a lever to force the shopkeeper to pay a good price for the eggs. Under this Bill, that type of competition is going to be done away with. Such competition was healthy, and was necessary in the interests of the producers of eggs.  If you are going to do away with that competition, all I can say is that it is typical of the policy of the Government Party to destroy any competition without hesitation. You cannot have healthy trade and good prices for produce if there is not competition.  This is a matter that should receive serious attention. <Col N="726" /> The business done by the type of dealer to which I refer would not be sufficient to justify him building a separate room for the handling of eggs, but the bulk of the eggs come through those people in the first instance before they go to a wholesaler.  Then they sell back again for local consumption, and anything that is left over and above goes to the wholesaler.  It is through that type of people that the eggs are bought from the producer in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 28, if there is a small shopkeeper concerned who buys the eggs in a small little shop, he packs those eggs into a special egg case and they may be stored in a clean part of the house. In the majority of cases&mdash;90 per cent. of the cases&mdash;they are properly stored in these registered places and, in the ordinary way, taken to the wholesaler. I come from a county where there are at least 60 registered shopkeepers, and in general the quality of the eggs, as far as cleanliness is concerned, is well up to the standard and the responsibility of receiving those eggs from those small shopkeepers rests with the registered proprietor.  If he accepts any eggs that are not clean he is responsible at the port and when the eggs are being shipped.  I think the small shopkeeper will be badly treated under this section of the Act. I agree with Deputy Dillon and Deputy Morrissey that these people ought not to be put out of existence. In regard to Section 48&mdash;that section, too, will be more or less on the same lines as far as the purchase of eggs is concerned.  In the purchase of eggs under Section 48 I take it that those people who do business on the road <Col N="727" /> may do the ordinary travelling business on the road as far as groceries are concerned, and it may be they will have to have a separate lorry for the eggs.</P>

      <P>A point I raise has quite a different aspect from what the other Deputies have put.  What I fear is this&mdash;I only want the Minister to get his legal adviser to look into it &mdash;I am thinking of competing merchants. One man has registered premises, and he has quite an efficient storeroom, a place to which nobody could take exception, but not a separate premises.  A competitor wants to put this small man out of business because he is using a room in the house for storing the eggs.  The Minister is quite prepared to give a licence as long as he has a room apart from the room in which the oil and all the other things which are sold in the shop are kept.  But what I feel is that some competitor will come along and say that, under the law of property, that place is not a separate premises, that it is part of the house, and he institutes proceedings on the grounds that he is carrying on egg dealing in premises in which he is carrying on other business also, that is to say, in a room in the same house.  What I fear <Col N="728" /> is that if that case went to the court, the court would have to hold that that room in the same house was part of the premises, and he will get an order condemning it.  The Minister registering it looks at it from a different angle. This is another angle, getting an outsider in through the back door to put a person out of business.</P>

      <P>I want to answer first of all the question raised by Deputy Davin.  We cannot, I beg to assure Deputy Davin, make any distinction between existing dealers and newcomers. We do not know who they are.  They were not registered up to this.  If we had a register of dealers under the old Act we might be a bit more easy on them than we would be on those who are coming in now.  I think that Deputies, however, are giving a little bit too much importance to this section.  I think the majority of these shops the Deputies have spoken of are shops taking goods from their customers and selling retail.  As a matter of fact if they do otherwise they are a nuisance.  That is all.  They are the very type of people who are ruining the egg trade.  Take the grocer who takes in five or six dozen eggs and he hopes to sell them to his customers on a Saturday and he does not sell them, and on Monday or Tuesday sells them to a wholesaler.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to a bit of nonsense from the other side.  I am just saying those are the people that we do not want to have any regard for whatever.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy Morrissey tried to put me in the position of saying that I am out to kill the retail trader.  I say that unless the retail trader carries on his business in separate premises, he cannot go on in the egg trade.  I do not see why, in a Bill like this, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Morrissey could not forget <Col N="729" /> about politics for a while.  What good is it going to do?  They tried to get me to say, &ldquo;Yes, I am going to destroy the retail trade of eggs,&rdquo; and then Deputy Dillon would go down the country and quote this to his constituents, that I was out to destroy the retail trade of eggs.  What I am going to do is&mdash;I say it again&mdash;under this section, not allow any persons to be dealers in eggs unless they have separate premises.  Deputy Dillon says that is 70 per cent.  Deputy Browne, from an adjoining county, says in his speech that when these people get the eggs 90 per cent.  Put them into store.  The figures do not agree.  So there are only 10 per cent. that have not got a store of the 100 per cent. at present, and we are dealing with that 10 per cent. Some of them, perhaps, will be able to provide a store or room, and the rest of the 10 per cent. may have to go out of business; and, if they do, it will be, if you like, as a result of this Bill, and as a result of my compelling the Fine Gael Party to put it through against their will because they have such pity for these poor retailers.  They get all the kudos with the retailers all over the country; that they stood by them, but what could they do&mdash;they were beaten.  Let them have all that political victory, and all the kudos if they like; but I want to ask them this; what would they do for the egg trade?  They welcomed the Bill on the Second Reading, but everything we tried to do so far they said we were interfering with the rights of the retailers and the rights of the wholesalers; that we should not do anything to affect them, and so on.  Deputy Dillon goes so far as to say that we must not interfere with the egg dealer&mdash;let them put the eggs in on top of the paraffin oil if they like&mdash;why should they be interfered with?  Why should Deputy Dillon not have an opportunity of saying to the country: &ldquo;I did my best for you, but the Fianna Fáil Party, as usual, put it through in spite of us&rdquo;?  I say that is the position.  I thought that on this Bill, at least, we could forget about these political questions, and forget the kudos and see what could best be done for the egg trade in this country in all the circumstances, but <Col N="730" /> I see now that it was too much to hope, and, if you like, you may put it to a division&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If Deputy Browne says that 90 per cent. of the egg dealers in this country have store rooms, he is a very knowledgeable man, he knows the country, and I am greatly consoled to hear that is Deputy Browne's view.  I may be wrong and he may be right.  If he is right then I do not think this section is as objectionable as it appears now to me to be.  But we can find common ground.  There is no need to get violent about it.

      <P>I will tell you.  There is no difficulty about it, and there is no need to get vexed about it at all. Permit the egg collector to collect his eggs more or less as he is doing at the present time, and place on the exporter the obligation of seeing that the eggs are despatched for export in a fit and proper condition.</P>

      <P>But you are taking power to impose upon the eggler, as distinguished from the egg wholesaler, the standard of equipment that used to be stipulated for with the egg exporters. The egg exporter represented perhaps 40 egglers.  The egglers came into him and he was in a fairly large way of business, and it was worth his while to build a separate egg store, and he could do it.  If my information is right, it is not worth while for seven out of ten of the egglers to establish separate premises for handling their eggs.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is it the Minister's desire to put seven out of ten of the egglers out of business?  I fully sympathise with the Minister's difficulty.  I do not want to make political capital out of his difficulty.  If I were in his position I would be in the same difficulty. I put down on paper what my solution of that difficulty is, but the Ceann Comhairle has ruled my amendment out as being too wide, and therefore, I cannot debate it.  It is not true to say that I have carped at and criticised the Minister without putting up an alternative plan.  I did put up an alternative plan.  I do not want to minimise the Minister's difficulties or suggest that he is acting precipitately or carelessly or without examining the situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister came to this House to hear what we have to say.  If we do not say it here, where are we to say it?  I am telling him of the difficulties which I believe exist.  I am asking him if his advisers have suggested these difficulties to him and if he has considered them.  Perhaps the Minister's advisers would be prepared to accept Deputy Browne's view?  Perhaps they consider that nine out of ten, or even more, of these people have the necessary accommodation and that this section will not be a hardship.  If that is the case, then the Minister's information, or the information of his advisers, does not coincide with mine, but all the same I am prepared to accept his word.  I merely ask the House not to make a decision without facing what is going to happen.  My advice is that that section will put seven out of every ten existing egglers out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have heard Deputy Browne's advice and the Minister's view, and now they can make up their minds, but I ask them not to go into this business without thinking.  Deputy Smith intervened, and he has some knowledge of Cavan, a large egg-producing area.  Does Deputy Smith tell us that in his experience of his own <Col N="732" /> county nine out of ten egglers, the small men handling a few hundred of eggs every week as distinguished from the exporter who ships the eggs&mdash;is it his experience that the average eggler keeps the eggs in a separate room away from the general business he carries on?</P>

At present the eggs and the business are all kept together.  Deputy Smith confirms my experience of the existing position, not of what is going to happen.  He takes the view that it will be worth their while to clear out a room and equip it in accordance with the Minister's requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the danger of that arises, because no egg wholesaler will accept contaminated eggs.  These men have a lot of experience. Their families have been handling eggs, perhaps, for generations.  No eggler will allow eggs to be contaminated, because he wants to sell at the best price he can get and he will not be careless or indifferent.  This subsection requires him to have a separate apartment equipped in accordance with the Minister's regulations.  I have some experience of the Minister's regulations and I may say they are a bit stiff.  I say that it is not economically possible for the eggler to carry out what is prescribed here.  If the House says it is, then in my opinion the majority of those people must get out of eggling and make way for those who can afford to have their premises equipped in the manner specified by the Minister.  I say that the change wrought here is altogether out of proportion to the objective in view and that there is just as effective a way of achieving our purpose, which is to get the eggs on the British market in a condition which will command high prices without smashing the livelihood of thousands of people engaged in this trade.  In this House we get, evidently, to some degree divorced from the life of the people.  I remember on one occasion hearing the Prime Minister say that you cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs.  I know something about breaking eggs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is saying; I can never understand him.  You see a man in a comfortable way of business.  On Monday some new regulation comes into operation and that tiny microscopic business <Col N="734" /> stops.  Michael Tuohy is put out of business.  He does not come into the town for two or three weeks.  You ask what has become of him and then somebody casually says: &ldquo;He has not the shop any more.&rdquo;  Then you see Michael Tuohy coming into the town. A few weeks ago he was a comfortable man.  He had a shop.  He is now a poor little farmer, living on an uneconomic holding.  It was because he had an uneconomic holding that he added the keeping of a little shop to his livelihood.  That is what drove him into shopkeeping.  He is now out of the shop and the man who was a comparatively prosperous fellow becomes overnight an uneconomic holder. That may be necessary if a great good is to be achieved.  But are you achieving a great good in this?  I do not think so.  That is not the only way to do it.  I do not think you have inquired far enough into the question of whether you are going to swipe these small fellows out of business altogether.</P>

They can make up their minds when they understand what they are doing.  I have carefully considered what the Minister wants and in my opinion, on balance, I think I am right and he is wrong.  The method suggested by me is better and would not injure these people, but it is for this House to decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak as having some experience in the County Cavan. I do not pretend to know the exact proportions of those likely to be put out of business, but I am satisfied that the <Col N="735" /> proportion will be a large one.  The more you go into the rural districts the smaller and the more mixed the shops are.  You cannot have specialists where the population is thin and the people poor.  Generally, you would get these small shops that cater for the people around the neighbourhood.  These shops provide a useful service.  If these people were made throw up part of their business the other business would be scarcely worth carrying on. When a woman near a village shop wants to sell eggs she finds it very convenient to send to that shop and to buy things in return.  I say it would be a very bad thing for these people to be driven out of business.  I suggest that this section should be amended, and the Minister should give himself power to allow these little shops to carry on.  I have heard a good many people speak about this, and they all seem to think it is going too far to restrict the right of people to carry on this business.  There is nobody interested in the egg trade who is not anxious to see the business carried on under proper conditions.  I do not know of any shop that is unsuitable for storing eggs.  Nobody keeps oil in a shop.  It is kept in an outside house, not in any part of the shop.  I think it is a slander on shopkeepers to say that these shops are badly kept. Shops, as a rule, are clean and suitable places in which to store eggs. The Minister should not make his rules so drastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In very many rural areas the eggs are disposed of at a convenient shop in the neighbourhood. They are put into sectional cases and stored in the shop, which is usually separated from the dwelling-house. That is the case in a large percentage of the shops, anyway.  The eggs are kept there for a day or two and then sent out to the wholesaler or shipper. In February, March, April and May the eggs are sent to the wholesaler three or four times a week, at least twice a week.  The people could not afford to keep them any longer.  Now it will not pay those small shopkeepers to go to the cost of erecting stores.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that it will <Col N="736" /> put these people out of business; competition will not be there.  I speak on this matter from experience.  I know numbers of small shopkeepers who take in eggs and deliver them in a day or two to the larger traders.  That is the case as far as my district is concerned. I am connected with the egg trade myself; I know something about the egg export trade and about these small shops.  I certainly say this section will put some of them out of business, and their being put out of business will lessen competition and thereby create a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Dillon that this section, if put into force, would put a very large proportion of the small shopkeepers out of business.  But I do hold that if it put one out of every ten retailers out of business it would be a drastic and hard step and a step that would require considerable justification, more justification indeed than the Minister has adduced in his statement.  The Minister has not established a strong case for compelling the retailers to provide a separate apartment for the storage of eggs.  I think, having regard to the fact that there are a certain number of small shopkeepers engaged in dealing with eggs&mdash;people whose premises are small and whose means are limited&mdash; there should be some provision in the Bill which would enable these people to carry on and continue their business, provided, of course, that they did not store the eggs in such circumstances as would lead to contamination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that the Minister should bear in mind that the private citizen in this country, whether farmer or small shopkeeper, has certain rights, and these rights should be interfered with only as little as may be necessary. I do not think it is absolutely necessary for the purpose of this Act to compel dealers to keep their eggs in a separate apartment.  The Minister has stated that he will be prepared to allow those who have separate apartments registered for the storage of eggs to use part of their premises for other purposes.  He did not specify what these other purposes are.  He only mentioned poultry.  At times poultry may be as likely to contaminate <Col N="737" /> eggs as anything else.  However, from what we have heard, the Minister has not established a case for compelling these people to provide separate apartments for storing the eggs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any doubts I had as to whether this section would drive a considerable section of the people out of business or not was removed when the Minister spoke.  He resented very strongly that anybody on this side of the House should put this interpretation upon the section.  The Minister seemed to resent that we should ask information from him.  The House should be informed what they were about to do before passing a section of this kind.  But the Minister lost his temper; he even accused Deputy Dillon and myself of playing politics, trying to make political capital out of this Bill, and then he made, as he can make, a very nice Party political speech himself.  He admitted quite frankly in his speech, whether he intended it or not, that this Bill was going to drive a considerable number of people out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says, in effect: &ldquo;I am not saying that I am driving them out of business, but I admit that this section, if put into operation, will drive people out of business.&rdquo;  Does he admit that there are premises where, because of their size and situation, it would be impossible to provide an alternative room or store?  Would he deny that is so?  Certainly, as far as I am concerned, the Minister admitted, by the attitude he took up in getting angry about the matter, that there were dangers here.  He seemed to resent that the danger of his section was being exposed to the House and he seemed to be afraid that that exposure would find its way out from this House to the people affected by this Bill.  What is the House for it not to examine Bills and to have views and opinions expressed on them?  I am satisfied that if those views were not expressed on this side of the House, the Minister, if he thought it would suit his purpose, would afterwards twist the views of this side of the House in another way altogether and give them a different direction. <Col N="738" /> The Minister does that often, and does it very effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I did not say that the Minister twisted.  I said that he could give a twist of views from this side of the House into a particular direction if he so desired.  He is a keen enough politician not to be beyond that, as we know.  I think you will agree, however, that this is a serious matter for these people, even if there are only 10 per cent. affected.  I do not think there is anybody in any part of the House who wants to embarrass the Minister merely for the sake of embarrassing him.  I do not think that there is any question of Party politics in the minds of anybody in this matter.  Certainly, there is no question of Party politics in my mind at all.  I simply gave the facts as I know them in my own district, and I think I am in duty bound to give these facts, knowing them as I do.  In putting these facts forward, I am merely thinking of the interests of those people whose livelihoods are at stake, as the result of the section the Minister has in the Bill.  That is my only interest in the matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to the general opposition to this section, it appears to me that all the arguments that have been advanced, if put together, are very illogical.  Let us put Deputy Dillon's argument together. First of all, he speaks about the small trader, and the difficulty of getting so many hundreds of eggs, and I presume that the small people on the average would not make more than a trader of the magnitude of Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next thing the Deputy says is that we are going to smash the livelihoods of hundreds of people.  That is a piece of rhetoric if you like.  I take it that it was put in for effect in order to influence voters <Col N="739" /> and get them to look on that picture of people being ruined if this section is passed.  Take sixpence, however, as profit, and Deputy Dillon says that the majority of these people could not afford to make the alteration because they only deal with three or four great hundreds a week.  Let us take a maximum of five great hundreds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister but it is not the deprival of the profit that I am concerned with.  What I am concerned with is the fact that these people cannot take eggs, and their business depends on their ability to take eggs in barter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>All right, let us take it further.  Let us suppose that all these people are put out of business, as the Deputy has in mind, and we are prepared to take the blame for it if you like, naturally, the small farmer could then freely deal with the small shopkeeper with whom he has been dealing already, because the other people would have no interest in barter at all. The big dealer is not interested in exchange or barter.  The man will bring in his eggs, and he will get cash.</P>

I am only putting the Deputy's statements together with a view to showing that there is not a lot in his argument, but suppose we come down to the worst and suppose there is a loss <Col N="740" /> and that Deputy Dillon is able to impress a majority here sufficient to agree with him that the hardship inflicted on that class is out of all proportion to the benefits that might be conferred by going ahead with the Bill.

      <P>It is hard to keep patience with the Minister when he says that kind of thing.  I have tried to explain to him that the profit is not the fundamental question&mdash;that the real question is the business these people carry on.  That man's business depends&mdash;his <i>raison d'être</i>&mdash;is that he is there at the people's door to barter for eggs, and they will be sent into Ballaghaderreen, where they will be paid for in cash.  They will come into my shop, or the shops of my competitors, and my stock is 40 times as big as that of a man out in the country.</P>
      <P>There is the question of carting and the saving of money in cartage.  If the Minister is going to adopt my scheme &mdash;and it seems to be clear now that he is going to adopt it&mdash;do not wipe these people out and then, when they are all gone, introduce a scheme to save them. It is a hard thing to say to a horse: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass,&rdquo; but it is a great deal harder to poleaxe the horse, and then produce grass six months after he is rotting in his grave.  Do not wipe these people out if you are afterwards going to take a course which would not have wiped them out.  Turn the matter over in your minds.  Put in force the scheme which I suggest and you will achieve the purpose you have in mind, namely, getting good eggs, far more effectively than by all the abracadabra contained in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Fifth Stage, I think there are some matters about which the Minister might tell us.  The first is when he expects this agreement to operate, that is to say when he expects the transfer of the several businesses of the four companies to be completed. The second is this: this Bill envisages the creation of two companies. The first company is a company fated to disappear at a reasonably early date, when its work is done, and it will leave in possession of the Irish insurance field one company carrying on by far the greater part of all industrial insurance transacted in this country.  I want to know from the Minister whether it is the intention of the Minister for Finance, who is the effective shareholder in this combination, to give the directors of the amalgamating companies any representation on this board at all.  Whatever this business is worth, and <Col N="744" /> opinions will vary, those are the men who built it up.  Some mistakes may have been made, but they, I believe, will be prepared to stake their reputations that in time those several businesses would have become valuable assets.  It would be a profitless business at this stage to enter into an interminable discussion as to what the future might have held for those four companies; whether they would have been successful or not in the long run. The fact is they have chosen amalgamation instead of standing alone, and we can leave it to some to take the view that they would have developed and become prosperous and solvent, and to others to take the view that they would have been unable to meet their liabilities. Those directors were associated with valuable properties, and had command of large funds with all the advantages appertaining thereto, and I should like to know from the Minister if it is the Government's intention to give those men any representation on the board of the new company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point to which I want to refer.  The matter was raised by Deputy Norton on a previous occasion.  He seemed to imply that it was something in regard to which an apology was called for that a citizen of Great Britain should be on the board of those companies.  I am aware that the question of nationality and citizenship is at present one of great complexity.  That is our own doing. We have to face the consequences of our own doing, and the sooner we as a nation realise that, the better it will be for all of us, and the more careful it will make us when we are waving the patriotic stick over our heads.  I want to go on record as very clearly and very emphatically saying that any citizen of Great Britain who comes over here and gives good services for the salary he gets is heartily welcome and ought to be heartily welcome by the Irish people.  We bear them no grudge, and gladly avail of the opportunity of returning to Great Britain some of the hospitality which she has given to our people who are doctors, professional men and workers in every walk of life in Great Britain at the present time, and who might find themselves in great difficulties if they were <Col N="745" /> not afforded the opportunity of getting the employment they at present enjoy there.  They are giving good value for their money.  They owe nothing to Great Britain except the ordinary debt of gratitude for a hospitable reception, but the least our people can do is not to give to any citizen of Great Britain something for nothing, but to extend to them the same hospitality which our people are at present enjoying in their country.  So far as I am concerned, and so far as those associated with me are concerned, I desire that there should be no equivocation on that issue.  We opposed, I opposed, and I believe the insurance interests of this country opposed strongly the legislation which is now about to pass into law.  Our advice was rejected, and I think since then the insurance interests in this country have given ample evidence of the fact of their readiness to accept the decision of the Oireachtas and co-operate with it to the best of their ability.  For many of them it will mean laying down responsibility for the insurance affairs of this country, and I am quite satisfied that from all of them this agreement carried through by this Act, as it will shortly become, has their best wishes for success.  Let there be no doubt in the mind of anyone, the policy holders are as secure now, and possibly more secure, than the policy holders in industrial insurance companies in Great Britain or elsewhere.  The shareholders of these companies have done as well as any prudent financial advisers could have reasonably hoped.  They have achieved a security and an asset greater than that which would have been the merest speculation, and I assure Deputy Norton, if he consults prudent shareholders who are familiar with the circumstances of these companies, that while some may say with a very intimate knowledge of insurance business that they would prefer to face the future and take the risk abroad, the majority of conservatively minded shareholders will very gladly take the bird in the hand instead of the potential half dozen in the bushes.</P>

      <P>I did not get that.  I am not so sure that the Deputy is fair in recklessly slandering institutions to which he has not troubled to give careful thought.  It is not the decent thing to do.  The Deputy should not make rash observations of a left and backhanded kind, when the same might be said of some of the trade unions about which the Deputy is concerned.  It is not the decent thing to do.  If he wants to make backhanded allegations, the decent thing is to give those against whom they are made an opportunity of clearing themselves.  It is not the thing to slander anonymously persons quite unable to defend themselves when not named.  I have a fairly intimate knowledge of all these people, and I do not set myself up as a judge, but I know the difficulties they had to contend with, and their readiness to carry on, if allowed, and their readiness to co-operate as soon as this legislation is made law.  I think this House is under some obligation to a body of business men who, with very little assistance, sat down and with their own advisers, and with help and co-operation from the Department&mdash; which was not always helpful, as a good many difficulties were created&mdash; succeeded in surmounting matters in the draft agreement annexed to the Bill.  That was no small task.  It was something for which this House ought to be greatful.  In these circumstances, as this Bill is about to pass, it is about time the Minister gave those who gave their lives to the building up of the business, now to be amalgamated, some indication as to what the Government's intentions are as to the representation to be accorded them on the board of the permanent company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and I am aware that the Deputy is entitled to speak, but I am entitled to say that <Col N="747" /> Deputy Dillon has an inordinately flowery opinion of those responsible for the Bill, the directors of companies which, in the opinion of the Minister, were actuarially insolvent and are to be amalgamated.  Let us be perfectly clear on what we are doing.  We were told by the Minister that £500,000 of State money is being put into it in order to underwrite the actuarial deficit of the four participating companies. Everyone knows that State money is to be used for the purpose of putting right the actuarial deficiency which has been discovered in the affairs of the companies.  We gain nothing at all by closing our eyes to that fact.  As far as I am concerned, my eyes have been wide open all the time, and all the Minister said has convinced me that that was the only remedy which could be applied to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unusual for Deputy Dillon to pose in this House as an authority, having all the knowledge and all the wisdom.  Of course, when one gets to know the Deputy a little better one begins to realise how grotesque his arguments were.  I say definitely that £500,000 of State money is being put up to underwrite the actuarial deficiency in these companies.  That is what has happened under the Bill.  If they were not in that position the State would not find it necessary to intervene with this capital in order to save the policy-holders.  It is perfectly true, from the Ministerial point of view, that the approach to this legislation has been made to safeguard the interests of the policy-holder, because, in the long run, if the actuarial insolvency continued, the policy-holders would have to accept the position, either of the companies going into liquidation, and taking portion of the assets, or taking portion of the policies when they reached maturity.  It was only to avoid a situation of that kind that the State found it necessary to intervene on behalf of the policy-holders. I recognised all the time that the whole object of State interference was to save and to protect the policy-holders from the possibility of that type of loss.  Deputy Dillon tells us <Col N="748" /> that prudent financial advisers counselled accepting that position so as to safeguard the capital of the four participating companies, and get more for their capital now than in the recent past.  That is perfectly true.  If I was a shareholder in one of these companies, I think I would do so in existing conditions, because in fact there is no real capital left in the participating companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>All the companies in this arrangement are not actuarially solvent, and in respect of the insolvent company there is no capital left.  That is the position under this Bill.  There is a prospect that there will ultimately be capital available, but here again let us remember that the shareholders are going to revive that document and give it a value, again because of the intervention of the State in putting right companies which are at present actuarially insolvent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other point that I would like to refer to, and again only because Deputy Dillon has raised it. The Deputy has said that I raised a question on the Committee Stage of the Bill as to why a non-citizen of Eire was included in the board of directors of the new company.  It was a quite legitimate point for me to raise on that and if, as Deputy Dillon says, the directors of existing companies have devoted their lives to the insurance business and if they, as the Deputy said during his discourse a few <Col N="749" /> moments ago, possess the insurance ability that he claimed for them, surely it ought to be possible to find amongst those who have experience of insurance business in this country five citizens capable of directing the affairs of the terminating company or of the permanent company.  One of the persons who will be a director of the new terminating company is not a citizen of Éire but an official, I understand, of a company which is incorporated outside Éire.  If Deputy Dillon were an insurance agent and had some actual experience of an insurance agent's task in collecting premiums he would know that one of the most vicious things that has been introduced in the insurance business in relatively recent years has been the block system of collecting insurance.  It has been a scheme in the main designed to make agents work harder and harder for what they get as wages.  It is an attempt to concentrate business in a particular area and pay a wage for the business irrespective of the task of collecting the money in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to a fixed wage if the object of fixing the wage is to make a man work twice as hard for what he formerly got.  What we are going to have under this new terminating company and new permanent company, not so much in the permanent company, perhaps, as in the terminating company, but perhaps in both, is that we are going to have the Prudential system applied to insurance agents in this country, and if the Minister will only consult with insurance agents who are the victims of the block system of insurance which was introduced and pioneered through the insurance world by that company, he will know that the implementation of that system of collecting money and that method of remuneration inflicted very serious hardships on insurance agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="750" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should talk to some of the ordinary people who were victims of the other system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under both systems, I think, there were victims, but certainly there were victims <i>in excelsis</i> under the block system of collecting as operated in that instance, and I see in the appointment of this person an official of that company a further effort to apply to this new permanent company and terminating company the same vicious reactionary system that was put into operation in that instance.  It is impossible, probably, to expect a person who regards a system of that kind as his own child to change his mind on the system overnight, or to change his mind on the system merely because he is appointed to a post in this new permanent or terminating company.  But let us make no mistake about it that the application of the block system of collection is not only going to mean harder work for the insurance agents and less pay in proportion to that work, but it is also going to make it difficult for any company standing outside the amalgamation to pay existing rates while its main competitor is on the block system.  That is what we are going to have under this terminating and permanent company.  Deputy Dillon may not feel the effects of it or see the effects of it in 12 months.  I think after a few years we will see the effect of that thing, and those who will be continued in the insurance business will pay for the application of that principle to the method of collecting contributions under this new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked me when this amalgamation would come into effect.  I cannot give him any more definite answer to that question than to say that it will come into effect as soon as possible.  It will come into effect as soon as the necessary formalities have been completed and the valuation of the assets and the liabilities of the amalgamating companies has been concluded.  It is my intention, however, that there should be the least possible delay between the enactment of the legislation and the coming into effect of the amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> Deputy Dillon asked also if it is the intention to give to directors of amalgamating companies representation upon the board of the proposed new company.  I can only answer that question by saying I can give no guarantee of any kind that any of the directors of the amalgamating companies will be included in the membership of the board of the new company. The Minister for Finance has the obligation of choosing the number of persons competent to carry on the business of the new company, and in that connection he will no doubt have regard to the qualifications of existing insurance directors but no undertaking of any kind could be given, and I think it would be, in fact, improper for the Minister for Finance, in the circumstances, to tie his hands in any way in the selection of directors for this company.</P>
    <P>In the course of the brief discussion we have had here this evening, I think undue emphasis was laid on the question of the solvency of the amalgamating companies in connection with this general amalgamation scheme.  I think Deputies should see that there is behind the idea of amalgamating another object to be achieved than the remedying of the position created by the financial weakness of some of the Irish companies.  There are advantages, very substantial advantages, to be secured for the ordinary people in this country by eliminating the abuses associated with industrial insurance, of which many people are aware, and which resulted from the intense competition for new business between insurance offices.  I have seen circulated between the amalgamating companies a document which purported to show that many of the British offices which are now financially very strong were in no better condition than the Irish offices now are after 20 or 25 years' existence.  That is probably quite correct, but the conditions under which these companies amassed great resources and became financially strong were such as to call for the need for fresh legislation.  That legislation was introduced here in 1936.  We had, in order to protect the public against insurance companies, to impose a whole <Col N="752" /> lot of new conditions on the conduct of industrial insurance business.  That fact, I think, has been lost sight of by Deputies, that the primary purpose of the 1936 Act in relation to industrial insurance was to protect the public against certain methods of carrying on industrial insurance business.  In the conditions created by that Act, conditions which have also been created in Great Britain by an Act of the British Parliament, the development of insurance companies would inevitably take a somewhat different course from the development of these companies in the past in Great Britain, to which reference was made here by Deputy Norton, and outside by some of the directors of amalgamating companies.  The main idea behind the amalgamation scheme is to get unified operation and control of industrial insurance, so that the abuses resulting from competition will disappear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the block system.  He should find out something about it.  He must know, if he knows anything at all about industrial insurance business, that 99 per cent. of the abuses against which we are legislating arose from the system of paying agents upon the basis of the new policies they succeeded in having issued.  When the remuneration of an agent depended largely upon his ability to get people to take out new insurance, a position was created in which nobody cared a rap whether these insurances were continued or lapsed. All those abuses existed under that system, and all those abuses called forth the legislation which we enacted here in 1936.</P>
    <P>If we are going to get for this new company a different system of operation, a system that is going to be fairer to the people who are insured, then we have to change the method of operation as well and we can substitute a method of operation which will not merely be fairer to the public, but fairer to agents in so far as it will secure for them remuneration on an adequate scale without having to resort to questionable tactics which they have had to resort to in the past if they wanted to make any sort of a living out of the business.</P>
    <Col N="753" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The adequacy of the payment has always been in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the adequacy is a matter upon which difference of opinion may exist at any time.  But where the adequacy of the payment depended on the ability of the agent to get people to take out new policies, often by very questionable methods, then you had a condition of affairs which had to be ended, and which we have ended by the 1936 Act.  When that Act comes into operation, the conduct of industrial insurance business will be put on a different basis, but in order to start it and implement the idea behind it, it is necessary, not merely to put up these legal safeguards against abuses, but to get down to the causes of the abuses.  The main cause was the intensive competition in industrial insurance business.  That intensive competition we hope to eliminate as a result of the amalgamation. That was the primary idea behind the amalgamation, although it was also necessary because of the number of Irish companies that were not in a substantially strong position.</P>

I have in mind the case of a young chap, 20 years of age, who joined the Army in 1923.  He became an officer in the Air Force.  While flying in 1926, owing to an accident with his machine, he lost <Col N="754" /> his life, and so did the observer who was travelling with him.  He had parents who were not in very good circumstances. He helped to sustain them out of the income which he had as an officer in the Air Force.  On his death that method of sustenance ceased, and, in reply to applications made to the Department of Defence, the relatives were informed that there was no legislation under which they could be paid compensation in respect of the death of their son, who was a substantial contributor to the family income.  That seems to be a case of severe hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years the committees of management of <Col N="757" /> many voluntary hospitals in which the bed accommodation has proved inadequate to meet the demands for institutional treatment have applied for assistance from the Hospitals Trust Fund for the extension and improvement of these institutions, or for the erection of new hospitals.  In some instances these institutions are carrying out functions similar to the functions performed elsewhere by local authority hospitals, and when claims for grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund for the improvement of these voluntary institutions were being dealt with consideration was given to the question of co-ordinating their activities with the general local hospital situation, and of extending the areas served by them.  As the new or extended hospitals would, therefore, act to a certain extent as regional institutions, it was desirable that the local authorities concerned should have representation on their governing bodies.  Agreement to this arrangement has been readily accorded by the committees of management of voluntary hospitals who have hitherto been communicated with on the subject. Legislation was found to be necessary for the purpose of enabling the existing committees to be dissolved and new joint boards to be constituted with the necessary powers for taking over the functions and duties of the governing bodies of these voluntary hospitals In the cases of the Cork and Dublin Fever Hospitals special Acts, namely, the Cork Fever Hospital Acts, 1935 and 1938, and the Dublin Fever Hospital Act, 1936, had to be passed by the Oireachtas in order to implement the agreements arrived at with the committees of management of these institutions. There are now other instances in which governing bodies of voluntary hospitals have agreed to transfer their functions to joint boards on which local authorities will have representation. It has been thought well, therefore, with a view to obviating separate legislation in each such case to submit this Bill to the House for the purpose of enabling the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to grant the necessary powers for implementing such agreements by means of <Col N="758" /> an Order which is termed in the Bill an &ldquo;Establishment Order.&rdquo;  I would like to stress at this point that the power to be granted to the Minister can only be exercised where there is full agreement by the governing body of the voluntary hospital to the terms of the Establishment Order.  Section 1 of the Bill prescribes that this legislation is to apply only to voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>These are defined as institutions which provide for the prevention, treatment, or cure of disease, injury or deformity in human beings, or afford medical, surgical, or dental treatment to human beings, or give asylum to blind, deaf, dumb, or mentally defective persons, or to expectant mothers, or mothers of children under the age of five years and such children, subject to the condition that the governing body of such institution is not a Department of State, local authority or local authorities, or a committee of a local authority or local authorities. Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill set out the procedure in connection with the making by the governing body of a voluntary hospital of an application to the Minister for an establishment order in relation to the hospital and provide for due publicity being given to that application.  It will be open to any person within a period of four weeks after the week in which notice of the application has been published for the second time to submit to the Minister a statement of any objection he may have to the making of the proposed establishment order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On receipt of an application for an establishment order, the Minister may decide, after the specified period for the receipt of objections, either to grant the application or not, and he may hold a public inquiry before giving a decision in the matter.  If he decides to grant the application he shall prepare a draft of the establishment order and submit it to the governing body of the voluntary hospital. When agreement is reached with that body as to what, if any, variations are desirable in the draft order, the Minister may make the order in the terms agreed upon.  There are certain provisions laid down in the Bill which are essential for inclusion <Col N="759" /> in an establishment order.  These are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The existing governing body of the voluntary hospital shall be dissolved as from a specified date and a new governing board established, wholly or partly representative of one or more local authorities.  This board shall be a body corporate with a specified name, perpetual succession, a common seal, power to sue and be sued and to hold land.  The property, debts, duties, and liabilities of the existing governing body shall be transferred to the board on the appointed date.</P>
    <P>An establishment order may provide, where necessary, for the transfer to the board of the officers and servants of the governing body of the voluntary hospital, and may include arrangements whereby the service of an officer or servant of that governing body may be reckoned for the purpose of superannuation or compensation for loss of office.  The board may be authorised to borrow, subject to such restrictions as may be specified, and power may be given, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to lend to the board out of the local loans fund.  The board may be authorised to do all such things as governing bodies of hospitals of the class to which such hospitals belong are usually empowered to do. Other provisions which may be included in the establishment order are set out in detail in the schedule to the Bill.  These may be generally described as providing for the constitution and procedure of the board and for the carrying on of their business.</P>
    <P>The Bill prescribes in Section 6 for publicity being given to the Establishment Order when made, and the usual power for annulment of the Order by either House of the Oireachtas is provided for in Section 7.  If neither House of the Oireachtas has passed a Resolution annulling the Establishment Order, it is open to any person within a period of one month from the expiration of the time within which the Oireachtas could have annulled the Order to apply to the High Court for the annulment of the Order or any specified portion thereof, and on that <Col N="760" /> application the High Court may either annul the Order or portion of the Order, if satisfied that the Order or such portion contravenes, or is not authorised by, or is not made in accordance with, the provisions of the Act, as passed.  Power is taken by the Minister to annul the Establishment Order at any time before he has confirmed it.  If the Establishment Order has not been annulled under the above-mentioned procedure, the Minister may confirm it, or, in the event of part of the Order having been annulled, he may confirm the remainder of the Order with such specified modifications as may be necessary owing to the lapse of time since the making of the Order. The Establishment Order or the part thereof which has been confirmed shall have the force of law.  Arrangements are made under Section 11 of the Bill for the amendment of Establishment Orders which have been confirmed subject to the above-mentioned procedure being applied as if the proposed amendment were an application for a fresh Establishment Order, and power is taken to amend the Cork Fever Hospital Acts, 1935 and 1938, and the Dublin Fever Hospital Act, 1936, as if these Acts had been Establishment Orders.  I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>

      <P>I wish to call the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the case of the voluntary hospital in Valentia Island, County Kerry.  I appeal to him to consider that case, because the governing body have carried on under great difficulties; they have performed great work for a number of years.  Recently they made representations with a view to gaining whatever facilities will be available from this measure.  I submit that, in view of the limited funds at their disposal, and the fact that they have been operating in an island, they should get every consideration.  Voluntary hospitals <Col N="761" /> in Dublin and Cork and such centres are surrounded by very influential bodies and by people who are anxious to assist on every occasion. Funds are available from various sources for them, but in the case of Valentia Island it is quite different. In the event of the governing body there applying for permission to avail of these services or concessions, I should like to know what would be the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary. Would he give them the privileges they seek or the advantages that would accrue to larger centres, such as Dublin or Cork?  Knowing the circumstances and the justice of their case, I earnestly make that plea to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Bill is making provision for adequate hospital accommodation, it is certainly a very welcome gesture, because adequate hospital accommodation has been a very long-felt want.  Of course, the saving feature of the whole Bill&mdash; and I think it ought to ease even the mind of Deputy Flynn and the Deputy from Cork&mdash;is that agreement has to be reached, or rather that the board in charge of the voluntary hospital must of themselves, in fact, ask for the establishment order before it is granted.  I should like to know where exactly the local authority fits in.  Are the local authorities to be consulted in the making of the establishment order or are they to be pushed in?  What I am really anxious about is the burden that is already on local authorities for hospitalisation.  That burden is very heavy, and I do not think it would make for better hospitalisation if that burden is going to be increased in any way.  Right through the Bill, however, we have that spirit of agreement which the Parliamentary Secretary says is necessary, and on that account I feel that it will not be really a controversial matter at all and that, possibly, and very probably, very good work is going to flow as a result of this Bill.  I hope it will, and I hope the Minister will give some time to considering the implications of the Bill, because I do not think we understand very well at the moment what these implications may be as far as local <Col N="762" /> authorities are concerned.  I am sure, however, from the spirit in which this has been introduced, that it is really a matter of finding the best way to provide adequate hospitalisation, and to that extent we all welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy from Cork raised the point of the Minister insisting on the committee of management of a voluntary hospital seeking an Establishment Order.  As Deputy Brennan has pointed out, the Minister has no power whatever in this Bill to insist on any local authority taking advantage of this.  The initiative must come from the committee of management. Regarding Deputy Flynn's point, so far at any rate I have not had any representations on the matter from any voluntary committee in County Kerry, but if, as Deputy Flynn suggests, there is a committee of a voluntary hospital in Kerry that wishes to avail of the terms of this Bill, and who have merged their interests with the local authority to seek an Establishment Order, the Bill is intended to provide the necessary machinery to have that desirable and accom plished.  Deputy Brennan need not have any anxiety&mdash;I do not think he really has any&mdash;as to the position of the local authorities under this Bill. There will be no compulsion on the local authority any more than on the committee of management.  Before an Order is sought, or even subsequent to amendment by the Minister, there must be complete local agreement; and unless there is complete local agreement to the Minister's amendment&mdash;even to Establishment Orders, the draft of which might have been submitted to me&mdash;the Order will not become effective or operative.</P>

      <P>There is no compulsion on the management committee or the local authority.  It is merely in order to facilitate the dissolving of existing committees and the setting up of new <Col N="763" /> joint boards.  As I have pointed out, in the cases of the Cork and Dublin Fever Hospitals, special legislation had to be introduced to meet the situation there.  There the governing body of the hospitals concerned were anxious to merge with the local authority and hand over their assets to a new governing body, partly representative of the local authority in the area and partly representative of the committee of management.  Two or three similar instances have arisen where voluntary institutions are anxious to be dissolved and to hand over their assets to a new governing body on these representative lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of compensation, I think it would be found that most of these institutions are voluntary institutions to begin with, and that their main concern as such is to provide the most up-to-date hospital facilities that can be provided.  By merging their interests with the local authority, and by subsequently getting, I presume, substantial grants from the Hospitals Trust Funds, they will probably be able to secure the establishment of a new up-to-date and properly equipped institution, and that, I take it, is their primary object as members of a committee of management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that that is not the case as far as I am concerned.  I think that Deputy Browne has given a true picture of the position, so far as the egg export business applies to his area.  From my limited knowledge of the transport business in connection with the egg export trade, I would say that the egg export trade as established and carried on in the constituency which he represents is a well-paying and profitable business.  If the Minister agrees with that version of things, I will ask him also to agree that that is not the position in other parts of the country.  In the part of the country represented by Deputy Browne there have been men in the egg dealing and egg exporting business for a long period of years, and as far as I know they will be able to meet all the requirements of the Minister so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a reference to the bartering business and the extent to which it is carried on in parts of the country.  The farmer's wife or the wife of an agricultural labourer in most of the midland counties goes into a shop where her family has been dealing perhaps for generations, hands the eggs over the counter to the shopkeeper, and gets tea, sugar and tobacco in return for them.  There is, of course, an understanding that the eggs are purchased at a certain price, but no money is exchanged.  Although I am in favour of the policy contained in the Bill, and will encourage the Minister, as I have done in the past, to go ahead with any policy that will produce for the farmer or the farmer's wife a cash return for everything they sell, I do not want to see businesses wiped out wholesale by a stroke of the pen.  The egg dealer's business in the part of the country <Col N="765" /> where that kind of trade has been going on must be allowed to disappear gradually, and I would suggest to the Minister that he might take back this sub-section of the Bill and reconsider it in the light of some kind of a proposal whereby the people who have been carrying on a mixed trade, including the egg business, should be given a reasonable period of time to comply with the Minister's requirements, or then get out.  The section as it stands, as far as I can interpret it, would mean the wiping out of that section of the retailer's business right away.  It would mean the wiping out of that section of the trade where they have been dealing in the egg business.  I take it that that is a correct interpretation of this sub-section of the Bill as it now stands.  If that is so, I think it is rather drastic, and I think the section deserves to be reconsidered in the light of the existing conditions of the people who have been carrying on a mixed trade, particularly in the midland counties.  The small trader who has been engaged in purchasing eggs from the farmers or other people engaged in egg production, buys eggs on the one hand for the purpose of selling them to people elsewhere.  When they cannot dispose of all the eggs which they have bought in that particular way, they are going to hand over the remainder <Col N="766" /> of them at the end of a lengthy period to whatever exporter will come along and buy them.  I think the retailers who have been engaged in that kind of trade are mainly responsible for selling stale eggs, simply because they cannot dispose of them to some other local person.  At any rate, I do not want to see the small traders who have been making some portion of their livelihood out of this business wiped out by a stroke of the pen.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if the Minister takes back the sub-section for consideration he can find some other and easier way of bringing the egg dealers of the future into line with his requirements. So far as new dealers are concerned, I thoroughly agree with him and give him my entire support in insisting on the most rigid red-tape regulations which will operate to assist in making the egg export business a profitable one, which will compel the dealers and exporters to provide better quality eggs for the export market, and get a better price for the egg producer.  I would ask him to agree to take back the sub-section for further consideration in the light of the conditions in which the small traders have been operating in the midland counties.</P>

      <P>Is it proposed under Section 30 to increase the number of stamps that are being put on eggs? At present the only two stamps that would ordinarily appear on an egg are &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cold-stored&rdquo; in the proper season.

      <P>I take this occasion to ask the Minister in connection with these stamping sections if there is any chance, if we succeeded in raising the standard of our eggs to what we expect it is going to be before it satisfies us, of persuading the British Department of Agriculture to make an exception in respect of Irish eggs in regard to stamping them?  All our problems of export of agricultural <Col N="770" /> surplus to England hinge around the desire of Great Britain to have available abundant supplies of food in case of war.  We can provide that food but we can only provide that food in case of war if we receive the stimulus of active demand in time of peace.  If we could get exemption from the necessity of stamping our eggs, as the people in Northern Ireland have, I believe that the British egg producer and the Irish egg producer together could very nearly supply the British market and, if we did not completely supply the British market with a full peace-time supply, we could certainly meet the entire British requirement of eggs in time of war.  Surely it would be worth making the point to the British Department of Agriculture that there is nothing to be gained by getting our eggs stamped in this way.  They are identical with the eggs that are going to Great Britain at the present time from Northern Ireland.  In fact there may be two hens sitting side by side in the same nest; and one hen belongs to a Northern Ireland farmer and the other to a farmer in Eire, and when one hen gets up the egg goes to England without any mark and when the other hen gets up it has two stamps put on it.  In those circumstances I think an unanswerable case can be made to the British Department of Agriculture for a concession to our industry along those lines.  The Minister says&mdash; excuse me if I seem to be controversial&mdash;but I think that the Minister says that the stamping of the egg is in fact an advantage because people know Irish eggs to be so good that they covet them and look for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a grand proclamation for the edification of the foreign Press, but there is no use saying that to anyone who has practical knowledge of the egg trade.  Tell the egg exporters of this country: &ldquo;You may stamp your egg or you need not stamp your egg,&rdquo; and see how many of them will stamp the egg, because all of us who were in the trade know that it will be worth a preference of 15 per cent. to us, certainly 10 per cent., if we were exempted from the obligation <Col N="771" /> to stamp our eggs.  The public have it in their head when they get a &ldquo;new-laid&rdquo; egg that, by some miracle, the hen laid the egg this morning and they buy it in Dorset Street or Grafton Street that afternoon. Those of us who are in the trade know if they buy the egg within a week of the hen laying it they are damn lucky.  The English housewife seeing an egg without a stamp on it thinks this egg was just laid by the hen next door, but when she sees the stamp on it she attributes that egg to a foreign hen, that egg has travelled over wide oceans and has been a long time coming and, as a matter of fact, many an egg that came from Ireland reaches the London market far quicker than an egg laid in Scotland.  That housewife does not think of that.  She thinks an unmarked egg was laid by the neighbour's hen, just outside the boundary of London or outside the boundary of Birmingham.  She can see the hen shaking herself in the immediate neighbourhood after cackling almost on her threshold.  The moment the mark goes on it she thinks it is a foreign hen, a strange and exotic hen that has laid that egg and that the egg has passed through many hands before it comes to the grocer who offers it to her.  That is worth 10 per cent. to her, that absurd obsession in the mind of the purchaser in Great Britain.  It is worth at least 10 per cent. to us.  I put it as high as 15 per cent.  Would is not be worth while opening negotiation with the British Department of Agriculture to get that advantage?  I am not suggesting that by going over to-morrow morning you could get it, but is it not something you might profitably discuss with the Department of Agriculture in Great Britain with a view to getting that concession for our people?</P>

      <P>I quite see that the Deputy has made a very good case which should be convincing to the British Government that such a thing would be desirable from their point of view as well as ours, but I am afraid that we would not convince them, however, to change the scheme that they <Col N="772" /> have in operation.  It would possibly make a difference of 10 or 15 per cent. Probably that.  I did say here on the Second Reading that Deputies should not try to compare North of Ireland prices with ours because of different weights and standards.  I think the Deputy is right in putting it at 15 per cent.  I said before that by marking our eggs and by making our eggs very good we might reach as good a price. I admit that is only the second best thing.  It is something to console us. I do not think we could succeed in getting the British Government to change that regulation.  I would certainly be only too glad if it could be done.  It would save us a great deal of trouble as well as getting the better prices we undoubtedly would get.</P>

    <P>This sub-section as it now stands empowers the inspector who may suspect <Col N="773" /> that there is something wrong with the package or case of eggs to detain the case of eggs, or whatever else it may be, for, in the words of the sub-section, &ldquo;so long as may be reasonably necessary for the purposes of this section.&rdquo;  What is the meaning of &ldquo;so long as may be reasonably necessary&rdquo; as far as the Minister or his advisers are concerned?

      <P>Perhaps I can illustrate it by an example.  I gave an example on Second Reading of the sort of thing that might make this necessary, but it will not be necessary very often.  A certain exporter, who feels that he would like to evade examination as far as possible, might be inclined to select a route where a boat did not go very often, rush his consignment when the boat would be sailing, and make the plea to the inspector: &ldquo;Surely you are not going to keep these eggs back for a week or a fortnight until there is another boat going&rdquo;?

      <P>Before Section 38, page 23, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may be order make regulations requiring every registered wholesaler to place in every package of eggs intended to be consigned by him to any place whether inside or outside Ireland, before it is consigned, a document in the form prescribed by such regulations requesting the consignee of such package to notify the Minister of any defects found by him in such package or in the eggs contained therein or in the packing of such eggs therein.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every registered wholesaler who fails to comply with any regulation made under this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable, on summary conviction thereof, to a fine not exceeding five pounds.</P>
      <P>This is a matter that arose after the Bill had been drafted.  It was pointed out to me that, on certain occasions, when people in the trade in England had some complaint to make against Irish eggs they did not make the complaint but, much to our disadvantage, decided not to take Irish eggs again. We presume that they felt there was no use in complaining to the exporter. We thought that in some cases, at least, if this were put in, they might possibly write to the Department making a complaint about the condition of the eggs.  It is not a great inconvenience for any exporter.  The cards would be supplied to him.  He has only to fill in the number, of whatever it may be, and put the card in the case before exporting.  It is possible that in that way we might get complaints from time to time from recipients on the other side about the condition of the eggs which arrived there which may be useful for the officers of this Department.</P>

      <P>Doing business with them is a pretty formidable occupation. They are difficult people to deal with. You have to stand on your rights and fight your corner very hard, and the trade is not infrequently punctuated with ferocious battles.  I do not want consignees, every time they get involved in a quarrel with an Irish consignor, to send complaints to the Minister and get a black mark against the consignor in the Department.  If the Minister requires a consignor to put in these cards I want him to instruct his officers to bear clearly in mind that such a report should be looked upon with the utmost possible reserve and that wherever possible complaints of that character should be checked up on at once by the local representatives of the Department.</P>

Simply because a man is engaged in trade, we should not give another man, with whom he has trade relations in England, the right to libel him under the protection of the Minister.

      <P>Has the Minister considered the problem about the very bad exporter who washes eggs?  What is going to be the immediate reaction to that?  The women are going to wash the eggs at home, and that is the dilemma that you have to face.  What are you going to do about it?  The Minister speaks as if it were perfectly easy to distinguish, over a lamp, the difference between a washed egg and an egg that has not been washed.  It is not.  A washed egg can look very like a trade egg.  I find it very difficult, except in very gross cases, to distinguish between a washed and a trade egg.  Now, if a woman has dirty eggs on her dresser and she has either to make up her mind whether she will throw them out if she has more than enough eggs for the household, or wash them and take whatever price she can get for them, she will wash them, and wash them I think not as satisfactorily as the egg merchant.  I agree that the ultimate objective should be to get clean eggs, because no egg that has been washed can compare with the egg that has not been washed.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that he is going to get clean eggs in this way, or has he some plan in connection with this section&mdash;some intensive scheme for facilitating the production of clean eggs.  Perhaps he might consider extending that part of the Gaeltacht Housing scheme which makes available loans and grants for the building of hen-houses to the rest of Ireland. He may be doing that already, but if he is nobody knows it.  I think it would be far better for the Minister to undertake a drive of that kind rather than be incurring public expense by issuing advertisements to persuade people to eat more bacon. We have been eating bacon in this country for more than 100 years, and now the Minister is exhorting the people to eat more.</P>

If the Minister has a scheme analogous to the Gaeltacht housing scheme for good hen-houses, then I would advise him to publish it and make it known to the people.  I sincerely believe it would be of material help to the Minister, politically and economically.  If the Minister would declare that, as from 1st January, he wanted a great drive made to revive the poultry industry in this country: that the maize meal mixture scheme was going to be would up and that pure maize would be made available to the people, and advertised loans for good hen-houses, and urged everybody to set eggs, then I think you would get some real progress made towards producing sound eggs and clean eggs.  I would be prepared to accept the Minister's proposals for getting clean eggs if he would accompany them by an intensive scheme of propaganda on the lines that I suggest. You cannot get clean eggs unless you have the right kind of hen-houses, and unless you get the women of the country to believe that they are going to make money out of eggs, your scheme will be a failure.</P>

Is it intended to send inspectors to these houses to make inquiries with regard to any eggs that may happen to be found in them&mdash;to ascertain whether they are intended for sale or not?  It seems to me that the section will be a difficult one to enforce.  How will the retailers of eggs be affected?  You have a good many people who are engaged extensively in poultry farming. The retailers of eggs are under the impression that they are required to register under this Bill.</P>

      <P>There is no necessity for them to register because retailers are not dealt with in this Bill.  With regard to the washing of eggs, I am relying on the experts in the Department who say that washing can be detected.  An inspector cannot summon a farmer for having washed or dirty eggs on the premises because they might not be for sale at all.  It is a different matter, of course, if the farmer exposes the eggs for sale in a market town.  In that case, he can be dealt with under the Bill, as he could under the old Act.  A person who uses a wet cloth to take dirt off an egg shortly after being laid is not regarded as having washed it.  I believe it is a very effective way of cleaning eggs.  Deputy Dillon spoke of the provision of good hen houses for producers. He seemed to think that I had acquiesced in some scheme about that.  We would hope to do that if we could get the necessary finances.</P>

      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the Deputy deliberately.  He will be able to explain his speech in Castleblayney or in Clones in the very near future.  This section proposes to empower the Minister to make regulations for a variety of purposes which will have the force of law.</P>
      <P>These regulations may, for instance, require that eggs consigned, offered or exposed for sale shall be packed in the manner and with the packing materials specified by the regulations. The regulations made under these three paragraphs will not refer to eggs packed in the registered premises of a registered wholesaler or dealer. It would appear, therefore, that the regulations made under these three paragraphs will refer to the handling of eggs by the producer, that is, the farmer or the agricultural labourer.  I should like to have an assurance on that very important point from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> While it may be reasonable to require that all eggs sent by a farmer or an agricultural worker are packed in the specified manner, there is no need to require the producer to offer or expose for sale in any particular manner.  If the producer is merely exposing or offering eggs for sale in his own house, the potential purchaser is free to reject them, but it should not be made a criminal offence to offer or expose for sale otherwise than in accordance with the regulations.  I would like to know to what extent the section affects the farmer or the agricultural labourer, or to what extent the proposed regulations will affect them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something in what the Deputy says with regard to paragraph (c), but if eggs are offered or exposed for sale they may have to be marked in accordance with the regulations, if we make a mark, as we may.  We hope, when we make some further progress, to have a mark of the date of packing.  It may be necessary to have that mark and, therefore, under paragraph (d) and (e) there would be a good case for leaving things as they are in the section.  I admit it is not necessary yet, but when it comes to marking, it may be necessary to have these powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very much by reference. Sections 2 and 3 first come up for mention.  The experience gained in the <Col N="787" /> administration of the Principal Act of 1935 showed that as far as creamery butter was concerned the Act fulfilled its purpose with little difficulty and at relatively small cost to the State.  That part of the Act relating to the imposition and collection of levy on non-creamery butter proved in practice difficult to administer and so costly as to render its continuance undesirable. The collection of levy on non-creamery butter was suspended as from 1st January, 1937.  The suspension of levy renders the registration of dealers in non-creamery butter unnecessary. Part II of the Principal Act makes it mandatory on the Minister to keep registers of dealers in non-creamery butter and makes it an offence for persons to carry on business unless registered.  Paragraphs (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the Principal Act relate to the payment of levy by producers and distributors of non-creamery butter.  The purpose of Sections 2 and 3 of the present Bill is to enable the Minister to suspend the operation of these provisions of the Principal Act as and when he considers it desirable.  It will be noted that the power of suspension is made retrospective and it is the intention in due course to make suspension effective as from 1st January, 1937.  The reason for that is that we have not been pressing these people to keep up registration, seeing there was no other cause for it, apart from the legal obligation under the Principal Act.  We had intended to bring in this Bill sooner to do away with the obligation of keeping that register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Section 4, the power of the Minister to collect a levy on butter is confined to collecting such, in the case of creamery butter, from the manufacturer, and, in the case of non-creamery butter, from persons registered in the registers of butter factories or of non-manufacturing exporters kept under the Dairy Produce Acts or in the register of dealers in non-creamery butter provided for in Part II of the Principal Act.  The latter register has not been kept since January 1937, and will not be kept during the period when Part II of the Act is suspended. The fact that a levy was collectible <Col N="788" /> only from certain specified persons, namely creamery proprietors and registered factory owners, or non-manufacturing exporters and the dealers already referred to, has been a handicap on occasions in regulating the butter trade.  Power is, therefore, being sought to recover levies, if and when necessary, in respect of butter which has left the manufacturer's hands in the case of creamery butter, or in the case of non-creamery butter, is in the possession of persons at present beyond reach.  The object of the provision is to make speculation in butter unprofitable.  For instance, if at any time it were found necessary to prescribe a higher minimum wholesale price for butter&mdash;distributors who had large quantities of butter in stock at the time the higher price came into operation would reap a profit to which they were not entitled.  By imposing a levy equivalent approximately to the increase in value on the butter in stock when the rise takes place, the distributors would have the same margin of profit as if no increase had been effected.</P>
    <P>On Section 5, I want to point out that Section 10 of the Principal Act enabling a registered person to obtain a certificate of registration, was not in practice available.  It is proposed, therefore, to repeal it.</P>
    <P>The objects of Section 6 are to enable the repayment of levy to persons who purchased cream, on which levy had been paid, and subsequently exported it, or who used the purchased cream for manufacture into butter on which levy was duly paid.</P>
    <P>Section 7 gives power to amend a levy order as from a date prior to the making of the Amending Order but only by reducing the rate of levy prescribed in the original Order.  For instance, if an Order were made fixing a rate of levy of 6/- from 1st May, we are taking power to make an Order, on say, 1st July, reducing the rate from 1st June, if we find it possible and desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9 and 10 are designed to simplify procedure on occasions when butter is imported.  At present levy has to be prescribed and paid prior to the issue of an import licence.  It is impossible as a rule to determine the <Col N="789" /> appropriate levy&mdash;<i>i.e.,</i> levy at a rate that would producer no gain or loss on subsequent sale in the country&mdash;on imported butter accurately in advance; accordingly, it is proposed to take power to amend an import levy Order and to dispense with the necessity for prepayment of levy.</P>
    <P>It would on occasions have been convenient in the past to have amended a bounty order so as to enable the payment of a bigger bounty on exports during a specified period.  This course was not possible and it is now desired under Section 11 to obtain that power. Hitherto, only the seller of butter at less than the prescribed minimum price has committed an offence.  It is desirable that the purchaser should also be made amenable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often the purchaser is a more guilty party than the other. He is, perhaps, a person with very considerable means who may attempt to get butter cheaper from some hard-up creamery by offering cash down, and he may succeed in tempting the creamery to sell the butter.  In that case it would be more just to sue the purchaser than the seller.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, the state of frantic confusion to which the dairying industry in this country has now got as a result of the innumerable levies, counter-levies and Bills devised by the Government is such a thing as cannot be understood by anybody except somebody who devotes his entire life in following the twists and turns of the dairy produce legislation of the Minister.  It amuses me very much to see that the levy on farmer's butter has now gone up the spout.  At one time it was high treason to suggest that the legislation imposing such levies should be amended.  Deputies Corry, Smith and some others of the Fianna Fáil Party foamed at the mouth when that was suggested.  But that system of levies went on until it became politically impossible, and then the levies went up the spout.  They went up the <Col N="790" /> spout in the same way as the maize meal mixture.

      <P>The Minister says, with regard to a levy he is empowered to make under this Act, that in the event of its being made it will be used for the producers' benefit&mdash;that is, the levy on profits accruing to persons holding large stocks of butter when the minimum price is raised.  Would he tell us how are these levies going to be used for the producers' benefit?  Are they going to be paid into any existing fund which will ultimately result in the producer getting a larger price for his milk?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the purchaser should be made liable, and for this reason.  Under Section 12 the creamery manager is continually fixed with notice of the minimum price, but the average grocer dealing in butter does not know the minimum price and is not interested in orders made from time to time fixing the minimum price. It is quite true that a creamery manager might be tempted by a cash offer to take less than he was supposed to take, and it is equally true that a shopkeeper might be tempted by an offer of butter, which looked to be good value, to take it without inquiring into the matter of minimum price and so on, but it is no part of a shopkeeper's job to give effect to this dairying code; that is the business of <Col N="793" /> the creameries and of the producer. The shopkeeper's business, primarily, is to get the cheapest commodity he can for his customers, and to get it where and how he can, provided that he is within the law.  I say that to increase the number of precautions he must take in order to comply with the law is to increase his burdens too much.  I say that he should not be expected to make these enquiries, and I submit to the Minister that the only person that should be made liable under Section 12 is the dairy man or the creamery manager who, knowing the regulations full well, sells the butter in contravention of the law.  I do not know what the end of all this levying and so forth is going to be so far as the dairying industry is concerned, but this much I am certain of: that either the whole dairying industry ought to be radically altered so as to secure an equal supply of butter both for winter and summer, or else we should chuck entirely the business of producing butter and give the milk, free if necessary, to the people of this country.  Let us regard milk as a by-product of the livestock industry and let us distribute it to the urban populations of the country as being the best possible food they can get.  I offer that as an alternative to a complete reorganisation of the creamery trade which would put us on an equality with Denmark.  That would involve a level of production being maintained, both in winter and in summer, and adequate to supply the British demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in trying to build up the trade on the basis of an adequate summer supply and no supply at all in the winter.  It will never get anywhere on that basis, and it will become a permanent burden on the backs of the consumers of this country.  It should not be allowed to become that. If there is going to be a subsidy, and if you cannot maintain that level of production, then buy the milk, give 5d. a gallon for it, or whatever the price may be, and give the milk away to the poor people of this country, because there are thousands of people in the cities of this country who are badly in need of additional supplies of milk.  If <Col N="794" /> we were to do that we would get some value for our money, but at present all it means is that our people are being heavily taxed to provide the British people with cheap butter.  If there is any cheap food going around it should be given to the poor of our cities and not to the poor of Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.  Our people are paying more for butter so that the people of Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester may get butter cheap.  We must do one thing or the other.  Let us concentrate on live stock and dispose of the by-product of that industry, which is milk, to our own people, or else let us concentrate on dairying with a view to providing an adequate supply for both winter and summer. Above all, however, let us stop this patching and cobbling with the dairying industry.  Make up your minds to do it one way or the other, and then do it in the right way.</P>

      <P>I am interested in Section 4, where the Minister takes power to put levies on butter.  I think that the Minister said that this was to be done in the interests of the dairying community, but one has reason to fear that it might work in the other direction. How does the Minister propose to prevent this thing being passed on to the consumer and the public in general?  I have a fear that this may be used to relieve the Exchequer from the expenses of paying subsidies, and I say that if there is going to be any benefit to the ordinary consumer, who paid quite sufficient for butter in the past few years, something should be done to ensure that this will not be passed on to the consumer.  If this is meant to be a benefit to the consumer, there ought to be a guarantee with it, or some complementary clause, regulating the price at which the butter would be sold.  From what I have heard, there seems to be a real fear that, instead of being a benefit, this will be another burden on the backs of the urban consumers.  How does the Minister propose to operate this section without inflicting further hardship on the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion Section 4 of this Bill amounts to the imposition <Col N="795" /> of a tax on butter.  I think that what are called levies here may be described as a form of taxation.  I presume that the purpose is to pay a subsidy on butter exported.  The question of whether or not a subsidy should be paid on butter exported is very big, and I will not go into it at the moment, but I think that butter is not a commodity which should be taxed in this country, no matter what may be the purpose of such a tax.  I think that the State should not tax the necessities of life.  There may be a lot to be said for the taxing of commodities that can be regarded more or less as luxuries, but I hold that the State should not tax foodstuffs, such as butter and so on, which are a necessity of life, and which are indispensable to the poor, and to the young children of every section of the community, but particularly to the poor.  Now I think that in levying taxation for the purpose of financing any scheme, even though that scheme may be for the benefit of the dairying industry, the State should concentrate on raising the money required by some means other than taxing an essential foodstuff, and thereby raising the price of that foodstuff to the consumer in this country, because you cannot tax any commodity without raising the price of that commodity. Therefore, I think that the whole principle of this Bill is wrong inasmuch as it gives the Minister power to impose levies or indirect taxation on butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think when Deputy Dillon talks about the frantic confusion in the butter trade he really has in mind the frantic confusion of Deputies in dealing with those laws and regulations.  I quite admit that there may be something in that, because those amending Bills are very difficult for a Deputy to follow unless he goes to the trouble of getting the Acts which are already there, and studying the changes and the effects of those changes.  That is one of the the great disadvantages of legislation by reference, but one cannot really <Col N="796" /> codify legislation in a case of this kind, where there has practically been an annual Bill.  Perhaps when we get down to a more settled system in regard to the butter question, we may be able to bring in one Bill to codify the whole thing, so that everybody will be able to follow the matter more easily.</P>
      <P>As far as the butter trade itself is concerned, there is no such thing as frantic confusion.  I do not think there is anything in this country regulated so well, and which gives an advantage to the producer and the consumer at the same time.  The pro ducer knows exactly what he is going to get for his butter.  There is a set price given.  He knows what he is going to get.  The consumer knows what he is going to pay for butter. I think the consumer who knows that he is going to pay whatever is the price for the time being&mdash;the prices are fixed for quite a long period as a rule&mdash;is in a much better position than he was formerly when butter was up a penny one week, down a penny next week, and so on.  In all probability he felt that the people in the butter trade were not losing by it anyway: that they were going to take every advantage they could in putting up the price to him.  As I say, the legislation may be difficult, but at least the producer and the consumer know exactly where they stand, and from their point of view I think the system is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could never accept the argument that is made by Deputies here&mdash;it was made by Deputy Dillon this evening &mdash;that we were taxing our own consumers in order to give cheap butter to Great Britain.  The system which we have tried to adopt here as far as possible is to charge the consumer here what we regard as a fair price for butter.  I do not think anybody can find fault with the present price of 1/5, nor could even find fault if it were dearer still.  The stories that are told about the price of butter in Great Britain are entirely wrong.  I happened to be in London lately and I went into a grocer's shop.  They had no Irish butter, but the New Zealand butter which sells at the same price <Col N="797" /> was marked 1/8.  That was within the last month.  Anybody listening to Deputies here in the Dáil would imagine that the English people were getting our butter at 10d. or 11d. It is obvious that they cannot get it at any such price.  When you look at the price they are paying for our butter imports to Great Britain, it is quite obvious that at least they cannot get it any cheaper than our consumers get it here.  It does appear that the people who are handling the butter in Great Britain have more out of it than the people who are handling it here.</P>
    <P>With regard to the farmers' levy, I did advocate the farmers' levy, but I did it at a time when butter was very much lower.  The world price of butter at that time was as low as 68/-.  I would remind Deputy Dillon that in 1934-5 we actually paid out, in subsidies and bounties, over £2,000,000&mdash; £2,500,000&mdash;and if we had at that time brought the price of milk to the farmer up to 5d. per gallon it would at least have cost another £1,000,000, which makes the £3,000,000 he spoke of.  It would not cost that now because the world price is very much better.  The world price will average this year possibly 112/- or 114/-.  At that time the average was under 70/-, which is a very big difference.  At that time if we had not got the farmers' butter levy, we could not put a levy, or much of a levy, anyway, on the creameries.  You might put a small levy, but if the levy on the creameries were to exceed, say, 9/- per cwt., that is about 1d. per lb., the creameries would be at a serious disadvantage as against the producers of farmers' butter if there was no levy on farmers' butter at the same time. That is one thing about it, but apart from that altogether there was a separate pool created for farmers' butter, and by levying farmers' butter that was being consumed at home it was possible to pay a good levy on the export of non-creamery butter, and in that way to raise the general price of farmers' butter all round and confer an advantage on the farmer.  I never considered that a difficult thing to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputies opposite did consider it a hard thing to see, or at least they pretended to, but I think they should have seen that that system was at least in the interests of the farmer.  I am just as much entitled to say that as Deputy Dillon is to say it was not.  I hold honestly, and I am convinced as much of that as of anything that was every done, that the farmers' levy was in the interests of the farmer.  I know that any Deputy in this House who every took the trouble to understand the system would agree with me, but there are Deputies of course who do not want to take the trouble to understand it, because it suits them better to argue against it. The point was raised by Deputy Dillon that we should not inflict a penalty on the purchaser.  The instance given by the Deputy is that the ordinary grocer is not so interested in the fixed price, and so on, and may not know what the fixed price is.  This, I think, never does apply to the ordinary grocer.  The ordinary grocer usually has to pay the minimum price, if he does not pay a little more, and he may have to buy at retail terms, which would be more than the wholesale price; but the sort of person that I have in mind is the big wholesaler who has ready cash and who can offer a creamery cash down for a consignment.  It is very tempting to the creamery to give him a slight cut in order to get the money, of which it is sorely in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one rather big point raised by Deputy Dillon, and that is in regard to the even supply all the year round.  It is a very big question, but I should like to say that there are people both on this and on the other side who do not consider that that would be any great advantage to this country.  I must say that I have always been inclined to agree with the Deputy on that point, but I have heard a rather convincing argument against it from people both here and on the other side, and there may be something in the contention that we might be able to do as well in the ordinary seasonal trade that we do at the moment, our trade being replaced by the New Zealand and Australian trade in their flush season and our <Col N="799" /> slack season.  There may be something in that.  Deputy Keyes, I think, is wrong in believing that under Section 4 the Exchequer would make any saving.  As a matter of fact, what happens is that the Dáil votes a certain amount for subsidies to the creamery industry.  That amount is spent always, by keeping the price of butter as high as possible with the money at our disposal.  Section 4 deals principally with people who may have butter on hands at a time of change in prices.  For instance, if a dealer in butter has a big lot on hands, and we come along and say we are putting the price up 9/- a cwt., that dealer will get the benefit of the 9/- unless, at the time, we say we are taking a levy of 9/- for butter on hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am satisfied that the setting up of the Agricultural Commission is a step in the right direction, I agree with Deputy Cogan and with Deputies on the Independent Benches, that immediate help is needed. I am satisfied that the present year has been one of the hardest that the farmers have passed through.  It may be said that the economic war is over, and that the country is now reaping the benfit of the settlement.  That is all right for people who had their lands stocked, and who had the means to carry on.  But the land of large numbers of small farmers was denuded of stock and they have no money to purchase even a few cows.  I am sorry to say that that class are now in debt to the banks, to the Agricultural Credit <Col N="801" /> Corporation, and to other institutions. In the past, that type of farmer was the real mainstay of the country.  The Government should take this matter in hands boldly by coming to the aid of these people by issuing cheap money. If they did that they would do more for the farmers than all the talk that we heard from Deputies.  Land belonging to that class of farmer has been denuded of stock for years through no fault of the owners.  It was these men kept the fairs and markets going.  They paid their way always and they are now entitled to fair consideration from an Irish Government.  The issue of cheap, long-term loans is most essential at present, because for a number of years farmers have given up the draining, reclaiming land or manuring of land.  If the country is to be got into full production farmers who always drained the land and gave employment should get the opportunity of doing so again.  The issue of a long-term loan would confer immense benefit on the agricultural community.  There should also be a cessation of the collection of rates once the agricultural commission has been set up.</P>
      <P>While I do not expect the Government to be able to do everything at once, I think they should fund the arrears of unpaid annuities.  They did it before, and I do not see why they should not do it again.  At present, farmers do not know whether they own their land, whether they have to pay the original rent or half of it.  The rent should be fixed on a certain basis and should be standardised.  Some men who owe six or seven half-yearly instalments will not be able to meet their debts. The only hope is to spread the amount over a number of years and to give these people a chance of getting into production again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that would be of immense benefit to the agricultural community would be free imports of seeds, manures, and also machinery that cannot be manufactured here. These should be allowed in duty free as in the past.  I remember when middle-class farmers in my county imported perhaps three or five tons of basic slag for their land.  Dozens of carts were engaged drawing that slag home from the canal.  For the last six <Col N="802" /> or seven years farmers never do anything like that.  In fact, they do not worry about farmyard manure, and, as a result, the land is going into rushes. That is not right.  If we are to pass on the old tradition of working the land for all it is worth that position should be changed.</P>
    <P>The fairs affect the prosperity of our country towns.  Perhaps four or five fairs were held in each county in the year and they brought money and business to the towns.  These fairs have almost disappeared.  As a new type of business has started I should like if the Government could step in to deal with it.  The new game is for a class of jobbers or middlemen from God knows where to buy stock on the lands. It is rarely that a strong farmer goes to fairs with cattle now.  They are sold on the land to dealers from England or Scotland, and the towns reap no benefit from such transactions.  The bringing of people into the fairs meant that the shops, the drovers and the unemployed got a little benefit.  The new system has done a great deal of harm to the towns and has broken up the fairs.  These middlemen buy the cattle and give no one else a chance of earning a shilling.  Concessions have been given to all classes in the community, with the exception of farmers. The labourers have got fixed wages.  I do not begrudge them.  They are entitled to them.  They have also got cottages and new houses to which they are entitled.  In the last four or five years, nearly all officials, big and small, have got increased salaries and fixed pensions, but farmers, who are the real producers, got nothing.  That is unfair.  Before fixing wages the men who have to pay them should be given the means to do so, because they will pay the wages without Government interference if they are able to do so.  The cause of the trouble I believe is because we have a Government in power which will not take the only step that is worth taking, and that is to give the agricultural community an opportunity of making agriculture a paying proposition.  We have a flight from the land at present.  In the past, labourers from the West of Ireland and from congested districts <Col N="803" /> flocked to England and Scotland to earn a living as potato pickers, or as the hewers of wood and drawers of water.  I am sorry to say that from County Meath, which is supposed to be a wealthy county, I have seen labourers, and also farmers' sons, going away to become potato pickers in England and Scotland.  That happened previously only in the time of the famine.  I hope that some steps will be taken to see that the farming community get a living at home, instead of having to go to England and Scotland to look for work.  If the agricultural problem was tackled in the proper way we would not have to be asking for doles, sops and bounties to try to keep things going.  There would be no need for that if farming was made a paying proposition.  The unemployment problem will then solve itself.  Every farmer who could make profit on his land would give more employment.</P>
    <P>If he was doing well he would employ more labour.  I see around my own county farmers who formerly employed anything from five to 15 men, and sometimes 20, who are to-day employing only one, two and three, and some of these in a casual capacity. Surely to God, there is something wrong in a county like mine when you find the farmers not employing labour.  It is not their fault.  If it was a paying proposition they would give employment.  It is not a paying proposition, and therefore they must let their land go into grass or weeds, or whatever they like it to go into.</P>
    <P>Another important item which I think should have been tackled, not alone to-day, but 14 or 15 years ago, is in connection with some of our largest people in the farming community who were very strongly in production in both the tillage and live stock trade.  In the year 1921 a large number of these people got the huge crash.  They got the crash right down from that to the year 1932, when they got the real death fall again.  Those people, through no fault of their own, have very heavy debts in either their banks or the Agricultural Credit Corporation or something like that.  They are in debt through no fault of their <Col N="804" /> own.  They have been producing and doing the nation's work, and through unforeseen circumstances, instead of their land being a paying proposition, they were driven into debt with the bank.  I think, now that a national Government is in power, these things should be remedied, because it is unfair. These people are our best people.  They are, in fact, the people who rushed into business when it was good and have done what we wanted them to do, and have given employment in both tillage and the live stock trade.  To-day and for the last 15 years they are in one of the most deplorable plights of anyone in this country.  They find their land is not their own.  The bank owns it.  There is perhaps £500 or £5,000 debt over their heads.  They find that instead of working the land for themselves, they have it set to some class of middleman on the 11 months system. They have looked to the Irish Governments&mdash;the first and the second Governments&mdash;they have rushed to T.D.s and everybody, but all in vain, and I say it is our duty as national people in our own Parliament to come to the aid of these men.  They are at present no use to themselves and no use to the community, and I think that they are certainly entitled to some consideration.  It is not their fault. The crash came without their knowledge, and I think there should be a fifty-fifty basis brought about between those to whom they owe the debt and themselves.  It should be done and could be done without any hardship to anybody, but they are left in a position in which they are no use to themselves or to the community in general.  It is a pitiable thing, at a time when there is a chance of this country recovering again, to see the farmers going out of production.  It is certainly the truth to say they are going out of production.  We see less tillage and less labour on the land. Is not that a poor prospect for a country which we were told for the last six or seven years was rounding the corner?  It must be a very long corner, for we do not see around it yet.  We want to see in this country more eggs, more poultry, more tillage <Col N="805" /> and more employment.  To bring that about, the Government has a problem to tackle and should tackle it.  I believe myself that the Minister for Agriculture, if he wants to save his face, ought to tackle his problems with his coat off.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand at all the mentality of the Labour Party in this House.  Nobody seems to understand them.  They were for three or four months here and they could not even think of an amendment.  When we were in the happy position of getting the Government to agree to set up a commission we really thought that, instead of talking, that commission should be set up and that we could get on with the work.  I am sorry to say that all the talk that is going on has kept back this commission and the sooner that commission reports the better for us all.  At the last moment the Labour Party came in with an amendment.  I do not know what they brought it in for.  Another Deputy had that amendment in long before them. It seemed they wanted to get some political capital out of it if they could at all.  I want to tell the Labour Party that they and they alone are responsible for more of the troubles and ills of this country to-day than Fianna Fáil.  They could have put Fianna Fáil out of office from the year 1932 to 1936 if they wanted to do it.  They would not do it.  They were not the friend of the farmer then, but they whine and cry to-day and say they are the friend of the farmer.  Why do they say that?  Because the Labour type of people have deserted them and have found they are no use for anything.  I say to the Labour Party: &ldquo;Do your duty to your own people.  Do your duty to yourselves.  Instead of bowing to the Labour in the North and to the Reds in Spain, go and bow to the poor unfortunate hungry farmers in your own country and see about setting up this commission.  Help to relieve us of our ills, and do not try to make political capital at the expense of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Irish farmers have suffered for the last six years without taking a definite stand. I believe they were entitled to take a <Col N="806" /> definite stand.  We heard of labour strikes in our big factories and all over the country and they are entitled to have them.  The farmer was entitled to strike, and I believe if the farmer did his duty to himself and his children he should have struck and refused to produce anything on his land.  He should have sat down and left the City of Dublin, which is becoming wealthy at the countryman's expense, to think where they were getting their cheap food.  If the farmer did that I can tell you that any Government in power would toe the line and come to the relief of the man who was on strike because the strike would be a just one. It would be the most just strike that ever took place in Ireland.  It is a shame to see the City of Dublin fattening and battening at the expense of the man who is producing the food that is put on his table.  I would say to the farmer: &ldquo;You have slept on it too long, and it is time you woke up.&rdquo;  If this commission brings him nothing, and that his case is put on the long finger, on the shelf, I think it is his duty to sit down and produce no more until he makes these wealthy people in Dublin who are fattening and battening at his expense, realise that, if he goes out of production they will go into starvation.  So I hope Mr. Tom Kelly, who is a city man, will realise that we can throttle him if we want to.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to prolong this debate, because I agree with Deputy Giles that if the talk is going to continue it will delay the commission.  I think he ought to have thought about that himself, because he made a long speech the last evening and continued again to-day.  I do not intend to prolong the debate, but I think, after the speech made by Deputy Dillon, something has to be said.  He must not have been in earnest about it.  He seems to have been surprised that the Minister for Agriculture accepted his amendment. He did not accept the whole of it. Deputy Dillon put down an amendment, <Col N="807" /> and most of the points have been accepted.  The Minister agreed to the commission.  Deputy Dillon does not seem to have been in earnest about it at all and, judging from the remarks of some of the speakers on the Fine Gael side, they do not seem to have wanted it either. Some of them have almost anticipated and told the commission that is to be set up what findings it is to bring in. Deputy Dillon, for instance, cannot conceive of any commission not recommending derating.  Well, other people could conceive of that.  Anyway, the commission is the body to decide whether they recommend it or not. One thing we must remember is that a commission was set up by Deputy Cosgrave's Government and, after going carefully into the whole question, it recommended against derating.  When our Government were considering what relief we would bring to the farmers, the fact that this commission had reported against derating had some influence in the decision we came to to put the money towards halving the annuities, which cost more than derating would have cost.  I do not know, as I say, what this commission is going to report.  Deputy Dillon is one of those people who knows everything, and he cannot conceive of this commission not recommending derating.  As a matter of fact, judging by the speech he made here on last Wednesday, he seemed to know exactly what the commission was going to report on every subject&mdash;veterinary research, grain growing, cattle grazing and everything else.  Deputy Dillon anticipated the commission on every subject.  He could not give the Minister the credit of meaning to do well by agriculture by agreeing to set up this commission.  He had to be as offensive as he possibly could.  He said the Minister was afraid to face the mess, and &ldquo;was trying to pass the buck,&rdquo; in his own poetical language.  That was a nice spirit in which to accept the Minister's decision to set up this commission.  In the course of his speech, he said the maize meal mixture scheme &ldquo;was gone up the spout,&rdquo; that anyone who dared to criticise that scheme when it was introduced was called a traitor and all <Col N="808" /> the rest of it.  The fact of the matter is that that scheme did serve a very useful purpose when it was introduced, as every grain grower in the country knows.  It provided a market for grain at the time, and kept the grain producers in production until they were educated into the growing of wheat.</P>
      <P>Now wheat has been put on a secure basis and a large percentage of our wheat is being produced here, and I am sure even Deputy Dillon must have felt comfortable during the recent crisis when we were faced with a world war when he found that, due to the efforts of the Government of this country in the last six years, notwithstanding the economic war, we were producing a large percentage of our requirements in wheat, that we had saved our milling industry and that we were practically independent of outside resources for our supplies.  In addition, we might have had to go short of many manufactured articles if that war had come about&mdash;and we all know we are not out of the wood yet&mdash;but for the industrial policy of the Government. I say, not alone are we not ashamed of the policy that we have given effect to during the last six years, but we are proud of it and mean to continue it.  The Minister for Agriculture is quite satisfied, now that he has put wheat growing on a proper basis, that this maize meal mixture scheme can be dispensed with and accordingly he has dispensed with it. I say he was quite right to do it when he found the time had come for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon complains about the Pigs Act.  Every farmer knows that Act served a very useful purpose, too, and because Deputy Dillon gets £900 for £200 he presumes that the industry has been making enormous profits. I am sure they have been making great profits but I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is such a thing as a nuisance value.  People have what they call a nuisance value, and I think buying out Deputy Dillon for £900 was cheap.  If I happened to be a member of the board of the bacon factory I would think I had got away with it very cheaply if I got rid of him for £900.  That, I submit, is another aspect of the bacon factory case that he made which ought to be considered <Col N="809" /> before we jump to the conclusion that the shares suddenly jumped to 4½ times their value.  Nothing we have done is right&mdash;not even the acceptance of the motion&mdash;and this at a time when the Minister had actually settled with the British without any thanks to the Opposition Party.  He can thank them, of course, for their attitude during the last negotiations.  But, if they had adopted that attitude at an earlier stage, we are quite satisfied that the economic war could have been settled long before it was.</P>
    <P>We have to remember the attempts made in every way during the last six years to break this Government.  I do not want to rake up the past, but when Deputy Dillon brought us over the last six years I am entitled to go over them too and remind him of the serious situation with which we were faced.  The &ldquo;shirt&rdquo; movements, which were such a menace on the Continent, were being introduced here. Marches on the City of Dublin were threatened.  &ldquo;No rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;no annuities&rdquo; campaigns were actively pursued.  We almost had a state of war at one time, as there was a cutting of communications.  All these things were done, and Deputy Dillon was one of the people who stood for that sort of thing at a time when we were facing an attempt by the British Government to squeeze us into submission. Thanks to the powers of resistance of the Irish people and to the fact that they were not prepared to listen to those who tried to break this Government down and defeat the Irish people, we succeeded in getting a fairly satisfactory settlement for this part of the country.  We have always admitted that when the recent negotiations were taking place the Opposition Party did behave decently.  But, if they had done so at the beginning, that settlement could have been made sooner.</P>
    <P>It would be much better if Deputy Dillon and the Opposition stopped talking on this motion when the Minister agreed to accept the idea of setting up a commission.  What the terms of reference are going to be has not been decided yet.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Giles was right when he <Col N="810" /> said that there had been a lot of talk of this.  But he tried to blame the Labour Party, who hardly spoke on it at all.  I am satisfied that the Minister is not going to set up a commission until the debate is ended.  Therefore, I think the sooner it is ended the better.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something said by Deputy Fagan, who asked me to enquire about an order to the sheriff in Westmeath.  He said that an order has been made about the sheriff's fees there different from what had been in force up to recently.  There has been a change made in Westmeath undoubtedly. It has nothing to do with the Land Commission.  But the Department of Justice, when they went into the books of the sheriff, found that he was not charging the fees in that county that were charged in other counties, and the Department directed the sheriff to charge the same fees in Westmeath as were charged in other places.  That was the only change made.  As Westmeath was not being dealt with by the sheriff in the same way as the other counties, they were simply bringing it into line with the other counties and the change was made.</P>
    <P>On the question of the payment of annuities.  I have been pressed by Deputy Cogan and a deputation which he brought to me to make some arrangement for a moratorium.  My answer to that was that the Government were not prepared to do that. But if people who find themselves in arrears and are genuinely not in a position to pay would make representations to the Land Commission and make some effort to meet their liabilities, they will be met decently by the Land Commission, as they always have been.  We are not prepared to give a moratorium.  The collection of annuities, I am glad to say, is steadily improving.  We know there are people who are not in a position to pay, but there has been difficulty undoubtedly in finding out who could pay and who could not.  I am not suggesting that there is any campaign against payment now, but there certainly was for a long period.  Where the Land Commission is satisfied that people are <Col N="811" /> genuinely not able to meet their obligations, they have always been prepared, as every Deputy knows, to meet these people in a reasonable manner. All I can suggest to Deputy Cogan, and others who want to have this general moratorium, is that if they have any particular cases to make and they bring them to the notice of the Land Commission, they will be dealt with in a sympathetic way.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything more to say, but I could not allow Deputy Dillon's slanderous talk&mdash;because that is really what it was&mdash;to pass.  He did not exactly call the Minister for Agriculture an imbecile, but he said that the scheme he introduced could only have been conceived in the mind of an imbecile.  With all respect to the Chair, I think that that sort of language ought not to be allowed from Deputy Dillon or anyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasant to find the various Parties in the House unanimous in something, and there seems to be unanimity that all is not well with agriculture&mdash;that it is in a somewhat depressed condition.  That is all to the good, and it is better late than never.  But, if the general anxiety about the farmer's condition is accompanied by a genuine determination to put an end to the circumstances which retard prosperity, then we will get somewhere and something will be done.  I am glad to see from this debate that there does appear to be anxiety, if not determination, to end it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another good thing which has emerged, not alone from the debate but from some observations made outside, is that agriculture has come to be recognised as an industry.  It is the most vital industry we have in this country, one that is engaging thousands of men skilled in their job and hundreds of thousands of skilled workers.  I do not think there is any member of the House who would deny that an agricultural worker is a skilled worker.  One may say that agriculture is the sole industry that, so far as our exports are concerned, matters materially to the welfare of the country.  It supplies certain products to the people <Col N="812" /> at home in sufficient quantities, as well as products to the value of many million pounds for export.</P>
    <P>If we debate the matter in that particular light, recognising that agriculture is a very great industry and that its existence is vital to the country, then we must realise what depression in it means, not only to the occupiers of land but to thousands of workers and to the country itself.  We are losing thousands of those skilled workers.  After years of training they are fleeing to other lands, and perhaps in time it will be difficult to replace them.  We have the recognition that agriculture is an industry and not a haphazard occupation.  The feeling did exist not very long ago&mdash;perhaps it is held still in some places&mdash;that agriculture was something to be despised, and that anyone could engage in it without training and without skill.  That feeling no longer exists.  We have advanced to this extent at any rate, that the bulk of the people of the country now recognise that it is a very great industry and vital to the country. All of us are agreed that agriculture is depressed, but we are not all agreed as to the magnitude of the depression.  A figure of £20,000,000 of a loss as between one period and another has been freely mentioned in this House.  If we are down £20,000,000 in our exports, and an undetermined amount in home sales&mdash;because after all home sales are governed by the export price&mdash;that does not truly represent the position, because we have no figures to show what the increased overhead charges in the industry amount to.  Comparisons between one period and another as to produce sales prices are of very little value unless they are accompanied by figures relating to comparative costs of production.</P>
    <P>What is the amount of the loss that has been incurred in this industry in the last eight or ten years?  I cannot compute it, and I doubt if any member of the House could make even a reasonably accurate estimate of what that loss has been.  Neither do I believe that any man outside the House could make a fair estimate of what the actual loss has been, and my reason for saying that is that we have no detailed accounts of the increases in overhead <Col N="813" /> charges.  We know that the rates have gone up, that wages have gone up as well as the cost of implements, manures, feeding stuffs and other things; but in spite of all that we cannot make a really true estimate of what the actual loss incurred by the industry has been. There are other losses that one cannot compute.  Every new industry in this State, helped by a subsidy or in any other way, is in effect a new tax on the agricultural industry.  Every extension of the social services is an additional burden on the agricultural community. The cost of all the improvements in labour conditions is also an added burden.  All these have their effect.  All of them may have been necessary.  All perhaps were necessary, but our argument is that more than a fair share of the burden fell on the agricultural community: a share that was greater than it could carry.  We do not ask for the abolition of any industry or for any less generous treatment for the workers in agriculture or in any other industry.  All that we ask is that the really vital industry in this country should get a fair crack of the whip and should be given the necessary aids to prosperity.</P>
    <P>Personally, I welcome the decision of the Minister to set up a commission. I have been somewhat sceptical perhaps of commissions, but at least if the commission does nothing else it will produce a lot of material that will be of infinite value to the people of this country.  If the commission is to be in any way effective, then to my mind it must have almost limitless powers. Its activities must not be confined to production and production prices.  It must examine the aggregation of circumstances which caused the depression; it must inquire into what extent the industrialisation of this country has affected agriculture; it must inquire into the increased overhead charges in the industry.  The commission will gather valuable evidence in that way, evidence that it would not be possible for an individual to secure. It must also inquire into the question of credit generally, and the reasons which have made it impossible for agriculturists to get a loan on the security of their property.  It must also inquire into transport, and, in fact, into anything <Col N="814" /> that may seem to the commission reasonable and necessary.  All that is going to take time.  While we are awaiting the report of the commission, I do not think that we are asking anything that we ought not to ask from a home Parliament when we plead that, in the interim&mdash;now that we are all agreed that there is depression and that we are all anxious to help&mdash;some temporary relief might be offered to agriculture.  I am not going to say what form it should take.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion with regard to a moratorium.  The Minister thinks that is impossible.  The only difficulty I see about a moratorium is this, that at the end of it the arrears would have to be funded.  There was also a suggestion that the activities in connection with the collection of land annuities should be greatly reduced. Various suggestions were made as to what form the relief should take. Derating has been generally suggested as one of the things that would offer immediately effective relief to farmers. Personally, I believe it would.  There may be others who differ from me, but I think it is generally recognised that derating is one of the things that would give the most effective immediate relief.  The Minister for Agriculture, if I have correctly interpreted what he said on the matter, while not actually opposed to derating, appears to think it would be something of a cold comfort.  I think that would shortly describe what he said.  I might retort in the manner of the gentleman who, when asked whether he would have his whiskey hot or cold, replied: &ldquo;I will have a little cold while I am waiting for the hot.&rdquo;  We do not care what sort of relief we get, hot or cold. We would be grateful for any relief that the Government choose to give us, some immediate relief while we are waiting for the report of the commission. I do not think the Government are so devoid of ingenuity that they cannot think of something as a temporary relief for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Many people will say that we are looking for an agricultural Utopia. Perhaps we would be, if it were possible. What we do ask is that the House, and the Government, should <Col N="815" /> try to create an agricultural economy somewhat analogous to that pertaining to other industries; to procure for the agriculturist a fair return for the capital invested in his industry.  It is too often forgotten that there is very great capital invested here in the industry of agriculture.  If things were really right, there should be a percentage return on that capital.  We ask, further, that there should be, not only fair remuneration for the skilled workers on the farms, but that there should be equal remuneration for the farmer himself and those members of his family who assist him in his work: in other words, to put an end to the existence of unpaid slavery on the land.  That is what we ask, and what we expect eventually to get.  We believe that with the sympathy of the House expressed in this debate we are going to get something of what we ask. We anticipate valuable results from the commission which the Minister has promised to set up, whether in effect or in the amount of information it will set before the country.  I should like that any evidence given before the commission be published from day to day, so that the people generally will be really cognisant, for the first time, of the position of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I have tried, as far as possible, to keep out of the technicalities.  I have tried to avoid discussing wheat, beet, or any other technical aspect of the industry.  We ought to confine ourselves to the economic end of it, to ascertain whether there was a loss&mdash; I think we are agreed on that&mdash;and how much was the loss; to find out whether we are producing economically or uneconomically, and if uneconomically, how best to end it. Thanks be to God, I think there is an anxiety on all sides of the House to improve matters, and if the commission does nothing better than help us along that road, it will not have sat in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all appear to agree that agriculture needs a stimulus at the present time, I believe that the work of the commission will not be successful unless the report contains suggestions that will enable <Col N="816" /> the Government to set up the necessary machinery to give employment to the rural workers.  A great deal has been said about the position of the farmers.  With most of that I agree, but I do not agree with the speakers who suggest that if agriculture is prosperous the workers also will be prosperous; that they will get employment when agriculture is prosperous. That may be true in certain branches of agriculture, but it is not true as far as the cattle trade is concerned.  I have had experience for years of what the cattle trade brought to the county I represent and I know that it adversely affected population and employment. I am not anxious that we should go back to that position.  One of the Labour Deputies, speaking here, said he was satisfied that the prosperity of the farmers means prosperity for the workers.  It has been reiterated from the Opposition Benches.  I say that if we are to have prosperity in the rural districts we must have full employment for our people and there must be some measure of control by the Government to enable that to take place.  In the cattle trade, where the cattle increase in numbers the population goes down.  The more prosperity we have in the cattle trade, the lower becomes our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the situation that deserves the attention of the commission.  It is the tendency nowadays for farmers to displace the workers by the introduction of machinery. They tell us it is more progressive and more economical to invest in machinery to do the work.  It is the line of least resistance and no one can blame the farmers if they find it is economical. But in the interests of the country the matter should receive attention. I find in many cases where tillage has been carried out on a large scale during the past few years that the tractor has been used to plough the land, to sow the seeds and it has even helped to harvest the corn.  Not alone has machinery reaped it, but it has threshed it on the fields and brought it to the farm, with the result that there was scarcely any manual employment given on the large tillage farm.  The mechanisation of the agricultural <Col N="817" /> industry demands a supply of foreign petrol and oil to the exclusion of the hay and oats that would be consumed by horses.  The number of people displaced by the machine is considerable.  We have blacksmiths, harness makers, wheelwrights and others, not to mention agricultural labourers, deprived of employment in consequence of these things.  The farmer is killing his own market as far as oats, other cereals and hay are concerned. We find in the country the position to be such that it should not be tolerated.  Some people may call it progress but no one can say that it is for the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I wish to put forward is this&mdash;that we have sufficient land in this country to provide for our agricultural community.  If you take Meath. my own constituency, for instance, we have there an area of 577,000 acres. That is the approximate area of the county.  We have an agricultural male population of 16,500.  That includes farmers, farmers' sons and agricultural workers.  That gives us approximately one man for each 35 acres&mdash;that is, one man, whether farmer or labourer. When we allow for the waste land it is possible that figure would be reduced by one-third.  The average in Leinster would be found to be something smaller.  If we take the Twenty-Six Counties as a whole, allowing for the congested areas, the average would be much less.  I suppose one agricultural worker or farmer for about twenty acres.  The task would appear to be to provide that each 10 or at most 15 acres should maintain, at least, one man.</P>
    <P>If the commission approach this matter with a view to arriving at a solution, they, no doubt, will find the means to do so.  Of course, it can be suggested that the subsidies, grants, unemployment assistance and so on, should be devoted towards subsidising the farmers to enable them to meet the wage bill they would be called upon to pay for each 10 or 15 acres, which would be the outside acreage that would maintain one man.  That would certainly place us in the position that we would have productive assistance given to the country instead of unproductive <Col N="818" /> assistance and the dole.  It would also do away with rotational employment as we know it.  The country worker has no objection to the rotational scheme of employment provided full wages are guaranteed to him at the end of the week.  If the agricultural worker is employed for only four days in the week he should be entitled to a full week's wages.  That is a matter that should merit some consideration, and possibly some means might be got to overcome the position so as to enable the worker to receive a full week's wages for, say, the four days' work in which he would be engaged.</P>
    <P>I am quite aware that the farmers have a number of grievances.  Small farmers are entitled to all the consideration that it is possible to give to them.  I have no objection to grazing or to ranchers merely because of the fact that a man is a grazier or a rancher or that he is engaged in the cattle trade.  I have an objection to the system of grazing simply because it does not give the amount of employment that the welfare of the nation demands.  We are all aware that the small farmers owe money to the banks and to the Credit Corporation for many years past.  We know that in the division of the lands from 1922 to 1932 very heavy annuities were placed upon the men who got this land.  Even though the annuities were halved subsequently, they still find that the burden is pressing them too much.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of the small farmers who live in urban areas and who are compelled to bear the charge of very high urban rates.  We have the case of those farmers whose out-offices are insufficient and are not in such a state of preservation as would enable the farmers to carry on their tillage operations in the way we should like them to be carried on.  We know all these things, and while we ask that they may be rectified, we also ask that the worker who pays a share of the charges for social services&mdash;incidentally I may remark that he pays his share of the charges that arise consequent on the default of various farmers to pay their annuities&mdash;should be entitled to have his position secured. Working and living on the land should <Col N="819" /> give the farmer, the farmer's son and the worker all the facilities and advantages that are enjoyed by people in other walks of life and in the professions. The farm worker certainly should, as far as possible, have advantages similar to those given to people who are engaged in industry.  I do hope that this commission, when set up, will evolve a scheme that will be comprehensive enough to cover these matters and that the farmers' sons and agricultural workers will be placed in a position whereby they will be given full employment on the land.  If the commission approaches the matter from the point of view of providing work for everybody, I am sure their deliberations will be successful.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendments under the names of Deputy Cogan and Deputy Dillon.  Before the general election of 1932 the Fianna Fáil party promised to derate agricultural land, and if it were necessary to do so at that time, I should say it is doubly necessary to-day.  After six years of the economic war and after a number of bad harvests, I find that the farmers in Wexford, the constituency which I represent, were never so badly off and were never in a position where they needed derating so badly.  The amendment asks for what is certainly due to the farmers, unless this country is altogether to go out of tillage.  If the Government kills the goose that lays the golden egg, what will then remain?  All our wealth practically comes out of the land.  I am aware we have a few industries, but we depend mainly on the land.  I certainly support and approve of all industries that are economic, but if the farmer is not in a position to purchase our manufactured commodities what use is it trying to carry on industries?  If the farmer is bankrupt, the country is bankrupt.  We have heard a great deal from the Fianna Fáil Benches about grazing ranches and about having cattle on the land instead of men. Well, I rather think that by now most Deputies realise that what is complained about in ranching can happen just as well under mechanised farming. A man can get in tractors, binders <Col N="820" /> and reapers and give very little employment in the growing of corn.  As a practical farmer I have always advocated the raising of cattle, for I believe the system of mixed farming gives more employment than raising corn.  I know that the farmers in Wexford who raise cattle are good employers.  In fact, more employment is given on the land in cattle raising in the winter than in the summer.  Through the policy of Fianna Fáil, coupled with a very bad season this year, there are many farmers now who are not in a position to stock their lands.  It is up to the Minister for Agriculture to find some scheme that will give those farmers assistance in the restocking of these lands.</P>
      <P>I hope something will come out of that.  We are told that the policy of Fianna Fáil is a sound one.  Long before to-day I have said, and I say it again to-day, that the policy is not sound.  The only way you can make it sound is by the Government helping the downtrodden farmer, the man who has been kicked from pillar to post and generally treated like a bad-bred dog. The farmer has not the life of a slave. The farmer's wife and children have to work long hours, and without pay.  The sooner the Government realises the necessity for derating agricultural land and finding money in loans for the farmer at a very low rate of interest, or free to the farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe there is an understanding between the two Parties to finish to-night, and I shall not say <Col N="821" /> anything more, under these circumstances. I only hope that the Minister for Agriculture and the Government will see their way to derate agricultural land and to find cheap money for the farmer to enable him to restock his land and pay his employees.  Some few weeks ago I asked the Minister for Agriculture to give a bounty on stall-fed cattle.  If he and his Government intend to make this country prosperous and to encourage tillage, you have got to stall-feed.  The farmer in this country to-day cannot stall-feed cattle unless he is provided with help in the way of a bounty per head, and the way for that bounty to reach the farmer, to whom it is due, is to give it into his own hand.  The man entitled to that bounty is the farmer who feeds the cattle.  He has to pay his men extra for work in stall-feeding on Sundays and so on, and, owing to the cost of living, it is due to the men.  I do not object to that, but I do object to the Government grinding the farmer down, with his nose to the grindstone, and turning the handle until the farmer has no nose left.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look into the question of giving a bounty on stall-fed cattle.  He said that he gave it last year, which he did, but that bounty did not get into the right hands.  I hold that it is quite easy to give it to the man who feeds the cattle, and the man who is entitled to get the bounty is the man who stall-feeds the cattle. County Wexford has the name of being the best stall-feeding county in the State, and if they do not get a bounty on their cattle&mdash;even though it is very late in the season now&mdash;there will be very few cattle left.</P>

      <P>In listening to this debate, I have had a feeling of loneliness and isolation, and it has been brought home to me very forcibly, as a result of this debate, that the farmer has very few friends on either side of the House, and no friends on the front benches of the big political Parties.  The motion which I have submitted to the consideration of the House is one which simply asks for plain, simple justice for the farmer. It asks for complete derating of agricultural land, which the farmers of <Col N="822" /> Northern Ireland and Great Britain already enjoy.  Is there anything unreasonable in that?  It asks for a temporary moratorium in the payment of annuities and for special loans to enable the farmers to recover from the effects of several years of depression, and we find that both of the big political Parties are united in opposing that motion.  Now, it seems to me that there is some excuse for the Government Party in opposing the suggestions contained in this motion.  At least, if there is not an excuse, there is some explanation for their attitude.  They have to face the difficult task of putting up the money to finance those proposals, and that might to a certain extent explain their hostility to them.</P>

      <P>I said that it was at least an explanation, if not an excuse, for their attitude that they have got to face that difficulty, but there is no excuse or explanation whatever for the attitude of the Opposition Party who solemnly pledged the electorate at two succeeding elections that they stood for complete derating of land, and yet when a motion is laid before this House asking for complete derating they opposed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They opposed it.  Now there is a question of the grievances and the claims of the farmers being submitted to a commission appointed by the Government&mdash;by a Government which declares that it is hostile, and determinedly hostile, to derating.  Does anybody think that a commission nominated by a Government hostile to derating is going to report in favour of derating agricultural land?  When the leaders of the Opposition Party were in power, and when they were opposed to derating, they set up a commission to enquire into this question. Did that commission report in favour of derating?  It did not.  Commissions, almost invariably, carry out the wishes of the Government that nominates them.  Of course, there are some exceptions to that general rule, such as the <Col N="823" /> Banking Commission, but as a general rule commissions carry out the desires and wishes of the Government that appoints them.  Accordingly, anybody who hopes that a commission set up by the present Government is going to report in favour of complete derating is living in a fool's paradise.  Governmental commissions have a very bad reputation as far as the agricultural community is concerned.  Commissions have discussed farming and farmers for 300 years.  They have failed to produce anything except dust to throw in the eyes of the people, and anybody who seriously thinks that this commission is going to be an exception to the general rule must be very optimistic indeed.  As far as I am concerned I have no objection to the Government setting up a commission, or setting up ten commissions if they wish, but I have a very strong objection to the Government being allowed to pretend they are doing justice to the agricultural community by simply setting up a commission to inquire into its claims. If I had delivered 50 barrels of wheat to a miller, and I demanded payment, it would be no answer to my claim if the miller were simply to say: &ldquo;I am holding an inquiry into your claim&rdquo;; neither is it any answer to the farmers' legitimate demands, demands which have been repeated year after year, to say that the matter is being inquired into by a commission which may sit for weeks or months or years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want from the Government, and what we have a right to expect from the Government&mdash;from a Government which has asked for a clear majority to govern this country&mdash;is that they put forward a sound constructive agricultural policy and carry it into effect.  Having a clear majority in this House they have no right to shelve their responsibilities by setting up a commission, and no farmer will recognise their right to do so.  If the Government fails to do justice to the agricultural industry, and to give immediate relief to that industry, the Government will be held responsible and must be held responsible, no matter what assistance they have received from the Opposition body to evade their responsibilities.  The responsibility <Col N="824" /> must rest upon the majority in this House, who have been elected to govern this country, if they fail to do justice to the main industry here.  We have been told by Deputy Keating that there was an agreement between the two big Parties to finish this debate to-night.  I do not know how that agreement came about, but the Deputies in this part of the House have not been consulted.  It seems to me that there is some kind of a secret alliance growing up between those two Parties to try to prevent the farmer from getting justice.</P>
    <P>It seems to me as if the two big political Parties in this country are about to merge into one big mutual admiration and co-operative society.  I personally should like to see, and am glad to see, a certain amount of friendly feeling growing up between those two political Parties which have been so bitterly hostile in the past, but I should also like to see them agreeing to do something in the country's interest, something in the interests of the agricultural industry. I think that an agreement to cheat the farmers of this country out of their rights is a rather ignoble end to an ignoble squabble, and I think that the Government Party must feel very grateful to the Opposition for coming to their rescue in this matter.  They must feel grateful to be in a position to say: &ldquo;Well, we have met the farmers fairly.  We have done what the Opposition Party, who claim and have always claimed to be the farmers' spokesmen, asked us to do.  They asked for a commission.  We have set up a commission, and that is our answer to anybody who says we are not treating the farmers fairly.&rdquo;  I think that the setting up of a commission is not doing justice to the farming community.  The farmers have waited for 16 years to get a square deal in this country, in which the majority of the people are supposed to be engaged in agriculture, in this country which is dependent mainly if not entirely upon the agricultural industry.  Surely it is not just or fair to the farmers that they should be compelled to wait now for months or perhaps years while this Kathleen Mavourneen commission is deliberating. <Col N="825" /> I object to an attempt being made by the Government, backed up by the Opposition, to shove on to a commission the full responsibility for their failure to solve the agricultural problems.  The lawfully and democratically elected Government of this country should take on their shoulders the full responsibility for governing this country and doing justice to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I should like to advise both of those political Parties, and especially the Government, that if this commission fails to deal fairly with agriculture it may finish up by becoming not a commission of inquiry into agriculture but an inquest upon the agricultural industry, because the position of agriculture at the present time is desperate, and unless some immediate relief is given, that industry will dwindle, decay and die.  This commission may not only become an inquest upon the agricultural industry, but if it dawdles too long over its job it may become an inquest upon the two political Parties who were responsible for setting it up, because the farming community are not in a mood to tolerate undue delay.  They are not going to tolerate the setting up of a commission merely to cheat them out of their rights.  Therefore I advise the two big political Parties, and particularly the Government who will have the job of nominating this commission, to see that they appoint to this commission men who are not prepared to defeat the ends of justice, but who are determined to bring immediate relief to the agricultural industry. Otherwise this motion will be a very disastrous one for the Government. I have been told that my refusal to withdraw the motion has had the effect of having the commission set up.  That is absolute nonsense.  If the Government had decided to set up a commission, neither I nor any other member on the Independent or Opposition Benches could prevent them doing so.  The setting up of the commission was not dependent in any way on the result of this debate.  If it was, it would mean that while the motion was under discussion the House would be debarred from discussing <Col N="826" /> any question affecting agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent the Government going ahead with the commission.  As far as farmers are concerned, the commission does not absolve the Government from doing its duty, and dealing fairly with agriculture. Accordingly, there is no reason why I should withdraw a motion which asks for justice and for concessions for the farming community. There is also no reason why we should be satisfied to wait until this commission has brought in its report.  Many speakers dealt with the motion and the amendment but, if they were anxious to facilitate the setting up of the commission, I wonder why they occupied so much of the time of the House. Surely if they wanted to have the commission set up they would have refrained from taking any further part in the debate.  If these speakers felt that it was necessary to say something to justify their position, they have shown their insincerity.  Many speakers travelled over a variety of subjects and some of the statements were weird.  We had a prominent spokesman for the Government declaring that the roof of the agricultural structure was falling in.  That was an alarming admission from a Government supporter, and I think justified the placing of the motion on the Order Paper. Everyone knows that if the roof of a house is falling in, it is no longer a desirable place of residence.  The people in it are justified in getting out. If the roof of the agricultural industry is falling in, and if people are flying from the land, are they not justified in doing the sensible thing?  Why does the Government not realise that the main industry, as one of their chief spokesmen has admitted, is collapsing, and why are not immediate steps taken to relieve those connected with it?  Why does the Government not adopt the suggestions contained in the motion?  They are suggestions which offer some immediate relief to those engaged in agriculture, and they might prevent the roof of the industry falling in.</P>

      <P>I understood from the Deputy's statement that he had the agricultural industry in mind.  If the industry is in the desperate plight that Deputy Corry admitted it to be, there is need for immediate relief.  Deputy Brennan suggested that the motion was an emergency one.  Derating is not an emergency measure.  It is one of permanent justice.  I admit that the other proposals are of a temporary nature, such as the temporary remission of annuities, and temporary loans to enable farmers to recover from the present deplorable position.  Derating should be a permanent measure of relief.  It would be an act of justice. Many things have been said against derating, but no Deputy has dared to suggest that the present system of financing local administration was just or equitable.</P>

      <P>Provided that the deliberations of the commission that is to be set up will be of brief duration. Derating is not a temporary measure and should not be regarded as such. It is not an emergency.  The motion calls for a far-reaching measure of relief for agriculture.  There is absolutely no justification for any suggestion to the contrary.  Deputy Brennan and other speakers on the Opposition Benches thought that the motion did not go far enough.  I suggest that it goes a great deal further than the amendment tabled by Deputy Dillon. The motion asks for complete derating, while the amendment only asks for a temporary remission of rates.  The motion also asks for a moratorium on the payment of land annuities and the funding of outstanding arrears.  The amendment asks for nothing of the kind.  Apparently the Deputy is satisfied that unjust pressure should be maintained against farmers in respect of annuity arrears that accrued during the depression.  The amendment contains nothing regarding the funding of arrears or a moratorium on land annuities.  It does not go as far as the proposals in the motion and there is no justification for claiming that it does. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
