      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall (for Mrs. Redmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if representations have been made by him to the Valencia Government with reference to the murder of Miss Boland, an Irish National, by troops under its command.  If so, with what result and whether any offer of monetary compensation has been made to the relatives of that lady by the said Government.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to the Barcelona Government with reference to the murder of Miss Boland at Las Arenas on the 16th June, 1937.  A claim for appropriate and adequate reparation has been made on the ground that the outrage constituted a grave contravention of the law of nations involving the international responsibility of the Spanish State.  The Government will prosecute the claim to a conclusion, but there is a difficulty in having claims arising out of the civil war finally dealt with during the continuance of hostilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is it not notorious that the lady was murdered by a man in the service of the Red Government; that the miscreant has, in fact, been arrested, tried and executed, and is it not nearly time, in view of the fact that we have chosen to maintain diplomatic relations with the Red Government, that it should give some sign of its goodwill, or desire to maintain relation with us by recognising a legitimate claim of that kind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state on what grounds he justifies the issue by him of a sealed order directing the Monaghan County Council to pay a gratuity of £110 to a retired vocational education teacher who had only six years' service while her predecessor, who had ten years' service, was with the Minister's sanction granted £70 gratuity on her retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount, viz., £110, sanctioned by me was the amount awarded by the local body and did not exceed the amount authorised by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, is the Minister aware that the vocational education committee, acting outside its authority, recommended a gratuity of £110, and that that recommendation was forwarded to the Minister, who sent it back informing them that they had no authority to make such recommendation on their own, but that he would pass it if the county council recommended it?  The vocational committee then sent their recommendation to the county council, who examined it and decided that £70 was a reasonable gratuity in this case, and forwarded it to the Minister, who then returned it with a sealed order ordering the county council to disburse £110 of its <Col N="495" /> money in contravention of their decision, although by law the county council was not bound to give the lady anything at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that the county council, although they have to pay, are not empowered by law to veto the amount granted by the education committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council are not obliged to give anything.  They have the right not to give any gratuity at all and the vocational education committee has no function except through the county council to recommend.  Will the Minister look into the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that the county council are required to pay once the vocational education committee have passed the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that he himself wrote to the vocational education committee and told them that that was not so?  Surely the Minister must know that this council actually granted £70 to a similar officer who retired in similar circumstances recently and that it is common knowledge in Monaghan that the reason this lady is given £110 by the Minister's sealed order is because she is a political supporter of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister and his Party?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two probation officers, both women, were recently appointed, bringing the number of female probation officers in Dublin up to three.  These appointments were made following a recommendation from the Dublin justices that there should be four female probation officers attached to the metropolitan courts.  I am circulating a more detailed statement with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement referred to: &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the year 1926 there was only one probation officer in Dublin, a woman.  In 1926 the number was increased to two women.  One of these officers died in March, 1936, and while the filling of the vacancy was under consideration the Minister for Justice suggested to the then senior justice that in addition to two women it would be well to have a male probation officer to deal with male adults <Col N="501" /> and older boys.  The then senior justice accepted the suggestion, although expressing some doubt as to whether there was full-time work for such an officer.  A male probation officer was appointed accordingly in October, 1936, and in March, 1937, the vacant post of female probation officer was filled and the staff brought up to two women and one man.  The number of female probation officers was again reduced to one in May, 1937, by the death of one of these women, and shortly afterwards a recommendation was received from the Dublin justices that a staff of four female probation officers was necessary.  The Minister for Justice was not satisfied that there was sufficient suitable work for four female officers and came to the conclusion that it would be more prudent to appoint only two female officers on a temporary basis in addition to the existing one (bringing the staff up to three women and one man) and to review the situation generally after a reasonable interval.  The present staffing, therefore, viz., three women and one man, may be considered as more or less experimental.</P>

      <P>Warble fly inspectors were appointed in the first year of the working of the Order, namely, 1936, as a result of advertisements.  In the year 1937 and also in this year local authorities were again requested to advertise the posts and this was done in most cases.  Certain local authorities, however, asked for sanction to reappoint inspectors of the previous year without advertising and this procedure was agreed to as the services of these officers were satisfactory.</P>

There were 48,200 cows under test in 1931 and 51,393 in 1937.  Particulars are not available as to the average yield of all cows under test but as regards cows for which the associations have records for completed milking periods it has been computed that the average yield of milk of 40,924 such cows in 1931 was 558 gallons with an average butter-fat percentage of 3.62.  The corresponding figures in respect of 45,617 cows in 1936 (the latest year for which such information is at present available) were 528 gallons milk with a butter-fat percentage of 3.64.</P>

The agreement with the factory provided that if during the first year of its operations the factory was unable to sell its total output of canned beef the Government would purchase up to one-third of the total output at the lowest ruling wholesale prices and terms.  No liability arose under this clause of the agreement.  The agreement further provided that if it was determined by the Government before its expiration except for certain specified reasons <Col N="506" /> they would pay to the society by way of compensation either a sum of £10,000, or a sum equivalent to the outlay of the society on the buildings and equipment, whichever was the less.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount expended by the Government in advertising the scheme from its inception (July, 1935) to the 31st January, 1938, was £1,206. It is not practicable to give the figure for the cost of loading animals as the officers of the Department undertaking this work are also engaged in other work and it would be a difficult matter to segregate with any degree of accuracy their expenses as between their different services.  The total sum paid for animals from the inception of the scheme to the 31st January, 1938, was £236,612 10s. 0d.</P>
      <P>The total amount loaned to the company is £16,000.</P>
      <P>There will be Government liability under the option agreement which provides that in the event of the Minister deciding to avail of his power under the operation agreement to terminate his obligation under the latter agreement to supply cattle to the company he shall pay to the promoters by way of liquidated damages and not as a penalty such sum as shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the option agreement as follows: &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  should such determination take place within 12 calendar months from the date on which the abattoir and factory of the company commenced operations, the sum of £5,000 together with the <Col N="507" /> sum of £5,000 or such other sum as may be subscribed as capital in and to be expended by the company upon the erection and equipment of buildings.  Should the promoters find it necessary to expend more than £5,000 in addition to the sum of £16,000 to be advanced by the Minister, the Minister shall be notified and unless he is satisfied that the additional expenditure is necessary he shall be under no liability to refund the surplus should he give notice of intention to discontinue the supply of cattle.</P>
    <P>(b)  should such determination take place within 24 calendar months</P>
    <P>(i)  a sum equal to 75 per cent. of the net profits earned by the company in its first year working and</P>
    <P>(ii)  such sum subscribed as capital as aforesaid not exceeding £5,000.</P>
    <P>(c)  should such determination take place within 36 calendar months,</P>
    <P>(i)  a sum equal to 50 per cent. of one year's net profits to the company on the average of the two years' working; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  such sum subscribed as aforesaid as capital not exceeding £5,000;</P>
    <P>(d)  should such determination take place within 48 calendar months,</P>
    <P>(i)  a sum equal to 25 per cent. of one year's net profits to the company on the average of the three years' working; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  such sum subscribed as capital as aforesaid not exceeding £5,000.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister determine the agreement four years from the date of commencement of operations of the company, it is provided that he shall have the option to purchase from the promoters all the issued shares in the company upon the basis of the fair value of the shares, including the amount standing to credit of the <Col N="508" /> Debenture Reserve Fund, plus one year's profits of the company on the average of four years' working.  Should the Minister fail to exercise this option within the period of two months after the audited accounts of the company had been made available to him, the promoters shall have the option to purchase from the Minister the debenture at a price to be ascertained as follows: &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the amount standing to credit of the Debenture Reserve Fund is two-thirds or more than two-thirds of the amount advanced by the Minister, the price shall be 100 per cent. of the face value of the debenture, and the amount of the Debenture Reserve Fund shall be paid to the promoters by the company;</P>
    <P>(b)  if the amount standing to the credit of the Debenture Reserve Fund be less than two-thirds of the amount advanced by the Minister, the price shall be a sum equivalent to the Reserve Fund, plus 50 per cent. of the sum by which the Minister's advance exceeds the amount of the Reserve Fund, and the amount of the Debenture Reserve Fund shall be paid to the promoters by the company.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Government liability referred to, the only other liability which will arise is in respect of the extension to the factory, which took place towards the end of the year 1935.  At that time it was found that the number of animals dealt with in the factory was not sufficient to cope with the numbers available, and the company were asked to extend the factory and plant with a view to dealing with up to 2,000 cows weekly.  The company agreed to extend the factory provided the Minister would make a further advance of £12,000.  It was also tentatively agreed to supply between 1,500 and 1,800 cows per week when the extensions were completed and the necessary agreements drawn up.  Before this took place, however, conditions in the cattle trade improved very considerably, and the situation as regards an excessive number of old cows coming forward for disposal was completely changed.  In the circumstances <Col N="509" /> it was decided to revert to the original rate of progress, namely, 800 to 1,000 per week.  As the company had undertaken the additional expenditure in extending their premises, and as this additional accommodation and plant were not availed of owing to the impracticability of supplying the increased number of cattle contemplated, the company were entitled to compensation for the additional expenditure incurred.  The amount of the compensation which the company will be entitled to for these reasons is at present under examination.</P>
    <P>After allowance for depreciation, the total value of the company's premises and plant, inclusive of the extension, as shown by the audited accounts of the company dated 30 July, 1937, is £53,969 12s. 11d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Fifth Stage will the Minister be good enough to tell us particularly the history of the enforcement of orders made under the Principal Act?  What exact purpose was achieved by prohibiting the export of sheepskins?  To what extent has he used his powers under the Principal Act, and how long does he think it will be necessary to restrict trade in the export of sheepskins?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give the Deputy all the information he desires.  The reason why the exportation of sheepskins was taken under control was to foster the fellmongery industry, or at least to secure its preservation and development, with possible further development in the tanning of sheepskins.  The fellmongery industry has been revived.  A number of firms are engaged in it, and a considerable number of persons are employed thereby.  Unless the industries could be secured a supply of raw material, they would not be established or permitted to grow.  The exportation of sheepskins is regulated only to the extent necessary to secure that supplies of sheepskins are available in whatever quantities are required by the fellmongery industry. It is considered to be better, in the national interests, that the processing of those sheepskins should be done here, rather than that they should be exported in the raw state, and the processing done abroad.  The only <Col N="530" /> interference with the actual control which is undertaken by the Department from time to time is whenever there are indications that the price here has been unduly affected by the orders in operation.  In such circumstances, usually following consultation with all the interested parties, a new price is arranged, or different regulations are brought into force.  Generally speaking, I think it may be said that the Act is at present worked mainly in consultation with the interested parties.  They are frequently in touch with the Department, and are called into consultation whenever any question arises.  Following those consultations, whatever steps are necessary are taken in order to give effect to the main intention of the Act.  The main intention of the Act was to secure the development here of the industry of processing sheepskins, for the purpose of ensuring that the article exported would be a semi-finished article rather than raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister has stated that, from time to time, he has called into consultation the interested parties, with a view to seeing that their rights and interests are adequately catered for.  Has he called into consultation the Department of Agriculture?  I apprehend this difficulty, Sir.  A sheep is a beast which commands a modest price.  A substantial part of that price is in the fleece.  If you have a good cow which makes £18, and the hide makes 17/6. you cannot say that the price of hides is radically going to affect the value of cattle.  But the price of a fleece represents a much larger percentage of the total value of a sheep.  If the only people effectively consulted are the butchers, the hidemongers and the fellmongers, they can protect their interests by ensuring that the fellmonger will be guaranteed a moderate price on his operation, and that he will pay the hidemonger such a price as will leave to the fellmonger that moderate profit; but the hidemonger or the man that deals in fleece must proportionately reduce the price he is prepared to pay to the butcher or the abattoir for the fleece in order to enable him to sell <Col N="531" /> to the fellmonger at the price the fellmonger is prepared to pay.  If that price becomes unduly depressed, the man who deals in fleeces and the fellmonger are all right, but the price of sheep down the country falls proportionately, and if you, by agreement between the fellmonger and the fleecemonger, reduce the price of fleeces by 5/- a fleece, that means 5/-off every sheep sold and that, off the price of a small sheep, is a very important consideration indeed.  Is it right, even for the purpose of preserving the fellmongering business, to withdraw from the agricultural community the best market available for the disposal of their fleeces?  I do not think that procedure can be defended unless the Minister is prepared to say: &ldquo;We will insist on the fellmongers being prepared to pay in Dublin the average price obtainable for these fleeces in Great Britain, and if they are not prepared to pay those prices, then I will not use my powers to restrain the exporters from sending fleeces to Great Britain where they can be sold to greater advantage.&rdquo; That is immensely important from the point of view of any Deputy here who represents a sheep-rearing community. I see a Deputy here from Donegal, where many people depend for their livelihood on the rearing of sheep.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, I was prepared to listen to the Deputy discussing the terms of the Bill before us and the amending of the Act, but I submit that that is somewhat different to initiating a discussion on whether the Principal Act should have been passed or not.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the question raised by the Deputy who has intervened on the Fifth Stage of this Bill would invite other Deputies to intervene in the same manner.  The main Act does not arise for discussion, except in so <Col N="532" /> far as it is proposed to amend it. The proposed amendment of the Principal Act is a minor one &mdash; it is to decide whether or not it shall be lawful to attempt to export sheepskins, and to make such an attempt punishable by law.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, I respectfully submit that that is what the Minister says is in the Bill, but I direct the attention of the Chair to sub-section (1) of Section 2, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to export or attempt to export sheepskin in contravention of an order made, whether before or after the passing of this Act, under the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>

I submit that, without going a hair's breadth outside Section 2 of this Bill, I am entitled to submit to the House that any Deputy interested in a sheep-raising constituency should be on his guard to see that sub-section 1 of Section 2 of this Bill does not operate drastically to reduce the price of sheep in his constituency and as raised by his constituents whom he is supposed to represent. I apprehend danger unless the Minister is prepared to give me an <Col N="534" /> undertaking that, before he issues an order under this Bill or under the Principal Act, he will require the fellmongers to satisfy him that they are prepared to pay as high a price for sheepskins as is obtainable on the open market in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a rather appropriate place to raise certain matters concerning rights which are given to the board in respect of the condition of property on the Shannon owned by weir owners, and such things.  This section reads as follows: &mdash;</P>
      <P>On the appointed day, every fishery and every fishing right in or over the waters of the River Shannon above the weir known as Corbally Mill weir, together with all ancillary rights appertaining to or necessary for the enjoyment of such fishery or fishing right, shall, if and in so far as it is not already vested in the board, become and be transferred to and vested in the board...</P>
      <P>I am very anxious to know what exactly is the position regarding these rights, and what are the ancillary rights.  I find, in the 1925 Act, a section &mdash; Section 13 &mdash; which gives power to strike a certain rate and deprives the local authority of the right to strike a rate.  That section says: &mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person who is liable to be rated under the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, as amended by this Act in respect of a fishery, shall be exempt from liability for any rate leviable by the council of any county, county borough...</P>

If the Electricity Supply Board is to have the right of not paying any rates to the county council where does the county council come in?  We have had an epidemic of that thing in County Clare. Already we have had the Shannon works at Ardnacrusha exempted.  We have had no information up to this about the Rhynana airport.

    <P>&ldquo;Every person who is liable to be rated under the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, as amended by <Col N="536" /> this Act in respect of a fishery, shall be exempt from liability for any rate leviable by the council of any county, county borough or urban district, or the commissioners of any town, in respect of that fishery for the local financial year commencing on the 1st day of April next after the commencement of this Act or for any of the nine next succeeding local financial years...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing that would be construed as an ancillary right.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section that is brought in here nominally for the purpose of making it possible to pay compensation to certain persons who are not provided for in the Acts previously passed by this House dealing with the Shannon electricity undertaking and the fisheries affected thereby.  I suppose the Castleconnell fishermen would come under this.  In any case a number of parties who are aggrieved might get compensation under this section. The categories into which these aggrieved parties fall are so many and so divergent in character that an omnibus clause of this kind is considered <Col N="539" /> to be the most effective way of providing for them.  In so far as that is true, this clause has a great deal to be said for it; but when we come to examine who is to determine which of these various categories of aggrieved persons are to get compensation, and how much they are to get, we discover that the person who is to determine who will get compensation and how much they are to get is the person who will have to pay the compensation.</P>
      <P>The Minister argues that that is the only way of doing it, and if he did not do it that way it would mean shutting out these people from getting any compensation.  I submit that argument is nonsense.  When any aggrieved party applies for compensation, for one of the heterogeneous reasons that may be advanced under Clause 10, somebody must decide whether, in fact, he has been injured and how much he is entitled to receive.  The Bill says that the Electricity Supply Board shall decide those matters.  There is no conceivable difficulty about providing that, instead of allowing the Electricity Supply Board to determine these matters, they shall be determined by an independent arbitrator.  It is usual, if you provide an arbitrator, to give him pretty close terms of reference. The difficulty here is that the heterogeneous quality of claims likely to be made render the creation of close terms of reference a virtual impossibility.  But at least the arbitrator will be in no greater difficulty in determining these claims than will the Electricity Supply Board, and before the Electricity Supply Board pay the claims they have to determine each one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if on this occasion, on the excuses made by the Minister, we admit the principle that where a citizen of the State is injured in his property or rights that person's claim for compensation shall be determined as to its validity and amount by a Government Department, by the Minister or, worse still, by an autonomous corporation like the Electricity Supply Board, that precedent will be relied upon in subsequent <Col N="540" /> Acts of Parliament and the very essence of genuine compensation is that Parliament will erect between the party aggrieved and the party offending an independent arbitrator to determine their respective rights and the amount of the damages due. If you depart from that fundamental principle, that the question of damage must be determined by a party independent of both aggrieved persons, then there is no end to where you may go.</P>
    <P>All Deputies will have seen the growing tendency in all Government legislation to make the responsible Minister a final court of appeal in determining appeals made by citizens against decisions taken under legislation. That is a wrong principle.  We go a step further here in Section 10 and, where a grievance is admitted, where damage is known to have occurred, we leave it to the autonomous Electricity Supply Board to determine whether they will pay and, if so, how much they will pay to the aggrieved party.  That principle is rotten, so rotten, so dangerous, that on that single issue we voted against the Bill on the Second Reading and on that single issue now we shall have no hesitation in dividing the House. We welcome the opportunity afforded by Clause 10 of getting compensation for aggrieved parties not provided for in the Principal Acts, but we reject absolutely the proposal that the person who is to be mulcted in damages shall himself be the judge of whether he is to be so mulcted and, if so, in how great a sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister's intention is to help unfortunate people who could not get compensation under the original Act but, like Deputy Dillon, I do not believe this is the proper way to do it.  I have been a consistent opponent of clauses in the various Bills which give Ministers discretion in certain circumstances to operate the legislation of this House.  But this is even more objectionable than the clauses which give the Minister discretion, because here we have the discretion vested in an interested board, a board set up <Col N="541" /> by the House and which is itself interested financially.  It will be their object to expend as little as they possibly can in this, or any other, direction and, unless they are supermen, possessing a charity unbounded, they are not likely to be as liberal as an independent arbitrator.</P>
      <P>There are several sets of fishermen concerned in this matter, the Castleconnell men, the Killaloe men, the Abbey fishermen and others, and any Deputy from Limerick or Clare must object to the proposal to allow the Electricity Supply Board to occupy the position of assessing compensation.  I believe this difficulty could have been surmounted otherwise than by the arrangement in this section.  I appeal, even at this late hour, to the Minister to accept some other way of dealing with these particular sets of fishermen than by leaving them to the discretion of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

What is all this talk about compensation?  The word compensation is not mentioned in the section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as people are to be compensated, adequate provision for that compensation has been made in the Principal Act passed by the Dáil.  We do not bring in an arbitrator to determine what their compensation should be.  There were set out in the Act rigid rules by which the amount of compensation to be paid to them was to be determined.  They are there set out in black and white.  Every person who the Dáil considered was entitled to compensation and who came under that section, got compensation in accordance with its provisions.  It was because there were classes outside the category, who could not be held to be <Col N="542" /> entitled to compensation but in respect of whom it could be urged that there were grounds for <i>ex-gratia</i> payments, that this section is introduced in this Bill.  The people who will get these <i>ex-gratia</i> payments are people not entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Principal Act, provisions which were drafted much more liberally than the corresponding provisions in the Act of 1925, under which the Shannon works were constructed, and this question of compensation was created for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to attempt to do what Deputy Dillon is suggesting, we would have to set down rules to guide the arbitrator who would be called into existence.  He would have to be given some terms of reference, and no matter how you attempt to frame them, they would be bound to operate to deprive some person who would get an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment under the section as it stands, from getting that payment. The only way to deal with cases of this kind is to give discretion to the party concerned to make what payment, in their opinion, real justice requires.  I mentioned the case of certain fishermen who were engaged in exercising a public right of fishing.  Do Deputies opposite seriously suggest that people should be compensated because circumstances arose which prevented them from exercising a public right &mdash; a right which they share with every member of the public?  Could it be claimed that these persons had any interest or ownership in the fishery in that particular case?  They had not.  To attempt to establish as a precedent the right of such persons to compensation would involve widespread complications in every direction.  It would establish a precedent which would make public administration almost impossible. I am prepared to agree, and have agreed, with those who have brought forward the case of these men that, although we cannot admit their right to compensation, there are, in all the circumstances, grounds to justify an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  That is what we are providing for.  There are, perhaps, cases of persons affected by the acquisition of the Shannon fisheries or <Col N="543" /> the construction of the Shannon electricity works who might think they should get <i>ex-gratia</i> payments but concerning whom the board may have a different view or vice versa.  I do not think it is possible to approach consideration of this matter on any other ground than that it is necessary to give somebody unlimited discretion to deal with these cases but, from the point of view of the parties concerned, there is no better body to which to give that discretion than the Electricity Supply Board because the Electricity Supply Board have an obvious reason for trying to secure the goodwill of all these parties.  They have got to operate these fisheries from the source of the Shannon to the sea.  They have got to protect these fisheries and they are naturally anxious to secure that all these minor grievances which have accumulated in consequence of the acquisition or destruction of the fisheries should be liquidated by cash payments, if possible.  They are much more likely to deal generously with these people than is any arbitrator, even if it were possible to frame rules under which an arbitrator could act. From the point of view of the parties concerned, the best provision in this Bill is that contained in Section 10 and I am prepared to resist, in the interest of the parties concerned, any proposal to amend that section on the lines suggested by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always interested in the form of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When he is satisfied that he has a good case, he is suave and polite and as pleasant a person as you could have dealings with across the House.  When he is satisfied that he has a bad case, he always starts off by attacking the other side and by saying something personally offensive to somebody.  In this particular instance, the Minister was not in one of his suave moods.  If I may say so, he was in one of his offensive moods.  It immediately occurred to me that the Minister did not believe very much in what he was going to say.  What are his arguments? There are certain persons, he says, who are not entitled to compensation <Col N="544" /> under the original Act.  The original Act set out that certain classes of persons were entitled to compensation.  Other persons who, he thinks, have a moral claim to compensation did not come within the terms of the original Act.  What does that prove except that the original Act was too narrowly drawn &mdash; that people with a moral right to compensation did not come under its terms?  The Minister now rightly comes along to amend the Act so that these people who have a moral claim to compensation, but not a legal claim, shall receive adequate compensation.  What is our suggestion. Our suggestion is a very simple one &mdash; that instead of saying &ldquo;whenever the board is satisfied&rdquo; to say &ldquo;whenever an arbitrator appointed by the Minister is satisfied...&rdquo;  I cannot see why an arbitrator appointed by the Minister &mdash; assuming, as I am entitled to assume, that he appoints a man of ability and integrity &mdash; will not exercise a judgment as impartial as, if not more impartial than, the Electricity Supply Board or any similar body.  What is the Minister's real argument?  He wants to draw a verbal distinction between compensation and an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  I do not care a button what he calls it.  If &ldquo;whenever the arbitrator is satisfied that a person is engaged by a way of trade...&rdquo; he awards compensation, what it is called is a matter of no importance.  I suggest that the course we propose will give more confidence to the people and the public.  An arbitrator should deal with these claims, which may not be enforceable in law, and not the people who have got to pay the money and who have got to secure that the Electricity Supply Board will be a paying concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that a public right of fishing is a thing in which no private individual has any right. Granted.  If a public right of fishing be taken away, there may not be any legal right but there may be a moral right to compensation if a man's means of livelihood be taken away. The State recognises that man's moral right to make a living.  Why should he not receive an amount decided upon by an impartial arbitrator rather than <Col N="545" /> an amount decided upon by an interested party like the Electricity Supply Board?  I think that these arguments were running through the Minister's mind and that was why he was in his mood of attack when defending this section.  I suggest that he abandon his mood of attack, that he get back to the much more pleasant, suave manner of which he is sometimes master and accept our views on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's assertiveness is always in evidence when his logic is lacking.  His logic is lacking now and his logic has been lacking in his piloting&mdash;&ldquo;piloting&rdquo; is a good word in this connection &mdash; of this Bill. He tells us that this is an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  It is no such thing as an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  It is payment in respect of a right destroyed by two successive Governments, which right was not legally recognised up to the present.  He tells us that under a section of this Bill fishing rights and ancillary rights are being handed over to the Electricity Supply Board. Does he recognise that the employment of some of these men upon the fisheries, in respect of which several riparian owners were compensated, was also a right, and does he recognise that it was the right of these fishermen on the fisheries at Killaloe to be handed over to the buyer when the fishery changed hands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two kinds of fishermen at Killaloe.  There were the fishermen employed by the riparian owners on the fisheries which belonged to them, and the fishermen on the free waters.  The fishermen who were employed by the riparian owners went with the sale of the fisheries.  It was a recognised right that a person buying a fishery took over for employment the men employed on the fishery.  If A., a riparian owner, had five men employed on a fishery, B., who bought that fishery, had to take over those five men.  That was the right of these men.  What did the Shannon fisheries reconstruction work do?  It destroyed that fishery and it compensated the riparian owners, but ignored the claims of the fishermen who were entitled to be handed over <Col N="546" /> to the purchaser with the purchase of the fishery.  Now the Minister tells us that that was not a right.  It is a right that has existed for generations along these banks, from Killaloe down by O'Brien's Bridge and on to Limerick, and, therefore, in respect of these people, there is no case whatever for saying that it is an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  It is payment in respect of a right, and it is only just that the Minister should amend the old Act and bring these men under its provisions in respect of the fixing of their compensation.  If there is machinery at present under the old Act for the fixing of compensation, let the Minister put it into operation, but let him not say that the people who are expected to pay the compensation should be the people to fix it.  Surely that is not justice, or anything like even-handed justice.  Suppose he were to do the opposite and to say that the employees should be entitled to fix the compensation in one case and the Electricity Supply Board in the other.  Would the Minister agree?  Surely it would be just as right to say that the people who are entitled to compensation should have the fixing of it as to say that the people who have to pay it should fix it.  That is in respect of the people on the weirs down the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of the fishermen on what have been described as the free waters.  The Minister tells us that anybody could fish on the free waters. They could not fish in the way these fishermen fished and earned their living.  Tourists came from England and employed these men who fished from what were known as cots, and that was a matter which had to be learned after years of practice.  The Minister would probably get a very severe ducking if he endeavoured to fish on the Shannon from one of these cots.  Fishing on the Shannon from one of these cots has almost to run in one's blood before one can do it.  But the Minister went in deliberately, and in the interests of the community &mdash; I admit that freely &mdash; destroyed that right.  He took it away completely from them and said to them: &ldquo;Go home and starve&rdquo;&mdash; because that is <Col N="547" /> what they had to do.  Killaloe was a thriving, prosperous place at one time. You raised the level of the waters by 15 feet and destroyed all the fishing in it and now what was a prosperous little village is a graveyard.  These people who were sent home to starve and who were making a frugally comfortable living have now no means of living.  I am basing my case on the fact that everybody could not do that fishing on the Shannon.  It was something which had to be acquired after years of practice.  Now, none of the English tourists come over to fish, taking a cot out on the Shannon, and fishing from it, and giving these men 10/-, 20/- and 30/- as sometimes was the case, a day, and, therefore, their means of living is gone.  These are the two cases&mdash;the riparian owner with whose fishery, when it was sold, the men had the right to go, and whose right was destroyed when the electrification of the Shannon was brought about, and the men on the free waters whose case I have endeavoured to explain now.  There is another set of men I want to mention.  I want to know if the employees of the lessees on the Shannon will be entitled to compensation under this Bill?  I should like the Minister to endeavour to be a little more lucid and less assertive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot understand what Deputy Hogan's grievance is.  I want to try to be suave and polite, and to show Deputies opposite that the case I have is a really strong one.  The flooding of the waters at Killaloe took place 11 years ago, and the Act under which that was done made no provision for the payment of compensation other than to owners of property which was either acquired or destroyed for the purpose of the construction of the works.  For the first time, a Bill has been introduced here which provides the possibility of payment being made to the many persons who thought they had a claim to compensation in consequence of what happened in 1927, but who could not be given any compensation, or any payment, because there was no legal authority in anybody to provide the money for that purpose. Here we are giving the party most <Col N="548" /> directly concerned the power to make payments, and there is no limitation upon that power otherwise than is set out in the section.  It is confined to persons who were engaged, by way of trade or otherwise, for profit in fishing in the waters of the River Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or was employed for reward by any person in such fishing, or was both so engaged, or so employed.  He must be able to show that he conforms to three conditions: (1)  that he was engaged by way of trade or otherwise in fishing; (2) that he suffered loss of profit, or loss of earning, by reason of interference under any of the Acts from the Shannon Act, 1925, down to date, and (3) that he has not been compensated already.  Subject to his fulfilling these three conditions, the board is empowered to make these payments to him.  I was interested to hear Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney arguing their claim to compensation.  I wonder did he argue as eloquently at the meetings of the Executive Council, of which he was a member, when his Government was taking the decision, which they reiterated again and again until they went out of office, that no compensation could be paid to these persons and that they were not entitled to payment of any kind whatever.  The matter was frequently discussed here in the years between 1927 and 1931 and the Government of the day took a most definite line on the subject.  The first departure from that line was when we made provision by a special Act for the payment of compensation to certain employees of the Cork electricity undertaking who were employed on trams. The second departure was when we introduced the Act which this Bill is designed to amend, the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1935, which, for the first time, made provision for the payment of compensation to persons who lost their employment by reason of things which happened under the Act.  It set out the conditions they had to fulfil in order to become entitled to compensation and the rules by which the amount to be paid in compensation was to be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Now, we are going further.  We are giving to the board discretionary power to make further payments in cases not covered by the 1935 Act.  We are putting no limit on that discretion, otherwise than to the extent shown here, that it is confined to those who suffered loss by reason of the effect on the fishing. It is confined to persons engaged in fishing operations.  I am very strongly of opinion that the only way of dealing with the multitude and with the variety of cases which have from time to time been brought to light is to give some wide discretionary power of this kind to the Electricity Supply Board. I am quite satisfied that no arrangement that could be devised between these persons and an arbitrator will prove as satisfactory as the operation of this section.  In fact, the circumstances are such that no arbitrator could in many cases do otherwise than refuse to recommend any payments, where the board, in its own interests, might decide to make payments in order to remove sources of ill-will.</P>

      <P>That was not the year the Shannon Act was passed.  The Bill was passed before 1927 but we will leave it at that.  The Minister's speech amounted simply to this: that this had not been done up to the present and because it had not been done, any scheme he suggests must be right.  I cannot follow that argument at all.  If the previous Government or the present Government has not up to this dealt with these people, that does not seem to have the slightest bearing upon the question as to whether the method embodied in this section is right or wrong.  Personally I cannot see that it has the slightest bearing on the question of method, and I have heard nothing from the Minister, except a statement that the arbitrator might not give what the Electricity Supply <Col N="550" /> Board might give.  I cannot follow that at all.  The arbitrator can make up his mind upon the meaning of words just as well if not better than the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister's argument seems to be this: that the Electricity Supply Board will walk outside the terms of this Act and will give compensation to people to whom they are not empowered to give it under the terms of the Act.  Otherwise I cannot follow his argument.  What can be given under the terms of the Act can be determined, in my opinion, much better by an arbitrator.  As the Minister says, the Electricity Supply Board will give where the arbitrator will not give.  Therefore, the Minister's argument, that the Electricity Supply Board will give compensation to persons to whom under this Act they are not entitled to give it, means that or nothing.</P>

      <P>The Minister is telling the Electricity Supply Board that they may or may not do certain things. That is what it means and these people will be left in the wilderness as long as that is the position.  There is to be no governmental action.  It simply means that they do not recognise that these peope have any rights whatever for what was taken from them, but that the Electricity Supply Board is entitled if in their goodness they choose to do so, to consider their cases and pay them compensation.  That is all that is in the section.  The board may do what they like.  They may leave these people in the widerness until they are old enough to get the old-age pension and the burden of compensation will die with them.  The section simply means that the board is given power to do what they like. The burden handed to them is being handed over to others because they were exposed to criticism.  There is this difference, however, that whatever the board does will not be discussed in the Dáil.  There is no Minister in the Dáil responsible for their activities. So long as it was a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce it could be raised without any difficulty in an estimate or in some other way, but when it is the Electricity Supply Board it cannot be <Col N="551" /> raised again.  The Electricity Supply Board is being told to do what they like but they will be forced to do nothing. The section means: &ldquo;Take the burden off the Department.  I am not going to face the Dáil about it any longer.&rdquo;  That is the sum and substance of the proposals in this section. In regard to people to be given compensation, does the Minister not know that in respect of the Electricity Supply Board tribunals were set up to deal with employees and to fix the compensation? Does he not know, what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney stated, that a tribunal or an arbitrator is well able to come to a decision?  If the Electricity Supply Board are going to deal with this question differently from a tribunal they are going to do so in an illegal fashion that would be outside the Act.  The Minister has no case and he knows it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Our application is a very simple one.  The Minister says he has drawn the terms of reference for the Electricity Supply Board very wide because, frankly, he could not foresee every kind of case and no one else could.  All we ask him to do is to draw up the same terms of reference for an independent arbitrator to be appointed by him.  If he will take out of the section the name of the Electricity Supply Board and put in its place the name of any Circuit judge sitting on the bench, that will meet our need.  Small as that concession may appear to be, I regard it as something very much more vital than the protection of particular rights under this Bill.  I regard it as a precedent which will be followed in subsequent legislation.  I think it is right we should take our stand against any proposal to entrust the assessing of compensation, whether by legal or moral right, to the authority which will ultimately have to pay whatever compensation is given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall explain that this section did not initiate in the way suggested.  An indication of the section was foreshadowed when the <Col N="552" /> Electricity Supply Board approached me saying: &ldquo;Here are classes of people who in our opinion have a claim for compensation, but unfortunately we are debarred by law from making payments to them.&rdquo;  If the Deputy knew the history of the section he would appreciate that the dangers he foresees cannot arise.  The Electricity Supply Board were anxious to get into the position when they would have power to make payments which they thought should be made to certain parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise what that means?

      <P>The Electricity Supply Board were approached this year, and then they told the Minister: &ldquo;Here is a list of people we want compensated. We think they ought to get compensation.&rdquo; That implies that they have already rejected dozens of others.  All we want to ensure now is that not only those that the Electricity Supply Board after criticism indicates are entitled to compensation, but that there should be compensation also for the others that they have announced their intention of turning down, so that they will have an opportunity of going before someone of the standing of a Circuit Court judge to make their cases.  Surely that is not a concession too great to ask for, particularly in view of the information which the Minister has just communicated to the House.  Unless he gives us that, the whole issue is determined and there is virtually no use in anybody else <Col N="553" /> applying, because the Electricity Supply Board have made up their minds and they only want this section to deal with the group of people they have already got before them.  Surely that copper-fastens our case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it must be true. The Minister tells us that the Electricity Supply Board asked for it because they said: &ldquo;We have a group of people whom we think ought to be looked after.&rdquo;  They did not come and say: &ldquo;We think, we hear talk, we see in the newspapers that there is a number of people who are likely to apply <Col N="554" /> if they think it worth while.&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;We know of a certain group of people who do not come under the principal Acts, and we think we ought to do something for them; facilitate us in this matter.&rdquo;  This is to exclude all the other people.  Could proof go further of the reasonableness of our contention?  I press on the Minister, with the information placed in his hands by the Electricity Supply Board, that he should come to see the urgent and vital necessity of providing an independent arbitrator to allow those people, with whom the Electricity Supply Board do not see eye to eye at present, to have an opportunity of having their submission impartially considered.</P>

      <P>2.  In page 5, to add after Section 11, a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Principal Act, all words from the words &ldquo;other than&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;hereinafter mentioned&rdquo; are hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof it is hereby declared and enacted that the said sub-section (1)  shall not apply to or render unlawful anything done under and in accordance with the written permission of the board.</P>
      <P>This amendment is required because the Electricity Supply Board have already acquired all the fisheries in the freshwaters of the Shannon which they have been able to identify.  Any others, of whose existence they are not now aware, will automatically vest in them under this Bill on whatever day may be appointed under Section 4.  The board will, accordingly, become the sole owners of fisheries and fishing rights in the tidal waters shortly after the Bill becomes law.  This amendment is necessary to protect the rights of the board by prohibiting the use of nets in the fresh waters of the river other than for the catching of eels or as an auxiliary to angling by rod and line except by written permission of the Board.</P>

      <P>the word &ldquo;shop&rdquo; includes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any premises in which any retail trade or business is carried on, excluding so much (if any) of such premises as is not used for the purpose of such retail trade or business;</P>

    <P>(e)  a hotel.</P>
    <P>This amendment is for the purpose of redefining the word &ldquo;shop.&rdquo;  Various objections to the definition contained in the Bill were advanced by different Deputies during the discussions in the two Committee Stages we had.  There was an objection by Deputy Benson that the definition might be held to cover premises used for industrial work, and an objection by Labour Deputies to the definition regarding wholesale warehouses.  The new definition, I think, is more satisfactory from every point of view.  It covers all the objections raised in Committee.  It makes clear that premises used for industrial work are not included.  The definition also covers warehouses occupied for the purposes of a retail trade or business by the person carrying on such retail trade or business, or by a wholesale dealer or merchant for the purposes of the business carried on by him in a wholesale shop.  It is considered that the definition is more satisfactory than that which the Bill originally contained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> In page 6, before Section 5, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of the powers of enforcement either expressly or otherwise conferred by this Act, it shall be competent for a trade union in its registered name to prosecute offences under any section of this Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is fairly clear from the amendment itself. It is to give trade unions the right to prosecute under the Act.  During the discussion on the previous stage of the Bill it was said by, I think, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that there would be certain difficulties arising out of trades unions having the right to institute proceedings, mainly, I think, because it was held that a trade union, in the event of a vexatious prosecution, could not be sued.  But that is not the case. There have actually been cases where trades unions have been sued in such circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for having trades unions' officials as against trades unions, appearing in the Bill, would as a matter of fact be weaker from the point of view of the Deputy who urged that, because &ldquo;a trade union official&rdquo; might include any person who was any kind of official.  It might be a part-time branch secretary of a trade union, for instance.  It would be much better if the trade union itself were in a position to institute proceedings.  The trade union would be a large responsible body, and it would be much less likely that vexatious proceedings would be instituted by a union than by an individual, and perhaps irresponsible, official of the union.  The Minister I notice has gone some distance to meet the point by permitting an official to sue, but the Labour Party would prefer &mdash; and I think the Minister, if he gives the matter full consideration, would agree that it would be more satisfactory &mdash; that the union as a corporate body should proceed than that an individual trade union official should proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>From such examination as I have been able to give the matter I am satisfied that it would be unwise at this juncture to provide that a union, as such, should have the right to prosecute.  It was mentioned here during an earlier discussion that it could be held that the funds of a union would be immune from penalties for malicious prosecution.  In any event, I think if you were to confer this right upon a registered union as such it would be necessary to have a certain amount of research into the position of the union in respect of such matters, and to make consequential provisions which might or might not be acceptable to the union, but which would certainly be necessitated by considerations of elementary justice.  In the circumstances, it is wiser to get the desired result with the least possible trouble, and therefore I have put forward an amendment which confers, not merely upon the Minister and aggrieved persons but also upon officials of registered trades unions, the right to prosecute.  That is as far as it is safe to go under present circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister agree that vexatious proceedings would be much less likely in the case of a responsible trade union than in the case of an individual, and possibly an irresponsible, official?  Also would he not agree that a union would give due consideration to the matter; that, if the union were suing, it would sue after the matter had been fully discussed by the executive committee of the union, whereas an individual official might possibly institute proceedings on his own?</P>

      <P>I gave the matter such consideration as was possible in the time at my disposal, and, while I admit that the research which I mentioned was not fully carried out, I satisfied myself that this was the safer course to take.  I am as anxious as Deputies opposite to bring the unions into the picture as potential prosecutors, because, of course, their cooperation would be effective in securing enforcement of the provisions of the Bill.  Aggrieved assistants may, for various reasons, be deterred from doing it.  They may be satisfied that it is not in their own interests to do it, even if they have been offended against by some employer; but the trades unions, who would be more concerned with the interests of their members as a whole than with the interests of a particular individual, would no doubt take proceedings when the circumstances justified it. On that point of view I will admit that to give the power to the union as such appears to be better than giving it to the officials of the union, but, from such examination as I could make, it was fairly clear that you could not take the responsibility of doing that without prolonged examination of the consequential amendments which would have to be put in.  That would involve considerable delay.  It is a matter, therefore, of passing the Bill with the amendment which I propose, giving the right to officials of the union, or allowing it to stand over altogether.</P>

To bring those refreshment cars within the scope of the Bill might be most unwelcome.  It would not leave discretion to the employer. If we put them in the Bill, they must <Col N="564" /> get these half-days, and it could easily happen that a railway-car attendant, starting off from Dublin in the morning, would have to get his half-day when he was down the country somewhere, and could not get back to Dublin unless he paid his own fare.

      <P>In page 11, Section 19 (3), to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring hotels into line with other businesses in relation to the total hours worked.  Paragraph (a) says:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>We decided, in the first instance, that in the case of hotels we could permit of a normal working week of 56 hours, and hence the normal week of 48 hours in shops.  I explained the circumstances which led to that decision, and I think that the decision involved different overtime provisions in the case of hotels as compared with the provisions in the Bill governing overtime arrangements in ordinary shops.  The hotel business, probably more than any other business with which this Bill deals, is liable to be called upon to deal with sudden rushes of business as exceptional circumstances arise.  And I do not think it would be possible in any hotel to contemplate any such sudden access of business being dealt with satisfactorily if only four hours' overtime in the week or less were to be permitted.  Apart from that, however, I am sure that the Deputy, on consideration, will see that it is necessary to have this special provision dealing with hotels if there is to be a fixed 56-hour week at all, because if the amendment were carried, it would not be possible to work 56 hours a week all the year round without infringing on the maximum hours that could be worked in the year. While I recognise that this section does <Col N="566" /> permit of fairly long hours being worked in certain weeks on overtime, I think that it is unavoidable and that a provision of that kind must be made. It would be completely impossible, I think, to restrict the working of overtime in hotels to the limits indicated in paragraph (b) of sub-section (3).  If we are to have the 56 hours and to have due regard to the circumstances that may arise in some hotels &mdash; not all of them, perhaps, but certainly in some of them &mdash; at certain times of the year, the provisions in paragraph (a) must be retained.</P>

The reply of the Minister on the latter occasion was that the Bill was not designed to make it illegal to work on a public holiday, and the amendment was not pressed. The Ceann Comhairle is still of the view that it is now too late to raise the point in No. 16, particularly as there is a Labour amendment to the Shops (Hours of Trading) Bill&mdash;No. 9, which is allowed&mdash;to close shops on public holidays and, furthermore, for the reason that if No. 16 were carried, there would be other amendments to be made consequentially to the Bill which have not been tabled and for which a further stage would be necessary.

      <P>I want to know from the Minister on what basis this sub-section will operate in giving the assistant board wages while he is on holidays?  That is an entirely new principle in respect of living-in.  Board wages while on holidays is a well-established principle in regard to domestic servants.  It is a well-established principle that when the domestic servant goes on holidays she gets board wages.  The arrangement between the shopkeeper and the assistant, where the assistant is living in, is that when the assistant goes on holidays he will get his salary.  What is going to be the effect of this amendment?  Is it to raise the salary of the shop assistant by allowing the cost of his board and lodging?  What was the Minister's view on the matter?  I want to point out to him there is no analogy between a domestic servant and a shop assistant in this matter of board wages.</P>

      <P>The assumption on which I went is that the shop assistant who gets board and lodging is in fact being paid part of his wages in kind, and that when he was on his annual holidays he had to get in cash and not in kind that portion of his wages represented by the value of his board and lodgings.  It is obvious that some provision of this kind is necessary. You might find an apprentice who got 3/-, 4/- or 5/- a week in cash and got his board and lodging in addition. Such an assistant would find his holidays a loss.  The cash payment given him would not enable him to find his board and lodgings.  On the assumption that board and lodgings represents payment in kind, some provision of this kind is required.</P>

      <P>I am not arguing against it.  I think there is a good deal of force and reason in what the Minister says, but are we passing this amendment with full advertence to its implications? Take the case of an apprentice. The apprentice does not pay full insurance because he is not a salaried person.  We are now dealing with that case as a salaried person.  It seems to me that automatically on the passing of this amendment the apprentice will become and must become an insured person under the Insurance Act.  The Minister is probably aware that there are two systems of apprenticeship in the country, (1) whereunder the parent or guardian of the apprentice pays a fee and the apprentice serves a term of years.  In the last year the apprentice gets a wage which operates pretty closely to give back to the parent or the boy the amount paid for his indenture.  The alternative system is that the parent or guardian pays no fee; the apprentice serves three years instead of four years and never gets paid at all, but he is provided with free board, lodging and laundry.  That is the only point with regard to wages, and so these boys have never been liable for national health contributions. If you are going to declare by statute that these things &mdash; board and lodging&mdash; are wages and that they are going to be evaluated by the district justice, then from that will flow that these boys are liable to both systems of insurance.</P>

      <P>I think the Labour Party will confirm me in saying that it is not the custom, in the case of shop assistants, to provide board wages, as it is in the case of domestic servants.  The assistants' salaries have been fixed on the assumption that there is a spread-over in the 12 months of the service which ought to help the assistants to pay their lodgings, board and so on, during their holiday period.</P>

      <P>If a shopkeeper employs two assistants in a town, one living in and the other living out, both on the same grade, both doing the same kind of work, I take it the assistant living out would be paid more in cash than the assistant living in.  Otherwise Deputy Dillon would have to argue that there is no value placed by an employer on board and lodging at all. I suggest, if they are paid at different rates because of the fact that one is living in, that the shopkeeper does place a value on board and lodging.  If the assistant going on holiday (the living out assistant) is paid his full wages, and the living in assistant is paid his cash wages without getting any allowance for board and lodging&mdash; if that is the custom, it is an illogical one.  If board and lodging is to be worth anything, surely the living in assistant on holiday should get some allowance if the living out assistant gets his full wages?</P>

I merely direct the attention of the House to the fact that it is doing something new.  That does not necessarily mean that it is something bad.  There is powerful logic behind the case made for this proposal.  I am not arguing against this at all, but the point is that the House is introducing into this trade a new principle entirely unfounded on the custom of the trade, and it is doing that in the knowledge that Section 22 is in the Bill, which prohibits the employer from altering the rates of wages obtaining on the date the Bill passes.</P>

      <P>I think amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21 have to be considered together.  I move: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17, Section 32 (1), to delete line 34 and substitute the words &ldquo;included in a public-holiday fortnight) and in each public holiday.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In page 17, Section 32 (2), to delete lines 38 to 50, both inclusive, and substitute the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;week (other than a week included in a public-holiday fortnight) and of each public-holiday fortnight, give not later than the Saturday preceding that week or that public-holiday fortnight (as the case may be) to each member of the staff of such shop who is in his employment on that Saturday, notice in the prescribed form and manner specifying the weekday in that week or in that public-holiday fortnight (as the case may be) on which he proposes to allow such member a half-holiday in pursuance of sub-section (1) of this section, and if default is made in compliance with this sub-section or if a half-holiday is allowed in that week or in that public-holiday fortnight on any weekday other than the weekday specified in such notice, and half-holiday allowed to such member in that week or in that public-holiday fortnight shall be deemed, for&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete Section 32 (8), and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(8)  In this section the expression &ldquo;public-holiday fortnight&rdquo; means in relation to any shop the week in which a day which is for that shop a public holiday falls, and the immediately preceding week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill the shop assistants are entitled to a half-day in each week.  The object of amendment No. 19 is to secure that the original intention, namely, that only one half-day should be lost to the assistant in respect of the period which includes a public holiday, shall be carried out.  Under the sub-section as amended the assistant would be entitled to one half-holiday in any <Col N="575" /> fortnight including any one of the six public holidays.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 19.  Amendment No. 20, which is consequential, provides that each fortnight including a public holiday is being treated in the same way as the original Christmas fortnight was.  Amendment No. 21 is consequential upon that.  It is a somewhat elaborate procedure, but it is designed to effect the purpose I have indicated, to make it clear that the shop assistant is entitled to one half-holiday in the fortnight which includes a public holiday.</P>

      <P>The only thing I would like to say about these amendments is that the Minister or his Department will have to send out this notice, which is to be hung up in the shops.  It will have to be very clear and very concise, because it will be difficult to follow a great number of these sections.  I dare say the Minister and his Department will manage to make it clear, to have a placard setting out the position clearly, but they will have a very tough job indeed in explaining some of this in simple language.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that in the British House of Commons a frequent preliminary procedure, where there is a complicated Bill, is to publish a White Paper setting out in simple terms the main outlines of the Bill.  These two Bills, when they become Acts, are going to affect the daily lives of thousands of people. Will the Minister consider drafting White Papers to give the application of these two Bills to the daily operations of a shop in as simple language as possible and circulate them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see the danger of that.  The Department is not responsible for the interpretation of the Acts.  The interpretation is a matter for the courts.  If a Government Department took the responsibility of publishing a document setting <Col N="576" /> out what purported to be an interpretation of an Act, it might lead to all sorts of difficulties later if the courts have to put an interpretation on it. However, I think some persons always come forth, for a purely personal or other reason, and publish explanatory pamphlets relating to legislation of this kind, upon their own initiative, and in so far as they are private persons, they take no responsibility except to give their own opinions.  I am sure that will be done in relation to these Bills.  It is much better that it should be done by private persons than by a Government Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, Section 35 (1), to delete paragraph (b) and substitute therefor two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>or,</P>
      <P>(b)  by agreement between such proprietor and such member, such proprietor shall increase by one the number of consecutive whole holidays in the annual leave of such member;</P>
      <P>(c)  if such member ceases to be in the employment of such proprietor before such member has been allowed such whole holiday, such proprietor shall pay to him one day's pay calculated at the rate which would be applicable if such public holiday were a day of annual leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> I think the Minister suggested that he was prepared to consider an amendment which would be made in relation to a shop where they found that they had no reason to keep open and were prepared to close on a public holiday. I do not know what the Minister thinks of this or the succeeding amendment, but in my opinion it would be a great hardship to ask an establishment to keep open on a day when there was no business or to give their employees holiday in excess of the 14.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that I tried to draft an amendment which would not make evasion possible.  I am not any more anxious than the Minister to have evasion.  I do not think that, in offering a distinct class of persons a separate procedure, the Minister can do any harm.  I ask him for his opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that it is desirable we should permit agreements of this kind to be made.  The public holidays occur at varying periods of the year, and I think it is desirable that these workers should get their day's leave in or about the periods of the public holidays rather than that they should be able to collect the holidays, as it were, and take them consecutively at whatever period the annual holiday is allowed.  Some workers might desire to do that and some employers might find it convenient to agree that they should do it.  At the same time, I am not at all sure that it is wise to permit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that consideration, the adoption of this amendment would add considerable complication to the Bill and greatly increase the difficulty of enforcing this particular provision, because it would be very difficult to check up on the statement of an employer, who had failed to give the day in lieu of the public holiday for which the Bill provides, that he made an agreement to give a day in lieu. The employee might find it awkward to contradict the statement of the employer, because such contradiction might lead to a permanent holiday without pay for that assistant.  Consequently, the difficulty of enforcement, as the Deputy will see, would be very much increased.  On that account I am <Col N="578" /> not prepared to accept the amendment, but, apart from that difficulty, which is a practical difficulty so far as the enforcement of the Bill is concerned, there is the further consideration which I bring to the Deputy's attention&mdash;whether it is wise in every-body's interest to allow it.  If we decide to allow it in this way, might we not allow the shop assistant to accumulate his annual leave so that he could take a month every four years instead of a week every year?</P>

      <P>I discussed these amendments with the Deputy on the last day and, while I have a certain sympathy with his point of view.  I am afraid their acceptance would produce considerable complication in the provisions of the Bill.  It is not possible to provide for every possible case of this kind.  We have, I think, gone to our limit in distinguishing between various classes of shops.  To attempt <Col N="579" /> to distinguish between individual shops would be a hopeless task and would make the uniform enforcement of the Bill very difficult.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has made up his mind on the matter, I shall not press the amendment.  At the same time, I think the Minister is unduly anxious for uniformity.  I think that there should be a certain amount of flexibility so that different conditions would apply to different trades and different circumstances.  After all, the real test in a measure such as this will be whether everybody recognises that it is perfectly fair.  The Minister himself has admitted that he is placing a certain amount of hardship on certain limited classes.  I do not think that that is either desirable or necessary.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has made up his mind on these lines, I do not suppose that anything further can be done.  Some people have, however, made the comment that the provisions regarding the whole of these holidays are unnecessarily complicated, that everybody should get the seven days, not including half-holidays; that the special-trade shops should be provided for and that an assistant should get the public holidays either within 14 days or added on to his annual leave, according to agreement.  Apparently it is too late to make that suggestion now.  I think that the Minister is unduly anxious for uniformity in order to make supervision easier.  I suggest to him that the easiest supervision is secured where everybody feels that the Act should be observed and is prepared to give information and press for notice to be taken of evasions.  The question ultimately comes down to how far the public recognise the justice of the Act and desire its enforcement.</P>

      <P>With regard to the definition of hotel in the Bill, I should like to ask if the Minister is clear as to what a hotel means.  He has made an effort, since the beginning of the Bill, to define &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; and reading the definition carefully, one finds that it means a place in which sleeping accommodation is provided.  It makes no reference to the sale of food or anything else.  Further down, we find that &ldquo;refreshment house&rdquo; includes &ldquo;hotel,&rdquo; so that a refreshment house may possibly include a place where no food is sold at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that holds.  I do not say that this is a perfect definition, but it is the best we could get to deal with the circumstances. There is a definition of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; in the licensing laws, but it <Col N="583" /> would not suit the particular purpose of this measure.  The definition in this Bill is:</P>
      <P>any premises structurally adapted for use and <i>bona-fide</i> used as a hotel and having apartments set apart and exclusively used for the sleeping accommodation of travellers.</P>

      <P>There is another matter about which there will be some difficulty.  The Minister has power to make closing orders.  I am not sure of the section, but he is empowered to define times and to make closing orders, but he cannot deal with licensed premises at all. They are excepted so far as the hours at which they must be closed are concerned. A temperance hotel, however, might come under the ban to a great extent.  There are some large temperance hotels and they might suddenly discover that while the non-temperance hotel, the licensed hotel, is open, they could not be open.  There is one large temperance hotel in Dublin and another large one in Athlone, and there are some fairly substantial temperance hotels through the country. Properly speaking, I think it could be met if some words like &ldquo;This shall not apply to licensed premises or an hotel&rdquo; were inserted in a subsequent section.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that all shops shall close on public holidays subject to certain reservations which are set out.  In the majority of small towns all the big shops close on public holidays, for instance, on bank holidays, and it is only a few of the smaller ones that remain open.  This amendment is really giving legislative sanction to what has been common practice.  Public houses are compelled to close on certain public holidays, St. Patrick's Day, Christmas Day and Good Friday, and I suggest there is no case for having small shops open on Sundays.  The amendment provides for certain exemptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has not given due attention to the difference in the practice prevailing in relation to public holidays in cities, towns and rural areas.  It is quite true that in the larger cities and towns it is the practice for most shops, other than shops that are exempt, to close on public holidays.  But that is by no means the practice in the greater part of the country where public holidays are not observed to any great extent, and where the obligation to close would mean the introduction of a new practice which would be of no advantage to people residing in these areas. It is also necessary to take into account the circumstances of holiday resorts and other places to which workers in towns go on public holidays, and the necessity of providing for their convenience. I gave consideration to that because it arose in the preparation of the Bill, and I have come to the conclusion that, so long as we are providing for the possibility of shop assistants getting public holidays or, if not, compensation by way of another holiday later, we were going as far as it is necessary to go.  If we were to attempt to go the distance which the amendment suggests, by providing for the compulsory closing of shops on public holidays, we would be introducing unnecessary complications which would, perhaps, arouse considerable opposition to the measure, and, in any event, make its enforcement in certain respects a matter of difficulty.  I do not think there is a public need to require the closing of all shops on public holidays.  It may he the usual <Col N="591" /> practice to do so in some areas, and it may be necessary for some employers to do so in consequence of the Conditions of Employment Act, but, even taking all that into account, it is difficult to understand how the public interest calls for it.  In any part of the country where it is not the practice, and where it is not desired to become the practice, if assistants are called upon to work on public holidays, the other Act makes ample compensation for the giving of alternative holidays. That is as far as I think it necessary to go in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Our people feel that it is necessary to test this amendment.  I endeavoured to have an amendment inserted in the other Act providing that shop assistants, except in certain circumstances, would be entitled to the public holidays.  That amendment was resisted, and unless this amendment is carried there will be no provision to compel shops to close on any particular day, or to secure that shop assistants are to get holidays on any particular day in lieu of public holidays.  The value of the one day's holiday is lost to a certain extent, so far as shop assistants and other workers are concerned, if they are not all on holiday at the same time.  As the Bill stands, provision is made for shopkeepers in an area to make a choice as to whether public holidays will be bank holidays or religious holidays.  Accordingly, having that choice, a good deal of the opposition to the amendment falls to the ground.  It has been urged that on Catholic holidays it is the custom in some parts for country people to go to the towns to do their shopping.  In such areas, as far as the shops are concerned, bank holidays can be substituted for Catholic holidays and <i>vice versa.</i>  As shopkeepers have the choice as regards bank holidays, religious holidays or public holidays, that meets whatever objection there might be to the amendment.  There is no reason why in every town and village there should not be a certain number of days in the year when shops are closed, so that shop assistants, shopkeepers and others could enjoy a day's holiday, like people in the larger centres.  Failing the acceptance of this amendment, <Col N="592" /> there is no provision in the Bill to compel shops to close on these days, and for that reason I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to forget that there are parts of the country where the fact that Easter Monday, Whit Monday, or the First Monday in August are bank holidays, is completely unknown.  If you go to any rural part every agricultural labourer and every farmer is working on bank holidays the same as on the ordinary day.  These holidays mean nothing to them.  Why should not country shops be open in just exactly the same way?  I cannot see that it is any hardship on a country shopkeeper who wishes to keep open on a particular day, or on the shop assistants who have their holidays provided for in the other Bill, that the shop should keep open in the ordinary way for people who are not observing these bank holidays.  They should not be made a special class, so that people coming in the ordinary way to their doors will suddenly discover the doors shut and be informed that it is Whit Monday or the first Monday in August and then ask: &ldquo;What is the first Monday in August?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's discussion of this amendment in relation to the Shop Assistants (Conditions of Employment) Bill has a boomerang effect.  If you compare it with that Bill, I think you will then get the kernel of the whole trouble.  There are two shops in a small town, one employing assistants and the other not employing assistants.  The man who employs assistants is compelled by the previous Bill, which has now gone through the House, if he opens on a Sunday and works his assistants, to give them a compensatory holiday.  But the Shop Assistants (Conditions of Employment) Bill does not apply to the man next door who has no assistants.  Therefore, the gentleman next door, who does not employ labour, can open when he likes and is definitely in a better position than the employer of labour next door. If you discuss the two Bills in relation to one another, I think you will agree that that is the one fundamental reason for this amendment, in order to <Col N="593" /> bring the shopkeeper who can run his shop with his family into line with the shopkeeper who has to employ assistants.</P>

      <P>As I understand the Deputy, the purpose of the amendment is to compel certain shop proprietors, who do not employ assistants, to take a holiday on public holidays.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  I do not think that the public interest demands that, nor is it true that that type of shop proprietor is being given an advantage over the other type who employs assistants.  If there is trade to be done on a public holiday, the other shop proprietor can keep his establishment open and work his assistants, but he is obliged to give them a day in lieu.  If there is no trade to be done, if the circumstances are such that the majority of shops are shut, or that the people are on holiday, or for some other reason no business is likely to be forthcoming, he can close his establishment.  It is up to the shop proprietor to decide for himself which is the best course to take, whether he will keep open and take whatever trade is available, or whether he will shut and give his employees a holiday.  The type of establishment where employees are to be found is ordinarily a larger and more prosperous kind of institution than the one in which the proprietor works himself or works with the assistance of his family.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of the shop assistant it is obviously desirable that he should get his holiday upon the day on which everyone else is on holiday.  But everyone cannot <Col N="594" /> get a holiday on the same day. Someone must work if the holiday is to be a holiday at all for those who have the privilege of enjoying it.  In the ordinary course, over the great range of shops in respect to which trade is not done on a bank holiday, the practice will be to close.  I do not think it is necessary for us to undertake the obligation of enforcing by law, through the medium of the Guards, such a closing of these shops when we have in fact provided adequately, in my opinion, for the rights of the assistants.  In relation to those types of shops which are not of the exempted class, shops which are not tobacconists or confectionery shops or places of that kind, it can be stated, I think with truth, that the amount of business available to be done on a public holiday will be small, and that in the ordinary course the shop proprietor in the city or town will find it more suitable to close than to remain open.</P>

      <P>(3)  The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order under this sub-section amend, in respect of any specified area, sub-section (1) of this section in any one or more of the following ways, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by substituting for the day which is a public holiday by virtue of paragraph (b) of the said sub-section (1), the 1st day of January, or the 6th day of January,</P>
      <P>(b)  by substituting for Easter Monday, Ascension Thursday,</P>
      <P>(c)  by substituting for Whit Monday, the Feast of Corpus Christi or the 29th day of June,</P>

      <P>and whenever any such order is made in respect of any specified area, then, so long as such order remains in force, sub-section (1) of this section shall have effect in relation to any shops in such area subject to such amendment.</P>
      <P>(4)  The Minister may by order under this sub-section amend or revoke any order made by him under this section (including this sub-section).</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 6, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever and so often as an application is made to the Minister by a representative number of the proprietors of shops of a particular class in a particular area and a representative number of persons employed to do shop work in connection with shops of that class in that area requesting him to make an order under any Part of this Act, the Minister shall, unless he considers the application frivolous, make such order in such form and subject to such conditions as he may think fit to prescribe.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every order made under this section shall be an hours of trading order and the provisions in Part III of this Act relating to the making of an hours of trading order shall have effect and apply to every such order as if these provisions were reenacted in this section, save only that whenever such order relates to a day which is the weekly half-holiday, the specified hour of closing may be earlier than six o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under part of this Bill, the Minister has power to make a closing order in respect of certain days in the week, for instance, for fixing the half-holiday, but there is no machinery included in the Bill to secure that closing orders will be made.  In short, the effect of this amendment will be that there shall be a uniform half-holiday in the different towns.  Under the Bill, certain shops must close for a half-day each week and you might have the position down the country where one shopkeeper would close and take his half-day on Wednesday while another shopkeeper in the same trade would take his half-day on Thursday, <Col N="598" /> with the result that the whole thing would become chaotic.</P>
    <P>There would be nothing but retaliation on both sides, with the result that the entire Act might be nullified to the detriment of the trade, and, furthermore, I think to the detriment of shop assistants.  As I think I already pointed out in arguing this amendment on the previous stage, in the case of shop assistants living in a town their activities, both social and otherwise, are generally joint, and it is rather a hardship on them to have half their number in the same trade getting a half-day on Wednesday while the remainder have a half-day on Thursday. The Minister has already pointed out that he is endeavouring to make the provisions of this Act uniform, and I think that if this amendment were passed it would go a long way towards making one of the principal provisions uniform.  The Minister has power under this amendment, after consulting the different trade interests in a certain town or certain area, to fix that, say, the drapery trade in that area shall have a half-day on Wednesday. I think it is a reasonable amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other aspect of the amendment on which I think Deputy McGowan did not touch, and it is this: As the Bill stands at present the Minister is not in any circumstances required to make an order, and one of the purposes of this amendment&mdash;in fact, I think its chief purpose&mdash;is to ensure that, if there is a representative request from an area for a closing order, such closing order will be made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to that aspect of the matter, I think that the amendment which it is proposed to insert would serve no purpose at all. I think it has to be taken for granted that, if there is a really representative request from any area for the making of a closing order affecting the class of shop in which the persons making the request are interested, that order would be made, but if you impose upon the Minister the obligation of making an order you must provide that he will have discretion in determining what constitutes a representative <Col N="599" /> request.  If you do that, you get into precisely the same position in which the Bill leaves you at the moment.  The question as to what constitutes a representative body or a representative section of any class of traders is a very difficult one to determine. Do you count heads only, or do you count the number of persons employed, or do you judge them in relation to the annual turn-over of their business, or how do you weight the representative capacity of one individual as against another?  I think, therefore, that if you propose to proceed on those lines you must give somebody the right and the discretion to determine whether or not the particular request comes from a representative section of the traders.  If you do that, then I think the need for the whole thing falls to the ground, because it is reasonable to assume that when a proposal comes from people who are properly representative, who do in fact speak for the people engaged in the trade, their representations will be acted on, unless as is provided for here they are of such a character as to be worthy of the description of &ldquo;frivolous.&rdquo;  That is unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, therefore, that this amendment is unnecessary, and it might in fact operate to limit the freedom of action of the Minister in so far as the practice might develop that no action would be taken without such representations being made.  I think it is much better to leave the matter as it stands, to enable the Minister to consider all relevant considerations, and make his own decision in the light of the circumstances and of the information at his disposal.  He is, of course, empowered and authorised to hold a local inquiry if such local inquiry appears to be necessary in order to get the necessary information.  There is nothing in this Bill which debars anybody&mdash;whether he is representative or not&mdash;from making representations, and it has to be assumed that the ordinary practice will be that representations will be made.  If they are obviously made by persons who can speak for the bulk of the parties concerned, those representations will be acted on.  If that is not obvious, then they will be <Col N="600" /> followed probably by a local inquiry, unless the nature of the representations is such as to preclude the possibility of action being taken upon them irrespective of the outcome of the local inquiry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the proposal I discussed this matter here before.  There are grounds which make it desirable to have a uniform closing day for all establishments in particular towns, but it is impossible to fit that within the framework of this Bill.  That was the procedure under the existing law, but the existing law required that the initiative in fixing a half-day or fixing closing hours for shops on ordinary days should come from the traders themselves. The law provided that two-thirds of the traders in a particular area must agree, and set up elaborate machinery for inquiries and so forth before action could be taken.  If we are to get away from all that, and give power to take direct action where action is required, then I think we have to operate on the basis contemplated in this Bill, which leaves it discretionary to the proprietor of a shop as to what day he shall choose for a half-holiday. I am strongly of opinion that proprietors of shops in large towns will find it to their advantage to choose one uniform half-day in each week.  In such towns, where the half-holiday has been in operation for some time past, the fact becomes known not merely amongst the citizens of the town itself but amongst all the people of the surrounding district who trade in that town, and they do not bother to come in to do shopping on that afternoon because they know that certain establishments will be closed.  It would be in the interests of employers as well of the public that that practice should continue.  I think it will continue on that account, and that it is not necessary to establish any procedure for local inquiries such as would be necessary if we were to undertake the responsibility for fixing by order the day on which a town must observe a half-holiday.  I think in practice it will work out that way.  I think that local traders will agree amongst themselves as to the day most suitable to have as a half-holiday, and that it will <Col N="601" /> not be in any trader's interest to depart from what is the general practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much better to leave the matter to the traders, and in fact it will invariably result in all the shops closing on the same day, for the reasons set out by the Minister.  The people would not come into the town, and the traders would not find it worth while opening their shops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of custom; the shopkeepers agree amongst themselves without any meetings or anything else.  But you may find one or two people in some towns who will not agree to anything.  They will open for seven days in the week, with the result that decent shopkeepers are prevented from coming to an arrangement to have a regular half-day in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that they are not permitted to open on seven days.  Those traders must shut for a half-day at some time during the week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea, however, is to have it uniform.  For instance, there may be one delinquent, and perhaps he will not close on certain days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This difficulty arises, as the Minister pointed out.  How are you going to weight the day?  Suppose you have two large shops, each employing 20 assistants, and 30 shops, each employing one assistant &mdash; how are you going to prevent these shops, employing one assistant each, from controlling <Col N="602" /> the others in regard to the matter of closing, as they could easily do, and therefore injure those two large shops which were really giving employment to the town?  How would you weight it so as to avoid that?  If you have a system which is working satisfactorily, surely it is better to continue that system.  If abuses arise in a particular town, let the Minister's attention be directed to that with a view to taking action, by legislation if needs be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this will work out all right.  If events should prove that my view is wrong and if we have different traders in a town closing upon different days of the week, so that nobody knows what is the half-day, then I think we might have to go back to the old system; but I do not think that will happen, and therefore I think it is easier to deal with it in this manner.  It avoids the necessity for all that machinery of local inquiry and local consultation which was necessary under the existing law.</P>

If something should arise in, say, Castlebar, or some other place, I would have to consult the people in the place concerned on some statutory basis, and it is that statutory consultation that I am anxious to avoid, because of the difficulties I have mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it would be best to discuss amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24 together. Deputy Dillon raised a difficulty during discussion on the last stage in connection with the fixing of the day of the weekly half-holiday.  I have given the matter some consideration without being able to discover a really satisfactory way out of it.  The method proposed in these amendments is, I think, the best that can be devised in the circumstances.  The Deputy's point was that certain fairs are held on movable feasts.  They occur on particular dates which may be on different days of the week, one year with another, and his point was that some provision should be made to enable the half-holiday to be adjusted to meet the situation that would arise if one of these fairs happened to fall on the day fixed for the <Col N="606" /> half-holiday in a particular town.  In considering how to deal with that situation, which requires to be dealt with, I gave consideration to this general provision relating to half-holidays. The provision, as Deputies will remember, prescribes that the half-holiday can be altered by the proprietor of the shop, but not oftener than once in three months, and subject only to giving notice to the sergeant in charge of the nearest Gárda Síochána station of the intention to make such change.  I came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to maintain that provision outside the cities or county boroughs, and that in fact the same circumstances, to which I have referred already, and which would operate to ensure the maintenance of a uniform half-holiday in all the smaller towns of the country, would continue to operate to prevent any numerous changes in the day chosen by a proprietor to be his half-day.  The proprietor, in all probability, will find it best to conform with the general practice, and undesirable, from the point of view of his trade, to change his half-day frequently, because his customers would become confused and he would lose trade if he did so.  Therefore, the amendments seek to provide that, outside the county boroughs, the half-day may be changed oftener than once in a period of three months and subject only to giving the requisite notice to the sergeant of the Guards at the nearest station.  That, of course, will enable the difficulty, which Deputy Dillon mentions, to be got over, and I am not at all sure that it is not a desirable change in any event, even if that difficulty did not exist.</P>

    <P>The object of this amendment is to empower the Minister in cases in which he makes an order exempting shops in regard to Sunday trading to specify the hours.  It may apply to the whole of an exempted area or to part of an exempted area.  The order may make it unlawful for any particular shop or class of shop to keep open after a particular hour.  There may be different provisions for different periods of the <Col N="615" /> year.  The Sunday trading orders may pertain to more than one class of shop to enable them to serve customers in case of emergency.  It is provided that where an early closing order is in force, Sunday trading automatically lapses.  Special provision is made for the case of the multiple shop.  A shop selling exempted articles may not open until the latest named hour for the sale of any of the commodities sold.</P>

      <P>(b) either &mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  declare that it shall not be lawful for the proprietor of any shop (being a shop in which there is carried on any business which is for the time being an exempted business for the purposes of this Part of this Act) situate in such trading area to open or keep open such shop for the serving of customers on any Sunday before a specified hour or after a specified hour, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  declare that it shall not be lawful for the proprietor of any shop (being a shop in which there is carried on any business which is for the time being an exempted business for the purposes of this Part of this Act) of a specified class (defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Minister thinks <Col N="616" /> proper) situate in such trading area to open or keep open such shop for the serving of customers on any Sunday before a specified hour or after a specified hour:</P>
    <P>and such order may contain different provisions in relation to different periods of the year.</P>
    <P>(2)  The following provisions shall apply in respect of every hours of Sunday-trading (exempted businesses) order made in relation to a particular trading area, that is to say: &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such order may relate to more than one class of shops and in that case may contain different provisions in relation to each class of shops to which it applies;</P>
    <P>(b)  such order may contain provisions authorising the serving of customers outside the hours specified therein in cases of emergency and such other cases as may be specified in such order.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by order under this sub-section revoke or amend any order made under this section (including this sub-section).</P>
    <P>(4)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an hours of Sunday-trading (exempted businesses) order relates to two or more classes of shops, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a particular shop to which such order applies falls within more than one of the said classes, the provisions of such order relating to one of the said classes within which such shop falls shall not be construed as affecting in any way the application to such shop of the provisions of such order relating to any other of the said classes within which such shop falls.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where two or more hours of Sunday-trading (exempted businesses) orders are applicable to the same shop nothing contained in any one of such orders shall be construed as affecting in any way the application to such shop of the other or others of such orders.</P>
    <P>(6)  If whenever an hours of Sunday-trading (exempted businesses) order is in force the proprietor of any shop to which such order applies <Col N="617" /> acts in contravention of any of the provisions of such order which are applicable to such shop, such proprietor shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to empower the Minister to fix the hours of trading on Sunday for businesses which are exempted as regards Sunday trading.

      <P>The only point is that they are perishable commodities and there may be circumstances in which it would be unfair to require persons trading in these goods to close for a weekly half-holiday.  We are arranging that any assistants employed would get the half-holiday.  I gave this matter consideration and I came to the conclusion that it is wiser to leave the Bill in this form for the time being. There is power in the Bill to take these articles out of the Schedule if it were agreed that that was the wiser course, in which case a closing order in relation <Col N="621" /> to shops selling these articles can be made.  But, as a general indication of the line we propose to proceed on, I would prefer that we leave them there for the time being.  I would not take them out of the Schedule without consultation with all the parties concerned and full consideration of the circumstances that might apply in different parts of the country, and which arise as the practice of the trade varies.  My feeling is that it is wise to leave them there, so that before any decision can be made in relation to them, an order which will give full notice to everybody of the intention to effect a change in their position must be made, and adequate opportunities made available for consultation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters that I think ought to be mentioned, now that this Bill is passing into law. One is that I should like to press very strongly on the Minister that both these Bills relating to shops should be enforced with the broadest possible latitude until the people concerned come really to understand their meaning. They are extremely complex measures and many perfectly <i>bona fide</i> persons will unconsciously break the law.  What I want to impress principally on the Minister is this, that it is an extremely painful experience to an old and well-established firm to come into conflict with the law at all. It may appear to persons at headquarters that they do not mean to cast aspersions on a man's good faith by starting a prosecution.  They may think it convenient to test out something by prosecuting a firm, never dreaming that it is any more offensive than an ordinary prosecution under the Acts which protect industrial workers &mdash; that it is some ordinary every-day affair. That is not true of a business establishment in a country town.  A prosecution means to them very material embarrassment and may destroy a long <Col N="622" /> record of honourable trading to which they attach very great importance, in that they have never been known consciously to come in conflict with the law.</P>
      <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer briefly is this: All Parties in this House sincerely, I believe, desire to promote the social services and improve the general conditions under which all our citizens live.  But we ought to remember always, when we are implementing legislation, that legislation of this kind does cost money; it does increase costs, it does put an added burden on the people who ultimately have to carry all the burden and all the cost.  In so far as country shops are concerned, the bulk of the increased cost created by these Bills will fall on the shoulders of the country people. The shopkeepers will simply have to increase their margin of profit to meet the higher rates of wages and the superior conditions which these Bills impose.  Some time ago I reviewed that with great alarm, because I felt that the agricultural community would be quite unequal to the strain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, our Government is entering upon discussions which we all hope &mdash; and some of us have good reason to believe &mdash; will have a happy issue; and, in the light of that, I think we may venture on expenditure which we otherwise would have to weigh well in our minds.  But I do want to urge, especially on the Labour Party, the recollection that every bit of this kind of legislation does cost money, and we, in this country, in our desire to combat what appear to us all to be abuses, ought not to make the same mistake that France has made, or the same kind of mistake the United States of America is in great danger of making &mdash; that is, of forcing costs up very rapidly without making due provision to finance these increased costs.  Unless we keep the income of the people rising so as to meet the increased costs we by our legislation create, we are going to have a catastrophe such as France has encountered and such as America is threatened with at the present time, with this aggravating factor in our case, that the two countries I have mentioned, France and <Col N="623" /> America, are immensely wealthy countries, with immense powers of recuperation. We are not.  If we struck a storm, resulting from the imprudent raising of costs, without making adequate provision to finance them, it might so shake the whole economic structure that it would be impossible for any Party or combination of Parties to pull the country round without external help.  We have nowhere to look for external help, and it would be a deplorable commentary on our excellent intentions that, in our desire for reform, we rushed ahead too fast without, at every step, making prudent provision not only for initiating the reforms but for maintaining them permanently.  I do hope that, as a result of deliberations about to take place we shall be able to get from the national income all that will be necessary to provide for the reforms envisaged thus far.  It will be a source of undiluted satisfaction to every side of the House if that is possible, but, at the same time, in view of the fact that the Minister has spoken of the probability of other measures on these lines coming before us, I do urge on the House to consider between now and the time when such measures may present themselves, the question of providing the wherewithal to finance this type of legislation and of remembering that the only people we can get it from ultimately is the agricultural community.  Therefore, in addition to exerting ourselves to promote reform, all Parties, whether they represent agricultural interests or not, should earnestly concern themselves to promote the profit-making capacity of agriculture and the land, so that the community will have sufficient wealth to meet this type of call when we make such calls upon it.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House is deeply obliged to Deputy Dillon for the lecture he has given the Labour Party and the Government.  What relation some of it had to this Bill I do not exactly understand.  He opened by appealing to the Minister to see that, as far as he could, considerable latitude, as he called it, was given in <Col N="624" /> enforcing the provisions of this Bill. I happen to know that in the case of other legislation of this kind &mdash; for instance, the Conditions of Employment Act &mdash; employers have in a great many instances taken advantage of loopholes to evade their responsibilities. As regards compulsory holidays, certain employers, even here in the City of Dublin, have gone out of their way to dismiss employees just before the period which would qualify them for holidays had elapsed.  I urge upon the Minister the importance of enforcing the provisions of this Bill.  When a measure of this kind is passed, surely it is the intention of the House that it should be put into effect.  I can see no meaning in Deputy Dillon's appeal that the Act should not be put into effect &mdash;</P>

      <P>Am I to take it that Deputy Dillon means that America has been threatened with economic and financial collapse only since America commenced to take an interest in social legislation &mdash; in other words, since the Roosevelt administration came into power?  Surely, the reverse is the case. Surely, America was on the point of collapse when Roosevelt came forward to make some sort of effort, by social and other legislation, to pull it together. Again, in regard to France, I suggest that, prior to legislation of this kind being adopted, France was on the verge of revolution.  I think that <Col N="625" /> Deputy Dillon is wrong in his facts and still more wrong in his conclusions.</P>
      <P>While I regret that the Minister did not see fit to adopt some of the Labour Party's amendments which, I believe, would have considerably improved the Bill, still I welcome the spirit and intention of the Bill, and I hope it is only one of many similar measures.  I hope that it will be followed very quickly by a similar Bill to deal with workers in the transport and other industries not yet covered by legislation. So far as the general principles of the Bill are concerned, I welcome them and, unlike Deputy Dillon, I hope the Minister will do everything possible immediately to enforce the provisions of this measure.</P>

      <P>On the question of the enforcement of the measure, in all legislation of this kind &mdash; the Conditions of Employment Act, the Conditions of Employment (Shop Assistants) Bill and the present Bill &mdash; I think the Minister will agree that it does not matter what provisions are included to deal with detection or with the question of prosecution. You may provide all sorts of penalties but the only person who can give the necessary information and see that this measure and similar Acts are properly enforced is the employee. He is the one person who suffers and he is the person who should give the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, I think, he lacks a certain amount of moral courage and does not give the required information. That is due to one or two things. It has come out very strongly under the Conditions of Employment Act &mdash; the Minister, I think, referred to it in the course of the debate on these Bills &mdash; that an employee who becomes a little busy in detecting breaches of the <Col N="626" /> different Acts and reporting upon them to the authorities is easily got rid of by the employer.  He contrives that that employee will not remain very long in his employment.  As long as you have that bogey, you might as well not pass these Acts at all.  There is definitely one difference between the Hours of Closing Bill and the Conditions of Employment Bill.  In the one case, you have shop inspectors enforcing it and, in the other, the Civic Guards.  Deputy Dillon need have no fears of the Hours of Closing Bill.  I think he is well known to the police, and I do not think the Guards will be unduly harsh with him.</P>
