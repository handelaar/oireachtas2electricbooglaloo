      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Esmonde)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn from time to time to the present position of mental hospital attendants who, in order to qualify for full superannuation allowane, agree obliged to continue serving up to the age of 55 years regardless of the number of years of their service; and whether he will consider the desirability of introducing proposals for legislation which would give to mental hospital attendants the right to retire on full superannuation allowancce on the completion of 25 years' service without the qualification as to reaching the age limit.</P>

      <P>I have not received any special representations on this matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he has refused or is about to refuse to grant licences to several small bacon curers; and, if so, whether, before such action is taken, he will have inquiry made into the circumstances surrounding the proposed extinction of their factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question presumably refers to the minor curers who were registered as such under the Pigs and Bacon Acts and who failed to qualify for licences.  The Acts lay down that curers must have produced as certain quantity of bacon within the preliminary period, and failure to do so makes their ineligible for liences. The circumstances attending the bacon factories on the eligbility for licence bearing on the eligibility for licence and cannot, therefore, be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that recently some authorised inspectors have gone round amongst the minor currers and that to some of the minor curers they have said: &ldquo;We accept from your returns that you have slaughtered the qualifing number of pigs, but we declare that your premises do not come up to the required standard and, therefore, we will not giver you a licence&rdquo;?  To the others they have said: &ldquo;we admit that your premises come up to the required standard, but we do not admit that your records are correct, that you slaughtered the requisite number of pigs and, therefore we will not give you a licence,&rdquo; with the net result that nearly all the minor curers are to be swept out of existence and a virtual monopoly handed over to the members of the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether what the Deputy says is true or not, and I certainly do not accept it as true because the Deputy says, it, but if a baccon curer has fulfuilled his obligations with regard to quantity, he must also have his premises put in order, but they may be put in order now and a licence will be given.  If he did not have the requisite quantity slaughtered in the qualifying period, no matter whether the premises come up to the standard or not, a licence cannot be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose there is a uifferencce between the Department and the curer as to whether, in fact, the <Col N="1307" /> requisite number of pigs has been slaughtered, has the curer any method of appeal against the decision of the inspector that the requisite number has not been slaughtered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to welcome the new atmosphere in which the House can discuss matters of this kind.  The settlement of the dispute between this country and Britain has made it possible to discuss those matters without members of the Opposition or members on any side of the House being suspected of destructive criticism.  I think at the present moment it is admitted on all sides that whatever criticism may be offered on this or other measures it is in order to serve the interests of the country as a whole.  I think that all Parties have come to understand one another on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is that most disappointing Budget we have had for the last five or six years.  It is only a couple o weeks since the country was rejoicing at the prospects of improved trade between this country and Great Britain as a result of the Agreement. The people were hoping, and they had good grounds for the hope, that there would be a reduction in taxation, and that other reliefs would be forthcoming <Col N="1311" /> in this Budget in onsequence of the settlement.  I am sorry to say that the country has been sadly disappointed. The relief whih was expected has not come.  The taxpayers are still bearing the abnormal burdens whih were imposed upon them during the last five or six years. During that period there was perhaps some reasonble excuse because of the dispute between this country and Britain, but certainly that is not so at a normal time, which those outstanding disputes have been settled and the neccessity for paying very large sums in bounties has passed away.  We are told there are new items which are to taken the place of those bounties.  One of them is defence.  Like other Deputies in this House, I am not satisfied that the Minister and the Taoiseach are dealing fairly with this House or the country, because it is evident that something is being kept back in connection with this defence question.  It is turn that hints have been dropped in regard to something very important to come in the immediate or distant future.  We have been warned again and again that this is not such a boon as people expected, because defence is something very serious.  The Taoiseach has given us some hints; so has the Minister.  I think it is about time that the Minister should take the House into his confidence. Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, speaking last evening, used medical language and said that the Minister was giving it to the House in small doses.  I think the people of this country are able to take a full dose. It may be advisable in some cases to break the news gradually.  The Minister was afraid that the people had weak hearts and would not be able to stand the shock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is better that the House and the country should know the exact position, as far as the Minister can state it.  I realise that it is difficult to arrive at the amount involved, <Col N="1312" /> but we are getting it pretty clearly from other sources.  For instance, I think it was on 27th April last that I saw in the <i>Daily Mail</i> an article from the Dublin correspondent, in which it was stated that there was an understanding that at least the amount of money which was in dispute between the two countires would be spent on defence.  The Minister should tell us whether that report was justified by the facts; he should tell us whether there is any such understanding.  It would ease the anxiety of the people of this country to know whether there is any intention to spend so much money in the coming year.  The people would like to have this information, and not to have it administered in small doses.  Whatever the worst is, the people my as well know it.  They would be prepared to face the facts. It would be more satisfactory at all events.  With regard to this question of defence, maintaining that we are to defend 32 Counties, I do not see why a section of this country should take on a very serious responsibility the that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entitled to question the sums allocated in the Budget or defence, but I would remind him that the policy of defence will be discussed when the Vote is introduced in the immediate future.  The Minister for Defence is responsible for that policy, not Minister for Finance.  Some of the questions now being put to the Minister for Finance should be reserved for the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not precluding the Deputy from referring to the amount et out in this Budget. The whole defence policy, however, should more properly be raised on the Vote for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to dwell any longer on that subject.  We will have opportunities for dealing with it again I hope.  In the meantime, I still think that the sooner the <Col N="1313" /> people know more about it the better. It would allay their anxiety.  There are complaints also down the country and keep disappointment amongst people who expected relief in this Budget.  If we cast our minds bak to the time before the economic war, when the country was in a much better position and when the agricultural community was more prosperous than it is now, we will recall that at that time the Fianna Fáil Party strongly advocaed deating for farmers and it was hoped that out of the savings effected by the settlement, they would be able to implement that promise.</P>
      <P>It is matter for regret that the Minister has not seen fit in this Budget to make this provision.  He has tried to make people believe that all the saving which have been effected by the settlement, if there have been any savings, are being passed on to the farmers.  In page 35 of the Minister's Budget statement he stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputies may wish at this stage to refer to Table 6.  It sets out in a compact and convenient form that manner in which the moneys that in other circumstances might have been absorbed in payments to Great Britain have been utilised.  It shows that after making the necessary adjustment for the old Local Loans capital, the total sum which the stoppage of the payments made available for disposal amounted to £4,240,273.  Practically every penny of this, as may be seen, has been disposed of for the benefit of the farmers.  They have secured the last remnant of gain arising out of the struggle to retain the annuities, and for them at any rate the campaign begun under the Land League has ended in indubitable victory.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder was the Minister serious when the stated that practically every penny of this £4,240,273 has been disposed of for the benefit of the farmers?  Dose anybody agree with the Minister?  I very strongly disagree with him.  He refers us to Table 6 to prove it.  There is no proof of it in Table 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies <Col N="1314" /> have stressed the case for derating for farmers as restitution for their losses during the last five or six years.  I do not proposes to cover that ground again, because it has been already dealt with better than I can do it.  But I do propose to question the Minister's statement, not upon the losses of the last five or six years, but on the farmers' position at present.  Suppose we never had an economic war and the farmers had not been impoverished as they have been, I am prepared to question the Minister's statement and I think I will satisfy the Minister and the House that the Minister's contention is not correct, and that the farmers are entitled to dearating now more than they were in 1932, when Fiannan Fáil promised it and claimed that the farmers were entitled to it.  In the first place, in Table 6 the Minister has given amounts that he claims have been passed on for the benefit of the farmers.  Nothing of the sort has occurred.</P>
    <P>The first of these is the halving of the annuities, £1,615,000 under the earlier Land Acts, and £612,000 under the 1923 Land Act.  I do not question these figures which amount to £2,227,000.  The farmers have got the benefit of that.  The next item is &ldquo;Increase over 1931-32 in provision in the Land Commission Vote for improvement of estates&mdash;£498,050.&rdquo; How did that benefit the average farmer?  It may go to the benefit of some individuals, but how the Minister can claim that that is any benefit to the average farmer passes my comprehension Then there is No.4: &ldquo;Net increase over 1931-32 in provision under other Land Commission subheads, excepting (2) and (3) above and the excess and bonus stock contribution&mdash;£186,000.&rdquo; I do not think that benefits the average farmer Then we have No.5: &ldquo;Increase over 1931-32 in provision under other Votes for services in connection with Land Commission&mdash;£26,500.&rdquo; No.6 is: &ldquo;Estimated loss on sugar revenuse as compared with 1931-3 consequent upon development of beet sugar industry (adhusted in respect of beet suger subsidy paid in 1931-32&mdash;£899,610).&rdquo; Will the Minister tell us what benefit <Col N="1315" /> that is to the farers in County Cavan or in County Donegal, County Leitrim or County Sligo, where they are 200 miles from a sugar factor and where an acre of beet has never been grown? It may be a benefit of the districts where the beet is being grown, but the people who come from these districts question that.</P>
    <P>This really is the penalty that we pay for uneconomic production, for produsing something which cannot be produced economically.  If it is a benefit to anybody, it certainly dose not benefit the farmers, because the farmers are dissatified with the price they are being paid for beet.  They say it is not an economic price.  I do not propose to give an opinion on that, but people who come from these districts question whether there is a proper price being paid.  Even one of the Minister's own Party, Deputy Corry, stated yesterday that it is not an economic price, so that the farmers get no benefit even in the districts where beet is grown.  Certainly the farmers outside the beet growing districts, which are confined to very shall areas, derive no benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The next item is No.7&mdash;increase over 1931-32 in the provision in the Vote for Agriculture, £189,342.  What particular benefit has been conferred on the farmer by that?  That is probably spent in the payment of inspectors for harassing and tormenting farmers, Every activity of the farmer, and everybody else, is being restricted by regulation and by order.  The farmers do not regard it as any benefit to their industry to have it controlled and directed from Government Buildings. They prefer to be let live and to carry on their industry in their own way. They do not regard that provision as affording any benefit to the average farmer.</P>
    <P>The next item relates to the provision for turf development, £123,952. What benefit is that to the farmers? None whatever.  If there is any benefit accruing to the country as a whole from that provision, it certainly can not be referred to the farmers.  Then there is another mall item, an increase <Col N="1316" /> of £83,515 in the Vote for afforestation. That brings no benefit to the farmer unless afforestation is carried out in the form of schemes taht would suit farmers, namely, shelter belts.  That has not been done.  I referred to that on the Vote for afforestation, and I expressed a desire that schemes of that kind should be carried out so that farmers might derive some benefit, if not immediately, certainly in the future. There is, therefore, only £2,227,000 of a benefit passed on to he farmer, according to the Minister, but I am not accepting that part of the statement.</P>
    <P>As against that, what are the offsets?  Taxation has been increased by £4,5000,000 for the last six years, since that time that Fianna Fáil promised that they would derate agricultural lane.  It is admitted by statisticians that the farmers pay 59 per cent. of all taxation.  If we roughly estimate their shar of this £4,500,000 they certainly pay more than this £2,227,000 of which they are supposed to get the benefit, so that, going no further, things are just as they were.  But there are a number of other items which must be taken into consideration.  How much has that cost of production increased? Take one item alone, the recent increase in wages given to agricultural labourers.  I want to say with regard to agricultural wages, that that increase was long overdue.  Agricultural labourers are the worst paid workers in this State, and 27/- per week is scarcely a living wage, having regard to the increase in the cost of living.  I do not suppose that they are any better off now than when they were paid 24/- per week with a lower cost of living.  I doubt if they are as well off. I believe that are not.  I do not question that they are entitled to that wage, but at the same time the increase granted to them counts up in the cost of production.</P>
    <P>The cost of production has been increased, for every man engaged by a farmer, at the rate of 3/- per week, that is, £7 16s. per year.  The number of agricultural labouters in this country according to the 1926 census was 125,161.  We are tole that the number <Col N="1317" /> has increased since Fianna Fáil came into office, but for the purpose of simplifying the calculation, we will take the figure provided by the 1926 census. Assuming the number to be 125,161, and multipling that by £7 16s., we get £976,255 as the increase in the cost of production, arising out of the payment of labour alone and as a result of the increase in wages that has recently been put into operation.  That is as far as the agricultural labourer alone is concerned.  There are 550,172 agricultural workers altogether in the State.  If the cost of living has been so increased for the agricultural labourer, as nobody doubts it has, the cost of living has been increased to the same extent for the working farmer and the members of his family so that everyone of these 550,172 workers employed on the land are entilted to the same increased allowance to meet the increased cost of living.  I think the Minister, or anybody in this country, will not deny that the working farmer, and the members of his family who are working on the land, are at least entitled to the same standard of living as the agricultural labourer who is the lowest paid labourer in the land.  I think it is not too much to claim that the farmers and their families are entiled to the same allowance as the agricultural labourers. That would make the allowance for all these workers, arising out of the increased cost of living, £4,291,341. Therefor, instead of the farmers being in as good a position as they were in 1931, they are over £4,250,000 worse.  If they were entitled to derating in 1931-32 as the Fianna Fáil Party said they were, they are £ 4,250,000 worse now.  That is proven by figures that can hardly be questioned, and yet that is not the end of it.</P>
    <P>The price of feeding stuffs has been increased and the cost of these feeding stuffs adds still further to the cost of production.  The cost of machinery has also been increased.  The price of implements and everything connected with production has been increased.  The position of the farmers, therefore, if there never had been an economic war, is much worse now than it was in 1931-32.  As other Deputies have pointed out, the economic war <Col N="1318" /> has robbed the people of their savings. It has left the average farmer who had not sufficient savings to carry him through the depression, swamped in banks or with shopkeepers, unable to pay his debts.  It has left him with reduced stocks.  With all those disadvabtages, we are now starting off with an additional disadvantage of £4,250,000 as compared with 1931-32. How, then, can the Minister hope to claim that the agricultural community are in a position to get any advantage out of the settlement?  Everyone in the State should give careful consideration to that question.  After all, the farming community are the backbone of the State, and unless they are in the position to live independently and to pay theur debts where is taxation to come from?  Who is to pay salaries and to buy the products of factories?  Agriculture is our basic industry, and those who claim that it is entitled to a fair deal are speaking in the best interests of the country. Everybody, whether he belongs to the cities or the rural parts, deplores the exodus of the people from the land.  They are fleeing from it into the cities and the towns because they do not want to stay on the lane.  Has not the policy of the present Government been responsible for the exodus?  After a few years, if the people continue to leave the land, how are they to be replaced?  Even if people later returned for the cities and towns would they be of any use on the land? If they once leave the land it is very difficult to get them to return to it.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our main industry, and the only one that could stand by itself if it got a chance.  It has not got a chance, because burdens have been placed on it for the past few years, as high in some cases as 50 per cent., in order to encourage new industries. The agricultural people are most anxious to help these new insutries to the best of their ability, but there is a limt beyond which they cannot go.  If they are expected to contribute towards the building up of these new industries their own industry is also entitled to some consideration, because we cannot continue taking form that industry without <Col N="1319" /> putting something back into it.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider the claims of agriculture and to look at both sides of this question.  The Minister can make up a very plausible story and juggle with figures in such a way as to give the impression that millions of money have been given to agriculture.  He should look at the other side of the account.  The figures then will shoe that farmers are now in a very show that farmers are now in a very much worse position than they were before the start of the economic war because of the sacrifices they made and of the debts they incurred.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I think the Minister was not well advised was in increasing the duty on hawkers' licences.  The amount of the duty has been doubled.  I do not think any Minister should double taxation in an off-hand way without inquiry.  O know that there has been a clamour by some merchants who were afraid of competition and who were afraid that these hawkers would take away their trade.  These traders would not stir from behind their counters to improve their trade and that gave the hawkers, as they are called, their chance. Hawkers are not a lazy class of people, and were serving the people in he country districts.  The Minister should consider the position of persons living five or six mils from a town who wanted to sell eggs a couple of times in the week.  In the past the women had to take baskets of eggs to the towns.  In the past they sometimes had an ass and car or a horse and car, but the roads are made in such a way now that these people are in danger of being run down by other traffic.  In addition, the roads are so slippery they ar afraid to being animals on them.  If they cannot dispose of their eggs people in the country will not be able to get the household necessaries that these hawkers supplied when they called. If hawkers are comelled to pay the extra licence duty it is the people in the country will eventually have to pay it by getting less for their eggs and other produce.  In the last resort <Col N="1320" /> it is another tax on the land and another incentive to people to et away from the lane.</P>
    <P>This was a necessary service that sprang up naturally to meet the changed condidtions that have been brought about.  The hawkers are as necessary to the country people to-day as the towns were ten years age.  The country does not exist for the benefit of the towns&mdash;I always understood that the towns existed for the benefit of the country.  If people can do their business with hawkers why should they not continue to do so?  If traders find that hawkers are geetings inside their business let them send out supplies to the country.  If a man can sent out a lorry and serve 40 people, is not that better than having 40 people quitting work and shutting up their houses in order to go into the towns for supplies?  Only that the people found it was a benefit they would not have encouraged the hawkers to come around.  I think the Minister might reconsider the position, or if he cannot fo so this year, he might restore the duty in the next Budget to what it was.  The Minister should mot listen to any story without having both side concerned heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>An economist said that the magic of properly trurned sand into gold, but I think Deputies who are farmers do not ponder sufficently on that wise saying. All our Irish tenant farmers are looking forward to the time when they shall become owners of the farms they hold, and any work they do, or that they are going to do on them, will be for the benefit of themselves and their families who, let us hope, will be eternally in possession of the land.  During the remainder of the period until their annuities have run out, the Irish tenant purchasers will enjoy a direct reduction of half the amount of annuties which they would have had to pay had the state of affairs which existed when we came into office still continued.  The Minster for Finanace pointed out in his Budget speech that parctically the whole of the £2,900,000, which would be collectible as annuities, had there been no econoimc war, and no settlement, was going back to <Col N="1321" /> Irish tenant farmers, and about £2,227,000, according to the figures given are going back to them directly this year in the form of a reduction of the annuties by 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>I think that that is a very substantial relief to agriculture which is not sufficiently stressed, and I, for one, am glad that the Minister for Finance took the opportunity to put these reliefs which had been given to agriculture, Government gave in other directions to that industry, in their proper perspective in his Budget statement.  One would imagine also, if one were to look back on what we have heard in this House for that past five years with regard to the dire effect of the economic war, the uselessness of protecting the home market for our farmers, the extravagance and wrthlessness of any system of boundties or subsiodides for the development of agreiculture, and the increasing of agricultural production, that, in fact, all these various measures counted nothing so long as the economic dispute continued. One would have expected from the critics of the Budget the admission that now that this economic dispute is settled, and,, as far as we can see, they are highly pleased with the settlement, to that extent at any rate, those arguments that they had been using against they Goverment measures which had been adopted and which were found necessary, no longer applied, One would imagine that they would go back to the statement of the former Minister for Agriculture, the late Mr. Hogan, to which Deputy Dillon Briefly referred in his speech.  Unfortunately, Deputy Dillon did not dwell upon the poicy expounded by the late Mr. Hogan in the way that one would expect. He seemed to the rather anxious to get away from that policy which, I think, could be fairly expressed as being to help the farmer to help him self.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon did not dwell upon that.  Deputy dillon <Col N="1322" /> Stareted off by telling us that the immediate neccessity was to reduce the overhead chrges on the agricultural producer.  As I have said, it is rather extraordinary that Deputy Dillon and his collegues have no taken the opportunity, if they still believe in the policy which the late Mr. Hogan preached, to inform their supporters in the country and to drive home to the Irish agriculturist, in particular, that no matter what reliefs he may get from the Government, of no matter what economic settlements he may reap the advantage of, he will still have to do a hard day's work to get a decent days's wage, and to get a decent return; that in that market he will still have to face that competition of practically every nation on the surface of the glove which is engaged in the agricultural industry, and that now is certainly the time for the Irish farmer to look into the question whether he has been availing himself of the opportunities that he has had and that he is now presented with to reap the fullest economic advantage out of them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down informed us that the farmers had suffered greatly during the past few years We all admit that, but one would like to get some figures to show that deposits held by farmers in the Irish banks have, in fact, decreased during the past five or six years to the extent that is supposed It has been stated on very reliable authority that the deposits held by the banks from Irish agricultural depositors have increased in proportion to the amounts held by other section of the community that, in fact, the perecentage of deposits held by Irish agriculturists has increased whicle the precentage held by other sections of the community has decreased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will hear the figures in due course.  Deputy <Col N="1323" /> Dillon says that in order to rap the beast profits out of this market which head charges in has now been made available, and the opening of which to the Irish farmer has made the Deputy almost delirious with joy, the great thing for the Government now to do is to reduce overhead charges.  One of the ways in which industrialists&mdash;and I suppose that in connection with the securing of efficiency in agriculture one ought to advert to the process by which efficiency us secured in industry &mdash;one of the ways in which industry secures an efficent return and a reduction of overhead charges is by increasing its total production. Increasing its total volume of production is the one way, the surest and easiest way, in which ineustrialists generally endeavour to secure a reduction a sug-overhead charges.  But through this whole debate has been running a suggestion not that we would increase our total national production, but that in certain very important respects we should reduce that production.  I would like to know on what grounds it is suggested that very important aspects of our national production should now be departed from, that we should actually close up our beet factories, that we ought even close up some of our industries, that we ought, in fact&mdash;becouse unmistakably the suggestion is at the back of these criticusms&mdash;go back to the policy of the old Farmers' Union, which I thought was dead and buried long since; that we should continue to but the foreign article no matter what that we should continue to buy the foreign article no matter what the circumstances might be under which it was produced or what the effect upon our own economy might be so long s it was the cheapest.  I hope that that policy is dead and buried and that anybody who attempts to resurrect it will receive short shrift in this country.  I think that no matter how much we may be intereasted in the welfare of the small farmer, of the worker, or of the consumer, we ought to realise that we have to secure employment for our people in this country, and that it is only by <Col N="1324" /> encouraging private enterprise, and ecouraging enterprise where necessary, either by direct intervention of the State or by Government subvention, that we shall, n fact, be able to ensure that substantial numbers of our people will find employment here. If we are going back to the policy of the ranch, if we are going to sacrifice our tillage policy and our industiral policy in order that the policy preached by the least patriotic and least worthy section of the Irish community should be carried into effect, then I say it is a misfortune that we ever got freedom in this country or every got control of our own affairs, To return however to Deputy Dillon's Statement with regard to derating, I think that no doubt the question of local finance in general demand examination&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated that certain steps have been taken in that regard. Perhaps it would be premature for the Government at this stage to undertake any substantial change until they satisfy themselves that that is the best way to encourage the agricultural industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I also belive that the policy of total and full derating would no be the best way to help agriculture. We had this question discussed in the House on a great many occasions years ago.  I do not think Deputy Dillon was here at that time.  The Party of which I am a member had a motion down in support or substantial support of drating.  There was an amendment brought in by Deputy O'Connell, the then leader of the Labour Party. Deputy O'Connel made a good case to show that derating, in fact, would no benefit the small farmers, who were the vast majority of the holders of agricultrual land in this country Donegal, about example, in the County Donegal, about three-fourths of the farmers are under a £10 valuation.  At the present time <Col N="1325" /> they are paying rates.  We will say that a man there with a £5 valuation&mdash;&mdash; which would be the valuation of the average 20 acre holding in that country &mdash;would be paying about £3 12s. 5d. That is the amount of the current rate demanded in a demand note I have before me.  Now that man gets £1 5s. 1., or roughly 35 per cent. of rates reduction in respect of agricultural land.  That is the special allowance in respect of the abatement on agricultural lane.  There is, therefore, at the present time an actual reduction so far as the small farmer is concerned &mdash;a direct reduction&mdash;of 35 per cent. He is still paying 65 per cent.  Having regard to the fact that a very large percentage of our farmers are comparatively smallholders, what we have to ask curselves is whether in these conditions and having regard to their circumstance, that best way of assisting them &mdash;if assistance on a substantial scale is necessary&mdash;would be to wipe out their rates completely.  I think it was proved on that occasion that that was not the best way so far as the small farmer is concerned. We have to bear in mind that the money from which derating is to be provided, if derating is to be put into operation, can only be secured by indirect taxation.  We know because we have calculated in the past that in order to relieve the small farmers of £2, £3 or £4 in rates, you would have to put on some taxes which would offset that relief to a considerable extent if not perhaps wipe it out altogether; you would have to impose increased taxation on such commodities as tea, sugar and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>What is the small farmer in Donegal getting out of sugar beet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The small farmer in Donegal at any rate can be held up to the rest of the country as the farmer who per excellence has kept up the standard of tillage in this country.  No other county but Donegal in this portion of Ireland sill has that percentage of lane under tillage which could be compared in any favourable manner with the amount of land under tillage 50 or 60 years ago. I have heard from those <Col N="1326" /> who know the people of Donegal&mdash;and I have discussed the matter with people who know Donegal intimately &mdash;that it is not by one particular scheme but by a number of schemes that the small farmers can be helped fully.  I think anybody acquainted with them will realise that neither by halving the annuities nor by any single scheme like derating can this be accomplished.  These things at any rate would only mean a few pounds per head to these people and that is not going to mean anything very great in their economic circumstances.  So that as far as the small farmer is concerned derating should not be considered as being the most suitable way to assist] him.</P>
      <P>We have to bear in mind that at the present time very substantial aid is being given to farmers under a £20 valuation.  Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that the agricultural grant was somewhat higher in the last year the agricultural grant without talking other circumstance also all the other services that the State has either extended or introduced during the term of office of the present Government? What about the great increase in social services?  Is it claimed that the rural community are not getting a fair share of these social services?  in my opinion they are getting a fair share I venture to say, if the question were now examined as it was examined by the Derating Commission, and if the position of the agriculturists in reference to national revenue were examined, it might in fact be shown that the agriculturist is contributing less proportionately toward the national revenue now than he was at that time. At any rate there was no suggestion then that he was bearing the brunt of the taxation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the £3,000,000 which is going to the tenant purchasers in <Col N="1327" /> one way or another, the Minister for Finance was able to point out in his Budget statement that in getting the sugar beet industry going, the State sacrificed a revenue of £900,000. Naturally the loss of so much revenue must be a serious consideration for the Minister for Finance.  But the Government decided that it was necessary to provided a crop so as to afford facilities for farmers who were prepared to undertake tillage. In order to give them a reasonable price for their beet crop, three other factories were set up.  All I have to say in connection with these new factories is that if there was the same appreciation of the usefulness of the factories to the agricultural community, and the same appreciation of their benefits in other areas, as there is in Carlow and around the Carlow factory, there would be no doubt whatever about the continued success and the continued operation of these factories.  Time after time the farmers in that area have state: &ldquo;We are not going to grow beet at the price fixed,&rdquo; but I have been told by those who are in a position to know Carlow intimately that it has never yet happened when the time came to sow bees that there were not scores, and probably hundreds, of farmers anxious and willing to grow beet in excess of the amount required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am hopeful that in the other areas the same readiness and anxiety to grow beet will prevail when the farmers in those other areas understand the crop better; when they are more familiarised with the conditions, and when they have as good a scientific knowledge of farming as a great many farmers in the Carlow district seem to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, of course, stated, with regard to derating, that his Party were not wedded to derating, and I think that is a very useful and a vary proper statement No fault whatever should be found with Deputies for suggesting means by which agriculture, or any other industry <Col N="1328" /> for that matter, can be made more efficient, can be helped along; but I think what we have a right to object to is a suggestion, which was delivered in a certain pontifical manner, that a certain proposal, which was turned down in the most solemm way by a commission for which a former Government was responsible, should now be sought to be dragged back again into the public view without being closely and seriously examined.  I welcome, therefore, Deputy Cosgarave's statement that his Party are not wedded by any means to the proposal that there should be total derating and I would be greatly surprised if that Party which, like this one, represents the small farmers and not the big ranchers, who are confined to certain counties in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that that Party, representing as we do the Western counties would, any more than this Party, be anxious to see in operation a policy which would, in effect, mean that the small farmer would have to pay, through increased taxation on the necessities of life, for the relief of socalled farmers, some of them with a great number of farms of land which are certainly not giving a fair return to this country either in the amount of food they produce or the employment they give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to a great many matters.  Had the Deputy looked at the Order Paper he would have seen that a great many of the Estimates in which he seems to be interested are on that Paper for early discussion in the Dáil, and I have no great sympathy with Deputy Davin in his haste to cover such a lot of ground, such a great many points which would more properly have come up during the coming weeks on the appropriate Votes.  The Deputy has the knack of taking out certain points which he thinks will be useful to him politically, and he completely forgets, as great many other critics of the Budget forget, that in order that we shall have a fair picture of our <Col N="1329" /> economic and financial conditions as a State, we should being everything into the picture which is relevant.  We should not, for instance, seize on one or two isolated figures or other matters which have come under our observation and endeavour to suggest that because these points appeal to us personally they, in fact, represent the whole of the picture, because they do not.</P>
    <P>One of the most amazing things about Deputy Davin is that he never, so far as I know, has admitted in this House, except when he was able to try to claim some credit for it himself or try to get credit for his Party through it, the very substantial improvement there has been in the conditions under which the workers of this country have been living, not alone during the period this Government has been in office, but since the war period, or since the pre-war period.  I wonder do those people who, like Deputy Davin, never seem to see anything except the problems which, unfortunately, have still to be solved, ever look back and ask themselves what an amount of ground has been covered and what an amount of progress has been achieved?  If the Deputy, and those who think with him, would only look at the conditions of the Irish worker in the pre-war period and in the period immediately after the war and look at the conditions at the present time I think they should be prepared to clap this Government or any other Government which is in office in this country on the back, because I am quite convinced that the conditions, taking all the circumstances into account in this country, so far as labour conditions hold, compare very favourably with the conditions existing in the powerful and wealthy State across the water.  I am quite satisfied that the conditions of labour here are better than they are in a great many countries in Europe and possibly elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we have Deputy Davin coming along telling us that <Col N="1330" /> there were 18,000,000 loaves of bread less eaten in this country last year or the year before than five or six years ago.  If the Deputy had known anything about the principles which go to the consideration of the question whether the standard of living in a country the standard of living in a country is a fair one or not, he would know that as the standard of living goes up in a country the consumption of bread goes down.  If he were examining the standard of living in the United States, Great Britain or any other country, would he measure it by the amount of bread consumed? He certainly would not.  He would measure it by the amount of eggs, butter and meat consumes, by the number of motor cars, by the amount of money collected in taxation.</P>
      <P>In this country, as was pointed out not so long ago, when this ramp which had been carried on here for the preceding 12 months was brought up in the form of a motion, and when it was sought to be proved that the cost of living had gone sky wards, it was shown conclusively that in respect of beer, spirits and tobacco there had been a steady increase in the yield of taxation. There could not have been an increase in the yield from these commodities if the people had not more in their pockets to buy these commodities.  When newspapers talk of the enormous increase which admittedly there has been in the figures in modern Budgets, they conveniently forget, like Deputy Davin, to put on the other side of the picture the enormous, the staggering increase in the standard of living which has taken place in this as in great many other countries.  They forget that completely. If they look back for a generation and examine the conditions a generation ago in this or any other country, they will find ample corroboration of that. We have corroboration of it in these figures dealing with the revenue returns, in the figures dealing with the number of motor car registrations, in the figures dealing with the Post Office Savings Bank and the Saving Certificates returns.</P>
      <P>All of those things go to show there is a good deal of money in circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> Everybody may not have benefited, but the figures certainly go the show that in the community as a whole there has been a steady and a satisfactory improvement, a raising of the standard of living, and that is proved conclusively, as I have said, by the fact that on our taxable commodities more revenue is being collected and more of these commodities are being consumed; the people have more money and there are more of them buying these commodities.  That fact should be kept in mind when the figures dealing with taxation are being stressed.</P>
    <P>What also should be borne in mind and pointed out by the wise gentlemen in the newspapers is that this money which is being collected in taxation is going back in services to the people, and that services have contributed more than any other thing to raise the standard of living in this as in other countries.  That is a fact which, of course, is completely left out of consideration by Deputy Davin and others like him, who will give no credit for what has been done and will omit entirely&mdash;I suppose it has not occurred to them&mdash;to dwell on the fact that enormous progress has been made.  What we should say to ourselves is that at any rate we are progressing. If everything is not in as satisfactory a condition as we would wish, at any rate, as honest men and men who profess to have a knowledge of what we are speaking of, we should bring into the picture these very important factors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin also, having already referred, on the last occasion he was here, to the fact that he anticipated certain things from the Budget, has come forward on this occasion and told us that the cost of living must not be increased; that bacon, bread, and butter must be sold here at the same price as in Great Britain.  On the other hand, Sir, the Deputy asked me a question as to whether I still believe that a guaranteed price should be paid for beet.  With regard to beet, bacon, butter, or any other agricultural product, if, by reserving the home market <Col N="1332" /> for the Irish producer, we can guarantee to the producer a reasonable and a fair price without imposing an altogether undue, burden on the community, I certainly am strongly in favour of that policy.  I cannot understand, however, the attitude of one like Deputy Davin, who takes the farmers so much to heart that he even seemed to cast a languishing smile towards Deputy Gorey yesterday evening when he suggested that he was sorry that the farmers of this country had not placed their destinies in his (Deputy Davin's) hands.  Deputy Davin takes a very keen interest, according to himself, in agricultural conditions.  Of course, he represents an agricultural constituency, but unfortunately the same speech, or the same set of arguments, which will appeal to the workers in Portlaoighise will not appeal to the small farmers in Arles, because if you tell the people in Portlaoighise that they are paying too much for their butter and bacon, and then tell the farmers in Arles, or some place down here where they are working in bog areas and on badland, that they will have to sell their produce here at the price that holds in the British market, no matter how low that price is, you cannot expect them to be pleased, nor can you expect the ordinary observe to think that there is much sincerity or much principal behind them when you gave those two opposing arguments coming from the same source.  If the Deputy is consistent in his anxiety to help the farmers, and if he believes in the policy of protecting the home market -if he his interested in the question of guaranteed prices&mdash;then, in all conscience he cannot come along and demand that the farmers should sell their produce here at low prices&mdash;particularly, as was pointed out to him by Deputy Allen, if they are actually below the cost of production&mdash;just because, according to Deputy Davin, the international price on the English market should rule here.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also should realise, I think that it is only fair to point out to the agricultural community&mdash;apart from the question of the economic war <Col N="1333" /> altogether&mdash;the advantages which the dispute brought to the community for which he speaks.  One of the advantages being that during the period when, according to Deputy Cosgrave &mdash;and Deputy Davin has respected his argument&mdash;there was a considerable reduction in the home consumption of bacon in this country&mdash;another argument that the standard of living in the country had seriously deteriorated and that we were in a very serious position&mdash;there were compensating factors.  Neither Deputy Cosgrave nor Deputy Davin, who talked a good deal when the scheme was being introduced, and who could not so easily have forgotten it, thought fit to mention the compensating factor of the free beef and free meat schemes under which scores of million of pounds of free ment and fee beef were given to thousands and thousands of poor people in this country who never had meat before.</P>

      <P>They forgot to take a note of that, and I think they should note that, so far as the demand for Irish beef in this country is concerned, it has been improved as a result.  Deputy Davin also forgot to point out when he was dealing with the question of food prices that between the years 1929 and 1934 there was a very serious fall indeed in agricultural prices here as elsewhere. Agricultural prices all over the would reached rock-bottom during those years.  Deputy Davin conveniently forgets to point out to his followers, if they are his followers, that during those years thy reaped the advantages of cheap food.  That got food at a price at which it was never got before.  Then, when in the succeeding years, 1936 and 1937 there began to be an increase in food prices, we had a general ramp to the effect that the Government was in some way responsible, and that whenever there was an increase in the prices of bacon, butter, or, in fact, any commodity, whether for the purpose of eating or otherwise, the Government was responsible <Col N="1334" /> for that increase.  Deputy Davin forgets that.  He forgets also that about £6,000,000 of extra expenditure have gone each year into social and allied services; and when he tells us here and when the weeps tears for the numbers of unemployed here, or for the migration to Great Britain surely he ought to consider the fact that £6,000,000 a years of additional expenditure on social and similar services is an extraordinary amount for a Government in this country and shows extraordinary generosity, and, if I may say so, certainly proves that we are in advance of the times in our concern to see that the poorer sections of the community are looked after.</P>
      <P>There has also been improvement in labour conditions and so on, and these improvements have mounted up to very substantial sums of money.  These sums of money, paid either in increased wages or through improved working conditions, although they go into circulation here and benefit certain classes of the community&mdash;the working classed and so on&mdash;at the same time have to be provided by somebody. These sums of money have to be provided by the consumer of by the taxpayer in the long run.  It would be well that Deputy Davin and his colleagues should remember that, if we are trying to secure better conditions for labour, if we are trying to secure higher wages and so on the provision or the wherewithal for these improved conditions and higher wages has to be got from the community; in other words, presumably, it has to be got from the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Sir, it is relevant. If the Minister is talking about higher wages having to be got from the community, is he suggesting that the State itself is paying the higher wages <Col N="1335" /> to somebody, or is he suggesting that the State has to find the money for the higher wages paid by private employers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the community has to pay in the long run, in some way, for all the increases in wages, or for anything which goes to increase the price of commodities.  For example, in the case of house-building, there has been an increase in the price of materials and in labour costs, and the consumer of houses is, in this country in order to produce bread we have a system which apparently produces less units of bread per man than across the water and at a much higher price per unit which the community has to pay, people are put in a position to say that the Government is responsible there again.  It has been suggested over and over again that the Government is responsible, either through the wheat scheme or through not having proper control of the flour mills, because the people have to pay more for bread, but what is entirely for-= gotten is the question of labour costs and the method of producing bread, which was only brought under public notice, after the Government had been denounced for a long time in all the moods and tenses, when the statement of comparative labour costs was made up by those responsible for the industry. It was only then it was made quite clear that there was a very heavy burden indeed placed upon the consumer.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin made the pint that the money saved by the settlement should be made available for those who suffered.  I have shown, and the Minister for Finance has already shown, that the tenant purchasers have reaped, and will continue to reap, as large share of the advantage, and I think the Deputy is not unaware of the fact, no matter how plausible or simple he may seem, that many million pounds have gone into circulation here during the course of the economic war for the improvement of social services.  The people who he says suffered most, certainly reaped advantages from those services.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the question of defence.  An agreement was accepted by this house under which we have taken over, unconditionally, as was explained by the Taoiseach, certain ports.  It was stated also by the Taoiseach, in the clearest manner possible, that the Government proposes to undertake certain responsibilities in connection with we were facing these new responsibilities, and that we intended at an early and opportune moment to place our policy with regard to defence before the House and the country and would ask the House and the country to accept that policy wholeheartedly.  I have only to say on this occasion that, as the Minister for Finance has already pointed out, we intend to provide for our own defence out of our own resources, If that fundamental consideration is kept in mind, if that is regarded as the principle on which we are going to work, it will save a great deal of misunderstanding.  Whatever others may have in view with regard to defence, that is the principle on which we are working: that we are going to undertake responsibility ourselves for the defence of our country, and that we are going to provided, ion so far as we can, for that defence effectively from our own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the amounts of money which is being provided in connection with defence. I have no wish to anticipate in any way <Col N="1337" /> the discussion, and I am sure there will be more than one discussion, in the House in the near future with regard to this very important mater; but I think I may say that the £6,000,000 need not necessarily or will not necessarily be all spent on the ports.  Votes for the provision of that sum of money will come before the House in due course, and, presumably the House will discuss the question fully.  As has frequently been pointed out by the Minister for Finance, in the course of speeches made in the house by deputy Davin and other Deputies, the Minster for Defence is the appropriate Minister under whose Vote this whole question can be properly discussed. If we were to start a discussion of defence on the Budget statement there is no reason why we should not start discussion on the question of education or on any other question.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised that those who vote gladly for the Agreement, having heard the Taoiseach's statement at the beginning and the end of that debate in which regard to defence, now seem to suggest either that something is being withheld or that the Government has no taken the House and the country fully into its confidence.  As was explained by the Taoiseach, and as I now repeat, the whole defence policy or the Government will be put before the House in due course.  At any rate, it is obvious that the elimination of Articles 6 and 7 which held such dangerous potentialities for us in the event of the international situation becoming serious&mdash;in the event of any danger of war&mdash;is a matter of the greatest moment to this country, a matter I think upon which, no matter what our views may be, we can all rejoice&mdash;that these Articles have been swept away.  I think we can all recognise that the final abrogation of these Articles creates an entirely new position. We are now quit free.  We always were, I suppose, so far as the Dáil is concerned.  It was always made clear under the old Constitution as well as under the new Constitution, that the Dáil&mdash;the Parliament of the People&mdash;was, of course, the final body <Col N="1338" /> to determine what our attitude should be in connection with war.  In the same way the Dáil the People's legislature, is the supreme body to deal with all questions of national defence. These never has been, and never can be, any question but that that is the case.</P>
    <P>I do hope that when the question comes up the atmosphere will be somewhat different from what it has been whenever defence has been dragged into this debate.  It is, undoubtedly, a most serious matter, one to which we would all be well advised to address ourselves in a very serious fashion, a matter to which we should give the utmost consideration. I hope, then, that when it is discussed by us as Irishmen whose only anxiety is to do that best we can for our country, to take such steps as will ensure that we shall be united, and shall be in a position to defend ourselves if the necessity for so doing arises.  I hope that the good spirit which has existed for some time past in the House and the promises of co-operation which the Government has received in connection with the implementation of the new Agreement. will be followed in connection with the question of national defence, that it will be discussed as a national question of the greatest importance to each one of us and of the greatest importance to the future of our country, a question upon which it is the duty of each one of us to see that a right decision is come to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>We regret that is not before the House.  As this is the first time.  I have spoken since he recent Agreement was made, I desire to congratulate the Government upon it.  As a Deputy from one of the Border counties, I feel, with the people there, that we have got a certain amount of relief.  Generally speaking, I think that the Agreement is an indication that the Government have come to realise that small nations cannot exist if themselves.  The Government have evidently learned that from what has happened in other parts of the world during the past couple of years.  As regards the Budget, I do not think that the farmers have any reason to congratulate the Minister.  The only people I know who have any right to congratulate the Minister are the directors of a lot of these new factories who are making a fine thing by way of salary and making a fine thing by way of salary and income out of these undertakings.  As a rule, the farmer has no interest in income-tax. His anxiety is to make ends meet.  He has never any money with which to pay income-tax.  I do not think that the Department of Finance would waste an envelope in sending a demand for income-tax to the ordinary farmer.  They would get nothing out of it.  As the Government have been assisting almost every industry established in the country during the last few years, it is time they tried to do something for the farming community. The only feasible way of doing that is by way of derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall probably be told that now that the tariffs are off the cattle and we are able to send our cattle free into Great Britain, it should be quite sufficient for us.  I so not think that the <Col N="1340" /> Minister can argue that because we have heard form Ministers and from Deputies on the Government Benches repeatedly during the last four or five years that we have been at no disadvantage regarding the price we have been receiving for our cattle&mdash;that the price we were receiving here was quite as good as was being received in Northern Ireland.  If that was true four or five years ago, it is equally true to-day and we are not going to get sufficient to make up for what we lost during the past few years.  There is no doubt about the poverty existing at present amongst the farming community. The Minister for Education has told us that farmers' deposits in the banks and post offices have increased during the last few years.  If the Minister was certain of that, he should have produced figures to substantiate his statement.  He did not give us any figures.  Instead, he asked us to produce fugures.  He knows it is utterly impossible for any Deputy it is go to a bank and ask what deposit they have belonging to farmers.  The Government can easily find out what deposits there are belonging farmers and what deposits have been withdrawn during the last four or five years.  I can say that, but for the deposits in the banks and post offices, the farmers could not have existed form 1933 to the present time.  They had to withdraw any money they had in the banks.  As proof of that, I ask the Minister to consider making a request to a farmere to go a bank and ask for a loan of £50 or even of a loan of a £ note.  He would be refused.  If there were deposits belonging to the farmers in the banks and if farming were in a prosperous condition, there is no doubt that the banks would be very glad to advance money to the farmers. At present, no farmer would get advance of even a £10 note without collateral security.</P>
    <P>Some of the back benchers want to know where the money for derating is to come from.  But for the recent Agreement, we would have had to pay £104,000,000 to the British Government. We have got out of that for £10,000,000.  We are, therefore, better off to the extent of £94,000,000. <Col N="1341" /> Surely that benefit should go to the farmers in some form.  Of course, the Government could get money in other ways.  They could use some economy which they are no using at the present time.  There is quite a lot of money&mdash;not thousands but millions&mdash; being squandered in various ways. One of these ways has to do with the Pigs Marketing Board.  Probably, the Ceann Comhairle will rule me out of order again and say that this is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture. It is, however, an item that could be saved and it is a thing that should never have been introduced into this country because the farmers do not want it and never wanted it.</P>

      <P>The Minister must acknowledge that the farmers of the Twenty-six Counties, and particularly those of Caven, Monaghan, and Donegal, have to compete with the farmers of Northern Ireland.  They cannot do so unless they get some rating concession.  The farmers of Northern Ireland are derated.  They also get a subsidy on their cattle. Every fat animal sold in Northern Ireland carries a subsidy of 7/6 or 5/- per cwt. We are not getting that concession.  Until we get something to equal it, we are not in a position to compete with the farmers of Northern Ireland have also agreed to do what the Government here are not willing cession to the farmers to try to get their lands cleaned up, to get bushes cut, drains cleared and work of that kind which used years ago to be carried out in winter time, done. Owing to the loss of interest in their land because of the uncertainly of <Col N="1342" /> their position, farmers ceased to do that work.  The Government of Northern Ireland are contributing, I think, 80 per cent.  &mdash;I am not sure of the exact figure&mdash;of the wages paid in respect of extra work, such as I have referred to, on the reclamation of land.  If the Minister wants to use up some of his unemployed men in the country, instead of bringing them up to the factories here and trying to create employment for them at the expense of the farmers&mdash;it is the farmers who have to pay eventually&mdash; why should he not give the farmers a certain amount towards the employment of these men?  Would it not be the easiest way of getting rid of them, of assisting the country and increasing its tillage?</P>

In this respect they are more to be pitied than blamed, as the case put up by them will not bear the test of public opinion. They are relying on the agricultural community as the only straw which they can hope to grasp and save themselves from drowning in the sea of politics.  The principal baits used to capture the farmers' votes are derating, the retention by the farmers of their land annuities, and cheap loans for farmers.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies opposite put up the suggestion that in order to finance derating, the beet industry finance derating, the beet industry should be scrapped.  If that suggestion were put into practice, it would mean depriving 30,000 farmers of the advantages they derive form the growing of beet.  It would mean putting out of employment the permanent staffs empolyed in the four sugar factories, as well as those employed in these factories during the campaign periods.  It would mean mpre unemployment also for the transport whrkers&mdash;those engaged in the transport of the beet to the factories and of sugar from the factories&mdash;and would also mean a huge financial loss to those who have their money invested in the sugar companies, as well as those who have their moneys invested in the various transport undertakings in the country.  I think it would be disastrous for the country generally if the beet industru were scrapped.  We remember a time during the last war when beet growing and the sugar industry were unknown in this country and when we were dependent on foreign lands for our sugar supplies. Sugar was scarce and the price was exorbitant&mdash;far higher than the price to-day.  We have no guarantee that a similar situation may not ariose again and unfortunately, there is every indication that in the furture there may be another world upheaval.  I do not think the people, muck less the Government of this country, are foolish enough to scrap an industry that safeguards one of it important food supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If derating comes by way of taxation, I am anxious to know how that will affect the small and the medium-sized farmers.  I am but human, and if sonebody paid my rates and my annuities for me to-morrow morning, I should much appreciate to gift, bur if that somebody, after paying these things for me, were to take an amount of money 50 per cent. greater than what <Col N="1344" /> he has paid in order to finance the scheme, I should feel that I would much prefer to keep paying as I had been.  To my mind, derating would only tend to make the rich richer and keep the grazier still a grazier, at the expense of other members of the community, including those farmers I speak of, and including even the farm labourer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion of cheap loans for farmers, I want to point out that it is not fair to the farming community to say that a large percentage of them are badly off. Despite the economic struggle against Britain, the vast majority of our farmers came out of that struggle with their heads well above water. There are, of course, certain farmers, and there always were, who were not and are not now in a good position financially, but if you examine these people you will find that 50 per cent. of them are unable to meet their commitments to-day for the simple reason that they got a loan or went surety for somebody for a loan in the past. He who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing, and I think you could not do a worse turn to the ordinary farmer than to encourage him to take loans.</P>

I think that is a very narrow view.  After all, there is a subsidy on butter and on eggs in order to make them an economic proposition for our farmers at the present day, despite the fact that we now have free access to the English market.  I think  it is rather short-sighted that one set of farmers should think it unfair to subsidise another set while they are being subsidised themselves.  I should also like to point out to those Deputy that sugar beet pulp, which is a cheap and valuable food, is available for the feeding of live stock in those districts, and would be a far better bragain than the imported Indian meal.</P>

    <P>Several Deputies objected to the exopenditure of £6,00,000 on defence <Col N="1346" /> Deputy Davin waxed eloquent on the matter last evening.  As a matter of fact I think Deputy Davin is the most generous Deputy who has spoken so far in the House, because according to him we should get higher prices for our farm products, higher wages for our farm products, higher wages for everyone engeaged in industry, and a lower cost of living.  Well I hope he can perform the miracle.  In objecting to this £6,000,000 for defence he insinuated that there must be a secret agreement, despite the fact that the Taoiseach has pledged his word to the House and the country to the contaray. It is a peculiar fact that the Deputies who are not in agreement with this expenditure of £6,000,000 on defence never took an active part in bringing this country to the position it occupies to-day; they never took and active part in the military sense.  I hold that as far as the people of this country are concerned they are anxions that any advance we have made and any advantage we have gained in this country should be strengthened, and that what is our own we should hold against all comers. It is well to remember that it took us over 700 years of suffering and sacrifice to achieve the position we have now arrived at.</P>

      <P>It is as a result of that suffering and sacrifice that we are now in the happy position that every god of the Twenty-six Counties belongs to the people of Ireland, and to the people of Ireland alone, without any outside ingterference.  As men were found willing to make these sacrifies down the centuries, and particularly within the past 20 years, to accomplish this fact, so the manhood of our country is still willing to defend the right of the Irish people. and the tax-payers of the country are still willing to defray the cost.  That is as it should be.  Looking back on our history, we find one very sad period. If we go back to the days of what was called the Grattan Parliament, the last Irish Parliament before Dáil Eireann was establised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of the Minister for Eduction was rather remarkable. There were a few statemants made by him to show how prosperous this country has been for the past five or six years under the Fianna Fáil Government.  He tried to prove to this House that the standard of living had not gone yup in the last five or six years.  In order to prove that he instanced the case of the number of motor cars that had been purchased in this country.  He did not tell us bout the number of motor cars that had been purchased on the instalment system under the Fianna Fáil Government or the number that possibly would never be paid for.  He also instanced the number of picture housed erected in Dublin and the attendance at these picture housed during the last five or six years.  Fancy the Minister for Education derawing his conclusions as to the prosperity of the country from the fact that there were so many thousand motor cars unpaid for and so many new picture houses in Dublin! I should like to ask the Minister has he ever gone outside the City of Dublin since he assumed office except to open some school or some new housing scheme. The Minister also told us that the Government had some to the relief of the unemployed by the provision of unemployment assistance and even went so <Col N="1348" /> far as to mention the giving of free beef to the people.  Who paid for that? Was it not the people of the country? They were giving free beef because the Government deprived the people of employment.  You would imagine that no one was paying for that.</P>
      <P>We were told about the social services that were provided. One would imagine that the money for the upkeep of those social services came from some other country.  The Minister did not tell us about the increased ates necessary for the upkeep of these services.  He did not tell is that the rates had gone up by at least one-thrid within the last five or six years.  What value are we getting for that?  As against that, Deputy Corry told us last night that there should be some relief afforded in regard to rates.  He said that a man paying £10 in rates a few years ago was now paying £20.  The Minister for Education practically told us that that is not a fact, that the conditions in the country are much better to-day than five or six years ago.  He also said that we are a free country now&mdash;&mdash; Deputy Meaney tried to follow him in that&mdash;and added that we were always a free country.  If we were a free country five or sic years ago what was the need for the economic war?  What was the need for making paupers practically of every section of the community?  Not alone the farmers, but the business people, the labourers and the tradesmen have been brought to that position, bur particularly the farming community.  If we were a free country five or sic years ago why was it necessary to put the country to the loss of £25,000,000 inside the last six years?</P>

Even so far back as ten years ago we heard from the Taoiseach that there was only one country we should be afraid of&mdash;that he did not believe Germany or any other country would ever attack us.

After telling the people that you were going to win the fight and that then you would give relief to the people, and to the farmers particularly, what does the Budget tell them?  That they will have to suffer on.  Apparently the war is not over.  That is the policy which Fianna Fáil wants the country to swallow.  From my experience of the country during the last five or six years, I believe that that policy is not going to be swallowed by the people in future.</P>

The Minister for Education complimented the people on the organisation of the Carlow factory, but said that he was not satisfied with the working of the other three factories. The fact is that the Caarlow factory was organised long before this Government came into power.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that the best paying industry at present was beet. Fianna Fáil members, including Deputy Corry, are practically telling the farmers that they should not grow beet at 37/6 per ton.</P>

      <P>An one who welcomed the recent Agreement and who understands its implications in a variety of ways, I did not expect as a cordollary to that Agreement any relief in any conceivable way to the tax-payers. Therefore, I will confine may remarks to one or two aspects of the Budget. I followed very closely the statement made by Deputy Meaney.  I followed him up to the time when he went off the deep end and conjured up all these figures in ancient history.  I was rather wondering if he was going to go back to the mythological figures which have impressed so many of our youthful people in the recent past. However, I do not want to follow Deputy Meaney into the past.  I am sure we all appreciated that colourful peroration of his, and I am rather sorry that we do not hear more of that kind of stuff occasionally, because it helps, in some respect ay any rate, to colour the atmosphere of this <Col N="1351" /> rather drab Dáil.  Earlier in the debate Deputy Davin, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, asked a couple o very pertinent questions.  I do not want to repeat those questions. I feel, however, that I can subscribe to much of what he said in the course of his speech but I certainly could not follow him in some of his attacks an the Ministers.  For once ion a way, the Minister for Fianace had my sympathy. I believe in fair play, even for a Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not subscribe to Deputy Davin's statement that he and the Labour Party represented the majority of persons in this State who suffered more severely than any other section of the community.  I do feel the working class of this country undoubtedly did bear a very great share of the suffering&mdash;I suggest a share equally as great as that of the working farmer of this country. I feel that the working classes undoubtedly have suffered as much as, if not more, in fact, than many of the working farmers of the country.  In that I am at one with Deputy Davin, but I am not at one with him when he says that he and his Party represent the majority of the people of this country.  The Deputies who represent the majority of the people of this country, whether you like it or not, or whether you believe it or not, are the Deputies who occupy the Government Benches.  The second largest Party, of course, is the Fine Gael Party and the third largest Party is the Labour Party.  It can never be said, therefore, that Deputy Davin's Party of 13 represents the majority of the people of this country .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin asked one very pertinent question, one to which the Irish people, as a whole, deman a clear and lucid answer, with regard to the £600,000 expenditure necessitated by the handing over of the forts.  That and the question of Partition have caused a good deal of discussion, not alone here, but outside the House.  I hold certain views in regard to that <Col N="1352" /> item in the Budget statement of the Minister and also in relation to the question of Partition, which possibly are not commonly felt.  If they are felt by people inside and outside this House these persons do not make themselves vocal.  I firmly believe that there is a tremendous lack of moral courage in the country.  It is a challenging thing to say, I know, but there is, I feel, in this country a whole lot of make-believe.  People say on public platforms things that they do not mean.  I believe that kind of conduct is reponsible for many persons being elected to this House.</P>
    <P>On the question of the expenditure of £6,00,000 on the forts, the Minister for Education, speaking a short time ago, indicated that all that £600,000 would not be spent on the forts.  I do know that on the Estimate for Defence all these matters pertaining to the Vote may be, and undoubtedly will be, gone into, but when the Minister made that statement that not all the £600,000 would be spent on the forts, I was wondering if the Minister for Education had given any thought or study at all to the question of defence.  He must know, and I as a layman do know, that £600,000 spent on the equipment of modern forts which, of course, connotes in addition, big guns and a certain number of aircraft&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In fact, you would not be tolerated in any House of Parliament that I know of and I have had many contacts, contacts sometimes soiled by people like you.  On this question of forts, I have just indicated that the Minister for Education cannot have given the necessary thought to that question, otherwise he would not <Col N="1353" /> have said, as he did say, that not all of the £6,00,000 would be spent on the forts.  It must be known certainly to the minister for Defence, as I am sure it is known to the Minister for Finance, that £6,00,000 is only an infinitesimal part of the amount that would be required properly to equip defences of this country.  I subscribe to what my friend Deputy Meaney said a while ago, and what I think the Taoiseach has also said on another occasion, that we should be responsible for our own defence.  Again, I want to point out that if we equip these forts and make sure that our defences will be as nearly foolproof as human agencies can make them, it will mean a tremendous amount of expense on the tax-paying community.  I think that should be borne in mind when dealing with this matter of £6,00,000 in relation to those forts.</P>
      <P>I have felt in that conection&mdash;it may be appropriate to say so now&mdash;that a more businesslike method would be to lay off some of that responsibility.  I think there are many person, some members of the Fianna Fáil party, who are directors of insurance companies and they must know that they lay off a lot of their liabilities from time to time, just as stockborkers and bookmakers do, with firms in England.  They often consider it a wise thing to do so long as they know that the firms to which they pass over this responsiblity are firms of standing.  In that connection, I cannot see why we should not make the fullest possible use out of this Agreement and exploit it to the fullest. After all, why should the British not help in this direction?  Let them accept at least the greater part of the responsibility of manning and equipping these forts.  That may no seems a patriotic thing to say.  I agree that sentiment may enter leargely into this question of the forts.</P>

The Minister for Finance may suggest that the manning <Col N="1354" /> of these forts will absorb a lot of young men into the defence forces, possibly a couple of thousand, and that that, in turn, may relieve unemployment to that extent but it will be relieved to that extent only.  No deep impression will be made in that way on the large volume of employment in the country.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the question of floting the loan of £10,000,000 was touched on by some speakers, Althought I was not present then, I understand that that flotation will cost something like £425,000.  I believe that Minister for Finaces is doing his best under rather difficult circumstances, and I feel, in view of the suggestions made by the Taoiseach and others that nothing should be done that would in any way damage the credit of the country.  I fell that the credit of this country stands very high.  We all wish success to the loan.  I believe there will be a good deal of team work towards the floating of the loan, and that the Minister will get support from all sides of the House.  Even where he dose not get support people will not make themselves vocal against it.  That is an assurance that should be an encouragement to the Minister, and I am sure he appreciates it.  I was wondering if the Minister had in mind the exploring of an avenue which I suggested in a question a few weeks ago, to try some other method of raising the money.  The cost of the flotation, something like £425,000, seems like a lot of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>My calculation was a rough one.  When the Minister for Education spoke he appeared to think that the improvement in the standard of living of the working people was due to the beneficence of this Government or the one that preceded it.  I do not suggest that he said so in so many words, but that was the impression gathered on this side of the House.  This Government and the one that preceded it had nothing at all to do with improving the position of the workers in relation to their standard of living.  That was brought about by the Great War.  There is no use in either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael telling any intelligent person that it was they brought about the improvement in the standard of living of the working&mdash;class people.  However, I want to say, as the Government has been charged with doing nothing for the working classes, that at least two things stand to their credit.  The only regret I have is that these things were done through political action instead of industrial action.  the Government passed two measures, the Conditions of Employment Act and the Shops Act.  I want to give credit where credit is due, and this Government has to be thanked for these two Acts.  It is regrettable,however, that the Budget dose not give us any indication, either by way of relief of taxation or in other ways, that Budgets generally give.  We have no indication whatever that relief will be given, whether by taxation or otherwise, to certain of our people who are unemployed.  Emigration continues on a vary large scal.  I am afraid it will continue on a still larger scale, because quite recently the Taoiseach tole us quite plainly that we cannot expect any immediate relief as a result of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undobutedly, immediate relief has been given to a number of people in the cattle trade who were enabled yesterday to get their stock off to the English markets.  I do not think that <Col N="1356" /> even these people have made any great profits out of the transaction, because it must be remembered that most of their stock was held up for 13 or 14 weeks.  With hay costing £5 a ton, I do not think feeders could have made a lot of profit.  It would not surprise me to hear that farmers and dealers had lost hundreds of thousand of pounds over this transaction. One thing that has emerged from the Budget is this, that we have no extra taxation worth talking about, while there are hopes of womething to come.  I should like if the Minister, when replying, could throw some light on the question raised by Deputy Davin and by other speakers regarding the Banking Commission's report.  I unreservedly accept the Minister's statement that he had not time to read the report because, as he explained, the evidence was so voluminous.  One could quite understand that.  After all, a Minister has certain responsibilites, and I could understand that he would be unable to find time to read through such a document.  Bur I wish he could indicate if we are to have tat report at an early date so that any uneasiness that may exist may be removed.  A good deal of uneasiness does exist in the minds of many people, and in order to remove it, perhaps the Minister could indicate the salient features of the report.  If they are healthy so much the better and if unhealthy so much the worse for the Minister and for the country .</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a Budget gives the opportunity to the Oppostion to make a many points as they can possibly conceive against it and naturally against the government. The discussion of this year's Budget has been unique, inasmuch as the Opposition has failed to being forward any critisism of a practical kind or to shoe that the Budget contained anything that is contrary to the interests of the community when it is compared with Budgets introduced in other countries about the same time. The only suggestions against the Budget that were stressed by practically all speakers were the old and <Col N="1357" /> hackneyed ones that are normally used at election periods.  These were concerned mainly with the derating of agricultural land, and doing away with some other forms of taxation. These suggestions are hackneyed and originated many years back at election times, but they offered no useful contribuation to the Budget debate and were of no practical use.  One item mentioned in the Budget attracted a good deal of attention from the critics, and that concerned a sum of £600,000. Deputy Davin waxed very wrath about that item and opposed its existence. He seemed to see no useful purpose being served by the expenditute for which that sum was earmarked, and indicated that much better service could be obtained by using it for the derating of land.  Deputy Davin must know that the amount of £600,000 would not do the whole if derating, but would only do part of it.  He further indicated as means by which he would go further, that he would ask the State to take control of our main roads.  I think he mentioned our mental hospitals, finding employment for out unemployed and increasing the amount of unemployment assistance paid to our unemployed.  i do not know how he would get this with the sum if £600,000, seeing that that sum would hardly reduce by half the first claim he made on it, derating, and that it could not do more than increase by 50 per cent. the present allowance made of the unemployed in the country, and I do not know how he would achieve the remaining purpose, to find employment for our unemployed and the mainteanance of the main roads.  How he is to get all those serviced out of that sum of money would be very enlightening indeed if he explained it to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also advocated in that direction, and I think it is only fair that it should be known, that not merely should the main roads of this country be taken over and made a STate service, but that the State should also take over the transport services in this country, which, he stated, are at present in a state of chaos.  Deputy Davin is an official of that service himself, and I <Col N="1358" /> do not think a higher compliment could be paid to he Government than that he should indicate that they are capable of taking countol of a service that is in a chaotic condition and put it on a right footing.  I am rather surprised that Deputy Davin, having regard to the position he holds in that service, would not have brought forward the suggestion that he ha in mind to make that service a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>When I am dealing with my policy-holders they are satisfied with the position they are in and they do not ask for further improvement. That is the contribution that I listened to last night here from Deputy Davin and it was not a very illuminating criticism of the Budget.  It certainly showed that if that was the amount of criticism that Deputy Davin was capable of offering on the Budget then the Budget must have been largely in a practical and sound position, that he was incapable of forming any charge against it, because he undoubtedly sought with great energy to make charges without consideration and to make a point against the standing of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cole this evening again spoke with a good deal of, not consideration, but lack of consideration and the holding back of information <Col N="1359" /> that I am sure he himself was in possession of.  He, too, of course, advocated derating, and he complained that the Minister for Education did not submit figures to show that what he said about the increase of deposits in the bank, in the Post office, was an indication of prosperity in this country.  He found fault with the Minister for Education that he did not produce statistics to prove that, thereby conveying the impression that he did not believe the statement because of the absence of proof, but he himself has no doubt that this House should believe his statement, which is a sweeping one, unsupported by any evidence or statistics, that the country has become much poorer.  Where is the logic in that sort of criticism?</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin also stated that the farmers here are in a worse position than the farmers of the Sic Counties That is not true.  So far as payments on the land are concerned, our farmers are in a better position, because, while we have not derating in its entirety, we have substantial assistance given to agriculturists in the form of reduction of the rates.  We have also a reduction by half of the annuties.  These facts are known perfectly well to Deputy Cole, and why is the time of this House wasted by misrepresenting or holding back facts that are essential and necessary to the statement, if it is to be a true repersentation of the case?  Why time is wasted in that form is difficult to understand.  Again I suggest it is a tribute to the Budget that is before us and that should be discussed in a practical way.  It has not been discussed because the Oppfosition do not feel that they are entitled to come out and applaud it as it should be applauaded.  They are incapable of finding a practical hold to point at, and they are unable to discuss it in a critical form with any degree of success for their own Party.</P>
    <P>I think that this Budget is one which is entitled to recieve favourable mention from all parties in this country. It does contain all the essentials that go to make for better prospects and a better outlook for every section in this country.  It embodies in its own way the general plan, Government plan, <Col N="1360" /> which covers practically every industry in this country.  In so far as it opines better prospects for the farming community in this country if officers a very substantial and enconuraging thing to that very important section of our people.  The improvement of agrciulture is guaranteed there.  The improvement of our workers and industrialists is guaranteed.  The continuation of bounties for our farm products, guaranteed prices for our farm products in the way of beet and wheat particularly, bounties for certain other export products, eggs, bacon, butter&mdash;&mdash; all these are guarantees for the farmer that he is going to receive, in the promise of that Budget, a better price for his stuff than this country could normally receive selling their stuff in the freest and best market in the world.  Over and beyond the market which is offered to them, they are receiving in bounties a price that will leave them an advantage over any competitor.  That is something that we should talk about and something our people should know.  Our industrialists, in the same way; are guaranteed a continuation of industry. Another important fact in this community: the income tax people can satisfy themselves that if there is no reduction of their payments they are at least better off than those in the other end of our country, the Sic Counties, or in England.  All these are very important and outstanding matters which we cannot emphasise sufficiently and we cannot, as some Deputies tried to do, in the one breath hold out that this country is in a sound financial position and thereby think that they are supporting the new flotation of the loan, and, in the next breath and in all their breaths, denounce the policy of the Government as the policy that has robbed and ruined and brought to the end of their resources all the people living in the country.  You cannot blow hot and cold on these things.  We must face realities.  Until the Opposition in this country come to realise that and face up to realties, and call a spade a spade, call a good Budget a good Budget and convince the public that they are sincerely thinking of things in a practical way the Opposition in <Col N="1361" /> this country will continue to dwindle in its improtance, the loss of which will be a serious matter in this country, the loss of a serious attempt at opposition. This question of the spending of £600,000 seems o lend the Opposition an opportunity of suggesting that there is a motive there and a driving force for the spending of that money on these defences other than the will and the wants of he people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you in this way what they are and what the reasons for these provisions are.  If a farmer started farming in this country with grand ideas of farming, let us say theoretically; that he was to raise every form of produce that could be raised on that farm and that he was equipping his farm with machinery and every sort of implement that was needed, with the men necessary to work that farm and the experts that he needed, and after all that installation it was found he refused to put fences round that farm, would any man of common sense, however sound the theories that farmer had in his mind, say that such a man was going to make a success of his farm or that <Col N="1362" /> he was going to retain possession of it?</P>

I cannot deal with that sort of argument. I am dealing with the practical reasons for putting up these deences.

      <P>The necessity for developing those defences is merely a matter of ordinary common-sense.  No one would assume that there is any such thing as leaving open the ordinary form of defence even of farm fences.  But that is an indication of the limitation of somebody's lip freedom. It is also an indication of the boundary over which somebody has a right to say the moment the fences are laid down that the fences should not be there; that somebody should say: &ldquo;I should have the right to put my foot across it; I should have the right to control some part of that property.&rdquo; But will the fact that no fence is put up, that the place is left derelict discourage that tendency on the part of anyone who is inclined to trespass? Will it not rather be an incentive and an inducement to those who feel half inclined to do so to come in and trespass on that property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did anyone ever know of a house vacated, left derelict and wihout any supervision that in a very short time in come mysterious way, such a house was not prowled, plundered and carried away bit by bit?  Is it not the same with our defences?  If we leave these forts unprotected we may rest assured <Col N="1364" /> that as soon as war breaks out between any two big countries that one or both are going to say: &ldquo;There are these waste forts over there; their possession by my enemy will be injurious to me; it is a question now which of us should get there first.&rdquo;  If there is an indication given that the people who own these forts are to defend them no matter how small that defence may be, it is a direct repulse to any such approach.  That is at least an indication if the sincerity of the people of this country to proctec t the freedom they have won.  Failure to defend these forts; failure to build war defences would be leaving ourselves open to certain attack and certain particupation in any major war in future. Maintaining the defences of these forts is the only guarantee we can have of remaining in a neutral position when a war takes place.  I suggest that the people who oppose the spending of this £600,000 have not considered this question at all from the national point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one feature about this budget and that is that it has apparently impressed Deputy Maguire.  I think most people will regard this a s a dull, unimaginative Budget introduced at a time when there are many problems confronting the country.  The Budget deals with these problem sin a very perfunctory manner, leaving them completely untouched in many cases.  Not only dose this Budget not solve but it does not attempt a solution of any of the problems which need solution. Besides this, it actually presents some new problems which, so far, have not troubled the country. Of the three main aspects of the Budget, it might be said that they contain noting to deal with the very grave prbolem of unemployment which exists in this country notwithstanding the mythical El Dorado of which Deputy Maguire has been telling us.  It does nothing in a substantial way to assist the farmer and the agricultural community. On the contrary, it creates new problems, imposing upon this country what may turn out to be the crushing burdens of armaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> Deputy Maguire tells us that we should be proud of and pleased with this Budget.  He says we ought to be pleased and satisfied that all our problems have now been brought to an end, and he tells us that there was now opening up to the country a vista of prosperity which the country had never before seen.</P>
    <P>What are the facts of the situation? Notwithstanding the glowing picture painted by Deputy Maguire, the Department of Industry and Commerce tells us that there are still 100,000 people registered at the employment exchanges in the country. There is the fact that 100,000 persons have satisfied the rigorous test that they are unable to get work and that their pitiable plight calls for relief through the medium of the Unemploy-ment Assistance Act.  If we pass from that situation to the national health section of the Department of Industry and Commerce we find that taking the past three years the numbers drawing benefit under the national health insurance have increased in some cases by 25 per cent.  Now that is the situation which to-day confronts us in this country, notwithstanding Deputy Maguire's belief that everything in the garden is lovely.  There is in this Budget no proposal for facing up to a situation of that kind.  There is no proposal in this Budget whereby the State may tackle in an effective manner a serious problem of that kind, a problem which brings misery and destitution in its train and which constitutes the most serious menace that was ever known to the progress and prosperity of this country.</P>
    <P>We used to be told away back in the light-hearted days of 1931 and 1932 that the Government had a plan for the solution of the unemployment problem. We used to be told then that Fianna Fáil would cure unemployment, that it was merely yearning for an opportunity of introducing its proposals and these would result in the complete solution of that problem. After six years we find 100,000 persons registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges and there are no proposals whatever in this Budget <Col N="1366" /> for dealing with a problem of that kind.  In my opinion the unemploy-ment problem is likely to get worse and not better owing to the developments within recent weeks.  The London Agreement which has been signed in my opinion opens up new difficulties of an economic kind.  Clause 8 of that Agreement provides that our existing tariffs, quotas and restrictions must be reviewed by the Prices Commission in such a manner as to give the United Kingdom producers full opportunities for selling their goods here.  There can be only one meaning in that Clause and that is that United Kingdom producers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I submit that I am quite entitled to refer to it and it has always been the practice on a Budget discussion to deal with such proposals, if any, as may be made for the relief of unemployment?  I am entitled, therefore, in accordance with the practice in the House, to refer to the problem of unemployment and, if I so desire, to show that it is a problem for which no provision has been made and that it is a problem which is tending to grow more serious and to merit much more the attention of the Government. I do not propose to discuss the London Agreement except to point out, with your permission, that in certain respects it is calculated to aggravate the problem with which I want to deal, namely, unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to guard against is that in discussing the question of unemployment the Deputy does not discuss the London Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss the London Agreement.  I merely propose to say that, in my opinion, the problem of unemployment is calculated to get worse and the events of the past few weeks are calculated <Col N="1367" /> to aggravate it, because we may now be giving a portion of this market to producers in another country to supply and I submit that the fact that they are going to supply it on certain terms now envisaged for them is calculated to add to the number of unemployed in this country. During the past week I have seen the representatives of many trade unions in this country.  They came to me and told me they had good reason to believe, from their own experience and from the information conveyed to them by employers, that the effect of the Agreement was calculated to slow down production in the future and that they did not think they could continue to hold their present share of the home market.</P>
      <P>I think anybody who has taken the trouble to inquire during the past couple to months into industrial productivity and employment in the country will find that a substantial number of hands have been laid off in various factories through want of orders.  He will also find that there is now a feeling of instability and unsteadiness in many industries and, in respect of some of them, they have great fears as to their capacity to carry on in view of the picture opened up to them.  I think that is the experience of anybody who has any contact with industry and who has had any contact with the trade unions catering for the workers in many of the industries affected by the Agreement. If that fact were not obvious through contacts of that kind, the fact that the Department of Industry and Commerce has been stormed by deputation after deputation asking where they stand and what is the effect on certain tariffs, quotas and restrictions, would indicate a certain feeling of instability and, in turn, it must inevitably add to the problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, therefore, apart from large-scale migration, a problem of 100,000 unemployed, notwithstanding the fact that we had assurances from the present Government that it had a plan for the solution of unemployment and only awaited the votes of the <Col N="1368" /> people to put the plan into operation and solve a very serious problem.  In this Budget there is no proposal whatever calculated to absorb the unemployed into productive employment. There is no proposal even for increasing the low rates of unemploy-ment assistance benefit paid to them during periods of unemployment.  The Government have now cultivated the mentality that unemployment is an insoluble problem so far as they are concerned.  They are willing to continue to treat the unemployed by means of giving them miserable pittances each week, but they have apparently abandoned all effort to deal with the unemployment problem in the big and comprehensive way of which they talked so glibly in 1931 and 1932.  Unemployment, according to the Government actions, is now an insoluble problem and the Minister for Finance does not spend much time propounding solutions for the problem or making financial provision for its solution in the Budget.</P>
    <P>There have been discussions on this Budget as to the position of the farmers.  Mention has been made of the fact that the farmers' savings have been relatively intact, notwithstanding the conditions through which they have passed for the past six years. Anybody who is in contact with the rural constituencies, with the farming community; any Deputy who has to deal with the problem of the agriculturist, knows perfectly well that the problem of the farmer to-day is a problem of having no money form any source.  Anybody who makes a contrary statement knows nothing whatever about the conditions of the agricultural community.  If you go through the country and take any trouble to make inquiries into the matter, you will find the farmer is suffering from the problem of having no money, and his lands are not nearly stocked to capacity.  He has no means of getting new stock, having borne heavy losses through the events of the last few years.</P>
    <P>This Budget does nothing to deal with that situation or to make available credit facilities for the farmers. <Col N="1369" /> It does nothing whatever to realise the enormous wealth which resides within a properly developed agricultural economy.  This country has been said to be mainly an agricultural community. In recent years efforts have been made to establish an industrial arm, but the main source of wealth here has been, and for a long time must continue to be, agriculture.  It is the height of economic insanity not to avail ourselves of the opportunity to develop to the full our agricultural possibilities and sell our agricultural produce in a market which is capable of absorbing a substantially greater proportion of agricultural produce than we are capable of providing for it to-day.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that during the past six years there have been considerable difficulties confronting the agriculturists of this country.  Everybody knows that, due to the economic war, farmers were put in a very difficult position: that the market which would normally be available to them was restricted and that they were only permitted to trade in that market on terms which imposed heavy losses upon them. That period has now come to an end, and, realising the possibilities of that market and realising the wealth which is contained within the agricultural economy of this country, we ought now to take steps to exploit our agricultural possibilities to the full; but how can you exploit our agricultural possibilities, having a farming community, on the one hand short of money, an don the other hand, unable to obtain credit facilities on terms which will not impose a very heavy burden upon them?  There is not a bank in the country to-day that would lend a farmer money on land&mdash;and the bigger the holding of land is, the harder it is for the farmer to get money.  There is not a bank in the country to-day that would lend a farmer money on a small-holding. It may be said that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is there for the purpose of advancing money to farmers for agricultural purposes, but if one takes the trouble to inquire into the inquisitions that are held by the Agricultural Credit Corporation as a condition of granting a loan to a farmer, one will find that a very negligible <Col N="1370" /> proportion of farmers in this country could possibly avail of any facilities offered by that corporation. Before you have any chance of getting a loan of money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, you must owe no rents, you must owe no rates, you must owe no traders' bills, you must have no shop debts, you must have your annuities paid up to date, and, in fact, in order to have any chance of getting money there, you must really be in such a position that almost anybody would lend you money.  The very fact that such a small amount of money is lent annually, and the small sums lent to small farmers, is an indication that that corporation never can adequately finance the rehabilitation of the agricultural community in this country, and agriculture, obviously, must be rehabilitated if we have any commonsense left so far as the economy of this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the farming community must be assisted to get over the losses they have sustained during the last few years, and good sense suggests that the farmers ought to be financially assisted in order to enable them to take advantage of the opportunities which are now available to them in the matter of supplying another market.  I would suggest, therefore, that the Minister for Finance might have availed of this Budget as an opportunity to indicate that the Government realises the losses which the agricultural community have suffered during the past six years and that, so far as the resources of the State permit, agriculture would be assisted in every possible way to rehabilitate itself and to equip itself for the task ahead.  One of the ways in which that could be done would be by the raising of a very substantial sum in the form of an agricultural loan, in order to make available to farmers credit facilities at extremely low rates of interest.  Even if the general community were to bear the service of the debt in the form of providing for the payment of the interest I think the expenditure of a large sum of money, by means of an advance to farmers throughout the country, would help to absorb a very large number of unemployed persons in the rural areas: would help to take them of the unemployment <Col N="1371" /> assistance rates and would given them some hope that the next six years would not be as bleak and as miserable for them as the last six years have been.</P>
    <P>It has got to be realised that, while you may open a new factory in a town or in a city, or while you may start an occasional new factory in a rural area, you cannot put a factory, in a small country like this, into every rural area in the country or into every small town throughout the country.  What hope, therefore, have we of absorbing the adolescent boys and girls in these areas except through the medium of agriculture?  What hope have we of absorbing into productive employment the large number of growing young men in rural areas who are unable at present to get employment in agriculture and who have to seek, in the emigrant ship, relief from the misery of long-continued unemployment, except through the medium of agriculture? We could make every big and every small farm in the country, however, a kind of agricultural workshop if you could only stimulate the farmer into industrial productivity by making available to him credit facilities on terms that would be acceptable to him. If we have any faith in the development of agriculture; if we have any belief that the opening again of the British market is going to be of assistance to agriculture, then, obviously, we ought to take steps to assist agriculture to benefit by the change which has now taken place and to recover some of the heavy losses of recent years.</P>
    <P>In this debate the provision of a sum of £600,000 for armaments has been referred to, and we must bear in mind that that sum of £600,000 is for armaments for a portion of this year.  The size of that sum, and hte fact that provision had to be made at short notice, is an indication, of course, of what we are likely to experience in future years in respect of the new armaments policy upon which we are about to embark. Everybody, I think, will praise the fact that the ports are now to be restored to the jurisdiction of this country.  They ought never to have <Col N="1372" /> been out of the jurisdiction of this country, because Britain never had any moral right whatever to occupy ports in this country, and the restoration of these ports was just a recognition by Britain that she never had a right to occupy these ports rather than a gesture of any generosity on her part towards the country.  Having taken them over, not merely have we reintegrated the ports with the rest of the country as Irish territory, but apparently we are now to embark on a policy of defending the ports.  Now, I want to raise the question here as to the wisdom of embarking on a policy of that kind, which is eminently suitable to Britain, and which meets Britain's imperial needs and her shipping needs.  Does it, however, meet Irish needs, and is it not calculated to have our association with Britain for defence purposes seriously misunderstood throughout Europe and the world?  The original scheme of defending Cobh, Berehaven and Lough Swilly was for the purpose of enabling Britain to have ports of defence for her trade routes.  Britain defended the southern coast of this country because, from a shipping point of view, it is the busiest portion of the ocean.</P>

      <P>I was pointing out, Sir, before the disorderly interruption of the Minister for Finance, that it was very questionable whether a scheme of defending the ports, situated as they are, was one that suited Irish interests. I was saying that these ports were originally defended by Britain in order to protect her trade routes.  Britain wants to protect the shipping off the south coast of Ireland going into British ports, and she wants to protect the shipping off the north coast of Ireland going into Scottish ports.  These are the chief British shipping highways, and it is for that reason only that these ports were defended.  Now, we are to take over these ports and to protect them and defend them, even though they are not on our shipping lines.  We are going to defend these ports now, and they are the nearest defence ports to British shipping routes.  I question whether that is good policy from an Irish point of view.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear to everyone that the main immediate armament policy is to defend the forts which have been taken over, and the point that I am raising is: why should we proceed at once, and with this indecent haste, to protect, defend and modernise forts which are to protect British shipping routes?  One might argue in another sense that you could have a defence policy related to Irish needs, and I am prepared to admit that that is something with which one could say with ease &ldquo;that is the right road or the wrong road&rdquo;; but for the moment I want the House and the country to realise that we are now embarking on a policy of equipping and modernising forts to protect British shipping routes.  I want to know, is it worth our while as Irish people to defend these forts, having regard to Irish interests.  What purpose is achieved in defending these Irish forts?  What purpose is gained by starting off immediately to take over and defend these forts&mdash;we were told by the Taoiseach that they would be defended&mdash;with this speed, without first giving consideration to the whole question as to what is the best method of defence to employ, what are the best centres to defend, and against whom are we going to defend the forts?</P>

I want to know is she the only enemy still, and is the £600,000 going to the spend defending the country against Britain.  If it is I could see my way to a new view of the thing and could understand an expenditure of £600,000, or even more, but is that the policy? Is it on that assumption that the £600,000 is being <Col N="1378" /> asked for? Is the assumption now that we need to defend the country against Britain who, in the past, was the only enemy, the traditional enemy, or are we now going to run the risk of taking on a new enemy elsewhere and a worse enemy, and from what source may we except attack? I think I am entitled to ask from whoever is in charge of Government business here what are we spending this £600,000 for.  Is it for the purpose of preventing Britain from again putting her foot into the portion of this country over which this Parliament has jurisdiction, or is it for the purpose of lining up with Britain to resist a possible attack on British shipping interests in this region by a Continental air power? Surely we ought to have some light and guidance as to what we are being committed to, and what this £600,000 is going to be spend on, because it will be contributed, in the main, by people who have their own economic needs still unsatisfied.  I should like the Minister for Finance to tell us on exactly what principle this new armament policy is being based and exactly on what fear this £600,000 is being spent.  What are we trying to avert? Do we still fear Britain, or do we fear a Continental air power?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to suggest that the policy of defence in the future needs to be carefully studied, particularly in relation to this new armaments race.  If it is not possible to tell the nation as a whole what it is committed to in respect of armaments, at least some machinery ought to be evolved for supplying Parties in this House, who have responsibility to the country, with particulars of the kind of defence machinery we are being committed to, how much we shall have to raise to finance it, when it is going to start and when it is <Col N="1379" /> going to end, and what will be the burden over the entire period.  We should be told now what load the country is being asked to bear and the objective, from the Irish point of view, for which it is being asked to bear that load.  Everybody knows that £600,000 would not provide anything like adequate protection for this country. An expenditure of £600,000 would not keep out an invasion of bees. It is only the wedge, and, when we get to the end of the wedge, we may discover that the expenditure is to be substantially higher than £600,000.  I do not want to see this country committed to a colossal armaments policy which may be unnecessary, on the one hand, and useless on the other hand. I do not want to have the people of this country told, as the people of other European countries have been told, that they should be glad to sacrifies their standard of living and their food to finance an armaments policy. I realise that it may be necessary, in certain circumstances, to take certain measure.  We ought to know what measures we are expected to take.  We ought to see the road clearly.  We ought not to be asked to expend money on the incomplete statement of national defence which we have had from the Government.  This is a small country, and, while it has substantial resources, they are relatively limited when it comes to buying armaments.  Al these armaments will have to be bought outside the country.</P>

That is due to the limitations of the language rather than to any inherent weakness on my part or any desire to be out of order.  I should prefer to have the money to be spend or armaments devoted to raising the standard of living of the people.  In any event, I do not want to see money used in such a way that its expenditure will be capable <Col N="1380" /> of having our aspirations and our outlook misinterpreted.  We have no imperial designs on Britain or on any other country.  We have no desire for territorial expansion.  All we desire is the reintegration in the motherland of the portion Britain has wrung from us and keeps from us by hte use of her armed forces.  I do not want to see this country linked up with Britain in an imperial defence policy while she is occupying the North, and I do not want to see our people linked with an imperial defence policy which is capable of having our position misunderstood in Europe.</P>

I think that there is hope and moral strength to be get by this country by constantly proclaiming our neutrality, by making it clear to the peoples of Europe that we have no imperial designs, and that we desire only to live in peace, our last political objective being to get Britain out of portion of this country in which she has no right.  A policy of that kind would give us a straightforward position incapable of misunderstanding.  I am afraid that the expenditure of this large sum as an instalment on a hastily-thought-out armaments policy, taking no notice whatever of the source from which an attack may be expected, is capable of doing us considerable mischief in Europe.</P>

      <P>At the outset, the Minister is to be congratulated on having introduced a Budget which reflects very accurately a Budget which reflects every accurately the subdued atmosphere which we have in the country since the new Agreement was entered into with Great Britain.  I am glad to say that that atmosphere is reflected in the Dáil.  At least, it has been reflected up to this evening. There have been a few ripples on the surface this evening but I am sure they will blow over and leave no trace behind.  Even Deputy Corry spoke in this debate in every chastened mood.  It looks as if, at long last, this Dáil is about to become what it was originally <Col N="1381" /> intended to be&mdash;a deliberative assembly. I hope that that spirit will inspire those who, in the future, will be responsible for our legislative programme, that the subdued tempo which we have in the country at present will have a retarding influence on our Bill-making machinery.  Deputies, during the hectic years of the economic war, have been faced with the necessity of digesting and assimilating a regular plethora of incongruous and oftentimes contradietory legislation.  The effect has been serious enough to Deputies but it was still worse int he case of the lawyers in the Four Courts who had to interpret this extraordinary accumulation of legislation.  What the effect has been on the business community I cannot say but I do know that the farmers, as a result of this hurly-burly for many years, have been almost at their wits' ends.  And is it any wonder? If the Ministers, instead of adopting the ordinary procedure, had brought into the House big drums of the Hospitals Trust, threw the various legislative measures into it holus-bolus, and then picked them out in the same haphazard way in which the sweep prizes are drawn, the result could scarcely be more bewildering or more problematical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody was driven further by this economic war that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and we all watched, with the greatest sympathy, the extraordinary eforts he made by legislation to save the baby of economic self-sufficiency.  I am sure that the Minister is pleased that this ordeal is now over and we are pleased to be in the position of watching him coming back, slowly but surely, to the policy of his predecessors&mdash;the policy of selective protection.  We all hope&mdash; and it is very difficult to find out how this Budget is going to affect them&mdash; that the great majority of the industries founded by the Minister will be put on a permanently healthy basis; but we must realise that the success of those industries will depend, to a very much greater extent, on the spirit animating the employers and employees in those industries than on any artificial stimuli applied by the Minister.  The people of this country in the past have heartily supported <Col N="1382" /> native industry and they will continue to support it in the future, but that does not mean that there is no limit to the amount of money which the people are prepared to expend in order to give a preference to native industries, or no limit to the length of time during which they are prepared to continue giving that preference. If the Irish people have been sufficiently patriotic to make genuine sacrifies to ensure the success of Irish industries without any prospect of gain or advantage to themselves the least they may expect is that those employers and employees whose profits and jobs depend on the patriotic feelings of the general public will at least reciprocate.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon in the proposal he made here the other evening, that in the same way as the Minister has seen fit to take the tariffs off certain articles used by the blind, and particularly the blind in institutions, he should also be prepared to remove the tariffs from certain commodities, free entry of which into this country would greatly relieve the burdens on the very poor.  Deputy Dillon gave the instance of cotton underclothing manufactured in Japan which could be purchased here for 1/- apiece. Those articles were a very great help to the poorer type of manual worker, and there are various other commodities of the same type which, if they were allowed into this country, without tax, would give great relief to the poor. Such an arrangement would not cost the Exchequer very much and would not interfere with the progress or prosperity of our native industry, and I think the Minister should give consideration to that subject.  I am not, int he ordinary way, in favour of purchasing very many commodities from Japan, and not for the reason which seemed to be at the back of Deputy Dillon's mind, but because Japan purchases very little from us. I think that in the ordinary way we should make most of our purchases in those countries which purchase most from us, purely as a business arrangement.  I do not agree with the view held by certain Deputies, that comodities which come into this country from <Col N="1383" /> Japan are produced by sweated labour. Modern factories in Japan are extremely efficient, and, in their own way, the Japanese workers in those factories are as well housed, as well clothed, and as well fed as our workers in similar factories here.  I merely say that because I think it would be a bad idea to allow abroad that the reason we are not able to compete with Japan or any other country is that our conditions are better here than in those countries.</P>
    <P>On page 23 of the Minister's statement, there is a passage which puzzles me and somewhat alarms me.  So far as I can gather, it simply means that the Minister intends at an early date to increase valuations in this country. Already something tantamount to that has been done for income-tax purposes. The Minister has, and in fact, all Ministers have, a decided tendency to place on the rates the cost of schemes and services which rightly should be borne by the central Exchequer, and this expedient of increasing valuations, and, as a consequence, the amount of the rate collectible will enable the Minister to carry on in a still more flagrant manner this very reprehensible practice.  The Minister in his speech went out of his way to plume himself on his generosity in increasing taxation for the purpose of extending our elemosynary services.  Already it has been pointed out by many speakers, and I do not intend to follow them, that a great deal of this expenditure is not confined to social services, but is spread over such services as the Army, the Gárda Síochaána, and the Civil Service.  Even if it were a fact that all this increased taxation was being expended on such excellent services as old age pensions, unemploy-ment assistance and insurance and so forth, I do not think the Minister has any reason to plume himself in that respect.  It is no indication of progress or prosperity in a country.  In fact, the opposite would be the case. If he were in a position to reduce the amount expended on those services, the country would be in a much sounder position.</P>
    <P>When this Dáil was first established, <Col N="1384" /> I remember that one of its earliest activities was to set about devising a scheme for getting rid of the workhouses which advertised the poverty of the Irish people to the world, but the Minister does not scruple to boradeast from this House the social disabilities of our people in a much more effective way than was ever done by the old workhouses.  Ministers are becoming very sensitive about the £2,000,000 reduction in taxation that they promised us when they were out of office. When the Ministers were out of office there was not a weapon in the armoury of political warfare which they did not use, and use unscrupulously, against their predecessors in office.  They did not care whether they hit above the belt or below the belt, or what the effect was on the nation, so long as they could have a crack at the Government. Now, when the shoe is on the other foot, they expect that no weapon should be used against them.  Possibly, the Ministers may find that we on this side of the House are not ready to pay them back in the same coin.  They may find that we are not going to continue taunting them with their reckless promises in the past, and their still more reckless incitements to a credulous public, but they will probably find that there are people outside this Dáil, in the country, with long memories, people who will continue to ask awkward questions and who will not forget as readily as we do.</P>
    <P>This Budget will prove a very serious disappointment to the farmers, who have borne the brunt of the economic war.  Many fo the most progressive and industrious of those farmers have gone with the wind of that war, and it is up to the Minister to see that so far as possible the survivors are put on their feet.  Money put into the land, particularly in an agricultural country like Ireland, is never lost.  The farmers of this country have submitted to something which I might compare to a transfusion of blood operation in order to save the rest of the community during this ordeal.  It would be only common justice, as well as very good business, to see that the strength of this industry is restored.  Of course, there will <Col N="1385" /> always be a difference of opinion as to how you can best assist the farmers. It is generally held by economists that the soundest way in which you cab help them is by reducing their overhead charges.  That naturally leads s to derating.  Derating has been criticised on the grounds that it helps the larger farmer to a greater extent than the smaller farmer.  I think that is a very unsound and very mean sort of criticism.  I have always regarded the agricultural industry in this country as a unit.  I think it is right that it should be so regarded.  If you help the farmer in Dublin and Koldare.  In the same way, in helping the bigger farmers in Kildare and Dublin you are helping the smaller farmers in Donegal and throughout other parts of Ireland.  I believe the Minister should give derating, and along with that I believe the tariffs should be taken off agricultural implements and artificial manures unless, of course, in exceptional cases where some of those implements are manufactured here at approximately the same cost as the imported article, and where you turn out just as good an article.  But in the present state of affairs in the country.  I do not think that is sufficient.  A great number of farmers here are just hanging on to their holdings by the skin of their teeth. At the present moment, as a result of the depression not only during the economic war but some time before that&mdash;because world depression had hit this country even before the present Government got into office, but certainly it was greatly intensified during the economic war&mdash;a great many farmers are in a very serious position.  Their capital has gone.  Not merely that, but their land has run down; they have taken successive crops of hay off their land, and they have not been puting manure into it. A great many of the farms in this country are under-stocked or not stocked at all.  Something drastic will have to be done in order to remedy that situation, and I think the Minister would be wise if he granted a moratorium to annuitants for two <Col N="1386" /> years until the farmers get on their feet.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has reminded us that the proper way to help agriculture and the proper way to reduce the overhead charges in the agricultural industry is to increase production.  There is no good in preaching about an increase of production if there is no capital or no other means of increasing production. If a moratorium were granted, the credit of those farmers would immediately go up.  They would be able to purchase the stock required for their land.  They would be able to purchase manures, and in all respects bring their land into heart.  They would then be in a position to avail to the full of the new conditions which result from the re-opening of the market in England. I think it should be the Government's policy to see that every acre of land which has been divided in this country, at a considerable cost to the taxpayers, is utilised to its fullest capacity.  That is the only way in which the people can be reimbursed for their very heavy expenditure on the acquiring and division of estates in this country.  I do not intend to say any more on that matter.  The important item in the Budget, the £600,000, has been very well debated.  Deputy Norton in particular has dwelt on it with great and pungent effect.  It is really a very important item.  I think everybody in the country anxious to know whether this £600,000 is to be a recurring charge; whether it is going to remain as it is or be increased; whether, as Deputy Norton said, it is merely the thin end of the wedge, and whether we may expect something much bigger to follow.  Most important of all, everybody would like to know thether this expenditure on defence or imperial defence.  The answers to those questions will, to a very large extent, decide how good was the settlement with Great Britain.  I am not criticising that settlement, because we all realised that anything which would bring the economic war to an end of a reasonable basis would be a good settlement, but we should like to have <Col N="1387" /> answers to those questions so that we may know exactly where we stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget has been a very disappointing one.  In fact the keynote of the whole Budget has been disappointment for every class of the community.  Naturally, taking into account the amount of money raised on taxation last year, an amount which approximated to the whole productivity of the country, those who had studied the position felt that with the new settlement the Minister should have at least some millions of money at his disposal to bring relief to certain classes of the community.  Last year the whole productivity of the agricultural industry amounted to something like £43,000,000.  Adding up the impositions on the people in the form of supply services, central fund services and Supplementary Estimates, and including local taxation, you will find that the aggregate of taxes and rates borne by the people approximated to that sum of £43,000,000, so we may well ask ourselves what did this country live upon.  We have one basic industry&mdash;agriculture.  The whole of it was absorbed in taxation, and what did the country live on? Somebody said we lived on the change out of the Civil Service salaries.  That probably was only a joke.  We produce nothing else in this country but agricultural goods.  All the other industries are really a form of change from one kind into another, because we have no raw materials in this country.  As I said, this Budget has been very disappointing. We felt that when the economic war was over there would be at least £4,000,000 at the Minister's disposal to bring relief to the taxpayer who had been paying this enormous sum of £43,000,000.  What do we find? The Minister, instead of telling us that there is going to be any relief brought to us tells us that we are already enjoying reliefs, that the farmer is already enjoying half the annuity.  But he has been enjoying that for the last four or five years. The Minister brings in no positive relief in this Budget.  This Budget does <Col N="1388" /> not bring any relief to the farmer directly in any possible way.</P>
      <P>In connection with this debate, one or two things have suck me very forcibly. ONe was, that the manner in which the Budget was approached from the Fianna Fáil Benches showed us how thorough, practical and effective has been the political education of Fianna Fáil during the last five years. Then, again, when I heard Deputy Norton capturing the whole Fine Gael policy with regard to helping the farmers, I thought we had at last reached the political Elysium in the splendid form of unity, that we had Labour, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael united in one splendid effort to help the farmers &mdash;a magnificent state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard so much about the farm ing community this evening, that I should like to part from the farming community for a moment and turn the Minister's attention to some other portions of the community where help would also be expected and where great disappointment arose because help was not forthcoming.  The farmer, at all events, has been left with his capital.  His chief asset in his land, and that is still left to him at all events.  It is his chief capital and land cannot be burned up or destroyed; it remains there.  But the person who, I think, has borne the greater brunt of the economic war, and who has come less into the limelight than the farmer, has been the unfortunate town dweller. When I say town dweller, I include every class of person in an urban community who pays rates, whether a trader, shopkeeper, professional man or worker.  I think the people in these little urban towns, which I have particularly in mind, have been hit the hardest of any section of the community, and if any relief should be forthcoming it should be to those persons who have suffered in silence and whose capital is gone, whose business connections have gone, whose credit has gone, and whose whole fabric of commercial connection that they had built up has been absolutely frittered away while the war lasted.  They went, first of all, when the fairs faded out, when the weekly markets came to an end, when the farmer's credit went <Col N="1389" /> down.  The farmer then had no business coming to town to do anything. He had nothing else left but his monthly cheque at the creamery, and the whole commercial business of the farmer was thrown back on the co-operative trade concerns.  In this way there has arisen, I am sorry to say, a sort of feeling that the co-operative concerns attached to creameries have run away with the whole business of the towns, while it has been by sheer force of economic pressure that the farmer has been thrown back on his monthly creamery cheque because he had no other asset to buy the necessary goods for his household and farm.</P>
    <P>As to the question of derating, I am in favour of it for the farmer.  It will give him a start, at all events, although, as I have said, his capital is unimpaired, as he is in the possession of his land.  Less than £1,000,000 will derate the whole agricultural land in this country.  That is not a very big sum when we can afford to raise £43,000,000 in national taxation and rateable charges.  It was said this evening that the farmer pays 95 per cent. of the taxes.  We all know that is not true.  How many farmers, big or small, pay income tax of any kind? Does not everybody in this House realise that the greatest portion of the taxes come from the town dwellers in the consumption of exciseable goods and in every other way? They do not come out of the farms.  I think it is wrong that the House should be misled by persons saying that the farmer pays 95 per cent. of the taxation.  That is all wrong.</P>
    <P>The amount collected in rates last year in this country amounted to nearly £6,000,000.  When you take into account that less than £1,000,000 will derate the whole agricultural land of the country, you will see how much is contributed by the town dwellers of the £5,500,000 or nearly £6,000,000.  Less than £1,000,000, as I say, will derate all the agricultural land, therefore, I conclude that the remainder of the burden falls on the town dwellers.  In the towns, everybody, including the unemployed man drawing the dole, has to pay his proportion of the local rates. In any town to-day, no matter how <Col N="1390" /> small it is, or how big it is, the local rates are at least 25 per cent. more than the rates collected off the county. There is no such thing as relief for the town ratepayer in the form of an agricultural grant.  There is no help given to the urban employer who pays labour.  I employ about 34 men myself, and I get no help whatever in the form of relief from the local council for employing these men.  But, because I employ one man on a bit of land, I get a certain amount of reduction in my agricultural rate.  There is no help, no relief, for the urban ratepayer.</P>
    <P>There was one form of taxation from which I thought the Minister this year, in the exercise of, I was going to say, his discretion, but, rather, I would say by a prick of his conscience, should have given relief, and that is the terrible taxation under Schedule A, where he raised the taxation by 25 per cent.  He raised the valuation under Schedule A of the Income Tax to five-fourths. In fact, by one stroke of the pen, the Minister in one night raised the whole urban valuation of the country by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Look how this works out compared with what previously prevailed.  UP to the time the Minister did that very iniquitous thing by raising the urban valuation by 25 per cent., a person owning a house valued £12 did not pay income tax on £12 valuation.  He got an allowance of one-sixth for repairs. That meant that he got £2 off the £12 and paid on a valuation of £10.  Now what happens? Instead of paying on £12 valuation, there is 25 per cent. added, and he pays on £15 valuation, so that actually, in effect, he is paying on a 50 per cent. higher valuation than he would have before the Minister did this very iniquitous thing.  I thought we would have got some relief on that point.  I am driven to talk about the town dweller because I heard so much about the farmer.  I do not want to put one against the other, but I believe the town dweller has been the worst sufferer in this war.  He is the person who should get any little relief that is coming out of this Budget.  As a matter of fact, there is no relief for him, but I emphasise these things as points on which he should get relief.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> As Deputy Norton said this Budget is remarkable in the way it impinges on certain social problems and passes them by.  He has dealt very effectively with the question of unemployment. The Minister ahs been boasting about how many unemployed we have and the steps the Government were taking to relieve that unemployment.  I would point out that that unemployment problem is another town problem. There is not such a big unemployment problem in the country.  In the country, especially in the poorer districts lke West Cork, with valuations round about £4, we have not got that big unemployment problem like that which we have to face in the towns.  The unemployment problem is principally an urban question.</P>
    <P>There is then this great increase in the cost of living to be considered. The cost of bread is one of the things that should be affected by our Budgetary considerations.  The price of flour should not be, say 52/- in Cork and 38/- in Belfast, simply by force of economic conditions.  Everybody knows that that discrepancy in the price of flour is due to a certain Government policy, to a certain fiscal policy propoundd and carried into practice by the Fianna Fáil Government. I maintain that the cost of living, particularly the cost of bread and of flour, is not due to any profiteering, but is due to a certain fiscal policy forced on the millers and the baking community by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The same thing applies to bacon.  Why should I have to pay 145/- per cwt. in Kinsale for bacon which is sold at 95/- to 98/- per cwt. in England? Why should I have to pay 1/5 per lb. for butter which I can buy in Birmingham or in Cardiff at 10d. or 11d. per lb? These are some of the things which call out for relief. These are the hidden taxes that do not appear in the Budget.  I may not be in order in referring to them on the Budget, but they are a natural consequence of the fisal policy of the Government.  They are matters which <Col N="1392" /> demand the serious attention of the Government and on which we have a right to demand relief.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that according to British standards of public finance we have a surplus of £629,042.  I do not think we should run our finance on British standards. At all events, we ought to have some regard for the actual state of affairs amongst ourselves here.  It has been stated that derating could only be carried out by scrapping such schemes as wheat and beet growing.  I do not think that that was ever advocated on this side of the House.</P>

These habits cannot be done away with, especially if their abolition would mean the creation of unemployment or a diminution in the circulation of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to the Deputy's own intelligence to understand what it means.  Another question was raised with regard to the farmers.  There was a plea not to put into effect the tax of £20 on hawkers. If there is one thing more than another that has done harm in this country, both from the point of view of lessening the resources of the town and disemploying labour, it is the travelling shop.  So far from having that tax abolished, I have heard the view expressed that instead of £20 it should be £200, if indeed there should not be a total prohibition of these travelling shops.  The bringing of goods for distribution <Col N="1393" /> from larger centres into big regional areas has done away with the small regional areas in which goods were distributed formerly by the local merchants.  In that way, our towns have suffered very severely by the practice of these travelling shops going to the farmers' houses and selling practically everything that the farmers need.  They work by a system of barter, because they are prepared to exchange bread and tea for eggs and other agricultural produce which the farmer has to sell.  This system of barter has practically wiped out the towns.  It has wiped out not alone the trade of the local merchants but it has done away with the weekly market, because it prevents the farmer from coming into the town to dispose of his goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have covered I think most of the ground so far as the economic war is concerned in so far as it affects the town dweller as distinct from the farmer.  The farmer, of course, has our first claim as he is the only amn who produces anything.  Al the wealth we have comes out of the soil.  It is transmuted, of course, afterwards into other forms of activity, but I would suggest that the town dweller deserves some consideration as well as the farmer.  We ought to help in some way to solve the social troubles that have arisen without leaving all these troubles to the bodies who administer local affairs. I see all around me in this House men who are connected with corporations and urban councils and wo are therefore fully aware of the problems existing in our towns.  So far, we have got very little consideration from the Government with regard to these problems. The capacity of the people of the towns to pay these taxes is getting less every day while the taxes themselves are mounting up so that the problem so far as the towns are concerned is becoming very acute indeed. The population of the towns is declining.  If you go into any small town to-morrow, you will see that shops are idle, that in every street there are houses closed up and houses to let.  You will, of course, also see many new houses that have been built to replace some of the houses demolished under the Slum Clearance Orders but, generally speaking, there has been <Col N="1394" /> a decline in the population of these towns.  For instance, in the town in which I myself was born the population has declined from 6,000 to 2,000 in the last 50 years and the 2,000 are left there simply because they have not the bus fares to get out of it.</P>
    <P>This Budget has been praised in some quarters simply because it is so characterless and colourless.  That is the most that can be said about it. It gives no relief in any positive way. We are thankful that it does not impose any new taxation, but I think the Minister instead of saying that he hoped to hear no more about the £2,000,000 should have availed of the great opportunity which this Budget gave him.  I thought he would have availed not alone of the possibilities but of the actual facts of the situation to come along with his Budget and shout triumphantly: &ldquo;At last, boys, I have been able to reduce taxation by £2,000,000.&rdquo;  He has not done that. I am very disappointed that the Minister has not embraced this opportunity to introduce his Budget with that triumphant shout: &ldquo;Boys, you will be glad to hear that at last I have been able to reduce taxation by £2,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. P. Daly Mr. P. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the most disappointing Budget that has been yet introduced by Fianna Fáil.  It is the seventh Budget brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government and it is the most disappointing of the seven.  It is all the more disappointing because this year the economic war was ended.  We were all delighted with the Agreement that the Government made with Great Britain and hope that its good effects will soon be seen in the country.  The Taoiseach has stated that we cannot expect the good results of the Agreement to be made manifest in the near future.  I agree with that.  I believe that it will take a few years before the good effects of the Agreement will be seen.  But in the meantime I would say that the good effects of this Agreement will never be seen unless the Government is prepared immediately to put the farmers in a position to produce agricultural products for the British <Col N="1395" /> market and to produce them even more extensively than they did before the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy knows what the farmers have gone through in the past six years.  During the economic war a great many of their homes were wrecked, and their sons and daughters were forced to seek a living in the land across the water taht this Government and its supporters stated was our only enemy.  In fact, conditions were so bad with some of the farmers that the money to send young men and women away had to be borrowed.  We are glad that that state of affairs has ended, and we all hope for prosperity, not only for the farmers but for all the people.  However, we cannot expect that prosperity if we are not going to help the farmers immediately.  I believe good prices were secured for cattle in the Dublin market to-day.  I hope that the increase will be greater in the future, but meantime the farmers must be helped financially immediately.  A plea has been made from this side of the House for derating.  The Government does not agree with that now, although at one time they approved of it.  I believe it is possible to derate agricultural land, and that it is possible for the Government to float a loan at a low rate of interest, so as to enable farmers to restock their land and carry on their business as they carried on before the economic war started.  Under the Agreement the Government here has been relieved of payments to the British Exchequer totalling over £4,250,000.  One of these payments concerns the land annuities.  When the economic war started the Government, after some time, brought in a measure reducing the annuities by 50 per cent.  With the settlement of the economic war this country has been relieved of payment of the full annuities, but the farmers are still paying half the annuities to the Irish Government. I believe that the Government here was only an agent for the collection of money that was paid by the British Government to the stockholders. Now that the agency has ceased, I cannot see that there is any moral obligation on the people to pay the annuities any longer.  The only <Col N="1396" /> amount for which the farmers are liable is their share of the £10,000,000 payment to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The £10,000,000 payment can be met by the £1,750,000 yearly that was paid to the Government up to the present as half the annuities, and the balance can be given to the farmers in the form of relief from paying half annuities.  If that is done, and if a loan is raised at a very low rate of interest, I believe that within the space of two years we will have a prosperous agricultural community, and when we have a prosperous agricultural community we will have a prosperous country. Deputy O'Neill remarked that we had heard a lot about the farmers recently. A great deal more will be heard about them, because they are the most important section of the community.  They are the producers of wealth.  Another section, the business people, has got no relief whatever under this Budget. These people have been very hard hit. I am very anxious about a statement the Minister made when speaking about the low rateable valuation of the country.  He seemed to suggest that something should be done about that in the immediate future.  I hope he is not going to raise valuations on business people in the towns who were so hard hit by the economic war.  The only money the people had to fall back upon, as Deputy O'Neill mentioned, was the monthly cheque for milk, and that was eaten up by the co-operative stores.  It will be no pleasure to farmers if, owing to the operations of the co-operative stores, the grass grows at the doors of shopkeepers.  I believe in co-operation for farmers to a certain extent, but I do not believe it is good business on the part of any Government in this or in any other country to help co-operation for the agricultural community to such an extent as to drive out the ordinary business people and to have grass growing at their doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item in the Budget statement to which I wish to refer concerns a payment made to Great <Col N="1397" /> Britain for Local Loans.  Reference to that payment of £600,000 caused some confusion.  I hold that the local authorities combined to make that payment of £600,000 for Local Loans each year.  That item has been wiped off under this Agreement.  The biggest part of the amount was raised for the building of labourers' cottages during the past 40 or 45 years.  Some years ago, in 1933 and 1934, the present Government claimed that they were the Government of the poor man.  If they are really the Government of the poor man they have now an opportunity of relieving the workers of a certain amount of their payments. There is an opportunity to relieve the cottiers of a certain amount of rent and also to relieve local authorities now that that payment of £600,000 yearly for Local Loans has been wiped out.  Deputy Corry asked me yesterday for my views concerning Deputy Dillon's suggestion to do away with the four beet factories.  My answer is that I agree with the growing of beet.  I spoke in favour of it, and I believe the growing of beet will continue.  I hope it will continue, and I will do everything in my power to see that the four factories that have been erected at public expense will not, as Mr. Corry and some of his friends said some years ago about the Carlow Beet Factory, become white elephants.  If public moneys have been expended on industries during the past five or six years I think it is the rightful duty of the Government and of the people of the country to protect them and to see that they will not go out of production.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is anything more I have to say on this, Sir, except that this is the most disappointing Budget for the past seven years.  This year more than any other year the people of the country, owing to the Agreement arrived at between this Government and the Government of Great Britain, were expecting great reliefs from this Budget.  They have got none.  Instead of that, after seven years, the people of this country to-day find themselves taxed to the extent of over £4,000,000 extra taxation since 1931.  They are paying over £4,000,000 <Col N="1398" /> annually more than they did prior to the advent of Fianna Fáil.  I want to know, Sir, how are the people of the country going to keep paying?  If we are going to keep us the present standard of social services in the country, the only way it can be done is by increased agricultural production.  We must increase our agricultural production a thousand-fold.  The only way you can do that is for the Government now, after six long years of the economic war, to go to the assistance of the farmers of the country and put them in the position that they will be able to produce agricultural produce for the market that we have across the water, next door to the borders of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, I think, to say that a great many people in this country were this year expecting a reduction in taxation in consequence of the close of the economic war, but those of us who were listening to the Taoiseach when he was introducing the Bill which implemented those Articles of Agreement did not expect any relief so soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is time, as Deputy O'Neill pointed out, that something should be said on behalf of the town dwellers. We all know that the farmers have suffered and have suffered considerably during the economic war.  Deputy O'Neill expressed himself as being surprised that Deputy Norton, on behalf of the Labour Party, had advocated in the course of his statement to-day that something should be done immediately to re-establish the farmers and to help them to re-stock their lands.  There is nothing new about that, in so far as the Labour Party is concerned.  That can be found in the printed policy as outlined by the Party to which I belong.  In so far as the town dwellers are concerned, Deputy O'Neill has rightly indicated that no relief whatever has been given to town dwellers. Business people in towns suffered considerably during the period of the economic war because the farmers were not in a position to pay their debts in a great many cases; they had to receive extensive credit and, of <Col N="1399" /> course, the shopkeepers did not refuse them that credit.  Now the economic war is settled and the farmer will be able to re-establish himself on the British market and we all hope, and hope sincerely, that he will be in a better position than ever he has been before.  It is time that something should be done to help the town dweller.  Not along has the town dweller suffered during the economic war by reason of the fact that the business person, above all, could not get in certain moneys that were due to him, but his rates and the rates of town dwellers generally have been raised considerably in a great many case in order to help to implement the policy of the present Government.  I have only to refer to the position in so far as the relief of the unemployed is concerned. Members of the Dáil are aware that certain urban areas over a certain population have, since 1933, been paying 1/6 and 9d. in the £ respectively. In the Cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford and places of that kind they pay 1/6 in the £.  That has been increased recently, as a matter of fact. In urban centres like Wexford, Sligo and Clonmel they have to levy themselves to the extent of 9d. in the £. That really is an impost of 10d. in the £ because the Minister insists on getting the gross amount which that rate would bring forth.  The rural population have not been called upon to pay that levy, although the people in the rural area get advantage of it.  I do not want to set one section of the community against another, but I do suggest seriously that the Minister should divert his attention to the urban centres now in order to do something to help.  Together with the fact that 1/6 and 9d. in the £, respectively, have been levied on certain urban and county borough areas, urban authorities have been called upon to levy a rate in order to supplement the grants given by the Government for the relief of unemployment.  This Government, when it went into power, stated very definitely that it had a plan to deal with the unemployment problem, and nobody ever dreamt when they set <Col N="1400" /> about to relieve unemployment that both urban and county areas would be called upon to levy the rates that they have been asked to levy within recent years.  In the town which I come from we are at the moment levied to the extent of about 2/9 in the £ in order to supplement grants for the relief of unemployment.  We do not begrudge doing that, but, at the same time, it is a big impost upon the urban ratepayer, and not alone on the business man, but the ordinary man, even the man who is unemployed, because we all know that the moment the rate is increased the landlord will immediately adjust the rent in order to secure that the increase in retes is paid through the medium of the rent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly has referred to the question of local loans.  As he indicated, up to 1933 there was an amount of £600,000 paid to the British Government as repayment of loans which had been given for the building of houses and the laying of sewers and watermains and things of that kind.  That has entirely disappeared in so far as the payment to England is concerned, and I would suggest that some relief should be given to urban areas in consequence of the fact that those payments have now ceased.</P>
    <P>Immediately prior to the War certain urban authorities had committed themselves to certain housing schemes. Those schemes did not materialise until the years 1915 and 1916.  During those two years we all know how the value of money decreased and how much more had to be paid in order to secure loans at the outbreak of the War.  Not alone was the War responsible for making money dearer, but it was also responsible for making houses dearer.  In consequence, houses cost a great deal more than they had been costing two years previously.  The result was that the local authorities were faced with the problem of not being able to charge an economic rent for the houses they built in those years. The local ratepayers were asked to pay a goodly sum in order to enable working-class people to occupy those houses.  I suggest to the Minister that in cases of that kind relief should be <Col N="1401" /> given, especially in view of the fact that the Government has been relieved of £600,000 a year which up to now they had to pay under the head of local loans.  In that connection also I suggest that a good deal of that £600,000 was money on foot of which labourers' cottages were built.  I suggest that here again some relief should be given to the county boards of health to enable them to adjust the rents of the labourers' cottages.</P>
    <P>Again we come back to the farmer and to the farmer's burden.  That burden has been lightened by reason of the fact that the land annuities have been decreased by 50 per cent.  I suggest to the Government that it is not too much at all to ask that instead of the 25 per cent. reduction set forth in the Act to enable the labourers to become owners of their own cottages, there should be at least a reduction of 50 per cent. now that this sum of £600,000 has been struck out and that we have not got to pay it to England.  After all, it will be agreed that while the farmers were fighting the economic war the agricultural labourers were also fighting and that the interest of the agricultural labourers suffered considerably during the period.  I submit that it would be a very wise gesture on the part of the Government to amend that Act and to fix the reduction at 50 per cent. instead of the 25 per cent.  As was indicated by this Party during the progress of that Bill through this House, 25 per cent. reduction means very little.  The position created by the passage of the Act would impose a very serious burden on agricultural labourers because of the fact that they would have to accept liability for the repair of the cottages.</P>
    <P>To come now to general matters, Deputy O'Neill referred to the increase which is supposed to be imposed on hawkers for their licences.  I agree that if it is at all possible hawkers should be prohibited altogether, and certainly travelling shops should be prohibited altogether.  These create a very serious menace to shopkeepers in urban areas.  Week after week and month after month we have people squatting in the market-places of our towns and setting up stalls in competition <Col N="1402" /> with the ordinary shopkeepers who have to pay rent, rates and taxes.  The shopkeepers are handicapped very much by the fact that they have to pay heavy rates to keep up the town, while these people can squat down there, sometimes leaving the place in a state of litter after them.  The people who are in competition with them have to pay rates in order to have the streets cleaned up after the travelling shops. Something should be done to prohibit this class of trading which is unfavourable to the business people of those urban areas.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Séamus Bourke was speaking he suggested that one way of helping the farmers would be to remove the tariff on agricultural machinery.  As a Wexford man, I cannot sit here and listen to that proposal. I hope the Minister will turn a deaf ear to it.  The town which I represent is practically entirely dependent upon the production of agricultural machinery.  There are 400 to 500 men employed in the foundries there, and if that tariff were removed it would be very serious for their industry.  As far as competition is concerned, the Wexford firms do not fear it; but prior to the imposition of the tariff there was a good deal of dumping by agricultural machinery manufacturers from the other side of the water.  I do hope the Minister will not take any serious notice of the suggestion made by Deputy Bourke.  If any tariff were proposed to be taken off an industry in his district he would very much resent it.  That is all I have to say on the Budget.  I earnestly invite the Minister's attention to the suggestions I have made.  If these suggestions were adopted they would be very helpful to large numbers of people.</P>

      <P>Many members of the Fine Gael Party advocated what was just and right and what I would agree with.  They advocated some form of compensation to the farmers who have suffered quite a considerable amount. Their capital has been diminished. Many of those Deputies advocated that farmers should be derated.  Some Deputy stated that the land annuities should be entirely forgiven.  He followed that up with a demand for a very cheap system of loan in order that production could be increased. Deputy Dillon, who is supposed to be a fairly sensible men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, Deputy Dillon was quite satisfied and had no doubts about it that not alone could all the ordinary fields of this country be brought into rapid production but that every hole and corner in those fields would be made available to go into production.  I take it that the first thing the Minister for Finance discovered was that notwithstanding all that talk he had to turn about to provide a subsidy to the tune of £600,000 so as to enable farmers' crops to be sold in the British market.  We have no experience of what will be the result.  Cattle and sheep are the only thing we are able to sell in the British market without a bounty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so sure along what lines credit at the moment could be given. It might become a very serious business <Col N="1404" /> to encourage the production of eggs, poultry and other things and have to provide continuous subsidies in order to sell them.  I think the Minister was perfectly wise to hold his hand until he and the country could see what was going to be the result of the settlement of the economic war.  There is no doubt that some people, apparently innocent people, did foolishly believe the Opposition when they said that the moment the war was settled, by this very day, they were going to get back all the wealth of the past, the fabulous wealth of the war period.  Anyone who saw the excitement that prevailed yesterday and this morning in shipping consignments of cattle to Great Britain would have come to the conclusion that these people actually did believe all that sort of thing was going to happen; that during the period from 1929 to 1931 nothing had happened, that there was no world depression, that Great Britain had no problems of her own, that out of sheer generosity she gave subsidies to her cattle, that she had pig and bacon schemes the same as we had, that she encouraged poultry and subsidised farming, that she provided cheap sent from here are sold on the easy-payment system, such as is advertised in the English papers.</P>
    <P>But the indications are that the weather is not so calm as some people believe it to be outside and, consequently, the Minister for Finance very wisely decided that a certain precaution or care was necessary in formulating this Budget.  It is possible if this settlement had occurred six months ago that he would have had a very reasonable idea how things were going to run and, as he gets his money from the public, through the medium of taxes, he would have been able to decide what he has just taken then normal method adopted for the last six or seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one line of consistency through the whole Budget, and that is that the Minister has made every effort to continue the social services.  The item of £600,000 for these forts that are to be taken over was very severely criticised.  It was criticised by some because they had no knowledge of how we were going to set them up or what we were going to do with them. I take it that the £600,000 will not do much more than put a few soldiers there to keep the places from falling to pieces, to keep them in order.  I take it that the setting up of a complete armament, as is the modern method and as all outside countries are doing would cost undoubtedly a great deal more.  There is hardly a doubt about that.  There may be some reason behind the people who have suspicion that enormous sums might be spent, or that we were going to start out to conquer other countries, whether it would be the Isle of Man or some other place</P>

      <P>The real facts of the situation are that these are ports which will be handed over to us on a certain date.  We may occupy them or we may leave them unoccupied.  If they are unoccupied, any of these great fellows from Europe, these swashbucklers, may come along and occupy the forts, and perhaps it is just as well that there is someone there to tell us that they are about to be occupied or are actually occupied.  I submit it is essential that some provision should be made for the taking over of these forts and their occupation.  Personally, I believe they should be occupied properly and fully equipped.  There were lamentations for generations over the loss of these forts, the great loss they meant to the country and the control held over us by a foreign country.  Now that we have complete control, surely we are not afraid to shoulder responsibility, <Col N="1406" /> because there is a responsibility, and everyone of us knows that perfectly well.  Freedom gives responsibility; it imposes responsibility on the people of this country.  I am satisfied that the members of this Party, and, I am sure, the members of the Party opposite, are satisfied to shoulder that responsibility. It cost us a great deal to get that responsibility.  It cost a great deal in blood to get that responsibility, and I am quite satisfied that almost everyone on the opposite side is prepared to shoulder that responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>After all the enthusiasm of the past few weeks in connection with the Agreement, I think this Budget comes as a great damper and tends to lessen very considerably that feeling of enthusiasm.  I know that the people at the present time are more or less disgusted because they were told by responsible Ministers here that they had won the war. If they have won the war, they certainly, and quite naturally, expect to see some of the fruits of their victory. I am sorry that they have not been offered very much in this Budget.  We all know the people who bore the brunt of the economic war on their shoulders.  The people who form the agricultural community were the soldiers of the economic war.  Every decent country after a war tries to compensate its victorious soldiers in some manner, and I wonder the Minister for Finance did not come to the aid of the wounded and disabled soldiers of the economic war.  I think it is very callous and unnatural that he should be so indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to gain the fruits of victory from the Agreement we must put the agricultural community on their feet.  When I say the agricultural community, I mean the workers and the farmers.  This is unquestionably an agricultural country and our only hope is to get agriculture properly on its feet and then let the farmers work out their own salvation. We must first of all get a prosperous agricultural community, get people on the land who will be able to give employment, who will be able to buy and <Col N="1407" /> sell and become quite independent.  I am sorry to say that at present our agricultural community are in a bad plight.  They are in the position that, Agreement or no Agreement, they are not worrying one way or the other. The fact is that in most cases they do not own their land at all.  The bank or somebody else has a big interest in it and the farmers are in the position of being little better than herds on the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance having got this Agreement&mdash;and it is a fair Agreement&mdash;should at least arrange to devote a few millions for the purpose of assisting the agricultural community. One of the most serious problems in the country at the moment is the amount outstanding in arrears of annuities.  Some small farmers owe annuities over a period of three to five years.  They are quite willing to pay, but they are unable to do so.  They do not want to have the arrears wiped out.  All they want is that the Government should give them some idea how they are going to start paying on a proper and ordinary basis.  I think there should be some indication, with regard to the men who owe arrears over three to five years, that there will be some way of funding that, or at least telling the farmers that they will have a space of 12 months or so before they are asked to pay up the arrears.  The Government could indicate to them that if they paid the current annuities they would be given a year or two in which to pay the arrears.  If that were done, I think the agricultural community would be satisfied and it would be a great help to them.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about derating. I quite agree that it is a great front plank in the platform of any Party, and it is needed, because derating will mean immediate benefits, not to the farmer alone, but to the unfortunate unemployed.  The Government should be able to initiate a plan whereby the money saved to the farmers when they would not have to pay rates would be spent in giving employment. The Government could see to it that <Col N="1408" /> the money was spent in that way, and that would mean perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 unemployed men getting work on the land and producing the necessaries of life for themselves and the people generally.</P>
    <P>For the last 20 years almost we have had an Irish Government.  I am one of those who sacrificed a fair amount to bring an Irish Government into being, but I am not satisfied that we should be for 16 or 20 years trying to get to the position of running this country in a business-like way.  The present Government have almost brought the country to the edge of despair, when they should have it at the peak of prosperity and on the high road to become a proper Irish nation. At the moment this country is poor and impoverished and all through our own doing.  There is no use in attributing it to John Bull; it was all done by our own hands.</P>
    <P>It is time the State realised the need for something like an emergency call. I think there is an emergency in the present year, and that the nation should be called together to see how we are going to get out of our difficulties.  I certainly think that a Council of State is needed, and that the resources and the brains of the State should be put together in order to see how we are going to make this a proper and a prosperous nation.  I think that it can be done, because up to the present moment our economy plans were not plans at all.  We were just blundering along from day to day, hoping to see if anything would turn up to help us out of our difficulties.  A little did turn up, of course, such as the Agreement with England, but that will not help to procure employment for the 100,000 unemployed men who are at present on the dole.  If we are to provide employment for most of these people, we must concentrate on one thing, and that is to get back the people from the towns and cities, to which they fled because they could not get work on the farms&mdash; to get them back and working on the land&mdash;and to do that the only hope for us is to try to ease the burdens on the people who own the land by taking off some of the overhead charges that <Col N="1409" /> are on the land at the moment.  I think that if that is not done, we will not get the fruits of this Agreement.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches did not either praise the Budget or anything else, except to talk about all that had been done during the last so many years for social services.  I quite agree that they did a fair amount for social services, but when they talk of such services they ought to bear in mind what has been done for social services in other countries, in Europe and so on.  I think it will be found, on examination, that other countries have increased their provision for social services by about 100 per cent. more than we did in Ireland.  We have only been tinkering with the matter here, giving widows and orphans pensions and so on, but we have been really doing nothing to get our country on its feet properly, and we should not talk at all about what we did for social services, because actually we did nothing; we did not even scratch the surface yet.</P>
    <P>Now, one of the burning problems of the day&mdash;with men of my type at least&mdash;is concerned with what I call the old soldier in the republican army, and in that connection I should like to know where we stand in the matter of defence.  We have certain sentimental ideas with regard to the independence of our country, such as that we fought for, and are prepared, if necessary, to fight for, the full independence of Ireland, as we did in the past, and we only accepted the Treaty as a stepping-stone to the full independence of our country, just as we accepted the Agreement of 1926 as a stepping-stone, and just as we are now agreeing to the Agreement of 1938 as a stepping-stone to our ultimate freedom, but I am afraid that, the country being so low in itself up to the present moment, and the Government being so glad to get some agreement or another with England, there is a danger that they think this is the final settlement.  Well, I am satisfied that further generations will arise to proclaim and to fight, if necessary, for the principle that Ireland must be free from shore to shore, that <Col N="1410" /> it should be no Crown colony of England, that it should be absolutely independent and free to make agreements with any country that it likes to make an agreement with, and I say that until that day comes we will not be free or cannot regard ourselves as being free.</P>
    <P>In connection with the ports, I am afraid the people are in dismay because it seems to me that we are now binding ourselves openly and avowedly to Imperial England, saddling ourselves with responsibilities in connection with Imperial England, and making ourselves part and parcel of the next European war whenever it may come.  Before the matter goes too far, I think it should be made clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir, but I suggest that this £600,000 that is to be spent on modernising these ports should be knocked out of the Budget this year.  I do not think we should start modernising these ports yet, but that that question should be left over until the people are able to bear the cost of modernising them.  In that way we could save that money in the coming year and devote it to the purpose of getting work on the land for the people who are at present unemployed. Getting back the ports is all right, but in any case I do not think that they are any great concern of ours, because if we have to spend money on defence I do not suppose it will be spent on these ports, but on aeroplanes, certain types of armament, and so on.  As far as I understand, these ports are derelict, and I think it would be a good thing to let them go derelict.  How <Col N="1411" /> ever, I would ask the Minister to drop this £600,000 out of the Budget this year, if it were only as a gesture that he is doing his best to relieve the unemployed men in this country who have had to flock out of the country into the cities and towns and across the water.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it would be a far better thing to give the country a chance to settle down, because the real problem of the day is to get work, and more work, at decent wages for our people, and to enable our farmers to pay those wages.  If we do that, I can assure the Minister that the farming community and the workers will respond at any time they are needed in a national emergency, and that they will come to the aid of any Government that will help them to live in decent circumstances and will help them to get out of the beggarly, hand-to-mouth, miserable existence that they have had to put up with for the last six years.  If you leave people living in the miserable conditions in which they have had to live for some years past, then you cannot expect much from them in an emergency, and if you want to get back your lost province, your lost Six Counties, from the North, you must provide your farmers in this part of the country with better circumstances and better living conditions than they have in the North.  As a matter of fact, if you can do that, instead of having to prevent the Six-County farmers from coming in, they will fall in on top of you, but if you are to have the uncertainty and misery that has been here for the last five or six years, they will not come in with you.</P>
      <P>Again, I suggest that the Minister should leave out things that are not needed, such as this £600,000 for defence, and, in fact, if I were Minister for Finance in an Irish Government, I would go further than that and would sack all those hordes of officials that have been brought in as a result of the economic war.  We are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on these.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  It seems that I cannot speak on that, but I should like to say that I cannot understand how it is that, with our population growing less in this country, it is taking more money to run the country.  That is something that is very curious.  I cannot understand how it is that with a smaller population, we should have higher taxation.  It would seem that the lesser the population, the higher the taxation goes up.  That is something that needs some economist to find out. At any rate, it is something more than I can solve.  However, as the Minister claims that he did win the war, I would ask him at least to give the soldiers of that war some compensation for the losses they have sustained. That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House, but, like Deputy Davin and other Deputies, I should like to say that there is a good deal of disappointment down the country at this Budget.  Undoubtedly, people did expect that, as a result of the settlement of this economic war, there would be a relief of taxation. Deputy O'Reilly talked about this Budget having been described by other Deputies as a featureless Budget and as a Budget that had nothing in it to encourage the people.  Well, there is really nothing in it to encourage the people and, mind you, since 1933, I have been looking forward to the fulfilment by the Minister for Finance of the promise he then made, namely, to reduce taxation by £2,000,000.  That was at a time when taxation was under £22,000,000.  I do not wish to take up the time of the House, as I said, and indeed I could talk for the next week, quoting the different Ministers on what they said at that time, but I am sure that the Minister for Finance will not deny that he said at that time that the country could not stand the burden of taxation.  I should like to ask him how he feels to-day that the country can be prosperous <Col N="1413" /> when taxation, taking it all around, is about £10,000,000 more than it was then.  There is no doubt about it that those who have referred to the position of the agricultural community and the people of the towns are simply telling what is the truth.  You could go into any town in the country at the present moment and play a score of bowls without endangering the life of anybody.  The farmers have been in the front line trenches during the past six years, and I have always held that until there was a settlement of the economic war there could be no hope for the people in the towns and cities. It is natural to expect that the more the farmers get for their produce the more they will have to spend.</P>
      <P>When the Agreement was under discussion two weeks ago, Deputy McGilligan, during his criticism of it, was asked by the Minister for Finance if he would vote for it.  The Deputy replied that he would, and added that if it was a much worse Agreement he would vote for it if the effect was going to be to improve the conditions of the agricultural community.  Deputy Moore interrupted to say that the farmers were not of that opinion in 1932.  Deputy McGilligan replied that he believed that were it not for the results of the general election last July, the Taoiseach would not have gone across to make this settlement with the British.  We were all glad to see that the Agreement was made.  I have my own views with regard to the settlement and would much prefer to discuss the merits of it at the crossroads or at a private session of the Dáil rather than in the presence of the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the amount of money that is being spent on social services.  Deputy Corry said that the last Government, during its ten years of office, did nothing.  I do not like to be ripping up old sores, but everyone in the country knows that the last Government, when in office, had to establish constitutional government in this country.  Even the Minister for Finance complimented the Leader of our Party on that, and said that he had to admit <Col N="1414" /> that the last Government established constitutionalism, and that the present Government were there to maintain it. Everyone knows what it cost to repair the damage done by those associated with the Party now on the Government Benches.  I am not saying that out of any spirit of vindictiveness, but I think that, when we on this side are attacked, we have the right to reply.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the reduction of the annuities. I think it was Deputy Allen who said yesterday that the farmers would reap an immediate benefit of £1,700,000.  In the Budget statement we find two items.  Under the first it is proposed to expend £600,000 on defence.  The second is the sum of £500,000 to meet interest charges on the £10,000,000 loan.  These are two big items.  The Minister for Agriculture, when he sat on these benches, said that the farmers produced 80 per cent. of the wealth of the country and, therefore, paid 80 per cent. of the taxation.  I am not one of those who believe in subsidies or bounties.  I think they are complicating the financial system we have here. To a great extent I fear that the provision of them is probably a political game.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, when in opposition, advocated the giving of £1,000,000 for derating, but they maintain now that derating would be of no advantage to the farmers.  I believe Deputy Meaney said&mdash;I was not in the House&mdash;that derating would bring no benefit to the farmers.  There has been a good deal of talk about the ranches and of the benefits that would go to the big ranchers from derating.</P>
    <P>I propose to give to the House particulars of the case of a small farmer who lives at the back of my own place in the County Cork.  His valuation is £9 10s.  In 1932 his annuity was £5 11s. 2d., and his rates £2 6s. 6d., the total outgoings being £7 17s. 8d. In 1931 his annuity was £5 11s. 2d., and his rates £2 8s. 6d., making a total of £7 19s. 8d.  In 1937 his new annuity was £3 1s. 4d. and his rates £3 12s. 6d., making a total of £6 13s. 10d., or a difference, as compared with 1932, of <Col N="1415" /> £1 3s. 10d.  Is there any Deputy who will contend that it would not benefit such a man to get relief under a derating scheme to the extent of £3 12s. 6d., the amount of rates that he paid on this land in 1937.  Is there any Deputy from the constituency that I represent who will not admit that there has been a vast increase in the cost of feeding stuffs, and in the agricultural implements that we have to buy, as well as on every commodity that is consumed in farmers' homes? Deputy Corry spoke the other night about the admixture scheme, but I have to watch the Ceann Comhairle, because I fear he may not allow me to discuss that.</P>

Of course, I know it does not make any difference to Deputy Corry, or those associated with him, where that 16/- comes from.  I put it to Deputies on the Government Benches&mdash; a great many of them come from the poorer parts of the country&mdash;do they think it just to subsidise people, who are able to grow barley and wheat, and other produce, at the expense of the people in the poorer parts?</P>

Deputy Meaney talks about the subsidy on butter and eggs.  I want to ask him, will the Government allow <Col N="1416" /> us to purchase our feeding stuffs at the world price as we were able to do in 1932?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably it is just as well.  I ask the Minister to take responsibility now and say that the Government are prepared to go into the question of the cost of feeding stuffs&mdash;to do something that will help to bring relief to the people in the poorer parts of the country who are so urgently in need of it.  The markets are now open, and why should not the people who can grow feeding stuffs do so, and feed them on their own land? Why do they expect the people down the country to pay £2 or more to subsidise them?  I was opposed to that when my Party was in power.  I am opposed to it to-day and I am going to continue my opposition to it as long as I am in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few words with regard to the position of the small farmers as a result of the having of their annuities.  I want to compare the position of a farmer as regards both rates and annuities in 1932 and in 1937.  The valuation of the man I have in mind is £9 10s.&mdash;£2 for the house and £7 10s. for the land.  Nobody <Col N="1417" /> will say that the valuation of the house is too high.  His annuity in 1932 was £5 11s. 2d. and his rates £2 6s. 6d.&mdash;total, £7 17s. 8d.  In 1937 his annuity was £3 1s. 4d. and his rates £3 12s. 6d.&mdash;total, £6 13s. 10d. As a result of the halving of the annuities, he benefited by £1 3s. 10d.  That does not take account of his contribution towards the £10,000,000 extra taxation imposed on this country. Taking the population at 3,000,000, that would work out at £3 per head, including every member of his family. Reference has been made to the position of the farmers and to the lightening of their burden by 50 per cent., I say that their position has not been lightened to the extent of 50 per cent., taking rates and annuities into account, which, in justice to them, you must take into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke about the subsidy on eggs and butter.  I ask Deputy Corry, or any Deputy on the Government Benches, to explain why people went out of egg production.  Is it not the truth that the price of feeding stuffs drove them out of egg production? Deputy Corry said that the cow population had gone up by 100,000 since 1931.  I do not know what the figures are, but I am not sorry to see the number of cows increasing.  As long as you have cows there will be more employment.  There was a time when a great many people went into milk production as a result of the position created by the economic war. People who were engaged in rearing calves and producing cattle went out of that business and into milk production. Will Deputy Corry deny that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will grant Deputy O'Leary this&mdash;that a lot of them who were keeping their land for dry stock did go into milk production, and it was a good job, because it gave more employment.</P>

He came up looking for a job on the Liffey scheme.  I asked him how it was he could not get employment at home, and he said that he could not get employment because everybody had a tractor. I have had some experience myself in connection with this matter of employment. We in the country are supposed to be allowed a certain amount for permanent employees.  I kept four permanent hands, but, as a result of the demoralisation brought about by the Government during the past six years, the tendency is for workers to go off the land.  I was allowed only for two men.  It was not my fault that the men came and went as they pleased.  I could not keep them.  One man left me on the 26th, and the secretary of the county council refused to allow me in respect of him&mdash;</P>

It will be admitted now that <Col N="1419" /> Mr. Hogan, the late Minister for Agriculture was probably the best Minister for Agriculture in the world.

      <P>I am not an expert on English&mdash;in fact, I know the Irish language better than the English&mdash;but I do not think there is any difference between one and the other.  I should like to quote Deputy Davin before I conclude.  He said that the agricultural community were in the front line <Col N="1421" /> crenches, and he said that he was speaking for men he knew.  I am also speaking for men I know, and I know that some of the most industrious people in this country have been brought to the verge of ruin, and I challenge any Deputy to contradict me in that.  Deputy Davin asked if the Government would, even now, set up a commission to investigate the conditions of these people and find out what hardships have been imposed on them in the last six years.  I think that is a reasonable demand.  Commissions have been appointed for other purposes, but I think I had better keep off that subject for the present.  I shall have another day for that, too, and I will have some quotations from the past.  I hope to spend some time showing the views of these people at that time as compared with their views now.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Government to set up some kind of commission to investigate the position of the agricultural community and to try to find some means of helping them out.  I have always maintained, and I maintained it before we got the Treaty, that agriculture was and would be the main industry of this country, that on agriculture depended the prosperity of the whole people, and that, instead of destroying production, as was encouraged by the Government in the past six years, production should be encouraged and an effort made to secure a market. We have the market, although we were told at one time that that market was gone, and gone for ever.  Now, however, we have had the experience of seeing the people who held that view going across to England and negotiating. At last they have come to their senses and have found out the real position in the country.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan that were it not for that realisation the Taoiseach would never have crossed the Channel to negotiate with the British people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Budget has ranged around two matters&mdash;the question of derating and the question of national defence.  I do not intend to indicate how far I think a discussion in regard to questions of defence policy was strictly relevant to the debate but, in any event, a large <Col N="1422" /> part of certain Deputies' speeches concerned itself with that issue.  I do not think that the question properly arises for detailed discussion on this Resolution.  An opportunity to discuss this question of national defence arose when the Agreements with the United Kingdom were under discussion a few days ago, and the House was then told, in no equivocal terms that, in the Government's view, large sums of money would thenceforward have to be provided for the purpose of national defence.  Deputies were informed that this was the considered view of the Government, and that after the Agreements were ratified by the House, the Dáil, in due course, would be asked to vote large sums of money for that purpose. Deputy Norton, Deputy Davin, Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Bennett, Deputy Giles&mdash;in fact practically every Fine Gael Deputy and every Deputy from the Labour Benches who has spoken&mdash;who referred to this matter were well aware of the fact which I have mentioned when those Agreements were before the House.  If they differed from our view in regard to this question, they could have taken the opportunity to make that clear by voting against the Agreement.</P>

    <P>They were told in the debate by the Taoiseach that it was the Government's intention, first of all, to take over these ports at the earliest possible moment, at the moment at which we had the skilled and trained personnel to take them over, and that when they were taken over, they would be modernised.  If Deputies and, in particular, those who have responsibility for leading Parties or for sitting on the Front Benches as representing the guiding and leading lights of Parties, felt that that was an unwise policy, they could have expressed their dissent from that policy in the way in which it is open to every member in this House; in the way, for instance, of which Deputy Larkin availed himself, by not voting for the Agreement. When these Deputies who have been so vocal to-day, so full of protest against money being raised for the purpose of Imperial defence, as they term it, who to-day are questioning the wisdom of modernising the ports <Col N="1423" /> and equipping this nation to defend itself against whomsover may attack it&mdash;for that is the sole purpose for which the country is being asked to provide this money&mdash;had an opportunity to give practical expression to those views by voting against the Agreement, which proposed to take over these ports, and by voting against the policy which was announced when that Agreement was put before the House; that is to say, that it was our intention to modernise those ports, and not merely that but to strengthen and extend every provision which hitherto with our limited resources we had been able to make for the purposes of national defence, they should have had the courage, they should have had the honesty, they should have had the honour, to get up here and do so then.  They had not the hardihood, Sir, to do that.  Therefore I suggest that if they want a full statement of our policy with regard to national defence they should have to wait, and I respectfully suggest that the Chair should have compelled them to wait until that policy was unfolded either by the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I, Sir, am not in that position; the responsibilities of my office, my particular duties, do not call upon me to state on an occasion such as this what the policy of the Government is in regard to that matter. Therefore I do not intend to deal with it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins informed us yesterday that the Budget had been received in some quarters with rather acute disappointment, and in other quarters with a certain amount of <Col N="1424" /> relief.  The Deputy said the relief was felt in places in which a big increase in taxation had been expected, and that the disappointment had been felt elsewhere.  I must differ from the Deputy when he suggests that the country has been accustomed to expect a big increase in taxation every year for the past six years.  I am quite sure that the Deputy, in making that statement must quite accidentally have overlooked the facts of the matter.  They are quite simple, and I think they are within the recollection of most of us.  In any event, if the recollection of any element in the House is at variance with what I say, they can substantiate the truth of my statements by looking up the records of the past six years.  When we took office in 1932 we had not only to make up the heavy deficit on the Budget of the coming year which then confronted us, but we had also to begin to provide the people with certain social services which had been withheld from them during the preceding ten years.  This involved for that year in our first Budget a heavy increase in taxation, but in 1933 there was no change in the rate of taxation, and in 1934 there was a reduction.  In 1935, again on account of the increased provision which had to be made for certain services, particularly for that of unemployment assistance, some rates of taxation were increased.  In 1936 and in 1937, however, there were heavy reductions in those rates, so that, so far from its being true that in every year for the past six years there have been increases in the rates of taxation here, such increases in fact took place only in 1932, when we had to make good the deficit which we inherited from our predecessors, and when we had to provide for the people the social services which had been so much in demand but which they had withheld from them during the preceding ten years.</P>
    <P>In that year 1932, and again in 1935, when we had to provide the heavy sums required for unemployment assistance, there were increases in taxation, but in most of the other years&mdash; notably in 1934, 1936 and 1937, there were heavy reductions in taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> But, of course, the members of the Opposition have hypnotised themselves into believing that there have been heavy increases in the rates of taxation over the past six years. Naturally, they have now come to judge a Budget not from the point of view of the benefits or advantages which the country can be expected to reap from the services for which the Budget is to provide, but merely on the narrow issue as to whether or not it is proposed to increase the rates of taxation.  There we have rather a paradoxical situation.  Most people would hold that a Budget which did not increase the rates of taxation, or even did not change the rates of taxation, should be regarded as a good Budget, but that is not the view of the Opposition.  If it does increase the rates of taxation, then from the point of view of the Opposition, as it is customarily expressed here in this House, it is a good Budget because it affords them an opportunity of making the utmost Party capital out of that fact. If on the other hand it does not increase the rates of taxation, then it is&mdash;as this Budget has been described &mdash;a bad Budget, or at best a disappointing one.  But though, as Deputy O'Higgins had to admit yesterday, the ordinary citizen is relieved at this Budget and thinks it a good one, we need not be surprised if the members of the Opposition, certain members of the Labour Party, and every other Deputy in this House who had hoped to make capital out of the fact that some one other than himself has had to take the odium of collecting taxes in order to meet the costs of the services which they, in common with every other member of the community, demand, should find this a bad and disappointing Budget.  It is a bad and disappointing Budget indeed from the point of view of its effect upon their political fortunes, but I think, and I believe the country will agree with me, that this is a good Budget and a sound Budget, and one which in present circumstances will be extremely advantageous to the country and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>But when an Opposition bases all its hopes in regard to a Budget upon <Col N="1426" /> the expectation and desire that it will provide for increased taxation, it is hard for them to adopt an attitude consistent with their own pasts. We have had that difficulty fully exhibited in this debate.  Prior to this day week, the clamour of the Opposition, heightened by the thin, piping note of Deputy Davin, was for a reduction of taxation.  But to-day they are demanding that taxation should be increased, mind you, not by £100,000 or £200,000, but by £2,000,000, for that is what this demand for the derating of agricultural land involves&mdash;an increase in general taxation of not less than £2,000,000 per annum.  And the Party which up to a week ago was clamouring that taxation should be reduced, is now equally clamorous that it should be increased by no less than £2,000,000. For, as I said, that is what the derating of agricultural land would cost, except in one eventuality, which is that, if those who are crying out for the derating of agricultural land are prepared to surrender the concession which was afforded to them in the Land Act of 1933 and to agree that the Land Acts shall be so amended that henceforward every person who is buying out, or who from this time onwards buys out his land, will agree to pay for it, not even at its full market price, but at something less, and at the same time, something very much more than he is paying for it now.  That is to say that those who are clamouring for derating should agree that the purchase of their land should be completed not upon the terms of the 1933 Act but on the terms of the 1923 Act.  In that way we can have derating without extra taxation.  Indeed, I might say that if those who want derating can see their way to concede that condition, not merely would we be able to give derating without increased taxation, but we would be able to give derating with a reduction in taxation as well.</P>
    <P>Now let us look at the figures.  Derating, as I have said, would cost £2,000,000 in round figures.  The reductions granted in the pre-1923 annuities cost the State approximately £1,615,000 a year.  In respect of the post-1923 annuities, the reductions already granted are expected to cost <Col N="1427" /> this year £612,000.  But that is not the whole story.  There still remains land to be bought out and divided.  It is expected that in order to complete the redistribution of the land of the country in economic holdings, further issues of land bonds to the amount of £7,750,000 must be made.  Of this capital sum, no less than £3,750,000 is expected to fall as a direct responsibility on the Exchequer, and in respect of that an annual charge of £184,000 will have to be met, and met, of course, out of taxation.  So that when land purchase is completed within a comparatively few years from now, the total benefit which agriculturists will derive from the reduction of the land annuities, which was granted under the 1933 Act alone, will amount to £2,411,000 per year, or almost £400,000 more than would be required to derate agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Now here is a chance for Deputies who want derating and who, as I said, used to want at the same time a reduction in taxation.  Deputy Gorey, Deputy Bennett, who is not here, and Deputy O'Leary, who has gone out&mdash; let them combine and let them go to the Land Commission and pay into it the full amount of the annuities which they would have paid, which they were paying, I think prior to 1933, and let them say to the collector there: &ldquo;We should like this money to be handed over to the Minister for Finance to enable him to derate agricultural land.&rdquo;  I can promise that, when Deputy Gorey, Deputy Bennett and the other members of the Opposition generally, can persuade their friends to pay over to the Land Commission the full amount of the annuities on the pre-1933 basis, derating from the point of view of the Exchequer will become a practical proposition. But, until then, I am afraid that it will not be possible for this or any other Government to deal with that proposal upon any equitable basis or in any practical way.  I should like to know now from the Opposition whether a proposal of that sort would be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would he surrender the concessions which have been granted to him in regard to his purchase annuity and take derating instead?  It is only on the basis of such a proposition that derating can be considered.  That would make it, as I have said, a practical proposition for the Exchequer and, I suggest, an equitable one for the community. I feel, of course, that the proposal would not commend itself to Deputy Bennett or to Deputy Davin.  It might do so, when he thinks over it, to Deputy Gorey, because, notwithstanding the terms in which he sometimes expresses himself.  Deputy Gorey is a Deputy who is inclined to look at things in a responsible and realistic way.  Some of the other Deputies who spoke in this debate have not the same direct, acute mind that Deputy Gorey has.  They will try to have it both ways.  They will not agree to give up the concession in regard to the annuities and they will continue to clamour for derating, and, accordingly, they will want it, of course, to be financed out of taxation.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary what lax views certain Deputies of the Opposition, and some, but not all, Deputies of the Labour Party, have in regard to this matter of taxation.  I have referred to the fact that in 1932 we had to impose increased taxation, and we had again to do it in 1935&mdash;an unpleasant task, an invidious task, an odious one, and one which leaves one open to a great deal of personal attack of a very acrimonious kind, and naturally so, because taxation, in essence, means that a group of men entrusted with certain temporary power proceed to take what, in the first instance, belongs to another in order to devote this property of a private individual or individuals to a public purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We used to hear from Fine Gael Deputies a great deal about the Communistic <Col N="1429" /> tendency of the Fianna Fáil Party.  When we were in opposition it was freely alleged by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as they were called then, that we were in league with the Reds.  When we came into power, we were described and we were held up by the Opposition, during that brief but inglorious period when they were trying to establish a Fascist movement here, as men who were paving the way for the dark revolutionary forces which were hidden in the background.  It was said that we would bow to the forces of disorder and that, by the stand we had taken against Great Britain in regard to the land annuities, we had created in the minds of the people loose conceptions about private property and private right, so that eventually we should be swept aside and replaced by those who did not believe in private property and private right, and who would establish an irreligious, Godless and sanguinary Communistic dictatorship here.  That was what used to be said about us here. That was the least thing said about us here when we increased the income-tax by 9d. in the £ in 1932.  Any interference by the Government with the property of a private individual, any imposition by way of taxation upon the back of that individual was, as I have said, regarded and held up by those who were opposing us in initiating and expanding social services as being Communistic in its tendency.  A number of them, filled with holy zeal, donned a blue shirt in order to prevent us going Red.  Not one of these dire prophecies has come to pass.</P>

      <P>I am not going to dilate on the fact that after six years of our administration there is comparative peace and order, that we are still in office and that no one feels himself insecure either in his property or in <Col N="1430" /> his person.  These things are there and the fact that they are there speaks for itself.  I must say that I am surprised, as I have said, to find that those who in 1932 regarded our action in taking 9d. more in the £ off a man's income than was taken in 1931 as an act of unjustifiable confiscation, who condemned us because when a person went into a cinema we insisted that some part of the money paid out for the purposes of amusement should be taken for public purposes, who condemned us, as I say, in terms that could be applicable only to highway robbers&mdash;I am surprised to find now that they regard so lightly the right of the individual to retain and to enjoy what he earns and what he owns, that they have no compunction whatever, no scruple, in demanding that an additional £2,000,000 should be raised for the purposes of derating.</P>
      <P>How do those who have advocated derating, who have advocated that we should raise that £2,000,000 think it can be secured?  We could get it by increasing income tax by 2/6 or 3/- in the £, making it 7/- or 7/6.  Do the Opposition advocate that?  Or we could get it by putting about 6/- per lb. on tobacco or putting, perhaps, 2/- per lb. on tea, or 2½d per lb. on sugar.  Does Deputy Davin, who told us that he wants derating also, want to put 2½d per lb on sugar, 2/- per lb. on tea, 6/- per lb. on tobacco or 2/6 or 3/- in the £ on income-tax?  Or does he want a combination of these, say 1d per lb. on sugar, 4d per lb. on tea, 8d per lb. on tobacco and 1/- in the £ on income-tax?</P>

      <P>What I have been saying has particular relation to Deputy Davin or any other Deputy who has been advocating derating in this House.  Does he want a combination of these taxes?  Let me repeat them&mdash;1d per lb. on sugar, 4d per lb. on tea, 8d per lb. on tobacco and 1/- in the £ increase in income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I know the Deputy would be bearing a heavy burden if a tax were imposed on ginger beer, because he would be paying an excise duty on a lot of his froth.  When Deputy Davin has got that 1d. per lb. on sugar, 4d. per lb. on tea, ½d. per ounce on tobacco, and 1/- in the £ increase on income tax, will Deputy Davin come along then crying out about the crushing <Col N="1432" /> burden of taxation and the high cost of living?  Why should I ask such a question?  Everyone knows that Deputy Davin has taken to himself the injunction of Polonius.  Whatever else happens, Deputy Davin always carries this admonition in his mind: &ldquo;To thine own self be true.&rdquo;  Unfortunately the remainder of the quotation does not apply.  His colleagues in the representation of the constituency, in the Labour Party, and Ministers in the Government&mdash;and not merely in this Government but in its predecessor's&mdash;will understand that Deputy Davin is always true to himself. Never once has that prevented Deputy Davin from being false to others if it suited Deputy Davin's turn.  Therefore, I say, why should I ask if Deputy Davin, having succeeded in imposing this additional £2,000,000 of taxation, will come out and complain about the high rates of taxation and the high cost of living?  Of course in these circumstances Deputy Davin will complain about the high taxation and the high cost of living, because it is Deputy Davin's nature and character to do so.</P>
      <P>I have said that unless the concession in regard to the land annuities is withdrawn with, of course, the consent of the overwhelming majority of the farmers, it is not possible to derate agricultural land without increasing taxation.  I have asked the House to recall how in former years the Opposition used to condemn, as unwarranted, the imposition of taxation which was necessary to provide for improved and new social services. Of course, we did not heed that cry then, and the public conscience endorsed our attitude in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the people decided that taxation for public purposes was fully justifiable, because it was for social services, should not induce us, however, to forget that taxation, to be endurable, must have its basis either in social justice or national necessity. Taxes may be imposed and the yield of these taxes may justly be taken for the public exchequer, if it is taken for the common good of the whole community; if it be taken, for instance, in order to provide for the preservation of public health, for the education of the citizens, for the maintenance <Col N="1433" /> of public peace, the administration of justice, or the defence of national territory.  These are all works and services of national necessity to which, so far as it can be secured by the methods of the ordinary work-a-day world, each citizen should contribute according to his means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that we should be justified in taking from those who have much for those who have little or nothing, but such taxation would be based on the principle of social justice, a principle that teaches us to feed the hungry and clothe the naked. Now is this demand for derating founded either upon the basis of national necessity or social justice? Where is justification to be found for imposing that additional £2,000,000 of taxation which the Opposition in the last two days have been demanding? There are approximately 1,300,000 people occupied in gainful pursuits in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Out of every 130, 53 on the average may be classified as farmers or assisting on farms.  The House must bear in mind that most of these are property owners, relatives of property owners, or prospective property owners, and the remaining 77 out of the 130 are members of the community who do not own or occupy land.  In fact, most of them own nothing, except perhaps the clothes on their backs, and sometimes, but only sometimes, the furniture in their houses, often only the room in which, as the fruit of centuries of <Col N="1434" /> neglect, they are condemned to live. The proposal of the Opposition, and, of course, of Deputy Davin, with qualifications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;looked at broadly, without any qualification, is to impose an enormous burden, in the first place, upon a non-land-owning class, and, in the second place, upon the poorer land-owning class, in order to help those who own the best lands in this country, and own them in large holdings.</P>
      <P>It is true that the taxation to be imposed would not be confined only to those who have no property in land. Of necessity, those who own land would have to bear a share of that taxation, but the burden would not be equitably distributed even amongst those who own land.  The small landowner would have to be taxed in order to relieve the big man, and to relieve most the landowner who, while he may in present circumstances produce the greatest amount of wealth for himself, at the same time employs comparatively few persons on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how derating would operate in the case of small farmers. If the £2,000,000 which we should have to find were to be found, say, by increasing the sugar duty, an increase of 2¼d. per lb. would not suffice for the purpose, because if we increased the price of sugar to as much even as 5d. per lb., there would be a serious decline in consumption.  Accordingly, if we were to get £2,000,000 out of sugar, we should not be safe in putting the increase in the excise and customs duties at less than 2½d. in the lb., and that would make the price of sugar 5¾d. or 6d., whichever Deputies choose to take.  Allowing for the decrease in consumption, which would arise from the increased price, we may assume that the average quantity of sugar consumed per head of the population would fall to about 70 lbs. per year, so that the consumption in the average household of five persons would amount to 350 lbs. per year.  An increase, therefore, of 2½d. per lb. in the sugar duty, would mean in each household that the outlay on sugar would be £3 13s. per annum.  Let us <Col N="1435" /> ask ourselves who would pay that £3 13s. per annum.  Large farmers, of course, might possibly pay a little more, because their houses are larger, and they are able to employ more servants than the small or medium farmers. Small farmers would pay, possibly, more than the average amount, because, as a rule, the size of their households and the numbers of children in them are above the average. Agricultural labourers and landless men would pay that £3 13s.  Every poverty-stricken person in the community would pay it and, of course, Deputy Davin, who wants derating, and is not merely the light but sometimes the delight of the Labour Party, wants that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin wants the small man, the landless man, the agricultural labourer, the unemployed, the poor and the needy, to pay taxes so that the large landowner and the rancher, as I have heard the Deputy describe them, should be derated.  Let us see the extent of the injustice, because it must be plain to the House that the proposal which the Deputy made, when examined in that form, is an unjust proposal.  Let us see the extent of that injustice even as between the farmers themselves.  Of the holdings in this country 74 per cent. are of £20 valuation or under, and the average rates payable upon farms which are in that category, a category which comprises 74 per cent. of the total holdings in this country, may be taken in round figures as £1 10s.; in some counties the figure may be larger than that, but on an average throughout the country the rates payable on holdings within the category of £20 valuation and under amount to £1 10s. per holding, and that applies to 74 per cent. of the farmers in this country.  Those farmers are not the most vocal.  They were not very vocal during the economic war.  They were those who helped us to win it.  If we agreed to derating they would get, in relief from rates, £1 10s., but they would have to pay in increased taxation no less than <Col N="1436" /> £3 13s., and they would lose, on the balance, 43/- per annum.  Forty-three shillings would be paid by the small farmer in order that the big man might be relieved of bearing his fair share of the cost of the public services, which benefit him just as much as they benefit the poor man, and, possibly, in some cases, benefit him a great deal more.</P>
      <P>The position of the small farmer is bad enough, but what about the position of the agricultural labourer?  He owns no land.  He would make no saving on the rates, but, out of his &ldquo;poor and narrow pittance of 27/- a week&rdquo;, when he is working, and out of his unemployment assistance when he is not working, he would be called upon to find, in round figures, 1/5 per week in order that his employer, whether his constant employer or part-time employer, his much-better-off employer, should be relieved of some share of the burden of the public services. That is the proposal that has been put up to us, and it will apply not merely to 74 per cent. of the farmers of this country and to all agricultural labourers, but to the dwellers in the small towns.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan was the first person to raise this issue of derating in this debate.  In the same speech he was very plaintive indeed about the hard plight of the small towns.  He talked about them looking like continental <i>plages</i> in the off-season, with their shutters up and the houses looking decrepit and derelict, and yet the Deputy who was pleading for the small towns, in the same speech advocated a proposal which would impose an additional burden of £3 13s. per annum on every householder in those towns, not only on such prosperous shopkeepers as there might be in those towns, but on every family in the back lanes and slums of those towns.  And Deputy Davin!  Deputy Davin, as a member of the Labour Party who wants social justice, gets up and stands shoulder to shoulder with Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan in making that iniquitous demand.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I can have it out on the Estimate for my Department.  I am asking, what justice or equity could there be in a proposal such as I have outlined?  It is quite clear that derating could only be granted in our present circumstances upon such conditions as would be disadvantageous, not merely to the poor in the urban areas, to the landless men and the agricultural labourer, but to 74 per cent. of the farmers as well, and it was on this ground that the Derating Commission rejected the proposal in 1931.  Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Brennan, of course, do not admit that.  They have gone back upon their policy in 1931.  The commission which investigated this matter very carefully, with a great deal of pains and, I am sure, with a cool, impartial judgment, spending a long time upon it, turned down this proposal in 1931.</P>

      <P>It reflects certainly &mdash;I do not believe creditably&mdash;upon the Government which appointed that commission, upon the late Minister for Agriculture, upon the other members of the Government, upon the Deputy's own leader, upon the Deputy's own colleagues, and it reflects also upon those who sat on the commission. I do not believe, at any rate, that the Government had decided that they would not grant derating, and that they were setting up this commission as a blind, merely to impose upon the credulous farmers who were supporting them at that time.  Whatever the attitude of the then Government may have been in regard to derating.  I certainly do not think that those who took the pains and the care to investigate that problem as fully as they did investigate it, as is shown by that report and by every line of that report, had prejudged it</P>

Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Brennan say that it was not because the proposal was inequitable. But mark you the grounds upon which they allege the proposal was rejected. It was because, as they say, in 1931 the farmers were prosperous.  What an ungrateful lot the farmers of Ireland must have been in 1932! In 1931 the <Col N="1439" /> farmers under the Cosgrave régime were prosperous and in 1932 they discarded the men who had brought them prosperity.</P>

      <P>At any rate this report was signed in 1931 and it was on the merits or demerits on that date that it was rejected.  Deputy Cosgrave trying to make the case for the <i>volte face</i> which has taken place, for the political somersault in which the Opposition is now engaged, said that the commission could not report in favour of derating in 1931 because the farmers at that time were prosperous. The Deputy referred to certain figures. For instance he said that in 1926 the farmers owned 27 per cent. of the moneys on deposit in our banks and that in 1929 they owned 29 per cent. of those moneys.  That is to say in 1926 the bank deposits belonging to the farmers amounted to 27 per cent. and the remaining 73 per cent. of these deposits belonged to the rest of the community.  In 1929, according to the report of the commission, about 29 per cent of these deposits belonged to the farmers and 71 to the rest of the community.  That is what Deputy Cosgrave said.  I read just a few weeks ago a statement from a very authoritative source&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is to say that, while in 1929 when the wave of prosperity must have been at its height, the Irish farmers owned 27 per cent. of the deposits in Irish banks and the rest of the community 73 per cent., according to this authority, which I am prepared to accept, the farmers' share of the deposits in 1936 had risen to 39 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Gorey has forgotten the good character I gave him.  I should be surprised, very seriously surprised, if there had not been some increase in the farmers' savings, taking them broadly.  I do not mean to say that every farmer saved money.  I am perfectly certain a lot of farmers lost, a lot of them, but if any reliance can be placed on the figures given, in the first instance, in the report of the Derating Commission and the figures which were published a couple of months ago in a newspaper, broadly it would seem that the general mass of the farmers have managed to come through the economic war fairly successfully.  I do not want to talk in superlatives, but I would be surprised if that were not a fact, because figures which are in our possession and which we have got from year to year&mdash;the returns for the Post Office Savings Bank deposits and for Savings Certificates&mdash;show <Col N="1444" /> that, whereas in 1931-32 the figures for savings held in those ways amounted to £13,119,000, for 1937-38 they had gone up to £21,369,000.  Of course, the Savings Banks are found all over the country, and Savings Certificates are sold all over the country, and these deposits must belong in some part to members of the rural community and the remainder similarly belong to those who live in urban areas.</P>
      <P>In any event, there has not been anything like the serious deterioration in the economic position of any section of the community that Deputies who have been clamouring for derating and making a poor wail about the farmers' conditions would have us believe. I think they are doing small credit to the farmers.  I would not like to think that the farmers of Ireland would care to see their representatives standing up here like a lot of banshees wailing for the coming demise of the Irish farmers.  The farmers of Ireland are men who stood up during the economic war, and they put this Government in power during that economic war, and while I think they would like us to do as much as we possibly could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us, however, again consider the position.  In 1931 the farmers could not get derating, because in 1929 they owned 29 per cent. of the deposits in the Irish banks. That is what Deputy Cosgrave said. How is Deputy Cosgrave now going to justify his advocacy of derating, which he refused when the farmers had only 29 per cent. of the deposits&mdash;how is he going to justify his advocacy now when the farmers hold 39 per cent. of the deposits?  In 1931 the farmers were paying the full 20/- in the £ of the agreed land purchase annuities.  To-day they are paying only 10/- in the £.</P>

Last year the sugar factories produced over 80,000 tons of beet sugar and the cost of that production to the Exchequer was £900,000, all of it going to the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, in 1931 they had no guaranteed price for butter and nothing, as everybody must recall, was being done for the dairying industry in that year.  Our ports were open to the agricultural products of the world.  Danish butter.  Siberian butter, Chinese bacon, Chinese eggs&mdash; all these things were coming in in 1931, and all that is ended now.  Whatever is consumed in this country in the way of dairy products, as well as a large part of our wheat consumption, all our eggs, all our poultry, all our beef and all our mutton&mdash;all these are Irish produce, produced by the Irish farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me go back over this again, because I think it will be seen that what is really responsible for the condition of deep melancholia which seems to afflict the Opposition, and particularly the farmer members of it, is that they still think that, not merely are they living in the last six years, but that they are back again in 1931.  Let us remember, however, that the plight of the Irish farmers in 1931 was not an enviable one, and I want to bring home to the members of the Opposition the difference between 1937-38 and 1931.  First of all, they pay only one half of the annuities they were paying in 1931.  The beet growing which then cost the Exchequer £57,000 has now been so developed that it is costing £900,000.  In 1931, farmers were being <Col N="1448" /> driven out of tillage; to-day, tillage has been made profitable.  Deputy Gorey himself had admitted that, because he told us that, in his view, 50 per cent. of the farming community which had done well out of the economic war were those who were engaged in growing wheat and beet and, in general, those who had adopted and followed the tillage policy of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>And in smuggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that, possibly, we might be something worse off in that regard than we were in 1931, but I think that, on a calm examination, when he reads his statements in regard to that phenomenon the Deputy will agree that his arguments are not tenable.  However, let me go on.  I said that in 1931 the farmers were being driven out of tillage, and that now tillage was profitable. In 1931 the dairying industry was in a state of collapse; to-day it is thriving.  In 1931 foreign farmers were competing with the Irish farmer for his own market in practically every commodity which the Irish farmer produced.  To-day, that cutthroat competition no longer exists, and the Irish market belongs to the Irish farmer, and he has as good a place in the British market, as I said before, as he ever had.  In short, in every way the position of the Irish farmer to-day is much better than it was in 1931.  I do not say that it is as good as it should be or as it will be, but, at any rate, it is very much better than it was in 1931.  Every impartial individual whom you meet in the country to-day will admit the truth of that statement.  There has been talk of derating, as I have said, and yet in 1931 the Derating Commission reported that it could not find any justification for derating.  How much less justification is there for it to-day.  I had intended to go more into this subject, but I have been talking longer that I had meant to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been better if the Minister had said nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I shall talk only a little longer.  I was going to say that I wished to discuss one proposal which was made by a Deputy which, I think, was even more outrageous than that proposed by the leader of the Opposition, and that was a proposal to derate urban property. I understand that that proposal was made by a Deputy in this debate, and I think it could only have been made because those who advocate derating in one form or another do not realise the fact that, however we may look upon the question of derating, one thing that must be kept in mind is that rates are borne, in the main, by the owners of property, and that a demand for general derating simply means that you lift the burden off the backs of those who are fortunate enough to have property, whether in the form of land or houses, and transfer it, or a very large part of that burden, to the backs of those who have no property.</P>
      <P>However, as I said, it is later than I had anticipated, and I do not intend to examine at length this problem of urban derating, but there is one proposal that I think I should not sit down without touching upon, and that was the proposal that credit should be provided in some way for farmers at low rates of interest.  I wonder has anybody ever considered what that would entail, and whether it could possibly be administered.  I would like to have a practical scheme discussed here in the House as to what its effect might be.  I heard a farmer say to-day, and I agree, that the great majority of hard-pressed farmers&mdash;the farmers who are virtually down-and-out&mdash;are in that condition by reason of unwise liabilities which they contracted, either on their own behalf or on behalf of other people, in regard to loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Bosh!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;unwise&rdquo;, and the Deputy can call it &ldquo;bosh&rdquo; if he likes to do so, but everybody knows what a millstone it is for a farmer to have raised money on loan in times of comparative prosperity, as the great majority of Irish farmers did in the <Col N="1450" /> years 1919 and 1920, and then to have to carry that liability through the depression.  The only ones who came through that depression were those who were wise enough in their generation not to over-borrow on a boom. However, in this connection, are Deputies aware how much money was advanced on loan to the Irish farmers? I had some calculations made in that regard before the last election, as a matter of fact, so that I might be in a position to examine some of the proposals in the Fine Gael programme. The amount cannot be much less than £15,000,000&mdash;that is, the amount which the banks have advanced to Irish farmers.  Now, that is money advanced to credit-worthy farmers.  Of course, some farmers are not so credit-worthy now as they were at the time when advances were made and, as a result, some of these advances might be regarded as frozen loans.  There might be about 70,000 farmers who were able to get loans but there might be another 15,000 who have not been able to get loans.  Then again, there are many other farmers who have not wanted loans, because they have been in a prosperous financial position and have been able to finance their farming all the time&mdash;farmers who, if they could get their money out of their farming and invest it, or take a turn on the stock exchange, could make money and get even.  With the way markets are going at present, one might make money even when there is a fall, as well as a rise.  At any rate, you would have the 70,000 to consider in the first place, and then you would have an additional few thousand&mdash;I do not know how many it might be&mdash;of people who have not been able to get money from the banks.  Then there are others who, if they thought they were able to get money, at, say, 3 per cent. or 3½ per cent. from the Government&mdash;and what a temptation that is, for we all know how difficult it may be on occasions for the Government to enforce its rights in regard to loans as, for instance, our experience in regard to the fishery loans&mdash;might come along and say: &ldquo;Why should I sink my money in my farm, when I can get money at 3 per cent. from the Government, and can put my <Col N="1451" /> own money into an industrial investment, and even though I might be getting 5 or 6 or 10 per cent. on it in the farm, in any event, if I can get money to replace it at 3 per cent. from the Government I can make a 3 per cent. profit on my own money by investing it in this way.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, then, would be the problem: that every man who had been able to get money from the bank, and every man who had not been able to get money from a bank, and every man who did not want money from a bank would come along and want a Government loan.  And how could anybody be refused?  Are we to have a whole corps of investigators?  We have heard, on some of the Estimates here, the complaint made that too many officials are poking their noses into the farmers' business.  If we are to avoid that, we cannot make fish of one and flesh of another in regard to this matter of Government loans. Every man who came for a loan would have to get one.  He would have to get as much as he demanded, and we could not make too many bones about an investigation.  What would be the financial problem which the Government would have to face, and what would be the financial problem which the banks would have to face when this money was thrown back into them? What was going to be the problem of the bank depositors when this money was thrown back on the banks, and when no use could be found for it? First of all, you would be in this position, that the Government would have to find an enormous sum and suffer a very heavy continuous loss for a considerable number of years&mdash;a loss that I could not put a price on, but it might be £1,000,000 or more.  And, remember, you could not refuse any person a loan under these circumstances. Deputy Gorey, who would not want a loan in normal circumstances, would have to get it if he demanded it, and even the person whom I have heard Deputy Gorey describe as a wastrel&mdash;the person who, he says, neither works nor wants work &mdash;he would have to get his loan.  How are you going to discriminate?  You <Col N="1452" /> could not discriminate between sections of farmers.  And, further, who is going to administer it?  We hear a lot of talk about the number of officials.  We have heard it said that the cost of the Civil Service has gone up by nearly £1,000,000.  How many officials, do you think, would you require to administer a scheme of that sort if the Government was going to stand up as the milch cow for every man, who owned a bit of land in the country, to come and have his draw out of it?</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the first people to clamour for a cessation of that state of affairs would be the honest working farmers of the country, because they would very quickly realise that where there was easy money to be got, once people got it, they were not going to use it properly.  That conclusion is based upon the experience of every person who ever had to deal with money.  If money can be got easily it will be wasted and misused, so that when we talk about loans for farmers we might as well say gifts for farmers.  That means taking the money out of the farmer's right-hand pocket and putting it into his left-hand pocket, because, as we are so often told, the farmers bear a very large share of the cost of government.  I have kept the House at great length, but I am grateful for the patient hearing which I have had, even from Deputy Keating, under great provocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in protest against the policy in operation in the Office of Public Works for the past few years, especially in connection with the general standard of wages and conditions under minor relief schemes.  The general standard of wages set up under these schemes of 24/- a week, as the basic rate, has been rightly condemned not only from these benches but from benches in other parts of the House.  It is true that from the Fianna Fáil Benches we have heard apologies with regard to these rates, but I think it is safe to say that even on the Fianna Fáil Benches there is no great enthusiasm with regard to this standard of 24/- a week for relief schemes.  We have been told that that standard is based on the rate for agricultural labourers laid down by the Wages Board, which has now been changed to 27/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance this evening referred to the poor pittance of 27/- a week paid to agricultural labourers, but at the same time we have this standard of 24/- a week, which is a much poorer pittance, on relief schemes.  I do not see in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary any indication that there is to be any rise in the low standard fixed for minor relief schemes to bring it up even to the poor pittance of 27/- a week; there is no indication that he thinks the time has arrived when this 24/- a week should in some way appertain to the standard now in operation for agricultural workers.  We are told that the general low standard of wages on those minor relief schemes is based on the agricultural wages paid in this country. We had a wage of 32/- a week paid on the Rhynana scheme.  It can hardly be contended that the work on that scheme is in any way akin to agricultural labour.  The whole conduct of that scheme, with the spontaneous up-rising against the bad conditions and bad wages associated with it, will, I think, be sufficient to brand the work of the Parliamentary Secretary as being akin to that of the people who at one time in this country attempted to set standards of low wage rates for workers.  Not only were the ordinary relations between employers and employees <Col N="1454" /> disregarded by the Parliamentary Secretary in the case of the Rhynana workers, but every canon of Christianity and Christian principles was also disregarded.  I suppose in the ordinary affairs between employers and employees when a strike is threatened or when it has taken place, it is usual for the employer to discuss the claims made with the employees. In this case, not alone were the relations which usually exist between employers and employees disregarded, but even the Government Departments, which usually set themselves the task of bringing the workers and employers together, sat idly by while the unfortunate workers at Rhynana were being starved into submission.  That, in itself, furnishes sufficient reason for support of this motion to refer back the Estimate.  It cannot be too frequently stressed that it was the wages and the general position of the workers on that scheme which caused this spontaneous uprising.  The Parliamentary Secretary may pride himself on the fact that he has got a victory, but the victory is not solely to the Parliamentary Secretary. Bad conditions and bad wages for workers in this Christian State have had a victory also.</P>
    <P>I pass from that to the general principle underlying these minor relief schemes.  We have this device of minor relief schemes, with a rotational system of employment, as the principal means of relieving unemployment.  We heard a good deal during the debate on the Budget with regard to the promises made in 1931 and 1932.  I can clearly recollect some of the promises made in 1932.  We heard then from Fianna Fáil platforms that not alone should unemployment be relieved in this country but that unemployment should be abolished.  I have read in some of the records of this House statements by members of the then Opposition&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; that there was no difficulty about the abolition of unemployment, and ways and means were shown of doing it.  It seems now that the Fianna Fáil Party have fallen back on this device of minor relief schemes, with the rotational system of employment.  In these schemes there is no conception of <Col N="1455" /> Christian standards.  It is simply an exploitation of the want and misery of the unfortunate people who have to man these schemes.</P>
    <P>The wage laid down to provide a standard of living on this scheme in this Christian State is 24/- per week. Figures have been given by other speakers to show that it is very far below even the starvation standards that obtain in other countries.  Even the ordinary necessaries of life cannot be purchased for the average family on 24/- per week.  Yet, this is the Government's principal means of relieving unemployment. We hear no talk about abolishing unemployment.  In these schemes, first preference is given to married men&mdash;rightly so.  We are told by the Parliamentary Secretary that many men on those schemes are not able, owing to deterioration of their powers, to obtain ordinary employment. While preference is given to married men, I know that in many cases single men have been completely ignored.  In certain districts no provision was made for the employment of single men.</P>

      <P>I have known single men who have not got work in any form on some of these relief schemes. This seems to be the only method we have to solve the unemployment problem. We are told that the wage of 24/- per week is based on the agricultural wage standard, and that it cannot be increased because we have not the money.  Lack of money is supposed to be the stumbling block.  We have included in the Budget £425,000 to pay interest and sinking fund in respect of the new loan for the first year.  That money will be obtained quite easily.  We have had a great deal of talk about social justice during the last three or four hours, but, when it comes to doing social justice to one of the weaker classes of the community the necessary money cannot be found.  We have no difficulty in finding the £425,000 to pay the charges on this loan which we are raising to pay England what we owe her, but we <Col N="1456" /> cannot afford to pay more than 24/- to the workers on this scheme.</P>
      <P>I do not place all the blame on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance for this state of affairs.  I blame every member of the Government and every member of the Fianna Fáil Party who stands behind this treatment of the workers.  The Parliamentary Secretary should not be saddled with all the blame.  He is simply the spokesman or the tool of the Government Party.  That is where we materially differ with the Government Party.  We regard the human being as possessing a body and soul.  In these minor relief schemes the workers are regarded as mere cogs in the wheel, to be used for the purpose of impressing the people with the numbers in employment.  There is no regard for the economic needs of these people, and no regard for their family needs.  There is no regard for their position as citizens, and still we are told we are living in a Christian State under a Christian Constitution. The guilt for this state of affairs must be shared by every member of the Government Party.  They are responsible for the low standard of wages and the bad conditions on the minor relief schemes.  There is no talk now about abolishing unemployment. This, we are told, is the way to relieve unemployment.  It is a mere palliative&mdash;to make the unemployed a class apart, to brand them with the brand of this degrading rotational system by which they go round in a circle.  In my constituency we had, in Sallybrook Mills, a number of people in constant employment.  Owing to the rapacity of the owners of the mill, these people were thrown out of employment and the mill was closed down.  The Government, with all the powers it could assume, was not able to keep that mill going.  Some of the workers filled up the quota on these minor relief schemes, but a great many of them are now across in England. That is the effort made by the Government to relieve unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we cannot emphasise too much, or too often, the standard of wages and conditions on these relief schemes under the rotational system.  We had quite recently at the Cork Harbour Board a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary that the work on a scheme carried out under these conditions was as good and the output as valuable as if it were done under any other system.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary would not say anything else? Anybody who takes the trouble to think over the position and to examine it, however, will agree that the work could not be as good.  After all, men working on this three days or four days a week system have not, and could not have, the same interest in their work as men who are constantly employed at a decent wage.  They do their best.  I have seen them working and I give them credit for it, but I say that the work turned out could not be as satisfactory as work done by men working constantly under trade union conditions of labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer also to another item in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement with regard to school buildings. I say very definitely that there is undue delay in the erection and renovation of school buildings and I want to know what is the cause of that delay.  Children are now compelled by law to go to school and parents are prosecuted if they do not send them to school, but look at some of the schools they have to go to.  I have known cases of school buildings into which it is criminal to compel children to go.  They are huddled in insanitary, unhygienic buildings, which, if they ever served the purpose of a school building, have long since lost the right to that title. While a good deal has been done, we have from the Parliamentary Secretary the very startling fact that the work on school buildings appears to <Col N="1458" /> be slowing down.  I shall quote the figures.</P>
    <P>He says that the object of the Office of Public Works has been to expend as much of the money allocated for schools as possible.  In 1932-33, the provision was £88,000, and expenditure £65,774.  Roughly, £14,000 were left over.  In 1933-34 the provision was £90,000, and expenditure £100,000. Actually £10,000 more was spent than was allotted.  In 1934-35, the provision was £122,000, and expenditure £128,538. Again, more was spent than was provided. In 1935-36, the provision was £200,000, and expenditure £127,000. Actually £73,000 were left over, although in the previous year £6,000 more were spent, and in the previous year £10,000 more were spent.  Yet we have these schools that I complain of. In 1936-37, the provision was £200,000, and the expenditure £133,000.  In that year £68,000 were left over.  In 1937-38 the provision was the same, and expenditure went up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I shall give you credit for everything you have done.  It went up from £132,000 to £150,000.</P>

      <P>£159,000, I think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, £159,000.  The point I want to make is that for those years there were large sums of money lying unexpended, while the country was crying out for the renovation of existing buildings and the erection of new buildings.  Unless the Parliamentary Secretary can bring forward a very good reason for this state of affairs, I must come to the conclusion that he puts a very low value on child life in this country.  I have known cases where diphtheria and other diseases have been rife amongst children, owing principally to bad sanitation and bad hygienic conditions in the schools.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there has been any recent gerneral increases in fares by the Dublin United Tramways CCompany.  I am aware, however, that certain uneconomic and anomalous fares&mdash;a legacy from the conditions of unregulated competition in passenger road transport which recent legislation was designed to abolish&mdash; have been adjusted both upwards and downwards on a small proportion of the <Col N="1310" /> routes operated by the company and for some only of the stages of those routes; and that wholly uneconomic return fares on about a dozen routes have been withdrawn.  I cannot agree that the revised fares will inflict hardship on any section of the community, and from the information availble to my Department I am satisfied that the necessity for a formal inquiry into the question of fares generally odes not arise.</P>
