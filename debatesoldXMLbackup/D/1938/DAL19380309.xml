      <P>In the period referred to three definite schemes were submitted to me by the Waterford Corporation which provided for the erection of 70, 28 and 13 houses respectively. I accorded sanction to the schemes of 70 and 28 houses but sanction has not yet been given to the scheme of 13 houses.  The plans respecting this scheme reached the Department on 19th ultimo and are at present being examined.  The corporation have also been authorised to acquire compulsorily 12 acres, 3 roods and 26 perches of land on which it is proposed to erect approximately 140 houses.  Negotiations are proceeding for the acquisition of a further 9 acres for the erection of about 86 houses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan (for Mr. Brasier)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the total failure of the salmon fishing industry in County Cork and if in view of the widespread distress prevailing amongst fishermen, he is prepared to extend the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Act to this deserving class who depend for their living throughout the year on the results of a short seasonal fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the results from salmon fishing fluctuate from year to year and that the results in the year 1937 were poor.  With regard to the second part of the question the position is that fishermen are already entitled to the benefits provided by the Unemployment Assistance Acts on precisely the same conditions as other classes, and I have no power to provide any exceptional treatment for them under the Acts.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned the year 1937. Is he not aware that the season for 1938 has been, so far, almost a complete blank?  Does he not think that there should be differentiation between these fishermen and the other classes that he refers to in his reply, for the reason that these men have been working, some of them since the beginning of February, and have earned nothing, but, because they have been working on these boats on the share system, they are being deprived of the benefits of the Unemployment Assistance Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises, I am sure, that unemployment assistance means unemployment assistance, and that these men, when they are working, cannot be regarded as being unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is, of course, aware that this question has been raised frequently. It has been urged here that there should be differentiation, in cases of this kind, between the words &ldquo;earning&rdquo; and &ldquo;working.&rdquo;  That is the whole difficulty.  It is much more severe on a man to be working and not earning than to be wholly unemployed.  It would surely be much more charitable to extend the benefits of the Unemployment <Col N="635" /> Assistance Act to men who are doing something to earn a living, and who, as in the present case for the reasons stated, have failed completely to do so, than to those who make no effort whatever to earn a living for themselves.</P>

In view of the answer to the second part of the question, the third part of the question does not arise.  The answer to the fourth part of the question is in the negative.  The answer to the fifth part of the question is in the affirmative. The amount included in the Estimate for the current year is £400. As regards the sixth part of the question, the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1885, was continued in force by Article 73 of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann and adapted under the provisions of the Adaptation of Enactments <Col N="637" /> Act, 1922.  Article 50 of the Constitution of Éire provides that those provisions should continue to be of full force and effect.  The form referred to in the seventh part of the question was not drafted in October, 1937.  The form is merely a reprint obtained at that time of the form previously in use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in calculating the service for superannuation purposes of Mr. Thomas Fitzgerald, Lower Regent Street, Muinebeag, who was retired on age grounds from the Ordnance Survey Department in 1936, a deduction of seven and a half years was made from his service; whether he is aware that Mr. Fitzgerald retired on a pension of approximately £25 per year and whether, in view of his long and satisfactory service in the Department, he will restore the deduction from service with a view to increasing the present inadequate pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Service for pension in this case was reckoned in accordance with the practice which has been observed in the ordnance survey since 1906.  On retirement, Mr. Fitzgerald had only five and a half years of actual established service, but he was allowed to reckon half his previous reckonable unestablished service of 15 years, which enabled a pension to be granted to him on 13 years' service.  In view of the well-established practice governing the reckoning of service for pension in the ordnance survey a concession of the nature indicated by the Deputy cannot be made.</P>

      <P>Could not the Minister give some picture of the sources from which the claims have been received and the manner in which decisions are being given in relation to the sources from which the claims have been received?  There is considerable dissatisfaction, as the Minister may know, because it has been expressed in the Press, because it is felt that applicants from certain areas are getting preference over applicants from other areas.  I want to get some information on that matter so that I may be able to judge whether or not statements of that kind are correct.

      <P>The grant of salary was withdrawn from the assistant teacher in question as from 30th June, 1930, as the average attendance for each of the two preceding quarters failed to reach the minimum required under the regulations for his continued recognition.</P>
      <P>(1) My Department has no information as to the number of pupils whose names were struck off the rolls of the school during the school year ended 30th June, 1930.  (2) The terms of the medical certificate furnished were not such as would warrant any concession in the matter of the average attendance required under the regulations for the continued recognition of an assistant teacher in a national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> (3) The Department has no information as to the number of pupils available for admission to the school on the 30th June, 1930.  (4) One of the remaining assistants retired on pension on 30th September, 1930.  Two new assistants were appointed by the manager on the 6th October, 1930.  Recognition could only be given to one of these new appointments, and that in a provisional capacity only, under Rule 83 (c) on that date, inasmuch as the average for the June quarter, 1930, was below the figure for the appointment of even a 13th assistant.  Later on, when it was found that an average of 651 units was secured for December quarter, 1930, recognition was given to the second of these appointees, because the average for the preceding calendar year (1929), as well as the average for December quarter, 1930, exceeded 635 units.  Both these appointments were, therefore, ratified when the average for December quarter, 1930, was available. (5).  If the teacher in question had continued to give regular and efficient service as assistant teacher from 1st July, 1930, to 31st March, 1937, exclusive of the period of 18 months' temporary service, he would have received approximately £1,900.  (6) Under the regulations, appointments of teachers are made by the managers.  Representations have been received in the Department on behalf of the teacher concerned with a view to securing for him alternative employment, but it has not been found possible for the Department to do very much for him. The appointment of teachers rests with the local managers.  He is not eligible to have his name included in the diocesan panel, as teachers who lost their positions owing to decline in average prior to January, 1931, are not eligible for inclusion in the panel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has been already informed, the Land Commission, in fixing the price of untenanted land acquired for division, are bound to take as their basis the provisions of Section 25, sub-section (2) of the Land Act, 1923, by which &ldquo;regard shall be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I can now amplify this information by explaining that, in practice, the Land Commission assess the value of the land on the basis of a fee simple property.  From such value there has to be deducted the redemption value of any land purchase annuity on the land and also the value of any drainage maintenance rate, if applicable. In cases where there is no land purchase annuity payable but a head rent or superior charge or mortgage is secured on the land, the capitalised value thereof would be deducted from the purchase price of the land on an allocation schedule when the land bonds representing the price are distributed by order of the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's three questions relative to the division of lands in the Kilcock area, and the selection of allottees therefor.  The primary duty of the Land Commission is the relief of congestion in the most necessitous areas, and it is frequently necessary for this purpose to migrate landholders from districts where untenanted land is not available to other districts where land can be acquired, in order that the vacated holdings may be used to enlarge neighbouring small farms.  The Land Commission endeavour to exercise their powers of migration with the minimum of disappointment to local applicants for land, and all claims are duly considered&mdash;particularly claims from accredited members of the Old I.R.A., which are specially noted.  In the division of the Aylmer estate to <Col N="647" /> which the Deputy refers, all the local small holders were provided for; a holding was given to a former herd on the estate, and 15 landless men were provided with holdings, in addition to the holdings given to two local migrants and one migrant from County Galway (who surrendered in exchange his three former holdings).  With the approval of the Land Commission, an allottee subsequently exchanged the holding given him for another.  The exchange facilitated the Land Commission as well as the allottee.  Schemes of division are being prepared for the lands of Pitchfordstown, on the Hannon estate, and the lands of Newtown, on the Carr estate, but it is not yet possible to state when the division will be made.</P>

      <P>The statement of ownership filed in the estate of Mrs. Sarah Geraldine Foley-Turpin and Mrs. Constance Ritter, Record No. S.3991 County Cork, comprises both tenanted and untenanted land.  The tenanted land became vested in the Land Commission on 1st November, 1931, the appointed day, under Section 9 of the Land Act, 1931.  The untenanted land has not become vested in the Land Commission, nor has a price been fixed therefor.  The purchase price of the tenanted land is £1,066, payable in 4½ per cent. land bonds.  Title to the purchase price was lodged on 3rd February, 1936, and rulings on the title were issued by the Examiner of Title to the solicitors for the owners on 8th April, 1936.  The rulings on title have now been discharged and the draft allocation schedule has been settled by the Examiner.  It remains for the solicitors for the owners to bring in the allocation schedule and have the dates fixed for vouching by the Examiner and allocation before the Judicial Commissioner.  Allocation of the purchase price is exclusively a matter for the Judicial Commissioner. Interest on land bonds representing the purchase price of an estate sold under the Land Acts, 1923 to 1936. will not ordinarily be paid out before the allocation of the purchase money unless application be made as provided by Section 36 of the Land Act, 1931, and Order XI of the Provisional Rules.  No application for payment of interest on the land bonds pending allocation has been made in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan (for Mr. Brasier)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if in November, 1937, he received a petition from the farmers and residents of the sub-postal district of Donoughmore comprising 80 houses in the townlands of Pluckanes, Gurrane, Tornaught, Runkilla, Ballyvodane, Knockane and Firmount requesting a daily <Col N="652" /> postal delivery service, and if in view of the fact that in this area pig feeding is extensively carried on, and that the absence of a daily postal delivery causes considerable inconvenience and loss by the late delivery of letters after the period for delivery of pigs has expired, he is prepared to extend the delivery of letters daily to every district in the area.</P>

      <P>The petition referred to by the Deputy was duly received and acknowledged.  The provision of a delivery on each week-day in the townlands mentioned would entail substantial expense and the postal service in the area would in consequence be maintained at a loss.  In the circumstances, I regret that compliance with the request would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>I was answering Deputy Hogan's question.  As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance announced to-day, and as is generally known, there is labour trouble at Rhynana, and I take it that Deputy Hogan wishes to raise that matter to-day as a matter of urgency.  A couple of weeks ago it was agreed by all Parties that Private Deputies' time would not be taken for the present.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the Government were anxious that the Vote on Account should be passed without the normal discussion associated with it, and that there was a desire to accommodate the Government in that respect.  If other Parties were <Col N="656" /> prepared to agree, I understood that a certain time was to be made available for a discussion of Deputy Hogan's motion because it is of urgent public importance, having regard to the fact that approximately 600 men are on strike at Rhynana.  It ought to be possible for the Government to arrange business in such a way that, at 8 o'clock to-night, we might stop dealing with Government business and deal with Deputy Hogan's motion, and if that were disposed of before 10.30 p.m., resume the Government business then. If Government business is not finished to-night, surely the House could meet to-morrow for a short time, seeing that Deputies are in town, and finish such Government business as it is necessary to deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, at the end of Section 5, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The Board shall be liable for any rate levied by a council of any county, county borough or urban district or the commissioners of any town in respect of any fishery or fishing rights transferred and vested under the powers contained in subsections (1) and (2) of Section 5 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> On a previous occasion I endeavoured to make a case for this amendment. It is this: that the fisheries on the Shannon were exempt from rates payable to the local council.  The local rating authority did not get anything by way of rates from these fisheries, as these rates were struck and collected in some other way.  I pointed out that if that kind of thing continued in County Clare, the county council would find itself in the position that a great many things would be taken away from the valuation of the county, and the other ratepayers would find themselves having to pay an excessive amount because of the reduced amount of rates coming in.  I pointed out that the works at Ardnacrusha were exempt from rates, and that I had information that a proposed ammunition factory at Kilkishen was to be exempt from rates.  I stated that I was also informed that it was proposed to exempt Rhynana, the air base, from rates, and now it is proposed to exempt the fisheries from the rates that were paid in the past by the owners. I do not think it is right that a big corporation like the Electricity Supply Board should be exempt from the payment of rates to Clare County Council. At a meeting on Monday last, the county council expressed its opinion very strongly on this proposal, pointing out that it would be a gross injustice to the revenue of the county if this corporation were exempt from the ordinary operation of paying rates to the local authority for the maintenance of public services.  There is no reason whatever for such a proposal. If such a practice was to continue in respect of any of the works now being carried on in connection with Government or semi-Government institutions, local authorities would find themselves in a serious position.  I ask the Minister <Col N="660" /> to accept the amendment, so that further injustice will not be done to ratepayers in the county.  I notice that the Fisheries Act exempts for 12 years certain fisheries in the county.  Surely, Clare ought not be asked to bear all the burden of the irregularities and the injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept an amendment of this sort.  Listening to Deputy Hogan, one would imagine that the Shannon Scheme and the Electricity Supply Board were exempt from the payment of all rates.  The Electricity Supply Board is prepared to pay the same rates as were paid by the owners of fisheries that they have taken over.  If Deputy Hogan wanted an amendment dealing with the question of payment of rates, that amendment would be on a Bill to amend the Fisheries Act of 1925.  This Bill and the main Act of 1935 made no change in the liability of the Electricity Supply Board for the payment of rates.  If we were to introduce an amendment dealing with the payment of rates by the Electricity Supply Board into this particular measure, we would be asking the board to pay two kinds of rates, rates for fisheries as well as the portion for which the Electricity Supply Board have to pay rates to the boards of conservators.  The Electricity Supply Board is in exactly the same position as every other fishery owner in regard to the payment of rates.  Deputy Hogan's amendment is to get the Electricity Supply Board to pay rates to the county council as well as to the conservators, and we cannot accept that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 57, Section 10, to delete the words &ldquo;the board is satisfied&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;an arbitrator appointed by the Minister is satisfied&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; where it first occurs in line 58 to insert the words &ldquo;to the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The principle of this amendment was fully debated when the Bill was going through its Second Reading.  I have drafted it to implement the points I made on the Second Reading, and that Deputy Dillon and other Deputies made, that we could not accept the principle of an interested body being themselves empowered to deal with the matter of compensation in a question in dispute, which is practically what the section in the Bill amounts to.  Here we have certain bodies of people applying for compensation to the Electricity Supply Board, and the Electricity Supply Board are given discretion to decide themselves whether or not they are going to give compensation, or what the amount of the compensation will be.  I think that in that particular connection Deputy Hogan made a very relevant remark on the Second Reading, to the effect that, if you are going to give discretion to one party in a dispute, an equally good case could be made for giving discretion to the other party. One could make quite as good a case for giving discretion to the people who are looking for compensation as to the people who eventually will have to give it.  I do not say that either case would be very just, but at least it is quite relevant and is a very good argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, our principal objection to this section, as it stood, was that we could not at all accept the principle. It was bad enough, in certain Acts <Col N="663" /> that were passed through this House, that certain Ministers should be given very wide discretionary powers &mdash; some of us have objected to that particular discretion being given to Ministers &mdash; but here we have gone further than we have gone, to my knowledge, in any legislation that we have passed, recently at all events.  We have given discretion, in the very important matter of compensation, to the body that will themselves have to pay the compensation, to decide whether or not they will give it.  Without making any long speech on the matter, since it was fully debated on the other reading, I think that the House generally will not accept that principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not really until the debate on the Committee Stage had proceeded a considerable distance that the urgency of this amendment became manifest.  We objected altogether to the principle of allowing an interested party in a dispute to be the judge in that dispute; but when we came to discuss that principle, the Minister undertook to defend the position he had taken up, and his first line of defence was to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is highly likely that these people &mdash; these injured parties &mdash; will get a better deal from the Electricity Supply Board than they would get from an arbitrator, because it will be in the interest of the Electricity Supply Board to purchase their goodwill, and if they err at all, when they come to give an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant under the Bill, they will give an exceedingly generous grant because, in addition to allaying the ruffied feelings of the complainant, they want to bring him right over to their side.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is important to bear that statement of the Minister in mind.  The debate then proceeded, and it was suggested that this Section 10 was the Minister's own plan, and at column 551, in Vol. 70, No. 5, of the Official Debates, the Minister made the following statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I shall explain that this section did not initiate in the way suggested.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> That is, from the Minister.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An indication of the section was foreshadowed when the Electricity Supply Board approached me saying: &lsquo;Here are classes of people who, in our opinion, have a claim for compensation, but unfortunately we are debarred by law from making payments to them&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, the Electricity Supply Board came along and said, in effect: &ldquo;Some of these injured parties have kicked up such an infernal row that we want to buy them off, and we have not got statutory authority for doing so. Now, we want statutory authority to buy off the noisy ones, but as to the injured parties, who have no vested interests to speak for them, who have no eloquent advocate to speak for them, and who do not know how to make a nuisance of themselves, we do not want to do anything for them; but as to the fellows who have proved troublesome we want authority to buy them off.&rdquo;  Now, we are not so interested in the fellows who have proved troublesome.  We, in the Fine Gael Party, and those in the Labour Party also, I think, are interested in the unfortunate individuals who have wives and families and who find that, as a result of the operation of the electricity supply code, they have been deprived of an opportunity of earning their living, who have nobody to speak for them, and many of whom are simple people who do not know how to speak for themselves.  Now, we want to give an arbitrator the discretion that it is proposed to give to the Electricity Supply Board in Section 10, so that if these people come to us we can say to them: &ldquo;State your case in the simplest possible terms to this arbitrator who is set up, and if the merits generally of this are that, as a result of the Electricity Supply Act you have been deprived of your livelihood, he is here to direct the Electricity Supply Board to compensate you for that loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We want to open the door to every injured person.  Now we do not want to open the door to come in and rob the Electricity Supply Board.  All we want to do is to open the door to every injured person to come in to the <Col N="665" /> arbitrator appointed by the Minister and to tell his story to the arbitrator. If he can satisfy that arbitrator appointed by the Minister that he has a genuine grievance then the arbitrator shall have discretion to say that this man should get compensation and to fix the amount.  The Minister immediately wrapped the Cumann na nGaedheal flag around him and said that he is only following the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and nobody except the Cumann na nGaedheal Government is responsible. That is entirely irrelevant.  We are not talking about what the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did.  We are talking about what the Fianna Fáil Government will do.  They have come in to set a wrong right that could not be foreseen when the original Bills were going through.  That wrong is explained this way: no matter how carefully one drafts an Act of Parliament one is going to find that the cases that are not being provided for are very hard cases.  It is admitted that if you are going to fix strict terms of reference for any arbitrator, no matter how carefully you examine the fact, you will find that the possible development of strict terms of reference will eliminate certain deserving claims.  These are the notoriously hard cases of law.  The whole object of Section 10 and this amendment is to provide machinery to overcome that defective legislation, to open the door to hard cases; to give somebody a much wider discretion than is given in the ordinary terms of reference such as are ordinarily incorporated in an Act of Parliament, and possibly to devise some arrangement and machinery by which that discretion could be vested in the arbitrator appointed by the Minister rather than giving it to the Electricity Supply Board.  We say give the discretion to the arbitrator. He enjoys the Minister's confidence; he is a prudent person, an impartial person and a person who will do what is reasonable and just between the parties.  What conceivable objection can there be to that proposal?  Somebody has got to decide on the merits of these applications.  Under the terms of Section 10 as it stands any <Col N="666" /> person who is convinced he has a grievance can make representations to the board.  Anybody can apply to the board and the board then can or may examine that application and, in their own absolute discretion, without assigning reasons, may determine whether they are going to make an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment or not.  That is a most unsatisfactory arrangement. Our proposal is simply this: to allow the self same people envisaged by Section 10 to make representations to an independent man and within a reasonable limit of time let that independent man say to the board: &ldquo;In the circumstances I think the board ought to make payment to the following list of persons and the payments shall be so much in each of the several cases.&rdquo;  When that is done the business is finished.</P>
    <P>Now I think the purpose for which Section 10 is designed is a good one. I think one of the great defects of these schemes of rationalisation and rearrangement is the scruple that all of us must have about the hard cases. I would call to the memory of the House the very remarkable statement that was made by Deputy McGilligan when we were discussing the Insurance Bill where there arose cases claiming compensation.  On that occasion he said that he was responsible under some Transport Acts for providing strict terms of reference under which injured parties were to get compensation, and that since he left the Government and became a Deputy in Opposition and went to the Bar he came into personal contact with a number of applicants who had failed to get compensation under the terms of these Acts settled by himself.  He told us that his experience was that if he had to do the work again he would never allow any transaction of that kind to be carried through this House without provision for proper compensation to every person whose livelihood was destroyed by that legislation.  Now that is a very remarkable admission by a man who had long experience of this kind of legislation.  I think that particular statement was responsible for evoking this section.  If this section is passed with the amendment <Col N="667" /> that we propose and a reasonable time fixed under it for the aggrieved parties to come in and to allow a responsible person to examine these complaints in a detached way and to determine between the parties what claim the aggrieved person has upon the Electricity Supply Board then we are nearer to an agreed arrangement for settling matters of this kind than it is possible under any legislation to get. Where is the use in spoiling the ship for the ha'porth of tar?  If we are to do the job right then why spoil it for this trifle?  Whether we do it rightly or whether we do it wrongly the amount of money cannot be very great.  If we do the job right and if we find that this system of an official arbitrator to gather up the loose ends and deal with the hard cases in an equitable way unrestricted by statutory terms of reference, is a satisfactory way to wind up affairs of this kind, then we may have discovered the key for the solution of these problems that may arise under amalgamation cases in the future.  We know that there are Bills looming ahead of us in connection with amalgamation. Where there will be hard cases and where questions of compensation will arise would it not be splendid if in this Bill we devised a plan which would clear the consciences of all of us in regard to the hard cases?  If the House will accept this amendment then we can say that everything that could reasonably be done to meet such cases has been done.  The ship will not be spoiled for the ha'porth of tar, a reasonable gesture will be carried to its logical conclusion and justice will be done to all.  Where is the use of standing on a trifle of this kind and leaving a trail of dissatisfaction, annoyance and grievance behind us?  There is here provided a good solution.  If this amendment is passed no one is going to run amuck and there is an absolute certainty that reasonable men will feel that substantial justice has been done to all, including the hard cases.  Surely that is worth doing. Section 10 with the amendment will ensure that the ship will not be spoiled. <Col N="668" /> I very strongly appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this amendment, so that the whole House could combine with him in seeing that Section 10 looks after everybody in so far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the principle of the amendment. To my mind, on reading Section 10, the real difficulty is that these people who feel they have a grievance and who have to make their claim to the Electricity Supply Board, have to make that claim to one of the parties to the transaction.  Under the section as it stands you are asking one of the parties vitally concerned to adjudicate upon complaints made by people who have a grievance.  That is the position in which you are placing the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not think that anybody could argue that the insertion of the words in the amendment, suggesting the appointment of an arbitrator by the Minister, would interfere with the operation of Section 10, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be establishing a very good principle if this amendment were adopted.  In cases where a considerable principle is involved, where people feel they have a just grievance and ask for an amount of compensation to cover their losses, if that amount is to be determined by one of the parties interested, vitally interested, and if that party is to get the right of being the judge and jury in regard to what is to be allowed, then the position is most unfair.  I suggest that would be the position if this section were allowed to stand as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of an arbitrator by the Minister will enable people to come forward and prove their claims. They will have to be satisfied with the person appointed by the Minister, a person who is not bound by either of the parties to the dispute.  I think it would have been just as equitable to say in Section 10 that the people who are aggrieved should themselves come in and decide what compensation ought to be awarded to them&mdash;it would at least be just as equitable as to allow the Electricity Supply Board, one of the vitally interested parties, to decide for themselves what compensation <Col N="669" /> they will allow to people who feel they have had losses under the operation of legislation.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does not see fit to accept this amendment, I strongly urge on the House to adopt it.  I ask Deputies to establish the principle that in cases of this sort, where questions relating to loss of employment and earnings come into consideration, one of the parties to the dispute will not be allowed to act as judge and jury, but rather that the decision will be left to an arbitrator appointed by a Minister responsible to this House.</P>

      <P>I would also like to support this amendment.  I do so, not only from the point of view of principle, but because I happen to have had some personal experience in a somewhat similar case.  I was glad to hear Deputy Dillon say that Deputy McGilligan now realises the hardship the original Act inflicted upon certain parties and interests.  I happened to be connected with a little undertaking which made a profit of £600 a year. That undertaking was destroyed by the Electricity Supply Board and the compensation awarded was a sum amounting to less than three years' profits of the property.  At that time there was a certain amount of freedom of contract. I had to submit to the terms imposed by the Electricity Supply Board.  There was freedom in the transaction if you like, but it was the freedom that obtains between the boaconstrictor and the rabbit.  I think the principle involved in this amendment would obviate the hardship that will fall on certain interests, not alone under this Bill, but, if we can establish the principle, it may extend to other forms of governmental control and activity.  In view of my own experience and on grounds of general principle, I heartily support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct Deputy Bennett when he mentions the word &ldquo;compensation.&rdquo;  In regard to compensation, it is provided for in Acts already passed by the House.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Compensation can be assessed; at least you can define it. We are prepared to give these <i>ex-gratia</i> grants for something that is rather nebulous.  The people who are to be considered as claimants for an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant are people who are unable to make a claim sustainable in law for compensation.  That is my point.  We are trying to do a very just and a very fair thing.  I would agree with Deputy Dillon that there should be arbitration if it was a question of dealing between two parties and if there was not a question of a third party.  If we had to deal as a Government with a man who owned a particular piece of property, it would be quite easy to deal with him by arbitration. In the case of fishermen who have a nebulous right, a right to fish, or a prescriptive right as Deputy Hogan called it&mdash;a right to fish on free waters&mdash;that would hardly be a right sustainable in law and hardly one for which we could assess definite compensation. We, however, while we regard their right as a nebulous right, think there is a moral right involved and we are inclined to go as far as possible in meeting the difficulties created for these unfortunate fishermen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon clarified the matter very well when he said that when you appoint an arbitrator you must have pretty tight terms of reference for him. I think that is correct and I agree with Deputy Dillon.  Here there might be innumerable claims, claims covering a variety of things, and that would make it impossible to frame terms of reference.  In that case it would be impossible for us to be just to the people whom we want to help if we were to appoint an arbitrator with any terms of reference, no matter how wide, because they might exclude some unfortunate man whom we hope to help in this manner.  In the circumstances, I must refuse to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>If it is vital to have strict terms of reference, and I deny that it is vital to have strict terms of reference for the purpose of Section 10, how are the Electricity Supply Board going to determine these claims? All I want is that the arbitrator should have the discretion which the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to give to the Electricity Supply Board, whatever that discretion is.  The Parliamentary Secretary must have some concept in his mind of what kind of discretion he proposes to confer on the Electricity Supply Board.  All I am asking him to do is, having conceded that discretion, to confer it on the arbitrator instead of on the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <P>Then, putting it in the form of a question, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he can see any difference between compensation and an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment that could not be met with a common solution?  One quite appreciates what compensation is, as laid down by the law.  Compensation is payment for something.  An <i>ex-gratia</i> grant is also given for something.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that compensation is given for something, for some right lost.  An <i>ex-gratia</i> grant is given for something too, something lost, and there may not be as good a case made for it as for compensation, but nevertheless it is in fact compensation for something.  I am suggesting that with all the Parliamentary Secretary's lofty sentiments and talk it would be quite easy to have an arbitrator appointed by the Minister or anybody else, who could adjudicate on a matter <Col N="672" /> and decide on the amount of the <i>ex-gratia</i> grant, if you want to give that instead of compensation, and the circumstances under which it should be given.  The Parliamentary Secretary said it would be impossible to frame terms of reference to include everything.  We want to arrange this so that anybody who thinks he has sustained a loss can make an application and have it decided upon. Nobody who has extravagant ideas will put in an application if he knows he has not some foundation for his claim.  To say that you could not frame terms of reference is pure nonsense. The section itself says that the board shall receive any application. Let any interested party make application and let the arbitrator decide whether there is anything in it, and if there is something in it, what amount he should give away by way of <i>ex-gratia</i> grant or whatever you like to call it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary makes the matter even more involved and complex than it appeared before he spoke, for he says that he has no objection to the principle enshrined in the amendment, and he thinks that it is a good thing to have an arbitrator, but he says it is a question between the board and the party from whom a right is being taken.  He says that in this case the board will be dealing with people who have a nebulous claim to some lost right, which they could not prove on legal grounds, and that that can only be dealt with by allowing the board to give them an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant at their discretion. Yet this House is giving statutory authority to the board to acquire such rights at their discretion, from the previous owners without any arbitrator being allowed to come into the matter at all.  As I said on an earlier stage it would be equally just to give to the other side, the existing owners, the right to fix the price of the interests acquired.  It would be equally just to say that they should have discretion to determine the amount of compensation.  The amendment is a perfectly fair one.  If an arbitrator is appointed and the Electricity <Col N="673" /> Supply Board can sustain their claim, the amount to be paid shall be determined by a party who will be impartial.  Experience of the attitude of the Electricity Supply Board upon issues of a much more concrete character than those visualised by the Parliamentary Secretary, does not indicate that they are a very equitable body or a body to which the House could, with confidence, give this discretion. On a former occasion we had two sets of fisheries in Limerick of approximately the same length.  In respect of the first of these rights, about four miles of water above the tidal water, the owners got £4,000 compensation, while in the case of another fishery of about the same length further upstream, the owners got compensation to the amount of £24,000 or £25,000. The owners in that case were of a different type and were in better circumstances than the unfortunate men who happened to be the owners of the other fishery.  There is an anomaly upon an eight-mile stretch of water which is not calculated to inspire very much confidence that the Electricity Supply Board will give a square deal in the matter of assessing compensation for any rights they may take over under this Bill.  The principle in the Bill is not one that can be defended in all equity but the amendment gives an equitable way out of it.  Even where there are rights which the Electricity Supply Board feel could not be proved in court, the parties should be compensated when these rights are taken over and I say there is room for the appointment of an arbitrator to assess the amount that should be given to such persons when they come to be compensated.  I think it would be an act of grace if the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to accept the amendment.  It would ensure satisfaction and harmony in the working of the measure as against the friction which is likely to be created between such people and the board by the knowledge that these people are going to be left absolutely at the mercy of the board in the matter of any compensation to which they feel they are entitled.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Parliamentary Secretary is not accepting this amendment.  I am against it and I can speak for some of the people concerned with this section. In former cases, where there was a question of the appointment of an arbitrator, the decision of the arbitrator was not always acceptable to those concerned in the arbitration, any more than the decision of the Electricity Supply Board would be. From previous experience, we know that, in connection with these Shannon Fisheries Acts, there is a better chance of the working fishermen who are concerned in this matter getting compensation from the Electricity Supply Board than from an arbitrator. Deputy Keyes referred to the Abbey fishermen.  In that case the Electricity Supply Board made an offer, and if the matter had gone to the arbitrator, it is very doubtful if the fishermen would have fared as well.</P>

      <P>I know some of the men concerned in this question are averse to the appointment of any arbitrator and would prefer to deal with the Electricity Supply Board direct.  They are confident that they would get quite as good a deal from the Electricity Supply Board as from the arbitrator.  It is for that reason that I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is not accepting this amendment. Of course there is a legal question involved, the question of the principle of the thing.  Perhaps Deputy Dillon and other Deputies who have spoken on the question of principle may be correct in their attitude in that regard, but it is really a very small matter in which there are a small number of men concerned, the number of men who were not covered by the principal Act and for whom this provision is to be made in order that something can be done for them by way of an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the Vote on Account, as the Dáil is aware, is to enable sums to be made available for the carrying out of what are termed the Supply Services during the interval in every financial year which must elapse before the Dáil has had an opportunity of discussing each Supply Service Estimate in detail and passing it.  Normally, the greater part of the first four months of the financial year has elapsed before all such Estimates have been considered by the Dáil, and before the annual Appropriation Act has become law; and it is, therefore, necessary to provide in the Vote on Account sufficient moneys to cover the working of the various departments and services for a period of four months.  The amount necessary, accordingly, is in most cases one-third of the Estimate, but in certain cases, where special circumstances exist, a departure from that fraction is necessary, and the necessary modifications in the fraction have been made, accordingly, in those Estimates in which such a departure is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>The total net provision to be made for the Supply Service Estimates for the coming financial year is £30,322,710, showing a net increase of £579,646 over the figure for last year.  As regards the Vote on Account for the coming <Col N="681" /> year, the sum now required is £10,630,000.  In the absence of the Minister for Finance, I hope it will be considered sufficient if I refer briefly to the more important decreases and increases in the Estimates as presented to the House, and make some reference to these cases in which, in respect of the sums mentioned in the Vote on Account, there has been a substantial departure from the normal one-third of the total Estimate for 1938-39.</P>
    <P>The more important decreases are: Vote 52&mdash;Agriculture&mdash;in which there is a decrease of £117,734 as compared with the current year.  There are various increases in respect of salary increments and bonus, improvement of live stock and the creamery industry and miscellaneous items, but these are more than offset by non-repetition of the provision of £111,000 for expenses in connection with the provision of butter for winter requirements.  There is also a substantial reduction under sub-head 0.9 in respect of the purchase, storage and export of butter.  The next largest decrease seems to be Vote 61&mdash;Unemployment Insurance and Assistance.  The amount is £52,993 less than the provision for the current year.  There is a decrease of £5,083 in respect of salaries, due mainly to reductions in the staff of the employment branch, and a decrease of £12,800 for poundage on money and postal orders due to a change in the system of paying unemployment insurance benefit and unemployment assistance. The Vote is further relieved to the extent of £80,426 by increased receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid from the Unemployment Fund and local authorities.  There are off-setting increases of £15,000 in the State contribution to the Unemployment Fund, and £30,086 in respect of payments of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Vote 58&mdash;Transport and Meteorological Services&mdash;shows a decrease of £47,206.  The reason for this is a decrease of about £48,000 in the provision for acquisition of land for civil air ports and that the payment of £1,500 to the Londonderry and Lough <Col N="682" /> Swilly Railway Company disappears. These are offset to a small extent by certain increases for additional staff for meteorological services and other items.  Electrical Battery Development decrease, £46,000.  The Vote for this service in 1937-38 was stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when moving it last year to be the last payment to be made in respect of the Drumm battery invention.</P>
    <P>Vote 46&mdash;Primary Education&mdash;shows a gross decrease of £34,190, offset as to £18,651 by increases on various sub-heads. The principal decrease is in teachers' salaries (£19,000) and the principal increase in provision for grants towards the cost of heating and cleaning schools&mdash;£15,600.</P>
    <P>Vote 14&mdash;Property Losses Compensation&mdash;which shows a decrease of £17,560, is a dwindling service.  Vote 16&mdash;Superannuation and Retired Allowances&mdash;shows a decrease of £13,135.</P>
    <P>The main increases are: Vote 11 &mdash;Public Works and Buildings.&mdash;The increase here is £211,293.  An increase of £205,833 is made in the provision for sub-head B.&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions.  The gross figure shown in the Schedule in Part III of the Estimate for this sub-head for 1938-39 is £1,156,075 as compared with £972,832 in the current year's Estimate. A sum of £160,000 (item 107) is provided for the Dublin airport as compared with £70,000 in the current year; while £230,000 is provided (item 108) for the Shannon airport as compared with £150,000 in the current year.  Works for the Army generally show an increase.  The deduction for works which may not be carried out during the year is £300,000 as compared with £322,590 in the current year.  The Commissioners of Public Works anticipate that, with certain additions which have been made to the staff of the Office of Public Works, it will be possible in the coming year to carry out works to the full scale contemplated. Token provision is made in the sub-head for the erection of an official residence for the President of Ireland; the details will be worked out by the Commissioners during the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> The provision for maintenance and supplies shows an increase of £19,569 which is accounted for by the greater number of buildings under the charge of the Commissioners.  The provision under sub-head A.&mdash;Purchase of Sites and Buildings&mdash;shows a decrease of £17,510.  Commitments for arterial drainage are estimated at £31,630, of which not more than £19,630, a decrease of £10,447 as compared with the current year, is estimated to come in course of payment during the year.</P>
    <P>Vote 66&mdash;Army Pensions&mdash;shows an increase of £93,408.  This increase is due mainly to an addition of £97,199 in the provision for extra pensions granted under the Military Service Act, 1934.  The Defence Forces Pensions Scheme, 1937, requires £3,672, an increase of £2,046 on the current year's provisions. Vote 63&mdash;Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;shows an increase of £91,140 and of the total increase here, £65,000 approximately, is in respect of salaries and due partly to additional staff but mainly to salary increments and bonus.  Vote 41&mdash;Local Government and Public Health&mdash;shows an increase of £78,826.  The main increases are £51,875 in respect of the contributions towards annual loan charges to local authorities for housing purposes and £14,995 for grants to private persons, local authorities and societies also for housing purposes.  Vote 65&mdash;Army&mdash; shows an increase of £76,504. Increased numbers in the rank and file and in the civilians employed in the engineering and air services account mainly for the increase of £28,064 for pay under sub-heads A. and C. and for an increase of £24,786 under sub-head K. in respect of provisions and allowances in lieu. There is an increase of £15,791 in the provision for mechanical transport and a corresponding increase of £3,575 for petrol and oil.  There is also an increase of £14,430 for warlike stores, due mainly to additional provision for ammunition and small arms.  Decreases totalling £49,870 are more than offset by the increases on the sub-heads referred to and by a reduction of <Col N="684" /> £10,854 in appropriations-in-aid.  Vote 57&mdash;Industry and Commerce&mdash;shows an increase of £52,169.  The principal increases are: £10,196 under salaries, due mainly to increments and bonus; £3,500 for the Glasgow Exhibition, a new item of £20,000 for the New York World Fair, 1939, an increase of £25,247 for the production of industrial alcohol, £2,330 in the provision for the reconstructed Prices Commission and £6,200 in the grant-in-aid for the development of Clonsast Bog.  There is a decrease of £15,242 in the provision for development of Lyracrompane Bog.</P>
    <P>Vote 7&mdash;Old Age Pensions&mdash;shows an increase of £39,800 due, I understand, to the fact that the number of pensioners in 1938-39 will attain to the total of 138,200; at present, the number is about 136,600.  Vote 6&mdash; Office of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash; shows an increase of £39,688.  The bulk of the increase arises on the salary sub-head, approximately £23,000 being due to the higher provision for bonus. The balance of the increase is due to normal increments accruing on salary scales, etc.  Vote 48&mdash;Technical Instruction&mdash;shows an increase of £36,003. The increase arises almost entirely on the provision for annual grants to vocational education committees under Section 53 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  Vote 8&mdash;Compensation Bounties&mdash;shows an increase of £32,900.  There is an increase of £33,500 in the provision for bounties to exporters in respect of sugar made in Éire, from beet grown in Éire and used in the manufacture of goods on which drawback is paid.  This is offset by the withdrawal, as from 14th April, 1937, of the bounty on home-made mineral hydrocarbon light oils, for which a sum of £600 was provided last year.  The increased provision for bounties on sugar is based upon information received from Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo., that the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland has contracted to purchase sufficient home-produced sugar to meet their total requirements for the coming season. Vote 71&mdash;Peat Fuel Development&mdash; shows an increase of £30,000.  No provision was made for this service in <Col N="685" /> the current year's Votes, but a sum of £35,000 was voted for it in 1936-7. Vote 2&mdash;Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash; shows an increase of £25,687.  The Estimate provides for the inclusion of provision for the cost of Seanad Eireann.  Salaries and allowances of Seanadoiri are continued on the basis of allowances paid in the former Seanad.  The Estimates are&mdash;£22,830 for salaries and allowances; £1,300, travelling expenses of Seanadoiri, with a decrease of £2,670 in the salaries and allowances of Teachtaí, which latter item is more than compensated for by an increase of £3,927 in salaries and wages of staff.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are the items in respect of which there is a marked departure from the normal one-third of the total Estimate for 1938-39. Vote 1&mdash;President's Establishment. This is a new service but, as it follows from the enactment of the Constitution, it may be regarded as non-contentious in principle and, therefore, proper to be covered by the Vote on Account.  Only one quarter of the sum estimated to be required for the year is asked for in the Vote on Account.  Vote 71&mdash;Peat Fuel Development&mdash;to which I have already referred.  Although this is not exactly a new service, provision having been made in 1936-7, it was not thought meet to include one-third of the Estimate in the Vote on Account.  Vote 54&mdash;Lands.  This is a typical example of cases in which a substantially greater fraction than the normal one-third of the annual Estimate is required during the first four months. The explanation is that in order to meet the payment of interest on Land Bonds on 1st July next, half of the provision under sub-heads H, K and Q, which together account for £742,250 of the total Estimate of £1,740,380, will have to be paid into the Land Bond Fund in June next.  Similarly, under a number of other Votes, principally Votes 22, 25, 28, 31, 33, 46 and 50.  It will be noted that provision is being made in the Vote on Account on the basis that expenditure during the first four months of the coming financial year will be greater than the average.  Deputies will, no doubt, have noted the variations themselves <Col N="686" /> and I do not think it necessary to dwell upon the reasons for the variations of the normal one-third under each of the Estimates concerned.  It should suffice to say that, in most of these cases, the chief cause of the variation is that a larger proportion of the payments under the Vote than the normal one-third falls to be met during the first four months of the financial year.  There are three Estimates which show no change as compared with the figures for the current financial year&mdash;tariff commission, employment schemes and export bounties and subsidies.  With regard to the latter important Votes&mdash;Nos. 69 and 70 &mdash;Deputies will notice that the amounts provided in the coming year's Estimate are the same as those provided for the present year.  I do not think that it is necessary for me to say anything more at this stage. Deputies will later have an opportunity of discussing the different Estimates in detail when presented to the House by the responsible Ministers.  I understand that the Opposition Parties have been good enough to express a desire to get through the financial business on to-day's paper without going into matters on which there is conflict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correctly informed when he says that we consider the immediate circumstances unpropitious for a controversial discussion of national finances.  We are satisfied that, in view of the negotiations proceeding in London, it will be wiser to postpone a detailed discussion of the matters raised by the Vote on Account for another day.  Another opportunity will be forthcoming when these matters can be more fully gone into and, therefore, I shall confine myself to-day to directing the attention of the House to the figures without comment. The figure appearing on the cover of the white Book of Estimates for 1938-39 is £30,322,710 and that is for the Supply Services.  The figure appearing on the cover of the white Book of Estimates for 1931-32 was £21,921,573 and this fact which I am now about to mention is one that many Deputies, I think, forget.  The Book of Estimates for 1931-32 contained <Col N="687" /> Votes 8, 16 and 29 which do not appear in the Book of Estimates for 1938-39. These three Votes required £2,484,500 to finance them.  None of them requires to be financed now, so that if we are to make a comparison between the expenditure to-day and the expenditure of five years ago, we must subtract the amount of those sub-heads from the figure which appeared on the cover of the Book of Estimates for 1931-32.  If we do that, we discover that, in 1931-32, the Estimates were £19,437,000. They are to-day £30,322,000.  That is, I freely admit, a matter which gives rise to controversy and about which there will be controversy on another occasion.  I do not for a moment desire to suggest that that is a statement upon which the Government will not have comment, and trenchent comment, to make.  So will we, and when the time arrives, the matters arising from those figures will deserve the close attention of every Deputy, of every taxpayer in the country and every person in the country who has the welfare of the country at heart.</P>

      <P>I cannot give it at present.  The position, so far as I <Col N="689" /> remember, is that at the introduction of the Budget, the memorandum to which I have referred is circulated. We are only making provision to-day for the further legislative steps that are necessary to implement the granting by the Dáil of the amount of moneys in the Vote on Account.</P>
      <P>We are only dealing with a sum of £10,630,000, plus, as I stated, £463,059. That amount relates to those Additional and Supplementary Estimates for the current financial year which were not covered by the Appropriation Act, 1937, and may be regarded as complementary to the several Supply Resolutions already passed in connection with the individual Supplementary and Additional Estimates concerned. There were 33 Additional and Supplementary Estimates taken in the current year, totalling in the aggregate £480,795.  Four of these Estimates, totalling £17,736, were covered by the Appropriation Act, 1937, leaving 29 Supplementary and Additional Estimates, totalling £463,059, to be provided for in the next Appropriation Act.  The House will probably agree with me that, at the present time, we are only implementing in the Central Fund Bill the further provision for the Ways and Means Resolutions which the House has just passed, for the provision of money already voted, and making it available out of the Central Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the rate of wages paid by the Board of Public Works to labourers engaged on the airport construction works at Rhynana, Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point I make is that this is a very grave and very urgent matter concerning, as Deputies will remember, the work at the international air base at Rhynana.  Facilities were given by this House for the introduction of a measure affording facilities for an international air base and I found it necessary in December, 1936, to bring before the House, as forcibly as I could, the scandalous rate of wages paid workers engaged on that scheme.  I endeavoured then to contrast the rate of wages paid to workers employed there by the Commissioners of Public Works, of which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is the political head, with the rate of wages paid by farmers in that area, with wages paid by county councils within a reasonable distance, as well as with the wages paid by the Electricity Supply Board which, at that time, was operating not far from that area.  The comparison was all against the wages paid by the <Col N="692" /> Board of Public Works.  The wages paid by the Board of Public Works were totally inadequate to maintain even a single man in any decent comfort and were totally incapable of giving even the meagre necessaries of life to a man with a family.  I endeavoured to convince the House that the comparison was very unfavourable to the Board of Public Works.  Since then there has been an improvement, because we focussed public opinion on the matter to such an extent that even the Parliamentary Secretary had to take action.  Even though the result of that action was communicated to a Fianna Fáil club, we forced the Parliamentary Secretary to take action and to increase the rates of wages then being paid.</P>
    <P>To-day I am in a position to make a further comparison regarding the rate of wages paid by the Board of Public Works at Rhynana and the rate of wages paid by a contractor on the very same spot.  Deputies who are conversant with the activities of the various public Departments will appreciate that it is one of the functions of the Office of Public Works to insist on a trade union rate of wages being paid on work given by Government Departments; that is to say, if contracts are being given out by the Post Office, or by the Army, it is the duty of the Office of Public Works to see that fair wages conditions obtain in the factories into which those orders go.  Yet we have the position at Rhynana that the very Department which is expected to insist on fair conditions of employment being given on Government contracts is paying those men 32/- a week, while the Pioneer Road Construction Company pays 37/- a week to their men, who are employed on practically the very same work.  They are employed almost within call of each other at the Rhynana air base; it is practically the same work; there are the very same conditions of employment and the same necessity for a decent standard of living, yet the wage given by the Board of Public Works is 5/-below the standard set up by the Pioneer Road Construction Company. It is very well worth while recalling that when a proposal was made to construct <Col N="693" /> a road through towards Ennis the Clare County Council, on which there is a majority of Fianna Fáil supporters, unanimously passed a resolution asking that in regard to any work given by contract on road construction or such things at Rhynana the trade union rate of wages operating in the nearest urban area to Rhynana should operate there.  To put that simply, the resolution of the Clare County Council meant that the trade union rate of wages operating at Ennis at that time should be the rate of wages that would operate at Rhynana.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is amused at some of those statements. He has no right to be amused.  I say quite definitely that the Parliamentary Secretary has no right to show amusement in this House at the needs and sufferings of the people of that area. I speak with conviction.  I speak with a knowledge of the conditions under which they work.  I have seen them working there on an open plain consisting of thousands of acres, flanked on one side by the Shannon.  They work there in the middle of winter for less than 32/- a week, when you take broken time into consideration.  The rate of wages that was paid during the winter of this year was anywhere from £1 to 30/-, or probably even anywhere from £1 to 25/-, and that was under a Government which told us they were going to introduce a Christian, social State.  Their conception of a Christian social State does not tally with that which has been adumbrated by people with probably a greater right to speak as to what a Christian social State should be.</P>
    <P>Let us take concrete examples of what is happening.  Men come from Ennis, Kilkishen, Sixmilebridge and Tulla to work on the construction works at this air base.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary, with that cynicism which characterises his utterances and thoughts in respect of the workers generally, is probably thinking &ldquo;there must be some attraction when they come such long distances.&rdquo;  They come because for the workers in Eire at the present time the position is that it is either starvation or slavery, and in this instance it is a case of slavery <Col N="694" /> under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. Even in ancient Rome they abolished the murder of slaves.  I wonder how soon modern Ireland will follow in the track of the ancients.  About 100 men come from Ennis.  Ennis is about 14 miles from Rhynana.  Those men travel 14 miles to the air base in the morning and 14 miles back again in the evening &mdash; 28 miles in all.  That of itself would probably be enough work for a man for one day, especially if he has to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning.  Those men come varied distances. As I said, they come from Tulla, Kilkishen and Sixmilebridge as well as from Ennis, but I take the case of Ennis because it is the clearest example of what I have to point out. They have to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning to reach the air base at 8 o'clock, and after their day's work they have to travel that 14 miles back. What they get for that is computed at 5/4 per day.  Of course it is not 5/4 when broken time operates.</P>
    <P>At Rhynana they have erected huts. A new system has been introduced which, it is alleged, is going to improve the position.  Let us see exactly what is the position at Rhynana, on the evidence of the Parliamentary Secretary himself.  They have erected huts in which the workers can stay, and in which they are supplied with food.  If a working man makes a contract for a week's supply of food, he gets it for 17/6.  Then there is 3/- for a cubicle and 1/- for washing.  That is a total of 21/6.  If you add to that ? or ? for national health and unemployment insurance. you have £1 3s. 0d. paid at Rhynana for the most meagre sustenance for one individual, without giving him anything for tobacco, and without giving him anything for recreation of any kind.  If he works a full week and is lucky enough to get 32/-, he is left with 9/- to send home to support his wife and family.  Mind you, that is assuming that he gets a full week's work, and that he is a teetotaller and a non-smoker.</P>
    <P>But that is purely the high-light of the picture.  Let us see what he gets for the 17/6, and, mind you, he must make a contract to remain on for the <Col N="695" /> week in order to get those special conditions. The particulars which I am about to give have been taken from the canteen itself.  When they make a contract for a week they get this food for 17/6, while they work to afford facilities for an international air service. In the canteen at this international air base they get this food for 17/6 per week.  For breakfast they get one sausage, that is, one link or one finger of sausage; they get a slice of bread and butter, that is, a cut of pan loaf with a piece of butter on it; they get a pint of tea.  Now just imagine going out and working on that international air base on such a breakfast &mdash;one link of sausage, one slice of a pan loaf, and one pint of tea.  What does he get for his dinner?  He gets a ½ lb. of beef&mdash;and that includes the bone and the fat &mdash; 7 ozs. of cabbage and 2 lbs. of potatoes.  That is what he gets for his dinner, and he gets for his tea: a pint of tea, a slice of bread, and a sausage.  That is what we are building the air base at Rhynana on &mdash; 17/6 &mdash; but suppose he wants to supplement that and says: &ldquo;I cannot work on a slice of bread and a sausage and a cup of tea; I want to get more&rdquo;&mdash; what does he pay for it?  Tea is 2d. a pint; a link of sausage is 2d.; eggs 3d. each, and a rasher is 3d.&mdash;and that is 17/6, plus whatever he may think he is entitled to in order to maintain the necessary strength to enable him to do the work there.  That is the sustenance that is being given.</P>
    <P>I am thankful to the Parliamentary Secretary for erecting these huts and getting this canteen going.  It shows what is the cost of bare existence, bare sustenance, in food.  That slice of bread, that sausage, and that cup of tea, is probably the Parliamentary Secretary's idea of what a workingman should be able to build an international airport on.  Anyhow, that is what they get&mdash;plus 3/&mdash;- for the cubicle &mdash;that is what they get if they contract to live in the huts; and their wives and children have to live on the 9/- or 10/- they may be able to send home.  Naturally, the men have revolted against this.  Between 600 and 700 of them have decided unanimously to withdraw their labour. <Col N="696" /> Mind you, they did not decide to withdraw their labour because of any influence being brought to bear upon them in any way.  The Parliamentary Secretary was good enough to suggest here, in December of 1936, that I was not speaking for the men.  He said that I had no authority to speak for the men.  Accordingly, I studiously remained away from Rhynana until the men had formulated their demands, until they had formed their organisation, and until they sent their demands to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not say that I in any way disagree with the demands.  I do not say that I would not uphold them fully and as far as it is possible for any human being to advance and support them, but I want to indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary that there was no influence brought to bear upon them from any source whatever other than the natural revulsion against being asked to erect this air base under the conditions and at the wages it is proposed to erect it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a few of the things that the Parliamentary Secretary said with reference to this case at Rhynana.  In column 1136, of Volume 64, he said, with reference to this Party: &ldquo;At the end of the whole of that period&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the period in which this Dáil is in existence &mdash;&ldquo;they have not been able to gather to themselves 5 per cent. of the whole voting strength of the community.  They are, apparently, the only one angels.&rdquo;  And the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;In 1932, that rate was being paid in County Clare; it was being paid generally, and we had an election in 1933, and we came back.&rdquo;  Now, we had an election in 1933, and the Fianna Fáil Party did come back.  Now, let us glance for a moment at the manner in which public opinion reacted, even in the County Clare, towards that policy and that Administration.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his Minister toured Clare.  They denounced Deputy Hogan in Kilrush, in Tulla, in Killaloe. They said that he was false to every principle of national sentiment. They spoke of his treachery to Irish nationality and to the cause of democracy in this republican kingdom &mdash; in this republican kingdom, I repeat. <Col N="697" /> That was the burden of their song everywhere they went, and of course these two stream-lined orators thought they would dazzle the people of Clare into rejecting Deputy Hogan, who had raised this matter.  However, the political jay-walking of the Parliamentary Secretary and his leader, the Minister for Finance, did not deceive the people of Clare.  They succeeded in increasing the first preference votes of Deputy Hogan by close on 1,000.  They succeeded in doing another thing.  They succeeded in putting a note of interrogation, in the shape of Deputy Thomas Burke, instead of one of their own Deputies, into this Dáil.</P>
    <P>They succeeded in reducing the No. 1 votes of the President of the Executive Council in the County Clare by something like 7,000 No. 1 votes&mdash; that is, considering the extended constituency of Clare.  They succeeded in doing all that, and when the stream-lined orators, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance, go to Kilrush, when they go to Kilkee, and when they go to Killaloe and the other places to which they go, perhaps they will explain why their Administration had that effect upon the votes of the county.</P>
    <P>At the present time, public opinion is clearly in favour of the men.  It is expressed in the statements of several priests who have expressed themselves in favour of the struggle that the men are making, and it is expressed very clearly in the collections that are being taken up throughout the county in order to help the men to carry this strike to a successful conclusion.  It is one of the most disgraceful exhibition of parsimony on the part of the Government that has ever been given since this Government came into power.  The Parliamentary Secretary has many discreditable things to account for.  He has to account for the introduction of the provisions of the Cat and Mouse Act into the minor relief schemes &mdash;&ldquo;now I am in and now I am out; now I am out and now I am in&rdquo;&mdash;which he calls the rotation scheme; but the worst thing he will have to account for, either here or to the country, is the starvation wages upon which he is endeavouring to <Col N="698" /> build an international air facility at Rhynana.  I am asking this House to express clearly the opinion that this wage is entirely too small.  I am asking this House to express clearly its opinion that the claim made by the workers themselves should be granted; I am asking this House to say clearly that this international facility should not be afforded and should not be constructed on the basis of the needs and wants of the people of Clare.  I move the motion.</P>

I think that is, perhaps, a favourite device of the Parliamentary Secretary.  There are other air bases besides Rhynana.  We have one a few miles from Dublin.  They call it the Collinstown air base.  There the Parliamentary Secretary, in keeping with his activities in Clare, has definitely started the same methods.  Speaking generally of air bases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am keeping to Rhynana but I would like to have an open debate on the Collinstown question, if so desired.  Certainly I will keep to Rhynana and in Rhynana the men have been badly treated.  There are other points to which Deputy Hogan did not refer.  That is the question of Church holidays and the men going to work on Church holidays.  Now the majority of these men live a good many miles away from the aerodrome, 15 or 20 miles, and some of them 12 miles.  They have to get up at an early hour, and if they happen to go to Mass on the way to work and are half an hour late, that portion is definitely deducted from their wages at the end of the week.  Secondly, there is another device.  In the event of a shower of rain or a big storm &mdash; and we have few big storms in this country, except political storms &mdash; one would have thought that the men would be allowed to return to work as soon as the storm or the rain is over.  One would think that they would then start work again. They are not allowed to do so in a great many instances until a quarter <Col N="700" /> day has elapsed.  The result is that a man might spend the major portion of the day actually in the aerodrome and he would have sevenpence to bring home to his wife and children at the end of the week.  I am not going to delay the Parliamentary Secretary any further.  I know the Ceann Comhairle will not allow me to touch on Collinstown aerodrome and on the general question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on this motion.  I listened carefully to Deputy Hogan's speech.  I think the outstanding fact in the case is this: that you have here a number of men who of their own volition and without any backing from any trade union &mdash; and financial backing is a great factor when men go on strike &mdash; have gone on strike. Men do not go on strike without considering the pros and cons of the situation. Here you have 600 or 700 men who, on their volition and knowing that they have no trade union financial backing behind them, have gone out on strike.  That in itself is a fact that should make the Parliamentary Secretary, or any other fair-minded man in any part of the House, inquire very <Col N="701" /> closely into the cause of this dispute. We have heard Deputy Hogan's speech and I take his version of the case as being correct.  Here we have the fact that 32/- a week is put down as the basis of wages at Rhynana.  We have had 24/- a week in other Government schemes.  Now this scheme at Rhynana is a scheme which is supposed to be over and above and beyond the usual minor relief schemes of unemployment. This is a scheme not only of national but of international utility.  But we have this meagre wage laid down as the basis of this scheme.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the Dáil as a body will not agree to the payment of this wage in Rhynana.  They will not do so any more than any other public board would agree to it.  I say that the Parliamentary Secretary is taking advantage of the position of these men.  If these men had been enrolled in a trade union, and if they had the financial backing of a trade union, then the position would be that while on strike they would have a weekly allowance from that union.  But the Parliamentary Secretary knows full well that that position does not obtain in Rhynana.  He is probably taking advantage of their position, and he believes that the time will come when the men will have to go back to work when starvation in its worst form will begin to operate.  I admire the stand these men are taking.  I say that this House should come to the rescue of these men and their families.</P>

      <P>As far as I can make out from the statement made by Deputy Hogan, the one fact which he has put forward is in relation to the cost of rations at Rhynana.  He stated the workers would be charged 1/- for laundry and 17/6 a week for meals. He said the total weekly charge would be 21/6, and he also stated that between 600 and 700 men had gone out of employment and that the vast majority of the men had to travel 14 or 15 miles.  All these statements are just about equally liberal in the proportion of accuracy with which they meet the facts.  I should have thought that Deputy Hogan would know exactly the number of men who had gone out.  The number is 430, and not 600 or 700.  As far as our figures go, hut residents would not be charged 1/-per week for their laundry.  As far as the huts are concerned, the bedding, and all that kind of thing, the washing of that is included, and there is no other charge made.  Residents will not be charged 17/6 a week for three meals a day.  They will be charged 12/3 a week for three meals a day for seven days.</P>

      <P>Just wait a moment.  If the Deputy wants information, I am <Col N="703" /> giving it to him.  For some extraordinary reason, Deputy Hogan told us exactly what the men got for dinner, but here again his information is inaccurate. He said dinner consisted of eight ounces of meat, including bone, and seven ounces of cabbage.  It includes eight ounces of meat, excluding bone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, the bone is lent, and let me add that there are six ounces of bread also included.  It seems a pity that in giving details the Deputy did not give them accurately. One can argue one way or the other, but at any rate there should be some accuracy in the matter.  Broadly speaking, the general suggestion that a man is going to pay 21/6 in order to live in that hutment is countered by the fact that the figure will be 15/3. Deputy McGowan spoke, and I said that if he had made a contribution to the discussion he had added something new &mdash; if he had been accurate. He said that if there was a storm the men who turned up were put off and kept off for hours during the day. What is his authority for that statement?</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is mistaken.  There is no one in the House more anxious than I am to know anything of that kind which is true, and anything of that kind which is true would be fully taken into account.  I think the Deputy is mistaken. The information I have is that no man has been put off under those conditions.  There might be an accidental case, but to suggest that there is any custom of that kind is absolutely wrong.  Now, in relation to broken time, it is a very difficult question. It is a question to which I have given a great deal of thought, to which I know the trade union organisations have given thought, and to which I know other Departments are giving thought, but it is not by any means an easy problem to solve.  I think it will be agreed there could be no possible payment for time off for men who did not appear on the job.  I think that will be agreed by any fair-minded man.  I am glad if that is accepted, because we can then have a basis.  The instruction is that no man is to be stopped working if he does appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that being carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being carried out. There might possibly be an exceptional case, but I do not know of it and my officers do not know of it.  We recognise that in the case of men who have to travel a considerable distance, say, 400 or 500 men coming from a village, you could quite rightly take the line that on a particular day no work can be done, no value is to be got, and the thing will be stopped. But where you are dealing with a huge number of men from a very large area, one would say: &ldquo;I will not put a man off unless I must.&rdquo;  We have carried it to the further stage that actually we do not.  There may have been odd cases of gangs working on the ground where three-quarters of the men would decide that the day was not good enough, and they have gone off and the other men have gone off, but they have not been put off by the officers of the Board of Works. <Col N="705" /> Whether that should be done is another question.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to give every possible consideration.  There has been a practice of giving every possible consideration to men in relation to broken time.  Now, as to the amount of broken time, it is certainly not greater than would be found upon any agricultural job, as far as I know.  I regard this as a very important question. It is going to be a very considerable job and will take a considerable time.  I propose to use the figures from Collinstown and Rhynana for the purpose of investigating the question of broken time fully, to see what it amounts to, and to see whether or not there is any line of country which can be taken in that matter.  You could say to yourself that from this on there will be practically no broken time at Rhynana; that is, from this on to the autumn, but there may be broken time in the winter.  We took out statistics for the worst part of the winter, including all the voluntary abstentions of men, and I think you will all agree that a certain proportion of the time is through voluntary abstention.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious to get from the Labour Party or any member of the House a contribution towards this question which will represent a solution of the principle involved &mdash; the question of broken time &mdash; and how it can be dealt with.  The total amount of lost time is less than 10 per cent., and if you take the top off all the people, the people who lost least, 96 per cent. of the total time that could be worked was worked.  When you come to analyse the distances covered by the men who travelled, you do not find that the abstentions are all amongst the men who have travelled the longest distances. There are some men, who over the whole winter period, have not lost any time at all.  That is proof that (1) a man was not stopped from working if he came there, and (2) that it was possible for a man to earn the whole of the working time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole question of whether in relation to Rhynana there are any circumstances which create a larger unavoidable involuntary proportion of broken time, I am inclined to think &mdash;<Col N="706" /> I am simply for the moment trying to get some line of principle&mdash;if it can be established in relation to any industry that there is in that industry a larger proportion of involuntary broken time than in other industries, that should be considered in the basic wage.  I believe it is considered in the basic wages of certain skilled labourers.  I understand, for instance, that bricklayer's are paid a much higher rate, relative to what might be regarded as their skill and craftmanship, due to the fact that they are more liable than other workers to be put off and that they are put off, in fact, in building work from hour to hour.  While the nominal rate of payment is very high, the average rate which they get over the year, due to inevitable broken time, is less for that reason.  I would say that that is an argument that could be taken into account.  If, however, some principle could be evolved in relation to these workers or generally, by which compensation for broken time would be allowed, personally I think there would be something in that principle, but it would have to be, clearly and definitely, continuously related to that particular element.  To me the only two difficulties that seem to arise in relation to the Rhynana wages are allegations (1) that there is an excessive amount of broken time, and (2) that the men come from excessive distances.  What I am concerned with is to see whether there is any principle involved or any method of approach to the question along these lines.  As far as broken time is concerned, the instructions are that a man who turns up on the job and whose broken time would be involuntary, is not going to lose by it.  In practice that has been carried out.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to the question of distance.  We are told that the vast majority of the men &mdash; I have a quotation from a public meeting in Clare-have travelled 14 or 15 miles and that that represents a day's work in itself. The vast majority certainly do not do anything of the kind.  The number of men who actually travel 14 miles is 50 and the number who travel between 12 and 14 is 30.  Therefore, out of this legendary 600, which comes down to a practical 420, the total who travel a long distance is not the vast majority <Col N="707" /> but 30 up to 14 miles and 50 over 14. I want Deputies to ask themselves on what basis you should decide the wage on a job for which the men are going to come from all sorts of distances.  Are you to say that the wage on that job is to be set by the longest distance that any man will voluntarily travel to that job?  That is quite a difficult question and that is what is being contended. In another airport &mdash; I am not going to be controversial in that matter &mdash; men travelled considerably more than 14 miles &mdash; 20 and 30 miles.  They did it voluntarily.  They were not men on an unemployment register.  They were not men on an unemployment assistance register.  They came from a radius of 20 miles, attracted by the actual conditions of the wages which were given.</P>

What we have simply done is, we have taken the decided cases which have been put to the umpires on appeal &mdash; and between six and seven miles is the limit.  The actual condition of wages in Rhynana has attracted, from within and without seven miles, up to and including 50 men who travel more than 14 miles, ten times the number of men who are known by any method of enumeration of the State to be in necessity.  What standard are we to take?  Surely it is perfectly obvious, whatever else may be said for or against the Rhynana wages, that they are a long way above the competitive level &mdash; the competitive level not merely of men in necessity, not merely of men in want, but men who are not on the unemployment register or known to the unemployment statistics at all.  In addition, there are about another 100 men employed by a contractor.  In other words, there has been attracted into the area by the actual wage conditions existing in Rhynana ten or 15 times the number of men known to be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a legitimate question. It is unnecessary to ask that question, as the Deputy knows, because that statement has already been dealt with.  What is happening?  We are told that the contractor is paying 37/-per week.  He has to attract men away from us for a temporary job, and he will have to pay 37/- or 57/-, as the case may be, to attract them away if he wants more men.  We are asked why the trade union rate of wages is not being paid.  What is the trade union rate of wages or the accepted local rate of wages for work on roads in that district in Clare?  I may say that it is a very rich district.  The House is familiar with these poverty maps which we have put before the House to show the different degrees of prosperity of different areas.  This is one of the yellow areas, one of the areas in which the valuation per head is high and in which the number of unemployed people is relatively low. I understand that the rate of wages for road work in Clare is 35/-.  But when the Clare County Council came to specify the rate of wages for a road work in that district for which they had not to pay, did they specify the local rate?  They did not; they specified 48/-.  Why should they specify, <Col N="710" /> if that is the principle that is involved, 48/- or 1/- per hour, which I think was the proposition, for a road work for Rhynana?  This was a public road; it was not a road on the aerodrome. This was for money being spent on improving one of their own roads which ordinarily they would have to maintain.  Why should they specify 48/- for that road when they only pay 35/- for their own?</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that. No one up to the present has given us any line of justification in relation to the statements made either as regards broken time or distance.  As to the 32/-, what is the nature of the work and what kind of men are working there.  What have they been accustomed to work at, and how does the work they are now doing differ from that work.  As far as I know, the actual position in Rhynana was that I got a large wet field of about a mile square which was slightly irregular in conformation.  If it had been more irregular in conformation the job would have been easier.  It had an old drainage system which had been neglected.  The sluices had been allowed to become choked, and as a result of that neglect this land was wet and boggy.  When we finish the work on which we are engaged that will be a level, dry field, with that drainage system in order, and with drains put into it for the purpose of draining the main body of the land. The irregularities of that land will be removed and levelled out.  The sods will have been removed and replaced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I again want to draw the attention of the Chair to the irrelevancy of the statements that are being made by the Parliamentary Secretary for the purpose, I submit, of wasting time.  He has entered upon a long explanation of what he found in Rhynana and of what he hopes to leave there, but the motion before the House is a short one of two and a half lines.  It deals specifically with the rate of wages paid, not with the class of work done or what those employed there did before they went to work at Rhynana as a justification, if it can be justified, of the 32/- a week maximum wage.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary should address himself to.  He has been speaking now for 35 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting the mentality that is behind the whole scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to plough and to seed that land in places in which it cannot be treated, as it was mainly treated in Collinstown, by the transference of sods.  We are engaged in a purely agricultural and drainage operation, and we are using for the purpose mainly people who themselves have been engaged in agricultural operations. A great many of the people who are working on this scheme are the sons of farmers in the district who now, during this portion of the strike, will very wisely and very rightly go back to the doing of those seasonal operations in relation to land which otherwise might have been neglected in that district in Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural rate of wages in Clare was 24/- a week.  The rate of wages for drainage was 27/- a week. Either of these rates could have been chosen.  The 27/- rate was chosen at the beginning as being that most directly analogous.  It was raised, not by the pressure of Deputy Hogan or of anybody else, not as the result of any agitation, to 32/- a week, and having been raised it was maintained there in spite of a strike.  It was raised upon the merits of the case&mdash;upon the purely <Col N="714" /> economic merits of the case.  I want to be quite fair and to explain to the House that we had a difficult labour problem in relation to Rhynana.  We were envisaging somewhere about 300 men.  The visible supply of labour was not 50.</P>
    <P>I told the House that we were not going to draw that labour right round the 360 degrees of a circle.  Owing to the geographical conformation of the district we could only draw it out of a narrow are of about 30 degrees.  I told the House then that the rate of wages in Rhynana had been decided by the practical conditions of the case &mdash;in relation to the work done, and the men who were required to be got. Now I am told that we are trying to exploit the men, trying to use the fact that they have not got the resources and all the rest of it.  There is no one who believes that.  For instance, I want to tell the House now that there is a sum of about £300 for holiday work, belonging to those men, which they have not drawn.  I think the actual sum is £310.  I am arranging that they can get that at the earliest possible moment.  We have hurried up the payment of the money due to them so that they could have it.  Of all the men who have gone out on strike only one man, so far as I know, has withdrawn his national health card.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We hurried up the payment of it, and we are now engaged in hurrying up the arrangements so that this £310 which they have got will be soon in their possession.  The rate of wages has been settled in Rhynana on the basis I have stated.  It has not been altered in relation to any strike or threat of strike, and it will not be altered as a result of a threat of strike. I do not intend to have the mentality of altering rates of wages upon Board of Works schemes by means of strikes. We do keep in careful and continuous review the wages which are paid on particular schemes, and any alteration <Col N="715" /> which is made is made on the basis of facts.  As far as we are concerned, we do not intend to have it governed by strikes or the threat of strikes.  We are quite satisfied that, at the present moment, the basic rate of 32/-, relative to the agricultural and drainage rate, is a fair rate for local men.  If you attract men from 30 miles away, what are you to do?  Here we are up against that problem.  We can get over that difficulty by saying that we will not take men outside a radius of seven, eight, nine or ten miles.  We can alter the rate of progress.  We can do that.</P>

      <P>The whole speech of the Parliamentary Secretary can be summed up in this way&mdash;that the Government have reduced conditions to such a point that, in his own words, men are attracted to travel 30 miles per day to earn a maximum of 32/- a <Col N="716" /> week.  Conditions of labour must be very bad, indeed, when men are attracted&mdash;that was the word he used &mdash;to travel 15 miles, night and morning, to earn a maximum of 32/- per week.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that he is in no hurry, that he is not going to be rushed by this strike.  What he is really saying is: &ldquo;We will starve them into submission.&rdquo; I can understand that, coming from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have heard it come from every bad employer in the country at one time or another.  The Parliamentary Secretary says: &ldquo;If we cannot get them otherwise, we will attract them into the huts.&rdquo; Is the Parliamentary Secretary going to attract married men into the huts at a maximum wage of 32/- per week, out of which they will have to pay, according to himself, 15/3.</P>

Thirty-two shillings a week!  I remember the time when members of the Fianna Fáil Party stumped every cross-road in the country howling against a wage of 32/- a week, not as a maximum but as a minimum.  Members of the Labour Party remember that also.  When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition and when they were outside this House, it was the greatest crime ever perpetrated by an Irish Government against the workers of this country to offer that wage.  But Fianna Fáil in the country and in Opposition are very different from Fianna Fáil in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say much because the Parliamentary Secretary has not made any contribution to <Col N="717" /> the debate.  If there is one thing which it is almost impossible to endure in this House, it is the tolerant benevolence and the sophisticated tomfoolery of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;the tolerant benevolence and the sophisticated tomfoolery of a man who has been appointed to look after unemployment and to see that wages of a decent, Christian standard are paid.  Of course, the Christian standards we heard so much about when the Party opposite were seeking the suffrages of the workers have been forgotten.  The Parliamentary Secretary now tells us that he will not be influenced by strikes or threats of strikes.  Is that a clarion call to every bad employer to ignore the Minister for Industry and Commerce? Are they to take the lead from the Parliamentary Secretary and say: &ldquo;We will not be influenced by strikes or threats of strikes; we will stand firm because we know we can have three meals a day when they cannot have one.&rdquo; He will not allow intervention by a Government Department.  He will not report the matter to a Government Department.  He will say, as another famous or infamous strike-breaker said on one occasion, &ldquo;We can have three meals a day and they cannot have one.&rdquo; That is exactly what the Parliamentary Secretary has said this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that has emerged from the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks&mdash;I cannot describe them as a contribution to the debate&mdash;is that he knows nothing whatever about what is happening at Rhynana.  He is in complete ignorance of it.  Certain adjectives could be used in other places besides this House with reference to that ignorance.  I cannot use them here but they are known to everybody and they would characterise the position properly.  There are more than 40 men cycling 14 miles to and from Rhynana.  There are 100 men cycling 14 miles from Ennis alone to Rhynana.  When we endeavoured to make bus arrangements, there were facts and figures forthcoming to substantiate that statement&mdash;that at least 100 men were cycling from Ennis to Rhynana.  The figures were supplied by the works and they were figures of the men who would use seats in the <Col N="718" /> buses.  The Parliamentary Secretary disputes my figures regarding the cost to men living at the huts at Rhynana. I got these figures from the canteen. I am not using these figures to bolster up my case.  Take the Parliamentary Secretary's own figures.  Imagine a man at Ennis getting up at 5 o'clock and, after a hurried breakfast, cycling 14 miles to Rhynana and cycling 14 miles back.  Imagine that man forced to stay in the huts, leaving a wife and four or five children at home.  He will pay 15/3, according to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider 16/9 sufficient to keep his family at home?  Even out of that 16/9, he has to pay 1/2 insurance. Does he consider that that sum provides a living of a Christian standard for that man's wife and children?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not say one word about the main theme of my argument this evening&mdash;that 32/- is nothing approaching a living wage. He has said nothing in defence of 32/-. He has talked round about the subject and ignored the main proposition&mdash; that a Government should give a lead in the matter of wages.  If a Government pays a certain wage, they should be in a position to defend it.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that the Clare County Council passed a resolution asking the Government to pay 48/-a week in respect of the road leading from the air base to Ennis.  He asks: &ldquo;Why do not Clare County Council themselves pay 48/-?&rdquo;  Surely it is an accepted maxim that a Government should give a lead in the matter of wages.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary does not want Clare County Council to give a lead to the national Government in the matter of wages. Surely he does not want them to give a lead to a Government which was to give us a Christian, social State.  I have seen sorry exhibitions in this House.  I have seen many sorry exhibitions by the Parliamentary Secretary, but I have never seen a more sorry exhibition than his exhibition this evening when he indulged in his sophisticated tomfoolery and unmitigated humbug in trying to deceive the workers of this country.</P>
