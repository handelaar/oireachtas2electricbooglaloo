      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the title under which the King attaches his signature to letters of credence of Ministers of Éire to foreign States; also, if he will state to whom are Ministers of foreign States to Éire now accredited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (An Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (An Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The titles under which letters of credence of the diplomatic representatives of Ireland to other States are signed are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;George VI, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These titles are those which were in use when the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, was enacted.  The reference in these titles to Great Britain and the British Dominions, etc., has no constitutional significance so far as this country is concerned.  The reference therein to Ireland must now be construed in the context only of those executive functions of the State in or in connection with the domain of external relations, for the purpose of the exercise of which the King is authorised by the law of Ireland to act if and when advised by the Irish Government so to do.  All such letters of credence are countersigned by the Minister for External Affairs, and the countersignature of that Minister signifies that the accrediting of the diplomatic representative concerned is an executive <Col N="1290" /> act of the Irish State performed exclusively on the authority of the Irish Government, which is the constitutional organ of the executive power of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The reply to the second part of the Deputy's question is as follows: Diplomatic representatives of other countries here are at present accredited to the State through the King, who is authorised in that behalf by the statute already referred to.  Their letters of credence are addressed to the King; but they are now presented here to the head of the Government.  This procedure is to indicate that the act of accrediting is, in each case, a transaction between our State and the foreign State controlled at all stages, so far as our State is concerned, by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is it not a fact that, when a Minister goes from this country to a foreign State, he presents his letter of appointment and credence to the head of that State, and then, afterwards, to the Minister for External Affairs; and, if the same route is not observed coming back, is it not a fact that the Minister so appointed, coming to this State from any foreign State, has submitted the letter of credence to a person outside the State, and then afterwards to the head of the Government here?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the procedure in other countries is, but the procedure here is that they are presented here first.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister state that the head of the Government in this country is the proper person to have it submitted to as long as there is a head of the State available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that that whole question was discussed here at the time of the debate on the Constitution.  It was raised, I think, by Deputy Lavery, and discussed then.  The position is as I have stated in the reply, and the reasons, further, are indicated in the reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether as a result of the special inquiries which the Acting Minister undertook to make on the 25th May, 1938, into the refusal of the Department to appoint Messrs.  Dixon &amp; Company, Upper Erne Street, Dublin, as official contractors, he can now state on what grounds Messrs.  Dixon &amp; Company were refused such appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on the undertaking given on 25th May, 1938, full inquiries were made into the cause of non-appointment of Messrs.  Dixon &amp; Co., Upper Erne Street, Dublin, as official contractors for candles and soaps.  The local supplies advisory committee did not recommend Messrs.  Dixon &amp; Co, for appointment as official contractors for the 1938-39 period for any of their products owing to complaints made by local bodies regarding commodities previously supplied by this firm.  I am fully satisfied with the grounds on which the tender of Messrs. Dixon was rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the body referred to in his reply accepted the tender of another firm for a product identical to that tendered by Messrs.  Dixon, at a substantially enhanced price?  Is he further aware that for this product, for which the enhanced tender was accepted from another firm, the Post Office gave Messrs.  Dixon a large contract at Messrs.  Dixon's price, and does the Minister contend that the Post Office is buying inferior supplies, or has the Minister made any inquiry from the Post Office as to why they gave their order to Messrs.  Dixon and not to the firm which he patronised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made full inquiry into the reason why the advisory committee recommended non-acceptance of the tender.  I could give the Deputy and the House the full facts here, but I do not think it advantageous to the firm concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>There is a list of from 20 to 25 complaints made by local authorities all over the country&mdash;Cork Mental Hospital; County Hospital, Castlebar; County Sanatorium, Ballinrobe; County Home, Castlebar; County Hospital and Nursery Home, Fermoy; County Home, Clonakilty; Central Hospital, Galway; County Home, Killarney; Limerick Mental Hospital; City Home and Hospital, Limerick; Carlow Mental Hospital; Glenties District Hospital; District Hospital, Cashel; County Sanatorium, Roscrea; County Fever Hospital, New Ross; Enniscorthy Mental Hospital; County Home, Stranorlar; District Mental Hospital, Portlaoighise; and District Hospital, Clifden.  All those complaints were inquired into.  The results were put before the advisory committee, and, on those complaints and on the reports of the investigation made by the combined purchasing section the advisory committee decided that whatever the tender was they would not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that in respect of each of those complaints Messrs.  Dixon were heard by the officers whom the Minister appointed to inquire into the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give me an undertaking that if Messrs. Dixon were not heard at all in respect of any of those complaints they will be at least afforded an opportunity to put their side of the case to the Minister in respect of each of those complaints?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say they were heard in respect of every complaint, but I feel quite satisfied, although I am speaking without the book, that in making their inquiry the combined purchasing section and its director satisfied themselves that Messrs.  Dixon were given an opportunity&mdash;perhaps not in 100 per cent. of the cases, but in particular cases taken as examples&mdash;to state their side of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister be satisfied on further inquiry that Messrs. <Col N="1293" /> Dixon were not given an opportunity of presenting their case in respect of the bulk of the complaints&mdash;not all of them&mdash;will he now afford them an opportunity of presenting their side of the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave him on the 23rd ultimo to a previous question put down by him.  There are no winter grants, as such, but as intimated in my previous reply, it is the policy of my Department to encourage an intensification during the winter season of the employment on schemes to which grants from the Employment Schemes Vote have been allocated. Grants towards employment schemes formulated by local authorities are available in the present year up to a maximum of £635,570 for road works; £123,000 for housing development works, and £180,000 for public health works and allocations therefrom up to the totals indicated are made throughout the year subject to the condition that a substantial amount of the employment is afforded before the 31st March next.</P>

      <P>No draft scheme was received by me from the Kildare Board of Health and Public Assistance.  A scheme made by the board in September, 1937, was submitted but had to be remade owing to errors made therein.  The board remade the scheme on 16th May, 1938, providing for the purchase of 1,882 labourers' cottages in the county health district by means of the monthly payments of annuities equivalent to 75 per cent. of existing rents, exclusive of rates, terminable on the expiration of payment periods dependent on the dates of erection of the cottages.  The scheme was approved by me without modification on the 16th July, 1938, and laid on the Table of the House on 25th October, 1938.</P>

This information was not fully supplied until January last.  The results of pressure tests were only received in October last, and a decision on the matter will be sent to the board of health as soon as possible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state whether the members of the recently disbanded Dublin Metropolitan Gárda Band performed police duties in the stations to which they were attached; whether, in fact, during their hours of practice the <Col N="1300" /> members of the band constituted a reserve force which could be called upon in emergency; and, if so, what steps he proposes to replace such reserve force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state what steps were taken to determine which of the members of the recently disbanded Dublin Metropolitan Gárda Band were suitable for transfer to the Depôt Band, and how, in fact, the proposals in regard to transfer were brought to his notice; and whether he sanctioned the arrangement under which seven out of 39 members of the Dublin Metropolitan Gárda Band were transferred to the Depôt Band.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take questions 14, 15, 16 and 17 together.  For a considerable time it has been clear that in face of the growing requirements for extra police in Dublin, and the fact that normal wastage was not being replaced by recruitment, the continued maintenance of two police bands in Dublin could not be justified.  Accordingly, the Commissioner in the discharge of his statutory duties decided to amalgamate the Depôt Band and the Dublin Metropolitan Band so as to release a number of men for full police duty.  I may say that I quite agree with the Commissioner's decision.  A statement on the other matters regarding which the Deputy desires information will appear in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;I have no information as to the period for which the Dublin Metropolitan Police Band has been in existence.  It was not at any time maintained wholly out of voluntary subscriptions by members of the force.  The majority of members contribute voluntarily a small sum each year towards the maintenance of the bands, but the pay of members of such bands is borne by the State.  I have no record of any undertaking given in the past in respect of the <Col N="1301" /> Dublin Metropolitan Police Band or athletic clubs.  Members of bands are available for duty at any time if urgently required, and ordinarily discharge some duty each day.  Their availability for duty is, however, seriously impaired by their membership of a band, particularly during the summer months when band engagements are numerous.  As regards the suggestion that the members of the Dublin Metropolitan Band constituted a reserve force, it is to be noted that they will be more readily available for emergencies when performing ordinary police duty.  I am not aware of and I have not inquired as to the respective placings of the bands in the competitions in which they competed.

      <P>Since I received the report of the investigation conducted by the previous Prices Commission into the costs of building materials, I have had all the facts then brought to my notice under examination.  In view of the more extensive powers given to the new Prices Commission by the Control of Prices Act, 1937, I decided that it would be more effective to ask the new commission to maintain constant supervision over the prices of building materials and to take whatever steps were practicable in the direction of securing reasonable prices.  This investigation of building material prices is at the present moment receiving the active consideration of the Prices Commission.</P>

      <P>The following are the particulars required:&mdash;(a) It is estimated that during the Irish Sugar Company's financial year which commenced on 1st May, 1938, and will end on 30th April, 1939, the quantity of sugar imported will be 57,000 tons.  (b) The average price, duty paid, for such imported sugar is estimated to be 24/5 per cwt. (c) It is estimated that the quantity of sugar produced from home-grown beet by the company in the manufacturing campaign 1938/39 will be 63,000 tons. (d) The wholesale prices paid to the company for imported sugar and home-produced <Col N="1304" /> sugar is the same, namely 25/5 per cwt.  The difference between the latter price and the price of 24/5 per cwt. paid by the company for imported sugar is accounted for by the fact that most customers enjoy the maximum rebate of 9d. per cwt.  The remaining 3d. of the difference between the two prices may be regarded as expenses of distribution on imported sugar.</P>

      <P>The allowances granted to civil servants on retirement cannot, under the existing provisions of the Superannuation Acts, exceed a prescribed proportion, appropriate to the retiring officer's length of service, of his pensionable salary and emoluments at the date of retirement.  Therefore, that part of a retiring allowance which is based on bonus cannot exceed the prescribed proportion of the bonus paid to the officer at the date of his retirement. There is no power to reassess the award of pension subsequently by reference to any increased bonus which the officer would have received had he <Col N="1308" /> continued in the service.  The effect of the Deputy's proposal would be to give an officer a pension based on a higher salary and emoluments than those actually received by him at the date of his retirement.

So far as I am aware, the greater part of the money guaranteed under similar legislation in the past has been lost or else has been employed in enterprises which have redounded very little to the advantage of the State.  The Long Title of this Bill indicates that the purpose for which the money is going to be raised and used under it may be extended.  In the circumstances, I think it is very desirable that the public should know, inasmuch as the Bill may not be circulated for some time, what it is the Minister has in his mind.  Does he propose to take the powers that will be given him under the Bill to engage in a variety of financial enterprises outside the categories provided for by analogous legislation in the past?

      <P>I do not want to enter into the merits or demerits of the Government or of our predecessors as regards their proficiency at financial swindling, as Deputy Dillon has tried to do.  This particular legislation&mdash;Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts&mdash;was introduced many years ago by the last Government.  It provided for the building up of the industries of the country.  When after a few years that Government came to the conclusion that the industries could not be built up, this particular legislation was dropped.  The Government lost a huge amount of money under that legislation.  When this Government came into power it provided new legislation and that legislation has been in operation since then.  Comparatively very little has been lost under the legislation that was then enacted.  It will be found that a very large percentage of the loans made since were repaid or repayable, unlike the position under the previous Government.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, section 4 (1), to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of a member of Dáil Eireann who does not reside in his constituency&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  travelling facilities between Dublin and any place in his constituency,</P>
      <P>(ii)  travelling facilities between Dublin and his normal place of residence for the time being,</P>
      <P>(iii)  on any occasion on which he travels direct from Dublin to any place in his constituency, travelling facilities from any place in his constituency to such normal place of residence.</P>
      <P>(iv)  on any occasion on which he travels direct from such normal place of residence to his constituency, travelling facilities between such normal place of residence and, if he entered his constituency on that occasion by rail, the railway station in his constituency nearest to the point of entrance or, if he entered his constituency on that occasion by road, the point of entrance;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is moved to meet the case which was made by certain Deputies on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  It was represented by them that the section, as originally drawn, would place certain Deputies in a position of undue privilege as compared with others, in so far as Deputies who resided close to but not in their constituency would, under sub-section (1) (a) be in a position to travel anywhere within the constituency.  It was represented to me, on behalf of Deputies in various parts of the House, that this was undesirable.  The purpose of the present amendment is, therefore, to draw the particular section somewhat more tightly, and in substitution for <Col N="1331" /> the present paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of section 4, to provide that where a Deputy travels direct from Dublin to a place in his constituency, he gets travelling facilities from any place in his constituency to his normal place of residence; but where he travels direct from his residence to his constituency by rail, then by rail to the station in his constituency nearest to the point of entrance, and where he travels by road, then to the point where he enters his constituency.  This enables the Deputy who travels from Dublin to his constituency, on the conclusion of his business in his constituency to travel from his constituency to his home.  It does restrict, however, travelling facilities to be allowed between the Deputy's residence and his constituency to the minimum facilities necessary, and place him at the public expense as far as possible inside his constituency, but would not allow him the expense of general travelling within his constituency to which objection was taken at the last stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment meets the main point which I raised in connection with the anomaly that existed in favour of the Deputy living outside his constituency, which I understood was not really intended, but I am sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to approach the railway companies with regard to the railway pass and bus pass of which I spoke here the last day.  I had a letter of explanation from the Minister.  I still regret the Minister did not approach the railway and see what could be done in that direction.  I am not at all convinced that the Minister's view as expressed in his letter to me is the right view, and I still think that the Minister ought to have at least inserted in this Bill a way out in case it were possible at some later stage to do what I suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I and a number of others here oppose the passing of this Bill.  As far as these increased allowances to members of the Oireachtas are concerned, we do not see any reason, and we have not heard any reasons in the debate which has continued over the past three weeks to make us alter our view.  The Minister made a case and various other Deputies made the case that there were people in this House to whom it meant a considerable sacrifice to be members of Dáil Eireann, and that the fact that to come into Dáil Eireann in the future and coming in here now would mean a sacrifice would deter the best type of people from entering politics.  I can see no justification for that argument.  As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, if Deputies wanted to make the case that the present allowance was not justified they had a private committee before which to make the case, and they could have made that case before that committee without having the Minister coming, as I said, and making the poor mouth in this House for them. Since the institution of this State there have been various commissions dealing with Ministerial and other salaries, and no commission that was appointed by any Government saw fit to recommend that the allowance of £360 per annum was inadequate.  The Deputies in this House who opposed the Bill on the Second Stage were challenged by Deputies on the benches opposite, on the grounds that our opposition was one of complete hypocrisy, that we only opposed this Bill because we knew it was going to be passed.  If that was true, the Deputies on the benches opposite got their opportunity last week when they had a chance of clearing up that position and making it open to any Deputy who was satisfied that £360 per annum was a proper allowance to only accept that much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> Even if I was not opposed to this Bill when it was first introduced I would have been driven into opposition to this Bill by the Minister's case for it.  The Minister's only case is that democratic government is going to be preserved in this country by paying higher salaries to Deputies.  If that is the case I say God help democratic government in this country.  The Minister may think that on his contention that we may get more intelligent Deputies as a result of this Bill some of us may be afraid to cross swords with him.  If that is the Minister's contention, why not scrap Dáil Eireann altogether?  Why not advertise the position of Executive Council in this country and pay ten people, the best people you can get, £10,000 per annum to run the country, and not be talking about democratic government. If you are going to have democratic government, the type of people that will give you democratic government are people who are not afraid to make sacrifices, are people who are prepared to make some sacrifice in the interests of their country, and not people who are only going into politics when they are not going to lose anything by it. I know what the Minister's reply will be.  He will make references, as he did on the Second Stage, to the positions of various Deputies and to the fact that they did not make their case before the Committee and, of course, he will tell us that there was opposition in this House from people who could afford to oppose this Bill who, because of their private circumstances, did not need an increased allowance. I make a present of that case to the Minister.  As far as the Minister or anybody else knows, the people who are opposing the Bill may be no better off or may be better off than the people who supported the Bill, and the Minister is welcome to any case he may make about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say, as he said on the other Bill, that this was a matter that had been before the country, that this was a matter that the public were aware of, that the public had an opportunity of passing judgment on it.  There is one thing absolutely clear about the Allowances for Deputies Bill&mdash;that that Bill was <Col N="1334" /> carefully concealed from the public at the last general election.  There was not one word about increased allowances for Deputies and the public realised with a shock a short month ago that a Bill was being introduced by the Deputies of Dáil Eireann, in their patriotism, to provide themselves with an extra £10 a month allowance. If the Minister is not satisfied that there was objection to it, that there is still objection to it by the people of this country, he has only to look at even his own daily paper and at the attitude of his own Ard-Fheis, where it took the benediction of the Taoiseach to bring the matter safely through, and he has only to look at any public bodies throughout the country and see what is their reaction to it.  As far as I am concerned, I see no justification for it.  I believe if there was a case to be make in favour of this Bill that case should have been made before the commission by the people who made the case to the Minister.  It could have been made before any commission that was set up for the last 15 years, and it is not for the Minister to come into this House, after appointing a commission to do a certain job, after getting the recommendation from that commission that they could see no justification for increased allowances, to come in and tell us that he is satisfied there is a necessity for increased allowances.</P>
    <P>I want to harp back on this point about democratic government, and mind you, the present Minister as a champion of democratic government is a bit too much for me.  I suppose it may have been at one period, not so very long ago, that he was a sheep in wolf's clothing when he promoted majority rule and democratic rule in this country.  At the present time, when he is upholding democratic government, he is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  I make the Minister a present of all he ever said or thought about democracy, when he says that we will preserve democratic government in this country by making the position of a Deputy of Dáil Eireann so attractive that anybody coming in here may be satisfied that he is going to lose no money and that in fact he may make a little.  He is welcome to that type <Col N="1335" /> of democratic government.  If there is democratic government existing in any country in the world to-day it is because people in those countries are prepared to make sacrifices for democracy and are prepared to make sacrifices to preserve the parliamentary institutions of their States.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I opposed this Bill at the beginning.  I oppose it now.  I am made stronger in my opposition simply because the Minister and any Deputy who spoke for the Bill has made no case for it and, as far as I am concerned, I hope that anybody in this House who has considered the matter and who has listened to the Minister's defence of his own Bill, a Bill which brings in something that was turned down by his own commission, will vote against this Bill now.</P>

      <P>It is heartening and encouraging to learn that Deputy Linehan is going to experiment on democracy by attempting to make sacrifices for his country's welfare.  I only hope that, having made his first sacrifice for democracy and the country, he will be as enthusiastic afterwards as he is now but I suspect that in speaking now he is speaking as an isolated wolf amongst his Party and that he represents neither the views of his Party nor his own stringent views in the matter.  I rise, however, to get information on this point: Is there anything to prevent Deputy Linehan, Deputy Nally, or other Deputies whose consciences are outraged by this proposal to increase their salaries or allowances &mdash;is there anything to prevent their returning to the Exchequer, in the interests of democracy, of good government and of good finance, the £10 per month extra which it is proposed to give them in this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is nothing to prevent their doing that, I hope they will salve their consciences, satisfy their minds, and serve democracy, by returning every month the extra £10 which the Minister proposes to give <Col N="1336" /> them.  If there is an obstacle to prevent the returning of that extra amount, I should like the Minister to say so, because it might be possible at a later stage, if the Bill comes back from the Seanad, to insert some amendment which would enable these Deputies to put themselves right and salve their consciences.</P>

      <P>I do not think we have heard any word spoken by the Minister or by any other Deputy since the Bill was introduced to make our opposition to it any the less.  In fact, as far as I am concerned, anything that has occurred during the debate has made me more opposed to the Bill than I was originally.  I see no reason for the introduction of the Bill at this moment, and I think, in fact, that the existing conditions might have been preserved for the life of this particular Parliament at least.  We could all have gone on tightening our belts, if you like, for the period for which the electors sent us here.  What I particularly objected to, however, was the type of spirit displayed by the Deputies who took part in the debates on this Bill and the epithets of hypocrisy that were levelled at us across the House, and that have been repeated, in a minor way, on this stage of the Bill, by Deputy Cleary, who was not here during the other stages. If he had been here, I do not think he would have made the speech he has just made, because an effort was made to put in such a provision, as he suggested in his speech, and his own Party refused to put it in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, if this House does not give to the Opposition, so far as this Bill is concerned, as much credit as they give to any other Party, then there is no use in having an Opposition in this House at all on any <Col N="1337" /> measure.  It is said that, if we are opposed to this increase, we should not accept it.  I, for one, am fully prepared, as I said before, to accept any increase, once it is passed.  If you made the allowance £10,000 a year instead of £480 a year, I should be prepared to accept it.  That kind of an argument is nonsensical.  It might as well be said that, because I opposed extra taxation that was imposed in various Bills here, putting an extra burden on the people, I should be eliminated from that taxation or excused from the charges imposed, simply because I had opposed it.  That argument, as I say, is nonsensical.  In the same way, even though I oppose it, if a Bill is passed here proposing to give an additional allowance, I would be a bally fool if I was to make myself the one majority who refused to accept it.</P>
      <P>I say there is no justice in this Bill. There is no just demand for it. There is no general demand for it amongst the people, nor, as far as I know, among the Deputies in this House.  The Bill came as a complete surprise to me.  I did not hear even two Deputies, three months ago, mention any such proposal as this.  It certainly came as a surprise to me and to my constituents, even if it may not have been a surprise to some Deputies.  One had hardly time to refer the matter to one's constituents, it was brought in so suddenly and hastily and put through the House. As I say, I do not see any reason for it.  I do not want to go back on the old debate, but I say that at least the conditions of certain of the people of this country are much worse off than ours are, and until their circumstances are a little bettered we have no right or reason to better our own.</P>

We were told then that it was even apostasy to take that allowance because the country was in such a wretchedly bad condition, and that, if they came into Parliament, they would burn white with such zeal for the public welfare that they would spurn the allowance and establish a national development fund for the establishment of Irish industry. They came into the House in 1927, and took the £360 per year, notwithstanding these previous protestations&mdash;mocking protestations.  Deputy Cleary did not regard his conscience as being troubled in that connection, even though at one stage his Party said that they would not take the £360.

      <P>There are some Parties in which you can express your opinions if you hold them honestly and conscientiously, and I am glad that, as far as the Labour Party is concerned, it gave its members a full opportunity of expressing their opinions candidly on this matter.  I think that makes for democratic government, and makes for a better standing for parliamentary institutions than the kind of mass regimentation which you get in certain other Parties.  I think a case could be made that Deputies who do their duties conscientiously, who attend the House, who meet their constituents, who travel in their constituencies, and who attend to a large amount of correspondence, need some additional payment to enable them to meet the heavy expenses inevitably involved in that kind of work, but I object to the whole approach to this matter. Deputies may have a grievance which has some intrinsic merit in it, but there are tens of thousands of other people in the country with grievances much more substantial, much more deep-rooted, and causing them much more hardship than any hardship from which the Deputy is suffering to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an answer from the Minister for Local Government to-day to the effect that there were 78,000 people in receipt of home assistance&mdash;78,000 people in receipt of home assistance in a tiny State like this.  The figures published by the Department of Industry and Commerce indicate that there are 100,000 people in receipt of either unemployment assistance benefit or unemployment insurance benefit, and further figures given by the Minister for Local Government to-day indicated that there are 28,000 widows trying to exist on a non-contributory pension of 5/- per week.  I am reminded that it was from 1/- to 5/-; 5/- is the maximum.  Now, during this <Col N="1341" /> period of the year and right on to March and April we will find workers employed on rotational schemes for three, four, or five days per week.  The Minister for Local Government, a member of the Executive Council responsible for the introduction of this Bill, will not allow a local authority to employ a man for a full six days in case he gets a full six days' wages.  That is the kind of picture some of us see before us&mdash;a low rate of unemployment assistance, 100,000 people idle, 78,000 in receipt of home assistance, 28,000 widows struggling on a miserable pittance, and rotational workers limited to working for two, three, four or five days during a few weeks of the year.  In the face of that sea of poverty this House concerns itself with two Bills to increase the allowance of Deputies, and to provide pensions on an extravagant scale for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries after a few years' service. It is because the House perverts its normal function of dealing with problems as they affect the large masses of the people, and proceeds to deal with this kind of specialised class, numbering not more than 150, that I object to the whole approach to those two Bills.  If we were starting out to-day to cure every economic and financial difficulty in the country, we might include the economic or financial difficulties which arise in respect of Deputies, Ministers, ex-Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  But we are not doing that.  We are leaving problems galore unsolved.  No attempt whatever is being made to tackle them, and we are concentrating on two Bills which affect not more than 150 people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked to-day whether, in view of the increase in the cost of living and the low rates of employment assistance benefit, he intended to introduce proposals for increasing that benefit, and we were told by the Minister in a sarcastic and laconic manner that the answer to the first part of the question was in the negative and that the second part of the question did not arise.  There was certainly an economy of words there compared with the torrent of words <Col N="1342" /> used to provide pensions for Ministers and increased allowances for Deputies under those two Bills.  I protest against this Bill and the other Bill on the basic principle that I think it is grossly unfair to concentrate our attention on those two classes of people when tens of thousands of people are living below the border line of starvation, when tens of thousands of others do not know on Monday where they are going to get money to pay their debts on Friday and Saturday, and when there is a bleak and miserable future for large masses of our people.  It is in circumstances such as those that we are introducing this Bill.  I think there has been incident haste about the whole business.  I think you could not get a majority vote in the country for those two Bills.  It is rather significant that although we had a general election only a few months ago there was a stony silence on the part of the Government Party in regard to its intention to introduce proposals of this kind.  Not a word was said at the recent election about those proposals. Why was that important information kept from the people?</P>
    <P>We used to be told that Fianna Fáil was in favour of low salaries for Ministers and high salaries for workers.  Now we find that policy completely reversed.  It is high salaries for Ministers and low wages for part-time employment for rotational workers.  If ever a Party changed its policy, changed its outlook, and walked the tight rope of politics, the present Government Party has done it in respect of wages and salaries.  Wage claims on behalf of public servants which have been in the Department of Finance for some years cannot even get a decision from the Department, but in a short time we could get two Bills of a complicated character such as those, designed to increase the allowances of people who are not nearly so badly off as many other people in the country.  As I have said, if you were adjusting every other difficulty in the country you might deal with those difficulties as something which had merit in them judged by certain standards, <Col N="1343" /> but when you are leaving untouched the vast and deep-rooted problems which affect the mass of the people, I think it is grossly unfair that proposals of this kind should be promoted and passed, giving increased allowances and generous pensions while you are doing nothing for the vast masses of the people who do not know what it is to get a regular week's wages, who do not know what it is to enjoy a pension, and who never hope to enjoy a pension on the generous scale provided in those two Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister for the sake of the unfortunate taxpayers of this country, for the sake of the decencies of public life in this country, and for the sake of the future of this country to withdraw this Bill.  It has been said that this Bill is unjustifiable having regard to the condition of the working classes, and having regard to the conditions of the unemployed, but there is another class of the community who are in perhaps a more deplorable condition at the present time, and those are the struggling farmers who have lived through six years of economic depression, who have lived through a condition of affairs in which their produce was absolutely unsaleable, and in which there was absolutely no return for their work.  During these years a load of debt has piled up on their shoulders, a load of debt which they are unable to meet.  There are in the country at the present time not thousands but tens of thousands of unfortunate men and women who cannot sleep at night because they are hunted and harassed by agents of the Land Commission, by rate collectors and other collectors of debt, urging them to meet debts which accrued during a time when their industry was completely disorganised and at a stand still.  The national Parliament of this country failed to recognise the just claim which those people have for some measure of compensation for their losses, and surely it is no consolation to those people to be told now that the members of that national Parliament <Col N="1344" /> have decided to reward themselves amply for their failure.</P>
      <P>In view of these facts, and of the feeling throughout the country, surely the Minister will hesitate before proceeding with legislation which will disgrace this Parliament.  We were told that the Bill is being introduced in the interests of the poor.  The poor are always with us, and are always used as an excuse for every mean and contemptible action.  Who are the poor? The unemployed, the unskilled manual workers, and the average farmer. Would any of these people be deterred from entering this House, or entering public life on the grounds that they considered the present allowances inadequate?  If the average farmer was asked if he considered £360 yearly insufficient, the answer would be that that amount compares very favourably with his present income.  The legal wage of the agricultural worker is 27/- a week, which works out somewhere about £70 yearly, and for the unemployed person the yearly income is less than half that amount.  The income of the average working farmer is much less than £70, yet these are the people for whom we are told it is necessary to increase the allowance, so as to induce them to enter public life.  That argument cannot be sustained.  I believe the only people who would be required to make sacrifices on entering this House, are those with considerable means, successful professional men, doctors, barristers and others who earn large incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be contended, as has been attempted here, that the only way to attract the best people in the nation to come into this House is offer ample remuneration.  Surely the best people in any country are those who are prepared to make some little financial sacrifice in its service.  No other consideration enters into the minds of these people when about to enter public life.  Surely they consider the desirability of doing so, in order to right wrongs, to expose grievances and to do some good for the country.  Money alone should not be the only consideration in the minds of the best people. There is no substance whatever in the argument that an increase is necessary if we want to secure the best people <Col N="1345" /> for this House.  It has also been suggested that Deputies who are opposing this Bill are bound to refuse to accept the extra allowance.  In accordance with that principle, I should like to ask if people at present opposed to complete derating of agricultural land will continue to pay rates after derating has been introduced?  Will these people refuse to accept the benefit of such legislation?  There is no justification whatever for an argument of that kind.  I have been taken to task and severely lectured by the Minister for Finance for saying that I would not accept this increase for myself, but would hand it over to the farmers organisation in my constituency.</P>

As the agricultural section of the community have to bear their share of the burden of taxation, I hold it is the duty of anybody entering public life to help them to organise in defence of their interests, instead of allowing them to be trampled upon.  I have also been taken to task for suggesting that there should be some clause in the Bill providing for compulsory attendance here. I have not suggested that the House might gain anything intellectually or otherwise from the attendance of all Deputies, but, at least, it would be a mark of respect to the dignity which should attach to the national assembly, if members were compelled to put in a reasonable attendance in the House, particularly in view of the increased allowance.</P>

      <P>I have already given my reasons for opposing this Bill. No one in favour of the Bill has attempted to refute my arguments against it.  There was one rather strained insinuation that I endeavoured to rectify on the Committee Stage. My reason for doing so was that, in my opinion, more was read into it than was ever intended.  The Deputy concerned has been accused in circles which we all respect and revere, of irreverence, by associating the opponents of the Bill with the greatest betrayal of all ages; that it was an outrage on this House, which open all its deliberations with prayer and an invocation for guidance; and that this unjust implication was striking at the elementary principles of Christianity.  I was convinced, Sir, that this was very unfair to the Deputy, and, with a desire that the members of the House should not be misinterpreted or misunderstood, I raised the question for the purpose of clarifying it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy apparently misunderstood my motion.  His reply conveyed that I was actuated by personal resentment.  I never considered the personal aspect of the affair, and I was only concerned that the Deputy should put himself right with the country and the House.  Here, Sir, I may express my gratitude to you for ruling me out.  In the disappointment, my reply would have been uncompromising.  I have since had an interview with the Deputy. He assured me&mdash;an assurance entirely unnecessary from one of his inherited tradition and his own disposition&mdash;that the interpretation put on his unfortunate quotation was entirely remote from his mind, which I am sure Deputy O'Higgins will corroborate.  I do not intend to take any further part in this question.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading I said that I welcomed the Government's decision.  The House has seen that amongst the various Parties there has been disagreement as to whether it was necessary or wise to make provision for increased allowances for Deputies.  I also indicated that there were very strong reasons why Deputies would be helped to keep closer in touch with the various parts <Col N="1347" /> of their constituencies, and with the problems of the people, so that, in a better way than in the past, both conditions would be reflected here, and in a better way the combined intelligence of Deputies of all Parties would be brought to bear on the solution of the country's problems.  It has been suggested that it will be a disgrace to this House in the future, the fact that Deputies would be paid increased allowances.  I think nothing will disgrace this House in the future to anything like an equal extent as the silence of quite a large number of Deputies during the last four or five years particularly on vitally important economic and national questions.  I welcome the circumstances that induced Parties outside Fianna Fáil to give expression to varying sentiments on a particular proposal here.  The question as to whether the increased allowances for Deputies are going to be justified is one that will depend entirely on the future.  The problem before the country is not whether it can afford the allowance but whether it will get services that will justify these allowances being given and whether this House is going to be a parliamentary assembly.  I welcome the expressions of approval, the &ldquo;hear, hears&rdquo; from the Fianna Fáil side of the House because nothing has done more to prevent the Dáil being a democratic Assembly than the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party during the last five or six years.  I might even add that they have been assisted in that by the Labour Party with regard to certain aspects of the Fianna Fáil policy.  Certain high policies have been adopted, constitutionally, internationally and otherwise and in so far as this Assembly has been concerned the Government have operated to shut the mouths of the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party and on some occasions to shut the mouths of the Labour Party and prevent them telling what they knew with regard to conditions in the country.  It was the policy pursued by the Government that was responsible for that.  I hope we have passed from those days.  I hope that by the loosening <Col N="1348" /> of tongues, by the relaxation of whippings, by the standing out on their own feet of the Labour Party without sheltering under the umbrella of the Fianna Fáil policy and endeavouring to do things by colloguing and conference with Fianna Fáil, that we will hear not only complaints of the conditions that exist in the country but the lines upon which conditions in the country might be improved.  As a result of the type of co-operation that has gone on here this House has lost almost complete control over fiscal actions.  The Government have taxed the people to increase the revenue available, and the Government has spent money in wild ways, money that might profitably be devoted towards assisting the development of our main industry.  As a result of the Government's policy and a definite silence on the part of many Deputies in this House there has been taken from this House power to control the operations of the fiscal policy.  Information that properly should be sought by this House has been denied.  Blatant economic facts have been brought out here and shown up by members of the Opposition, but they have been persistently denied by occupants of the Ministerial Front Benches.  Only now when some of the errors of the past have been rectified and we are proceeding on different lines, are the accumulated statistics appearing from Government Departments and they show that everything argued with regard to the injury to the consuming power of our people and the sound development of industrial life was right.  It is only now that the statistical facts are being massed together in Government reports and made available for the public, with the Government imprimatur on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The justification for increased allowances for Deputies lies in the future and they can only be justified if this is going to be a parliament.  A picture has been painted of the bad economic conditions that exist in the country.  The reason why these conditions exist is <Col N="1349" /> because representatives attending here have not spoken their minds.  Perhaps they have not in the circumstances that exist sufficient facilities to keep in touch with their constituents.  One thing these allowances will do is to enable Deputies to have transport that will bring them in touch with their constituents.  We have the position that this House has lost control to a large extent over its fiscal policy.  It has handed over powers that ought to be here to bacon boards, with the result that bacon consumption has gone down by 25 to 26 per cent.  The millers have been set up as a monopoly outside the House with no one here in control. They have been helped by the Government policy and by silence on the part of Government Deputies.  The consumption of bread has gone down. Milk boards have been set up, and now there is a scarcity of milk so far as the Dublin consumers are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit that I am trying to review the whole Government policy.  All I want to say is that bodies have been set up outside the House and have taken from the powers of the House as an Irish Parliament, and we can recover these powers by a candid and uniform expression of opinion by Deputies here.  I welcome the expression of approval from the Fianna Fáil Party.  If there is going to be a relaxation of putting the gag in Deputies' mouths with regard to the situation here, it is all for the better.  There is another matter in which I think the importance and independence of the House has to be strengthened.  There are all kinds of disparagements thrown at some politicians.  A new Seanad is to be set up that is going to guide us with a greater store of information of a finer character and a more detached and honest touch with regard to public affairs than a mere Assembly of elected politicians can have.  One type of <Col N="1350" /> Seanad has been set up and there are proposals for another type.  There are suggestions that corporate bodies can take charge of this, that and the other.  I do not think that anything can take the place of a Parliament elected to lay down and develop national policy with regard to economic and other matters.  I believe the increased facilities for Deputies can restore this Assembly to be a Parliament reflecting the conditions of the people and the intelligence of the people as to how their problems should be tackled.  That can only be if the Deputies for whom these allowances are made are going to be allowed to exercise their judgment and intelligence.  It is absurd to be paying increased allowances to a Government Party if that Party are going to be gagged behind Ministers and if the only purpose is that they can be more regimented.  I do not suggest that is the intention of the Government.  I welcome the action they have taken and I welcome these increases because they have given to Deputies an increased responsibility.  I hope it increases the responsibility and the authority and the prestige of the House so that the problems of the country may be tackled by people who have a definite responsibility to the country.</P>

      <P>I do not want this measure to pass without saying a few words upon it.  A lot has been said that I think could be very well left unsaid.  I think it would be no harm if some slight review was made of what is actually the work that a Deputy performs.  I do not take myself as being anything different from the ordinary Deputy.  I believe we all have to do practically the same work.  All I can say about this measure is that it is £120 better than it was, just exactly that.  Even then that is not adequate to cover the expenses or ample payment for a Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reside in my constituency.  I have callers who call on me in the morning, even before I get up to go to Mass at 8 o'clock.  They call on me at night, and I have callers all day on Sundays. <Col N="1351" /> I have not one moment that I can call my own.  If I put half the energy into any other business&mdash;even as a blacksmith&mdash;that I put into this work, I would make more money at it.  I will prove that.  I returned to public life in 1929.  At that time I got a gratuity of £3,000 from the State. Since then I fought four general elections and two by-elections.  Fighting these elections has cost me £1,700.  If I continue for nine years more, the gratuity I got will then be all gone and more with it.</P>
    <P>I made a few sacrifices for this country at other times.  That, I believe, is even doubted now.  During those elections that I fought I was told that I did not stand in the dock at all and did not make any speech from the dock.  I was told that something had been said about Deputy MacEntee's speech from the dock, that he, at least, made a speech from the dock.  It was denied that I made one at all.  I was told that it was another very important I.R.A. leader who had spoken from the dock and not me. The only point that arises out of that is that there are only two types of persons who can be members of this House at the moment: That is somebody out of the Labour Exchange who is looking for the dole or the Frank MacDermot type whose income runs into thousands.  If a man who has regard for his responsibilities and discharges his duties, has means or has middle-class means, it will be found he will be a beggar after nine or ten years as a Deputy.</P>
    <P>What business does a Deputy who is looking after his job do?  It is said here that attendance in the House is to be the criterion as regards the Deputy performing his duties. Everybody who knows anything about the country knows that that is nonsense.  The main part of a Deputy's work is the amount of good work he does for his constituents irrespective of whether they voted for or against him.  Here is a sample of my bag for to-day and to-morrow and indeed for every day in the week: Asked to secure time for a constituent to pay the land annuities, questions about land division and land acquisition, old age <Col N="1352" /> pension claims, blind pension claims, widows' and orphans' pension claims, unemployment assistance, questions about people broken off the dole by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, questions about national health insurance payments, questions about workers who have been struck off because they were not in insurable employment and so on.  A Deputy has to put his very best work into that.  Then there are the housing questions, reconstruction of houses and grants for new houses.  There are military pensions and disability service pensions.  I can state positively that for the last four years this work has entailed on an average two days' work a week.  I have simply said to my constituents that I could only give them two days' work as there are other questions to be attended to.  A Deputy has the duty of seeing about import and export licences for his constituents.  Traders sometimes cannot get their goods in or out without a Deputy having to write a letter to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and so on.  Then there is the question of drainage, afforestation and minor relief works.  There are bog passes, bog drains and so on.  Of course, a Deputy residing in the city or a Deputy who does not reside in his constituency knows nothing about all these things, but that is the position in a constituency such as mine.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputies that a country Deputy's work is quite different.  I know there are Deputies who simply ask to what organisation does the constituent belong before they do anything to help him.  That is a false principle.  No matter what way one's constituents <Col N="1353" /> voted, a Deputy should serve them. Taking all these things into account, I am satisfied that this question has not been examined at all on its merits. We have got into a heat here about the hardships that farmers are suffering, and Deputy Norton tells us about what the labourers are suffering.  My contention is that it would be well worth while to pay good salaries to Deputies so that they could look after and manage the country's affairs properly. It is only in that way good service can be got.  It is a whole-time job.  Political life should be made something to look up to and something that should not be sneered at.  Politics is the art of government.  I was called a politician and, in reply, I said I regretted I was not a good one.  I wish I was a better politician.  All I can say about this measure is that it is £120 better, but there are a few other things that I would like to see in it as well.</P>
      <P>This Bill and the one dealing with the Ministers show that there is a complete change of front.  That change of front is of no value unless there is also a change of heart.  I think the old Sinn Féin members of this House should apologise to the members of the old Irish Parliamentary Party and to their relations for all the things they said about the &ldquo;400 pounders.&rdquo;  That simply meant that we blackguarded them up and down the country because we were not aware of the facts.  We said a lot about them.  Now we know that the sum they got was inadequate.  We are told now that when a man comes to Dublin from Cork or Kerry there is a hardship, but the members of the old Irish Party had to travel as far as London.  We now realise that what we said about the then &ldquo;400 pounders&rdquo; was all nonsense.  The old Sinn Féin members on both sides of the House should apologise for all that was said. I also think that the Fianna Fáil Party should apologise to the Deputies on these benches for all they said about us in 1924, 1925 and 1926.</P>

I may not be doing that very well, but I am saying what I mean. The fact is that our Party were blackguarded up and down the country. The people were told that it was the £360 that we were looking for and that the Ministers were looking for their big salaries.  I think a change of heart there would not be any harm.  It would be all to the good.  Anyway it is a recognition that all the things said&mdash; I will not say said deliberately&mdash;were said in ignorance and without a full knowledge of the facts.  The only thing that struck me here this evening was that a number of the Deputies who spoke against this Bill were short-term Deputies who are not long in the House &mdash;at least some of them are here only a short time&mdash;and that they were speaking without full knowledge of the facts and that if they gave full attention to the work they could say to themselves and to their constituents: &ldquo;I have earned every shilling of the £480, if I get it.&rdquo;  All I would say is that I do not think £480 is ample compensation, and that if my two Fianna Fáil colleagues are worth £1,000 between them in the constituency, I am worth the two of them together&mdash;I am worth £1,000.</P>

      <P>The challenging nature of the speech made by Deputy Mulcahy, and when I say challenging I mean the friendly way in which he challenged Deputies to intervene in this debate, demands that I should make some contribution to the discussion.  I was invited or rather it was suggested I should be invited to go before the commission that was set up by this House or by the Minister, and give evidence as to the position of Deputies.  Presumably by that was meant the position of Deputies who are members of this Party.  In refusing to do so I felt I could not fairly represent the domestic position of the majority of my colleagues.  I was elected with a big majority to membership of this <Col N="1355" /> House when there was no assurance or certainty of any kind of any salary or allowance.  When I was invited to accept nomination and when I agreed to do so I informed my principal supporters at the time that I was not prepared to devote the whole of my time to political activities.  That was accepted by my supporters and also by the majority of my constituents and that has been ratified by my constituents in the eight general elections that have taken place since I first entered this House.  If I had known at the time when I was first invited to accept membership of this House that I would have to fight eight general elections in a period of 15 and a half years, I certainly would have thought over the matter more seriously and probably come to a different decision. I have endeavoured, I do not say I have succeeded, to serve my constituents as well as any other Deputy who has been prepared to give part-time service to his constituency during the 16 years that have intervened since 1922.  I feel called upon to pay a typist and to pay postage, which has never been less than £2 5s. to £2 10s. per week.  Deputies who live in the country and who live in their constituencies appear to be under the impression that Deputies who reside in Dublin or outside their constituencies are not called upon to bear any expense compared with what they are called upon to bear.  I travel to my constituency periodically.  I fairly often go down on a Saturday or Sunday and come back on Monday and very seldom do I find anybody to pay my hotel expenses.  I pay motor-car hire in order to get around a constituency where there is a very bad train service and, except on one occasion, I never claimed any return for that.  The Minister for Finance, or his advisers, can bear that out from the records.  I hesitate to intervene in this debate simply because I am not entirely dependent upon the allowance I have been in receipt of but I have had to pay my personal expenses in the majority of the eight general elections that I have contested and you cannot fight a general election and sponge on people during that period.  If you fight <Col N="1356" /> a general election it costs you something and as well as bearing personal expenses in fighting a general election I have to suffer loss of pay in the position which I occupy and pay a substitute during the period I am called upon to attend to my public duties.  I hesitate, however, and have hesitated to go before the commission or to speak in this House to make a plea, a personal appeal or plea, on my own behalf but I intervene simply because I do not understand how certain colleagues of mine, the majority of my colleagues, at the present time, can keep a family in decency and at the same time do their work efficiently for their constituency.  All of us have responsibilities to our families.  I have a wife and four children and the last person in the world I would like to see auditing my personal accounts is my own wife.  I thank goodness that she is not very inquisitive in that direction.  However, I also feel and in this I speak for a future and greater Labour Party that we can never get into a bigger Labour Party in the future the type of men that would be helpful to build up a Party, that would make good Deputies of a Labour Party, until the citizens of this country and the workers of the country, particularly, who want that type of man make it possible for him to come into this House and bear as little financial embarrassment as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I hope the Deputies who are living in their constituencies will consult with some of those who live in the City of Dublin, who pay as much attention, although they live in the City of Dublin, to their constituency as perhaps some who live in their own constituency.  The fact that I have been returned, and it is a great honour, at the head of the poll five times out of eight general elections, at any rate, returned in the eight general elections, is, in the opinion of a big section of my constituents, a tribute to the fact that I have made some attempt to do my work fairly efficiently.  I would hesitate very much to say I do my work very efficiently, but if we are to do our work efficiently, and particularly if the workers of this country are to have in this House in the future men of the <Col N="1357" /> type that will truly represent them, men who will come here as the workers should expect them to come, without making sacrifices at the expense of their wives and children, I think it is in the interests of the State, and particularly in the interests of a future and bigger Labour Party, that this Bill, in its present form, should pass through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the opposition to this Bill, as I presume I may describe Deputy Linehan, has said that he has been strengthened in his opposition by the speeches which he has heard in support of the Bill, and particularly, I think, by the speeches of the Minister for Finance.  I regret that I am such a bad advocate for such a very good measure.  The fact that the Bill has had the misfortune to be so ill-served by the Minister who is responsible for piloting it through the House, nevertheless does not detract from the public value of the Bill.  I feel the Bill is a good Bill.  The Government feel that the Bill is a necessary Bill, and we are supported in that attitude by those who have had previous responsibility for the government of this country.  It would have been quite easy for the Leaders of the Opposition to have made the sort of political capital out of this Bill which the Leader of the Labour Party has attempted to make, but they have borne responsibility; they perhaps will be called upon to bear responsibility in the future; they have done something to bring the State into being, as we have done something to build it up economically, and as we have done something to develop State organisation here constitutionally.  Both of us share a great responsibility for what has been done already in this country, and for what has yet to be done.  It is because we are conscious of that responsibility, and because we feel that the whole future of the country depends, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, on the preservation of the importance and independence of this House, that we have come here and have been facing the sort of misrepresentation which has been so glibly flung at us in this House because of this Bill.  We are telling the people now that, if they do want to <Col N="1358" /> have representative democracy in this country, they must make it possible for every man of talent and every man of ability to come in here and serve the public weal without involving himself in too great sacrifices&mdash;sacrifices which no man, who was conscious of his family responsibilities, would be justified in undertaking.  That is our justification for this measure.</P>
      <P>We have heard a great deal, of course, about the plight of the farmers, and a great deal about the plight of the poor.  I have said that one of the things we want to ensure, if we are going to have good government in this country, is that the independence and importance of this House shall be preserved and shall be free from the dictates of all vested interests.  Now, it is remarkable that those who have opposed this Bill are, in general, those who can afford to make the sacrifices that they have been so ready to ask others to make.</P>

      <P>At any rate, there are those whose speeches in this House might easily be in the nature of a professional advertisement for them, or there might be those who are the tools of vested interests.  As has been said already by Deputy Cogan, the poor are always used as an excuse for every mean and petty statement.  We have heard already about the 75,000 people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, and we were told that this House had concentrated its whole attention upon this measure. The Deputy who made that statement knew that it was an untrue statement. The amount of parliamentary time that has been devoted to the consideration of this measure is comparatively small and, in so far as it is longer than was justifiable, it is longer than was justifiable because of the sort of speeches we have heard against the Bill.  Some of those were. I daresay, dishonest speeches, because, even while Deputies have been making these speeches, they have been trying to justify to their own consciences the fact that they were <Col N="1359" /> going to benefit under the Bill and were not going to take any steps to case their consciences by returning, as is commonly done, to the Exchequer, as conscience money, the money to which they feel they are not entitled. When a man thinks he has wrongfully got money from the public purse he returns that money to the Minister for Finance in the form of conscience money.  To-day, however, we had Deputy Bennett saying that, after all, even though this proposal was a crime and an injustice, he was going to enjoy the fruits of that injustice&mdash;in other words, that, as somebody else has said elsewhere, his hands were going to be dripping with the fat of sacrilege.</P>
      <P>Then we heard Deputy Cogan telling us to-day, notwithstanding what he said on the previous stage of the Bill, that he is going to hand over his £10 a month&mdash;to whom?&mdash;to the election organisation in his constituency: his own organisation, in other words&mdash; this baby which he hopes to rear and feed until it becomes the new farmers' parliamentary organisation in this country.  Does Deputy Cogan think that because he is going to hand that money over to his own election machine in his own constituency he is not doing that in order to defray some part of his parliamentary expenses?  That is a sham and a humbug.  If any Deputy does not want to draw this extra allowance he can do either of two things.  He can return it, as conscience money, every month to the Minister for Finance, and I shall acknowledge that by public advertisement or else he can devote it to public charities.  There is a number of very estimable charities in each constituency which, I am quite certain, for the cost of the advertisement, would be quite prepared to acknowledge the receipt of £10 every month from Deputy Linehan, Deputy Cogan, or any other Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be quite clear about this matter.  This money will be paid every month&mdash;not as a salary, as Deputy Linehan said&mdash;to every Deputy in order to help him to serve his constituents in the way in which Deputy Seán <Col N="1360" /> MacEoin has stated here to-day&mdash;and I believe it&mdash;he is called upon to serve them.  And that is the position in every constituency where there are active, hard-working Deputies and where the divisions between the different political Parties are particularly keen, because no Deputy can afford to go asleep on his job and not look after his constituents.  It is the duty of the Government of to-day, just as it would be the duty of those who may be called upon to form the Government of to-morrow, to see that every member of this House is in a position to discharge his duties to his constituents and that he will not have the excuse, when the general election comes on, to say, &ldquo;I was too poor to serve you in the way you wished me to serve you when you first elected me.&rdquo;  That is one of the reasons for this measure. The responsible people, I think, in this House, have come to the conclusion after a great deal of investigation and out of the facts known to them, that this Bill is necessary.  As Deputy Davin said, he could not get any member of his Party to go before the commission that was set up in this connection and make a poor mouth; neither could we, and neither, I am sure, could our opponents, the principal members of the Opposition.  You could not get the people who were most deeply affected by this thing and most acutely touched by it, to go before that commission of 12 or 14 people and make a confession, so to speak, of their affairs.  But instead of that, those who are responsible for directing the affairs of this country and the principal people in the Opposition, know very well that some of the best men in both Parties, as well as, I may say, some of the best men in the Labour Party, have been severely crippled by the sacrifices they have had to make over the past ten years particularly.</P>
    <P>You cannot expect a system of representative government to be carried on in the letter and in the spirit as long as that condition of affairs exists.  Ultimately, the best men in both Parties are the men who have had to make the biggest sacrifices and who, because of that, are the most limited in their private means and therefore cannot <Col N="1361" /> make the sort of heavy sacrifices which the development of parliamentary government in this country is going to exact from those who take an active part in public life in the future.  Accordingly this would mean that they would ultimately be driven out of public life in this country.  Who is going to take their place?  You are either going to have the man of means, the man who had made money, the man who has what is known as an unearned income, or the man whose concerns were big enough for him always to be in a position to retain people to look after his affairs in exactly the same way, possibly, as he could look after them himself and who therefore would be free to devote himself to public affairs in this country; or else you are going to have the man of absolutely no property, with no interests except his own interests to serve, and who, in order to get in here and avail himself of the opportunity which, he may think, membership of this House will give him to serve those interests, will be prepared to make every sort of promise, to do every sort of thing, to come in here and, possibly, eventually sit on the Government Benches here and administer the whole affairs of the State.  Or we may get another type of person, the type of person who represents a vested interest, who is retained to look after some sectional interest, and who by one means or another has been able to get a seat here in this House.</P>

      <P>We heard a speech here to-day from the Chairman of the Labour Party.  I think it was an extraordinary speech for the chairman of a supposedly democratic Party to make on a measure of this sort.  What is the position which may arise?  You may get a person in this position, that he can retire from the Civil Service, that he can become an employee of a Civil Service organisation, that he can enter into such a contract with that organisation that he has Civil Service tenure, and as good as Civil Service pension terms, and that he draws a bigger salary from that organisation than he would have drawn if he continued <Col N="1362" /> to serve as a civil servant. Then you can get him elected for a constituency down in the country.  He will come in here and will not be the servant of his constituency, but will do as Deputy Norton has done on this Bill.  He will obey the crack of his master's whip, and we will have branches of his organisation up and down through the country passing resolutions binding him, mind you, not to act in accordance with his own conscience but to act as a servant of this vested interest is told to act by those who are his masters.  It does not matter then whether there may be in his Party members who cannot do their duties fully without involving too heavy sacrifices if the parliamentary allowance is insufficient.  No; Deputy Norton will get up as he did in this House to-day and as Deputy Cogan said, use the poor as an excuse for every mean and contemptible action.  Ignoring the fact that we are trying to get a democratic Government in this country, trying to make it possible for independent men to come in and serve the people, trying, as Deputy Mulcahy said, to preserve the independence of this House, he will attempt to becloud the issue with all sorts of false calumny, and by drawing in the poor and the unemployed. This Government has done more to look after the interests of the common people of this country than Deputy Norton ever did.</P>

Even allowing for a generous exercise of his discretion in permitting an amendment to be handed in, it is a very generous and very wide exercise of that discretion to allow an amendment to be handed to Deputies two hours before it is moved on a Bill about which there is no urgency and which can be passed next year or the year afterwards without any great injury.  This is a Bill about which there is no great urgency, no need for haste.  In the circumstances, I consider it is most unfair that we should be asked to discuss these amendments on two hours' notice, particularly when the Government had adequate time in which to submit them.</P>

      <P>It is quite true there is a discretion vested in the Ceann Comhairle to take notices of motions or amendments on shorter notice.  A very good case should be put in respect of an amendment on short notice, which would deal with a special aspect <Col N="1368" /> of the matter.  The Minister has indicated that the Government must have time for consideration of amendments moved by Deputies in order that they may make up their minds.  I put it to you that the Government had two days after Deputy Norton's amendment was put in, and that gave them sufficient time to make up their minds on the subject and there is no excuse or case for handing in an amendment at 3.30 to-day.  It may have been that it was put into the Dáil Office at 11 o'clock this morning.  This amendment ought to have been in the hands of Deputies this morning and, if the Government even utilised one day out of the two days still further to make up their minds, there was yet ample time to enable Deputies to be informed. I submit, with great respect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle, that the exercise of the Ceann Comhairle's discretion is limited under the Standing Orders to a case of special urgency and it is not a case in which the Ceann Comhairle has a voluntary discretion to take an amendment at the shortest possible notice.</P>

I am putting it to you that in this case it is not the case of a special amendment, but of an amendment moved by the Government arising out of one proposed by Deputy Davin.  I submit they have considered it, and, in their wisdom, exercised a discretion as to whether they should not themselves submit another amendment.  The members of the Dáil ought to have had the amendments in their hands this morning.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 8 inclusive are out of order, as they are obviously amendments that should have been moved on the Committee Stage.  Amendments Nos. 9, 12 and 13 arise out of an amendment moved by the Minister in Committee. It might be argued that that ministerial amendment was of an explanatory character.  Furthermore, the Deputy challenged a division on the section but, nevertheless, the fact that the amendment was inserted in Committee leaves the House at liberty to attempt to rescind the amendment on the Report Stage.  For that reason, I am allowing Deputy Davin's amendments to be moved.  I have suggested to the Deputy in a note to him which, perhaps, might possibly be regarded as impinging on the merits of the matter, that amendments Nos. 9 and 12 would abate one pension and amendment No. 13 would abate the other.  Presumably the Deputy did not intend to abate both.  If so amendments Nos. 9 and 12 might not be moved, and a decision taken on amendment No. 13.  That, of course, is a matter for decision by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>We are not questioning your ruling on the amendments on the green paper, but I asked the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for a ruling on the <Col N="1371" /> question as to whether, having regard to the Standing Orders, and even to the discretion vested in the Ceann Comhairle, it is fair to hand us two ministerial amendments at 3.30 to-day and expect us to discuss them at 5.30. The Minister for Finance has said that these amendments are consequential on seeing the amendments submitted at Labour Deputies.  But the Labour Party amendments were submitted at 4 o'clock on Friday last and nothing emerged following their submission until 3.30 to-day, when I discovered this on my desk.  I submit the Ministry had adequate time in which to present alternative amendments if they did not like the Labour Party amendments.  The House is being asked, on a Bill for which no haste can be pleaded, to discuss two ministerial amendments handed in two hours ago.  I suggest these amendments are not in order, having regard to the terms of the Standing Order, and I submit that even the exercise of the Ceann Comhairle's discretion should not bring us down to the point of having to discuss amendments handed to us two hours before we are asked to debate them.  That is using the discretion of the Chair to a very wide extent.  We do not think there is any need to have these amendments dealt with to-day.  There is no urgency about the Bill.</P>

They do not run counter to the amendments which I have accepted from the Deputy's Party, in fact one of them meets him to an extent.  I am further strengthened in my decision to accept the amendment by the fact that this is a Money Bill; it is a matter of finance and the first ministerial amendment proposes a reduction of charge.  The second ministerial amendment makes no change in the Bill as it left Committee.  The Chair would scarcely be justified in refusing an amendment which is a reduction of charge.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment moved by the Minister on the Committee Stage was handed in and dealt with in the very same way and the Minister can make lengthy speeches and give lengthy explanations when he wants to.  He was not inclined to be very eloquent or make lengthy explanations of the amendment which he handed in at equally short notice as the ones handed in to-day.  However, the amendment which I am moving on behalf of the members of this Party is for the purpose of making it impossible for dual pensions to be paid to the same people.  The members of this Party, through the leader of the Party, in speeches made in this House on previous occasions intimated their desire and intention to make it possible for compensation or gratuities to be paid to persons who rendered military or ministerial service to this State over a certain troublesome period, but there is a limit, in the opinion of the members of our Party, to the extent of the generosity to which the House should go in matters of this kind.  The members of this Party are of the opinion that a pension of £500 a year is, if you like, excessively generous, whereas under the terms of the Bill as it now stands it is possible for an ex-Minister in receipt of a military service pension to draw a sum far in excess of the figure of £500 a year.  I do not know whether it would influence the members of this House in matters of this kind if I made a comparison between the pensions which people get as a result of long service in the public service when compared with ministerial or ex-ministerial maximum pensions under this particular Bill.  An ex-Minister with seven years' service to this Stage will, under the terms of this Bill as it now stands, receive a pension of £500 a year but a public servant, a civil servant, would require to be an <Col N="1376" /> assistant secretary of a Department of State and to have given about 40 years' service before he would receive the same pension.  An ex-Minister will receive £500 a year after seven years' service but an assistant secretary of a Department, with a salary of £1,000 a year, will only receive a pension of £500 a year after 40 years' service.  I hope that will sink into the minds of the members of the House who may be inclined to vote with enthusiasm for the Bill as it now stands.  The intention of this amendment, at any rate, is to make it impossible, if we can do so, for ex-Ministers to receive two pensions from the State&mdash;the same employer&mdash;at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment but I propose instead to ask the House to accept the amendment of which I have given notice to-day and around which the discussion up to the present has centred. I should like to say that I think that Deputy Davin has not been quite fair to the House when he has tried to equate the position of a Minister to the position of civil servants and to imply that there is nobody except a Minister who could receive such a pension upon such a short term as seven years.  The Deputy has been in this House when Bills were passed dealing with the judiciary of this country and under those Bills it would be possible for members of the judiciary to receive such a pension after such a short period of time in certain circumstances.  But apart altogether from that, it is almost misleading for the Deputy to say that this can be done, that an ex-Minister can receive a pension of £500 a year after only seven years' service.  The Deputy knows that there are many ex-Ministers who have served more than seven years and quite a long time more than seven years, that they will be probably called to the service of their country again in the normal course of political life in this country and that, for every additional year of service that they give over and above this seven years, they do not get any increase in salary but that for every year a civil servant or judge serves they do, up to a maximum of two-thirds of their salary.  So <Col N="1377" /> that, you already have in this country men who have held high public office but no more responsible office I contend, than a Minister holds, who, having served 15 years, can retire with a pension of £2,000 a year.  They are not held up to the same sort of public obloquy as I and my colleagues and those who held ministerial office in this country before and those who will hold ministerial office after us have been held up by Deputy Davin.  The main point of the Deputy's amendment is this&mdash;to make sure that a person who served his country from 1916 to 1923 and who draws what is known as a military service pension, and who had to justify his title to draw that pension before an impartial tribunal, is now going to be deprived of that pension.</P>

      <P>And why?  Because in the interim since 1923, in the 15 years that have elapsed since 1923, he has devoted himself to the public service in this House and in the Government of his country.  Whatever service he has given since 1923 is either going to be disregarded in so far as he has a pension for military service rendered from 1916 to 1923&mdash;that either one or the other of those pensions is to be wiped out.  That is what the Deputy is contending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps that is not in the Deputy's mind now, but I cannot see what else was in his mind. He said it was to prevent one man from having a dual pension.  As I pointed out on the Committee Stage of this Bill, while it would be possible for an ex-Minister to draw a military service pension, that could only be in respect of the period from 1916 to 1923. If he afterwards is elected to this Dáil and takes office as a member of the Government of this country, then he creates a new claim to pension, not by virtue of the service he rendered from 1916 to 1923, but by virtue of the service he renders subsequently in his new capacity as a member of the Government of this country.  That was the point that was at stake here.  The Shanley Committee, quite fairly and <Col N="1378" /> properly, I believe, adverted to the fact that these were two absolutely different types of service, that, in so far as the military service pension was of any value whatsoever, it had been rendered for what was notionally a prolonged period of service, and that it must have been rendered over that period in circumstances of great difficulty and danger and, accordingly, the committee said: &ldquo;It is not right that the pension which has been given in respect of services rendered during that period and under those circumstances should be wiped out, or that the Ministerial pension which arises under quite a different set of circumstances, and quite a different form of service to the country, and in quite a different time, should be abated merely because a person had served his country during the revolutionary period from 1916 to 1923.&rdquo;  They took cognisance of that fact and, in my view, rightly took cognisance of it, and that was the principle upon which the Government was proceeding.  When the Government got this report, they studied it very carefully.  They could not accept the, Shanley Committee's view in regard to Ministerial salaries, having regard to the circumstances of the time, but they did accept the view of the Committee in regard to pensions, and, mind you, when they accepted that view, they were fortified by expressions of opinion from all parts of the House that one of the things that ought to be done in the public interest was to make proper provision for those who had served in the Government of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as I said, the Government examined this matter.  They saw that the amount involved was comparatively small, was much less, even in present circumstances, than £500 a year, and was not likely in any circumstances to amount to more than £1,500 a year, and, even to that, for only a comparatively short period of time.  In so far as most of the men who enjoy military service pensions are no longer young men&mdash;most of them are bordering on 50 or over 50 years of age&mdash;therefore, the burden that was going to be imposed was not going to be a substantial burden.  With all these facts in mind, <Col N="1379" /> and bearing in mind, firstly, what I consider to be the absolute justice of the case, and, secondly, that as the amount was comparatively small at the present time, and would have been comparatively small at any time, we were prepared to give effect to the recommendations of the Shanley Committee in this regard, and to allow a person who had earned his military service pension by military service from 1916 to 1923 to draw that pension and to draw a Ministerial pension as well, if he had qualified for a Ministerial pension in equally difficult circumstances&mdash;in equally difficult circumstances, I say, and if anybody wishes to hold that against me, I make him a present of it&mdash;which have prevailed up to the present period.</P>
    <P>That was the position of the Government, but what did we find?  We found this: That the moment we were prepared to give effect to that principle, there was going to be an attempt, on the part of some sections of the House at least, to blackmail Ministers because they might be interested parties, and to blackmail ex-Ministers for the same reason, into accepting financial obligations without due inquiry into them. Because we were prepared to accept the recommendation of the Shanley Committee in regard to Ministerial pensions, then we were going to be asked to open the flood-gate everywhere, and to find the country involved, perhaps, in one instance, it has been estimated, in an expenditure of over £40,000 per annum, simply because, in order to blackmail Ministers, some people were prepared to draw false analogies between these two pensions and in an entirely different set of circumstances.  Therefore, because somebody might falsely say that Ministers, when dealing with their own position and their own cases were prepared to do this and that and the other, when they came along to deal with a certain other class of society, even if the cases should be shown to be demonstrably not the same, they would not apply the same set of rules and principles to these other particular cases.  Simply because Ministers were not going to put themselves in that position, then the Ministers come here, being charged with responsibility for the public purse, <Col N="1380" /> and feeling that they cannot put themselves in a position in which their control over that public purse is going to be weakened by the sort of misrepresentation which is going to be levelled against them&mdash;then Ministers are prepared to say that, even though they feel that the recommendation of the Shanley Committee was well founded, and though they and other people like them are going to be the sufferers, they are not prepared in these circumstances, for the sake of what it might mean to them or others, to put themselves in a position in which their control over the public purse would be weakened, and are not going to submit to the blackmail of interested parties.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am prepared to oppose Deputy Davin's amendment, but to give effect to it, in so far as the military service pensions are concerned, by the amendment I put down, with this saver: that we shall rule out a pension under the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1934, in any case in which the pensioner is also entitled to a widow's pension.  There is one case of a pension which, I believe, is long overdue.  If we went all the way to apply the full rigour of Deputy Davin's idea and exclude completely military service pensions&mdash;to compel the military service pensioner's widow's pension to be abated completely by the fact that the person receives a Ministerial pension or a widow's pension or also holds a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, it would mean, in the case of this particular widow, to whom I have referred, that she would lose £10 and the State would save £10 pen annum.  Now, as I have said, this case is long overdue, and I do not think it would be just or that we would be entitled, or would be expected by Deputy Davin or Deputy Norton to mulct her to that extent.  As I say, I am prepared to accept the deletion of the words &ldquo;military service pensions&rdquo; from the exempted moneys covered by Section 23 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  We get a rather unusual reasoning as to why this <Col N="1381" /> amendment has been submitted by the Government and why it has been submitted late, but anybody who talks on this Bill must be prepared to withstand the foul abuse and gutter variety of oratory in which the Minister for Finance indulges.  Phrases like &ldquo;blackmail&rdquo; have been used here.  On the previous Bill, I was subjected to a characteristically low attack from the Minister for Finance who stated that, while he was before a court martial, I was wearing His Majesty's uniform.  I want to take this opportunity, Sir, of saying that, if the Minister refers to His Majesty's uniform as being the uniform of His Majesty's Army, His Majesty's Navy or the uniform of any of His Majesty's armed forces, I never served for one day in them.  I did serve in the Post Office as a boy messenger, and I make no apologies to the Minister for Finance or to anybody else for having served in that capacity.  That fact, however, was used to-day by the Minister, with that specially tortuous mind of his, to try to misrepresent me before the public.  I do not think it is any crime to have served in the Civil Service in the days before 1922 or in the days before 1916.  I would have been in good company in that respect, in any case.  Many members of this House have served in the Civil Service. I resigned from the Civil Service and might have got a pension.  My resignation was due under Article 10 of the Treaty, but I disliked that Article intensely and refused to take a pension in those circumstances.  The Minister for Finance chooses to misrepresent me here, but I think my record among those who know me will at least protect me against that kind of muck-and slime-slinging in which the Minister indulges and which is a disgrace to a ministerial office in this country.  However, Sir, even at the risk of calling forth that peculiar kind of invective and vituperation in which the Minister for Finance indulges, I want to say something on this amendment and to say something later on the Bill, generally.  I heard the Minister talking, in that hysterical way of his, about blackmail.  He tells us that the reason the Government has decided to amend the Bill is because there might be blackmail.  Well, a Minister for <Col N="1382" /> Finance ought to know what is the meaning of blackmail, but apparently this Minister for Finance does not know what the meaning of the word &ldquo;blackmail&rdquo; is.  I take it that his reference to blackmail refers to a motion which was submitted by the Labour Party and which asked the Dáil to request the Government to introduce proposals for the purpose of amending the Unemployment Assistance Acts so as to provide that military service pensions payable to Old I.R.A. men will not be taken into account when calculating the rate of benefit to which such men are entitled under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  In this Bill as submitted to the Dáil we saw clearly that pensions payable to members of the Ministry who served in the Old I.R.A. were excluded for the purpose of the pension they were to receive as Ministers under this Bill. If that represented a considered declaration of the Government's policy in respect of those pensions, why should not that same arrangement be made applicable to the Old I.R.A. men, the vast majority of whom are getting pensions which according to the answer given by the Minister for Defence to-day amount only to £17 18s. per year?  When an Old I.R.A. man has a pension of 7/- per week, or 1/- per day, and he seeks unemployment assistance benefit for himself at the rate of 7/-, the State says to him: &ldquo;You cannot get unemployment assistance benefit because you already have 1/- per day from the State as an Old I.R.A. pensioner.&rdquo;  But under this Bill you can receive an Old I.R.A. pension of £300 or £350 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and still get another State pension of £500 per year.  The blackmail to which the Minister referred is an endeavour by the Labour Party to ensure that the Old I.R.A. men will not have their military service pensions of 7/- taken into consideration when seeking unemployment assistance benefit.  One would have thought that that was a progressive kind of reform to undertake, but the Minister described it as blackmail, and <Col N="1383" /> in order that his political face may be saved from the danger of any smudge getting on it, we are told that this Bill must now be amended, so as to prevent the possibility of the Government having to whistle two tunes at the one time when we come to discuss the other motion.  That is the only reason for the Government's proposal to amend the Bill.  Our view is that if you are not going to give the Old I.R.A.&mdash; people who have small pensions&mdash;freedom from calculation of those pensions in assessing their means for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Act, the State ought not to exclude substantially higher pensions in the case of Ministers who are likely to be eligible or are eligible for the pensions provided in this Bill.  If there is going to be one law on the subject, it ought to be applicable all round.  But what we are doing in this Bill, as introduced, and as passed through the Committee Stage, is that we are going to exempt Old I.R.A. pensions for the purpose of entitlement to the Ministerial pensions, but we are going to make a deduction from the unemployment assistance payable to Old I.R.A. men who are in receipt of small pensions.  It is for that reason, and to bring this Bill into conformity with that position, that this amendment has been put down.  If we are going to have one law it ought to be for everybody.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained the reasons for it, and while I think the recommendation of the Committee was justified, and could be justified if properly argued, I quite despair of either a just or a proper argument of it so long as Deputy Norton remains in Irish public life.  Accordingly, I feel that to avoid the misrepresentation&mdash;and the false analogies which would be drawn here-after&mdash;of Ministers who are themselves in the position of having been awarded a military service pension in respect of services rendered to this country in a military capacity from 1916 to 1923, and who become also entitled to a pension in respect of services rendered as a member of the Government of this country, during the period, mainly, subsequent to 1923, as the amount of misrepresentation which would be indulged in would, I think, publicly embarrass Ministers doing their duty to the people so far as the public understanding is concerned, I, for one, and those associated with me, cannot accept that position.  I think that is unfortunate, and that the effect on public life is not going to be good.  If we are going to have democracy, and if we are going to expect from Ministers the disinterested service necessary to keep the public life of any country clean, we have to see to it that those who come here to discharge the responsibilities of Ministers should, at any rate, by virtue of the great responsibilities which they do discharge and the wide powers entrusted to them and the trust reposed in them, that they ought to be placed in a position of <Col N="1387" /> comparatively easy circumstances after they had served this country during the period that the people called them to do so.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that nowhere, in any field of endeavour in this or any other country, could you find individuals carrying greater responsibilities than Ministers of this State do now, and Ministers of this State did before we came into office and, I suppose, Ministers of this State will carry after both our predecessors and ourselves have long passed from the public sphere.  But it appears that Ministers must not merely discharge those duties, but they must be held up to public obloquy, to personal misrepresentation, simply in order to serve a little Party spleen, and, in order that the scope for such spleen may be diminished, I am proposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say with regard to the Minister's statement is that it shows that the Ministry are becoming somewhat sensitive.  I wish to Heaven a certain amount of the sensitiveness that they are showing at the present time could have been felt by them for the last six years and then we might have a less miserable picture painted by Deputy Norton and the members of the Labour Party to-night, and by us for the last four or five years.  I do not know whether the Labour Party are to be congratulated at the present moment for what they are achieving here.  They are, at any rate, achieving something. They are forcing the Ministry to accept an amendment from themselves dealing with a particular point.  I do not know whether on this occasion they are to be congratulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is showing that the Ministers are more sensitive with regard to public matters than they were, that is to be welcomed.  If the fact is that the Labour Party are able to impress the Ministers to make up their minds on certain matters by coming out more into the open and attacking them from the outside rather than colloguing with them, then we wish, on more important and bigger <Col N="1388" /> matters for the general welfare of the country, the Labour Party greater success than they are achieving at the present time.  I consider that the Minister's speech to-night contains an element of cowardice in it that, I hope, will quickly pass from the Ministry and that, now they are apparently making themselves prospectively poorer than they otherwise might have been, that their self-esteem will return to them and they will look on the situation in the country with calmer eyes.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene, but if the Labour Party could take any responsibility, and I am sure it could not, for the concluding sentence of the Minister for Finance, it it would be something to be partly proud of to get from the Minister the admission that, from his point of view ex-Ministers had rendered equally good service to this State as himself and his colleagues are now doing.  That, I take it, was the impression the Minister intended to convey to the House.  It has been suggested to me that in moving this amendment the Labour Party were consciously or unconsciously victimising some of the ex-Ministers.  In putting down the amendment the Party had no regard whatsoever to persons.  It would be far from the thoughts of any of us who have responsibility for putting up these amendments to the House to do it in a fashion that would inflict punishment on any person whether an existing Minister or an ex-Minister.</P>

      <P>Certain reflections properly arise in connection with this amendment.  My Party and I supported this Bill, and I would vote for it again to-morrow.  I would support it again to-morrow because the principles enshrined in it are sound, and designed for the protection of the people themselves.  The Ministers of this State are, in our judgement, entitled to remuneration consistent with their services.  It is unnecessary now for us to recapitulate what was said on the Second Stage.  This reflection does present itself&mdash;the passage of this amendment means that if a Minister <Col N="1389" /> of this or the previous Government had served in the British Army and was in the enjoyment of a British Army pension, he could draw his entire pension as Minister of the State of this country.  But for the crime that he was in the Irish Army and served his own country he is to be denied.  If he served as a mercenary in any army on the Continent, and got a pension for his war services, he would draw his Minister's pension, but because he was guilty of the folly of fighting as a soldier in the Irish Army he is to be penalised.  That is a principle that I will not vote for.  I have no apology to make, even to the rabble to whom Deputy Norton appeals.</P>

      <P>No one but the uninformed rabble to whom Deputy Norton looks in adopting this attitude will be deceived or carried away by any misrepresentation as to our attitude. That gives rise to this reflection&mdash;time and again the predecessors of the present Government were challenged with a challenge very similar to that made by the Labour Party to the Government of to-day.  They were told that what they were doing&mdash;as they saw it in the best interests of the country&mdash;<Col N="1390" /> would be misrepresented up and down the country for the purpose of stirring up uninformed prejudice against them. Knowing as they knew, with all their political experience, that the actions that they felt themselves under an obligation to take in the best interests of this country would be misrepresented to the people and political capital made out of it, they stood their ground and said: &ldquo;Though we know that this may cause us considerable loss of support in the country, we will face misrepresentation by our opponents, because we know that what we are doing is right.&rdquo;  They were misrepresented and they were politically injured in the country.  And that kind of misrepresentation eventually drove them out of office.</P>
      <P>They did their duty, according to their lights, and there are many Deputies in this House who remember it.  They were patriots as well as statesmen.  They said to those who misrepresented them to the people: &ldquo;Do your worst; we see our duty and we are prepared to do it, whatever the political consequences.&rdquo;  Can the Minister deny it?  Will the Minister compare his conduct and the conduct of his Government with the conduct of the Government that preceded them&mdash;with the conduct of their predecessors.  The Minister presents to this House an amendment which he himself says should command no support.  Does the Minister remember when his Party were putting up amendments of that kind to the Cumann na nGaedheal legislation?  Does the Minister remember the Cumann na nGaedheal Government resisting these amendments because they believed they owed a certain duty to the country?  Do the members of the Fianna Fáil Party remember the days when they went around the country consciously misrepresenting what the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were doing?</P>

      <P>Is there not a sad comparison between the resolute stand taken by the Minister's predecessors in doing certain things which misrepresentation made unpopular with the people and the position taken up by the Minister, who despairingly says: &ldquo;My record would not stand criticism of that kind; if I were misrepresented in that way I could not face it; it would get me down&rdquo;?  The Minister has deplored the deterioration in the conduct of politics in this country. Whatever deterioration there is it is trifling compared with the fact that a leading Minister in this House can get up and say that he was forced into doing what was wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister did not say it in so many words.  There has certainly been a terrible falling away.  I have never yet, up to this, heard in this State any public man making such an admission.  I am very happy to feel that no colleague of mine on these benches has ever or ever will make that kind of statement.  Certain of my colleagues lost their precedence in the public life of this State, and even lost their seats in this House, because they scorned the recourse to subterfuge. They have been rejected by the country but they have been rejected in the knowledge that no threat, no misrepresentation ever made them move one-quarter of an inch from what they conceived to be their duty.  They faced whatever criticism they got, conscious of the fact that they were doing their duty.  For a good deal of that criticism I was myself responsible.  They have stood their ground against all the criticism and misrepresentation, and they gave an air of purity to the public life of this country.  I am proud to have men like that for my colleagues. I think the Minister would be a great deal more comfortable were he able to say as much for his own actions.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene in order to stress a point made by Deputy Dillon.  It is an astonishing state of affairs that a civil servant or a British Army officer or an American or Continental Army officer can draw a full pension as ex-Minister of this State but that they are going to be penalised if they fought for this State only and this country only.  Deputy Dillon said that this should not refer only to the person who served in the National Army.  It actually refers to a person who served from 1916 to 1921 &mdash;a person who did not take part on either side in the civil war.  I think that is very unfair and very unjust. Furthermore, this amendment affects, I think, only two Ministers.</P>

      <P>There are two particularly affected.  There may be one or two others.  But this does not increase the sum to be paid until the Fianna Fáil Government goes out of office.  There is only a small number, at any rate.  Now it is a pity that the House is establishing such a bad principle.  It is only for a very short period of time, anyway, because 20 years from now will shift the whole lot of them.  There is no question about that.  Twenty years more will finish off every man who fought from 1916 to 1921.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was looking for it.  Indeed, I think 20 years is too long an estimate.  The strain of these two periods has been very severe and we find that the death roll is increasing daily.  Yet because of some snag in the mind of the Labour Party who put up the amendment we have the Government running away from it. The Labour Party in this are going contrary to one of their own principles, because they have been urging that a military service pension should not be taken into account when fixing the dole or the old age pension.  What should apply in the one case ought to apply in the other.</P>

      <P>I desire to make some remarks in regard to Reference No. 8&mdash;variation of duty on certain surface-glazed clay tiles.  A duty was imposed to the extent of 50 per cent., and this duty now is an increase on the former duty.  I think that the Minister scarcely realises what those new duties amount to.  The duty on 3×3 tiles is 335 per cent. and the duty on 4×2 tiles is 375 per cent.  We could all approve of the present producers in this country getting adequate protection for their goods, and in fact being encouraged to produce a greater variety of goods, but the manufacture of those glazed tiles is a highly specialised matter.  The fact that a factory may be able to produce one set of tiles satisfactorily does not mean that another set may be produced.  Another point is that there are special tiles which must be procured in any case from the other side, and I should like to suggest to the Minister that it is absurd to put a duty of over 300 per cent. on tiles which the present factory cannot produce, or in regard to which the deliveries are so much behind as practically to mean that there is no source of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister would not wish for that.  There are people who have these 6×6 tiles on order for five months, <Col N="1400" /> and others have been waiting four months for 4×4 tiles to make surrounds needed in a housing scheme.  I am sure the Minister would not approve of that delay.  I should like if he would look into the question of the duty and the delay.  I do not wish to let anybody get in goods that are produced by the present factory if they can be delivered in a reasonable time.  The Minister will find that there is plenty of machinery for consulting those who supply the goods, and if that is done, and if it is found that there is unreasonable delay, some provision ought to be made temporarily, at any rate, to allow in certain classes of tiles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy has heard of cases of considerable delay in supplying tiles, and particularly those of the 6×6 size.  There is a licensing provision attached to the duty, and I can promise the Deputy, if I am satisfied the company is unable to supply within a reasonable time, goods required by persons making these tile surrounds, or for similar purposes, the licensing provision will be availed of to overcome the difficulty.  I think it is a matter that would lend itself to discussion between the interests concerned and the officers of my Department.  I agree fully that there should not be protracted delay in meeting requirements of this kind, and if the company is unable to do so, we have a licensing provision to meet that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a Tribunal be established for enquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the present position of public transport (other than air transport) within the area of jurisdiction of the Irish Government, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in particular, the circumstances which have led or contributed to the present unfavourable financial position of the Great Southern Railways and of the other railway companies operating within the said area, and</P>
      <P>(c)  whether any and, if so, what measures are necessary or desirable in order to secure efficient and progressive public transport (other than air transport) in the said area, and</P>
      <P>(d)  in particular, whether&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  any further transport legislation,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(ii)  any changes in the ownership or in the methods of administration or both in the ownership and in the methods of administration of existing transport undertakings,</P>
      <P>are necessary or desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that it is hardly desirable that I should speak at any length upon the transport position, either for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to how the position has arisen, or the lines upon which a solution for it should be sought.  It would, probably, serve and fulfil my duty if I said enough to indicate that the matters set out in the motion are matters of urgent public importance. Some time ago I received from the Great Southern Railways Company, and from the Great Northern Railway Company, representations to the effect that they have reached positions of acute financial stringency, in which they claimed that Government action for their assistance was urgently necessary, <Col N="1402" /> if they were to carry on.  The Great Southern Company informed me that the estimated net income from the entire undertaking, for the present year, would fall short of the amount required to pay interest on debenture stock by a very substantial amount.  A similar intimation was received from the Great Northern Company, that it also estimated it would not earn its working expenses in the current year.  Both companies informed me that their liquid assets are exhausted, except for the amount hypothecated to secure loans raised in recent years to meet capital expenditure, and that their position in the matter of cash resources, to carry on the day-to-day work of the undertakings, was precarious.  In each case, also, fresh capital expenditure was urgent.  In the case of the Great Southern Company a very substantial figure was mentioned as representing the new capital required by it, to enable it to meet expenditure involved in the closing of uneconomic sections of the line, and developing road transport.  It is clear to everybody, I think, that the company could not hope to raise, in the ordinary way, any new capital at the present time without Government assistance or Government guarantee and, in these circumstances, the Government are satisfied that a major decision on transport policy must now be taken.</P>
    <P>It considers, however, before decisions are made, that a review by a tribunal, established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, should be made, for the purpose of getting a complete picture of the position, and obtaining the recommendations of such a tribunal as to the line of action to be followed.</P>
    <P>Therefore we propose that such a tribunal should be set up.  We are doing that under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, because a tribunal established under that Act has very definite rights and powers.  It has the powers, rights and privileges of a High Court in the matter of securing the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.  Whether the inquiry will be public or private is at the discretion of the tribunal.  That <Col N="1403" /> is to say, the Act, in relation to such a tribunal, provides that &ldquo;it shall not refuse to allow the public, or any portion of the public, to be present at any of its proceedings, unless, in the opinion of the tribunal, it is in the public interest inexpedient to do so, for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given&rdquo;.  I am unable, as yet, to give an indication of the personnel of the tribunal.  I do not think the inquiry we need here is one to be undertaken by transport experts, but rather do we require general consideration of the whole transport position of the country, by people who are concerned, not so much with the technical problems involved as with the difficulties of the problem of providing an efficient transport system in our circumstances which, as Deputies are aware, are somewhat unusual, and present many difficult features from the point of view of carrying on transport undertakings.  I should say that I hope the inquiry to be undertaken will be completed as soon as possible.  Certainly, it is my expectation that we should have the report of the tribunal before us when we meet again after the Christmas Recess.</P>

      <P>The members of this Government have a very odd policy, and a very enviable policy.  They can perpetrate the most astounding follies, and be saluted by the public as geniuses.  When the birds of their folly come home to roost, they can get up and, with a white sheet, repudiate themselves as having been guilty of grave folly, by announcing that the problem has become altogether too much for them to grapple with, and they pass it over to some one else to solve, and enjoy precisely the same applause that greeted their first folly. I have no doubt that the <i>Irish Times</i> will ring with praise of this far-seeing young Minister who has come to realise his own limitations and who has at last called in competent experts to clean up the mess he made.  But the same newspaper described him at one time as a young Lochinvar coming out of the West to save the transport system of Ireland.  &ldquo;Thank God we have a strong hand at the helm&rdquo;&mdash;that was <Col N="1404" /> five years ago.  Every pious head in Pembroke shook in grief because the Fine Gael Party warned the Minister that his 1933 Railway Bill was a cod.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the Official Reports and I remember telling the Minister that that Bill was a preliminary to the Minister coming back to this House to ask for powers to nationalise the railways and to pass the losses over to the taxpayer.  I will direct attention to paragraph (d) (2) of the terms of reference of this commission, which reads: &ldquo;any changes in the ownership or in the methods of administration or both in the ownership and in the methods of administration of existing transport undertakings.&rdquo;  Does this House forget so soon the proceedings that went on here when we were discussing the 1933 Road Transport and Railway Acts?  We were told they were radical and revolutionary, but that they were the children of a brilliant mind determined to cut the Gordian knot at one stroke and restore prosperity to the railway industry.</P>
      <P>Having cut the property of every shareholder by a very large percentage, the railways have gone bum, as has almost every enterprise upon which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has laid the hand of a young Lochinvar.  The beet factories are going bum; the railways are going bum; every other scheme to which he has put his hand in the last six years has gone bum, the Minister having spent more money on them than the most extravagant speculator in the history of Threadneedle Street.  They all peacefully collapsed, with the taxpayers' money poured into them, and we are now invited to pass the whole problem over, not to the Parliament&mdash; the Parliament having, under the Minister's guidance, made a complete fool of itself&mdash;but to some outside body, with a request to them for God's sake to tell us what we are to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seldom find myself in the position of congratulating the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I congratulate him on this resolution.  In <Col N="1405" /> the circumstances, the very best thing he could do is to pass this problem out of his own hands into those of competent men, just as his colleague, Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, adopted that very prudent course in regard to the whole subject of the agricultural industry.  He never did a better day's work for agriculture.  I have no hesitation in saying that the present Minister who is responsible for the transport of this country could not do a better day's work for the transport system than when he disowns all responsibility for remedying the appalling situation into which that system has drifted under his administration. Of course, immense damage has been done, as we all know, not only to the railway system itself, but to the towns which that system served.</P>
    <P>In the panicky, futile, fluthering policy that has obtained for the last five years the railway has been closed down which supplied a large number of small towns.  We were told it was necessary and that the Minister was satisfied adequate transport facilities of an alternative character had been supplied.  Those of us who live near the small towns saw them deteriorate, saw men thrown out of their jobs and thrown into chronic unemployment, simply because the Minister for Industry and Commerce was floundering along through his six weary years of incompetency which now, albeit very late, have come to an end.  Will anybody saddle him with the blame?  Not at all.  The Opposition will be described as factious for having criticised them. Will anybody recall the fact that the very evil which has brought disaster upon the railways now was explained in detail to the Minister when he was discussing the Road Transport Bill or the Railway Bill in 1933?</P>
    <P>What has brought the railways down?  Under the Act of Parliament carried through this House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, hundreds of thousands of pounds were taken out of the railways' treasury and paid out to public carriers, buying them out in order to concentrate the traffic back on the railways.  I remember the Minister being told from these benches, that if he did that, the <Col N="1406" /> only result would be that all these carriers would but lorries and turn into merchants and, instead of charging freight upon what they carried, they would buy the freight at one end of the hall, add the carriage on by way of profit, and sell the freight at the other end of the hall, which they probably did.  I know of one case where a warrior sold two battered lorries to the company for £3,000, and he bought three lorries and set up as a merchant.  Where he used to carry sugar and sundries from A to Z for a freight charge, with the three lorries he bought the sundries and carried them and sold them, and it was found he was well within the Minister's Act in doing so.  An endeavour was made to prosecute in a case of that kind, and the man was acquitted.</P>

      <P>Cruiser or wholesaler, or whatever else he is, he is the offspring of the Minister who is sitting over there.  It was he created him and, having created him, he is now passing him over to a commission to try to dispose of him.  But he has created a problem that will test the ability of any commission to control without doing very serious damage to the whole economic life of the country, and that problem is a problem of the Minister's own creation.  The fund which he compelled the railway company to pay out to those fellows was the fund used for the establishment of those cruising or wholesaling businesses.  The astonishing thing is that the Minister, having been a young Lochinvar in 1933, will march as an old Lochinvar in 1938, and everyone will look forward with equal enthusiasm to the effective measures he proposes to take to save the transport industry again.  If he goes on saving it much longer, it will sink, lock, stock and barrel, with the country behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is this inquiry going to be analogous to the fraudulent inquiry set up to consider the transport problem of the County Donegal?  Does anybody remember that, or have they forgotten all about it?  Does anybody remember <Col N="1407" /> Deputy Neal Blaney and Deputy Brian Brady stumping the country, explaining to the Donegal people that there were going to be deep-sea harbours all around the coast, and that liners were going to come in and bear away the ample merchandise of Donegal to the four corners of the world?  All this was to be in pursuance of a transport tribunal which the Minister was going to set up.  And he set it up, and it delivered a long rambling report which consisted, as to 90 per cent. of it, of pure balderdash, and it was probably thrown into the waste paper basket. Deputy Blaney and Deputy Brady took to their prayers, hoping to God that the people of Donegal had forgotten all about it.  I trust this transport inquiry will not be charged with a similar mission, but that it will be invited to make really constructive proposals, and I trust when they are made that the Minister will not relent of his temporary prudence, but will abide strictly by the orders they give him.</P>
    <P>This last word may be said.  The Minister is not yet in a position to inform the House as to the personnel of the commission.  He says he does not foresee himself inviting transport experts to take part in the personnel, but rather desires people who will view the whole transport problem of Ireland and make comprehensive recommendations.  If the Government's standard of people who take a comprehensive view of such problems is enshrined in the third minority report, God deliver us from the people with a comprehensive view.  I would rather have the narrowest expert view than that.  I suggest that one of the great problems of our transport situation in this country is the long distance between dense centres of population and the catering for an area so embarrassing from the transport point of view.  That problem presents itself acutely in Canada at the present time and has been the subject of almost acrimonious debate between the Canadian Government and the Canadian Pacific Railway.  The Canadian Pacific Railway takes the Minister's line of closing down economic branch lines and maintaining only the big lines.  The Government takes <Col N="1408" /> the line that the railways are something of a public service and may properly continue to operate even when economically they are not justified.</P>
    <P>I would imagine that the Minister would find amongst the railway personnel of Canada some man who has been a considerable time listening to the pros and cons of the arguments on both sides.  He would be the man who would be bound to dominate the solution of our transport problem here. The Minister ought to secure the assistance of such a person as a member of his commission or else invite such a person to come before the commission and give it the benefit of hearing the Canadian view of the problem.  I know that Deputies will not fall into the error of imagining to compare this country with Canada.  But this problem of the scarcity of population is not confined solely to this country.  It is ubiquitous in Canada.  I would imagine that the sort of commission envisaged here should hear the difficulty that has presented itself in Canada and hear what steps are taken and what schemes are set on foot in that country to solve the problem. This commission has our best wishes for the cleaning up of the mess which has arisen out of the ineptitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It has also our best wishes for the education of the Minister concerned. We have seen with approval and admiration the education by the Banking Commission of his leader, the Taoiseach, and the education of the Minister for Finance.  We look forward with hope that even when the Minister goes out into the wilderness his education will be of advantage to him when in opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel rather surprised that the House should be asked to deal with the motion in these terms.  If the motion indicates anything it is that the Government does not appear to have any policy in respect to transport.  But there was a time in his wild imaginative days when the present Minister for Industry and Commerce used to tell us of the simplicity with which he would solve the railway problem and almost every other problem.  That was a time when the Minister was an economic and industrial wizard.  One had only to show a problem to the Minister to be sure that he had a solution, or if he had not a solution one could be worked out in a short time.  We had the Minister's recipe in regard to unemployment, and we know the result. But the Minister made so many statements with regard to transport that one would imagine he had a definite policy and that he would not require a commission to inquire into the matter.</P>
      <P>Away back in 1931 the Minister went down to Athlone and made a speech there, in which he told the country that Fianna Fáil had a plan to deal with the transport problem of the country and that plan was the nationalisation of the railways and municipal ownership controlling the transport services in the cities.  In 1931 his solution was nationalisation of the railways and the municipalisation of transport services in the cities.  In 1933, when discussing the Railway Bill in the House, the Minister again told us of his proposal for dealing with the transport problem.  He again talked in an informed way, which gave one the impression that, however slow his steps were, he had a long-term plan in mind and that the implementation of it would bring prosperity to the railways, regular employment to the workers and an efficient service to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, five years after the 1933 Bill was introduced, and nine years after the Athlone speech, the Minister comes to the Dáil and asks the House to believe &ldquo;that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say&mdash;the present position of public transport (other than air transport) within the area of jurisdiction of the <Col N="1410" /> Irish Government, and in particular the circumstances which have led or contributed to the present unfavourable financial position of the Great Southern Railways and of the other railway companies operating within the said area, and whether any and, if so, what measures are necessary or desirable in order to secure efficient and progressive transport.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All this is being commended to us by the Minister, who told us seven years ago that the Government had a plan for dealing with the transport problem, and told some credulous railwaymen at Inchicore that the Government Party was a railway Party.  Now we are told that the Government has no policy for dealing with the transport problem but that it may get a policy after this has been dealt with by the commission.  That is the most amazing admission we had yet from the Minister.  Everyone knows of the parlous position of the railway companies-Railway shares are worth very little, and railwaymen are spending their time fighting against reductions in wages.  It is only the strength of the organisation that enables the men to withstand the attacks of the company to lower their standard of wages.</P>
    <P>Probably worse than all, railway men are threatened with the loss of the livelihood to which they have devoted the best years of their life.  The terrifying insecurity in which these people are placed in consequence of not knowing when they will be sentenced to economic death is creating a state of chaos and uncertainty on the railways that ought to have demanded a remedy from the Minister long before now.  In recent months there have been efforts made by the railway company to reduce the working week of the men and, consequently, their wages.  Large numbers of men have been dismissed and others are facing dismissal because of the parlous position of the railways at the present time.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects of the difficulties of the railways which do not need any commission to deal with them.  It is clear to everybody that in many respects the railway companies are facing a very unfair type of competition, <Col N="1411" /> a competition which takes the form of the road competitors, with money provided by the railway, actually operating against the railway, under the guise of wholesalers, who, by working their employees for long hours and low wages are able to offer terms for carrying merchandise which are below the prices for which that merchandise could be carried if the company were fulfilling its normal public obligations and paying decent wages to those who operate the service.  I had an example of a man who came to see me some time ago who was very annoyed because the railway company would not acquire his merchandise licence.  He wanted me to bring pressure to bear on the railway company to have his licence taken from him.  I asked him if he had decided to go out of the transport business or what was the explanation of this impetuosity on his part to have his licence taken over.  He said, &ldquo;If I could get a few thousand pounds from the railway company for my licence and lorries which are pretty old, I could, with the money I get, convert myself into a wholesaler, buy a few lorries and carry on precisely the same business as I am doing now, except I would not have so much trouble with the lorries, and they would be better and more efficient from the point of view of maintaining a service.&rdquo; There was a simple man who apparently thought the railway companies were to act as a kind of philanthropist to him and provide him with capital to maintain a transport service in competition with the railways.  That type of competition does not need an enquiry to deal with it. That type of competition has been going on for the past few years and I am surprised that the Ministry has not already taken steps to curb that kind of competition and to close that gap in the Road Transport Act of 1933 which is making it possible for these people to compete with the railway company on very unfair terms.</P>
    <P>I think it will be generally agreed that, while new methods of transport have grown up in recent years, new <Col N="1412" /> tastes developed in the matter of transport, whether it is merchandise or passenger, the railways represent such an important national asset and such an important national service that they must be saved at all costs and if there is to be a choice as to who will be hurt in the matter everybody, I think, would desire that the railway companies should be singled out for the avoidance of the ruin which is inevitable under the present position.  That, of course, does not mean that one agrees with the present management of the railways.  In a lot of ways it is strikingly unimaginative in its direction and there is an apparent unwillingness to develop new fields and create traffic, until the situation has reached a very critical point.  One feels that enlightened administration and direction of the railways, imagination on their part and a disposition to cater for public demands and public tastes more generously and more extensively would probably attract to the railways a considerable amount of the additional goods and passenger traffic which is lost to the railways by the want of that type of direction.</P>
    <P>But I think even when that is said, it will have to be admitted by all that the maintenance of a transport service in this country has difficulties which are not associated with the transport services of countries where the population is much greater than ours and where the distribution of the population is different from ours.  I think it will be accepted that, generally speaking, we are not a travelling community in the sense that other peoples are and the fact that the country largely consists of a working-class or peasant type of citizen, compelled to exist on a very low standard, inevitably restricts the amount of money which is available for expenditure on travelling.  Very few of our people, because of their low standard of living, are able to travel and such of them as to manage to travel, I believe, do so only once or twice a year.  We have, too, a very conservative local communal life.  You will find cases by the thousand of persons who do not leave the district in which they have been born and reared until long after they have reached <Col N="1413" /> manhood, and in addition to that you have the further difficulty of a sparsely populated country over which it is difficult to maintain a costly transport service because of the inadequacy of the traffic and sparsity of the population.  Those are problems which are associated with the maintenance of a transport service in this country and they are vital problems to which any commission, or any Government, charged with dealing with the matter, must give specialised attention.</P>
    <P>While one may quarrel with the Ministry taking the view that it is necessary to have an inquiry at this stage into matters such as the ownership and direction of the railway services of the country, there are certain advantages in the arrangement inasmuch as it will at least compel the Ministry to face up to its responsibilities in the matter.  But there is one point upon which I would like the Minister to give us some information. It was felt by him desirable to amalgamate all the railways under one undertaking to be known as the Great Southern Railways.  There is another undertaking in the country&mdash;the Great Northern Railway&mdash;and I understand that it carries on quite a remunerative traffic within the area of transport of the Government of Eire.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether it is within the competence of this commission to recommend the amalgamation of that portion of the railways which operates within our territory with the present Southern Railways.  Whether the Southern Railways are to continue as such in the future, of course, is a matter, at this stage, for conjecture but, if it is desirable that there should be one railway company and one railway service within the country, there does not seem to me to be any reason for the exclusion from that company of the area of railway service at present operated by the Great Northern Railway.</P>

      <P>There is only one other matter to which I would like to refer in connection with this motion, and that is the question of a time limit.  I was glad to hear the Minister indicate that he hoped to have the report of this commission by the time the Dáil reassembles.  That is heartening news on a matter of this kind, because inquiry over so wide a field might well last for a very prolonged period, and meantime the railway services would suffer enormously.  I would like the Minister to give us an assurance that he will try to arrange that the commission would definitely report by some fixed date so that consideration of its report might be then taken up and the necessary legislation introduced for the purpose of remedying the present parlous position of the railways which is causing concern to everybody interested in transport and causing dreadful fears to railwaymen who are standing in daily dread of dismissal&mdash;a position which continues to enforce on railwaymen intolerably low standards of wages.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, in dealing with this matter, told us about the warning we got in 1933 in connection with the Road Transport Acts.  Every Deputy in this House is aware of the <Col N="1415" /> position of the railways in 1931 and 1932.  It took the Road and Rail Transport Act to prolong their lives up to the present.  I want to know from the Minister whether representatives of the agricultural community are going to be appointed to this tribunal, for, if the Minister states that this tribunal means the life or death of the railway company, it also means the life or death of the agricultural community as well. Deputy Norton speaks about unfair competition, but I think it is about time that the railways of this country were placed under some business head, for if ever there was an exhibition of incompetence in regard to a transport system, it has been provided during the last four or five years by the Great Southern Railways.</P>

      <P>I am putting it before the Dáil now.  I have had instances brought to my notice in which the railway company bought over certain services.  What was the result?  There is a bus service plying every two hours at present from Cork to Cobh, side by side with the railway service, both catering for the one set of passengers.  At no part of the route is there more than a quarter of a mile between the road and the railway.  If there was an hour or half-an-hour between the services one might understand it, but there is not.  The moment the train changes the time it is to leave Cork the bus also changes its hour of departure.  They travel side by side along the one route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one would be lonely without the other.  The two are run together as an exhibition of the business capacity of the Great Southern Railways.  The railway company proved utterly incompetent, unable to meet even the business that was at their door.  I have before me a report sent to the Minister by the Cork Harbour Commissioners some time ago. The report deals with the discharge of five cargoes of coal.  A sixth cargo <Col N="1416" /> came into Cork, and left for Dublin because it could not get any facilities for discharge.  Here is the manner in which they provide transport in the shape of waggons for the delivery of coal.  A cargo arrived at 10 p.m. on Tuesday, November 2nd.  The vessel commenced to discharge on Saturday 6th, and, as was stated at the time, even if she got sufficient waggons she would not be discharged until Friday, November 12th.  The S.S. Coral arrived at 5.20 p.m. on Tuesday, November 2nd, with 630 tons of coal and, at the date of the report, 10th November, discharge had not yet commenced.  The next vessel arrived at 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, November 3rd, with 940 tons of coal.  It was intended to discharge this steamer at the cranes, but the owners of that cargo found that the railway company could not provide them with any transport whatever, and the vessel was shifted 200 yards up the river, to Anderson's Quay, there to be discharged by unfair competition of which Deputy Norton speaks.  That vessel was shifted at 7.40 a.m. on the 5th November to Anderson's Quay, where the discharge was completed on Tuesday, November 9th.  Her cargo was borne to North Cork towns by lorry, because the railway company could not supply the wagons.  I have further details of similar instances, but I shall not bother giving them.  That is the position in Cork City, and that is the way people are treated by the railway company that wants a monopoly of the transport system of this country.  That is the way they have discharged the onus placed upon them under the existing Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was called some time ago to the case of a certain co-operative creamery down the country where the driver of a local private lorry was collecting milk at ½d. per gallon and delivering it to the creamery.  The railway company came along and took over the service.  Their charge for delivering the same milk was 1?d. per gallon.  The price paid for the <Col N="1417" /> milk at the creamery was 3¾d. per gallon.  The result was that the creamery ran dry.</P>
      <P>The railway company, after buying over the lorry, and putting it off the road, found that the co-operative creamery had to step in, in order to protect its milk supply, and put a lorry of its own on the road.  We have the same thing happening right along the line.  The railway company, which, according to Deputy Norton, find it impossible to pay their employees, can expend a very large amount on a railway intelligence service for the purpose of spying around garages in Cork. They can have men travelling from door to door of Cork merchants to see who employs a lorry, where it is going to, and reporting the matter to the Department of Industry and Commerce so that the licence may be taken from the lorry owner.  They are also able to pay £600 a year to a gardener for the purpose of beautifying stations along the line.</P>
      <P>There is a condition of affairs prevailing amongst the agricultural community of this country that cannot be lost sight of, and that will have to be looked into.  I cannot imagine, for instance, any railway company supplying a service from house to house through country boreens, collecting lorry loads of pigs, taking them up to Cork and delivering them there.  I wonder how much per pig the railway company would charge on that job? We cannot overlook what they did in the case of beet.  In some cases, the beet growers had to bring their beet four miles before the railway company would take it from that point to the railway station.  That has been the condition of affairs.  They got the whole of the transport of beet to the factories, and what did they do?  They came at five o'clock in the evening and locked up the gates lest any more might come in, and the farmer, having his wagon half filled in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want, in the first place, an assurance from the Minister that the agricultural community will be represented on this tribunal.  They are the people who will have to pay the piper in the long run, seeing that there is the difference of a halfpenny a gallon in taking milk to the creamery and one and one-eighth pence charged by the railway for an article worth 3½d.  At present the main roads of the country are impassable for horse traffic owing to changes in the transport needs of the country and the need of driving the many people with heart disease who must have motor cars to take them smoothly along so that a by-election in any constituency will not arise.  The traffic which the working farmer formerly carried with a horse and cart, taking pigs to market and such activities, has now to be done by lorry, and I submit that it is absolutely impossible for the railway company to <Col N="1419" /> cater for that kind of work except at a prohibitive price.  I could stay here for a week giving instances of incompetence in the management of the railway company from my knowledge of it, but I do not want to waste the time of the House in doing so.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Norton's statement about a time-table, I say that this problem cannot be gone into on a time-table basis.  It is not a problem in respect of which you can bring out a report after sitting for a couple of hours.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;including the plan the Deputy had for getting 205,000 votes from the civil servants some time ago. I want an assurance from the Minister that this matter will be fully examined, that plenty of time will be taken with it and that there will be no hurried decisions in regard to it.  It is a matter of life or death for the agricultural community.  If the cost of transport of a particular article goes up unduly, the agricultural community are going out of business in that particular article.  This does not hit the large farmer because he will get a lorry of his own and do his own transport, but his neighbour, the man with one pig or two pigs, will find himself without a pig at all, because he cannot pay the railway company to take that pig to market. It is a problem whose examination requires time and trouble, and one which must be examined from every angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the utmost sympathy with those men who have spent their lives in the company's service, and who now find themselves practically out of employment.  I am prepared to go any fair length to have that problem met and those men kept in employment. There is, however, also the problem of whether you are going to drive out of <Col N="1420" /> business a large number of the small farmers.  That, too, is a very serious problem and one which will have to be very carefully inquired into.  It would be absolutely impossible for the railway company, on any kind of economic basis, to provide the service which is now provided by the private hauliers of this country.  They were never able to do it and they never will be able to do it.  As I say, this whole matter must be fully probed and there must be no hurried decisions on it.  We do not want any &ldquo;marry in haste and repent at leisure&rdquo; atmosphere in relation to this job.  It is a job all angles of which must be examined and a cure found before decisions are brought in here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this subject is altogether too serious for the kind of light entertainment which Deputy Corry usually provides and of which we have had an experience just now.  My contribution will be very short, because I realise that the Minister was, to some extent, on sound ground when he asked that this matter should not be discussed at very great length.  I must say, however, that the request for the setting up of this tribunal is disappointing, especially in view of the urgency of the problem and the widespread expectation of some more definite action than this time-honoured device of handing over an awkward problem to a commission.  Those of us who have been in this House for the past 15 years have become rather cynical about the effect of commissions for one business or another.  They appear to be designed, at least, sometimes, for the purpose of diverting attention from a very urgent and important problem, and dragging our hopes over a long period which very often fall very far short of fulfilment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, of course, is aware, as every sensible person must be aware, that if some action does not result in one way or another, all that will be required will be an inquest on the whole railway industry of the country. This is a matter of very special importance to those of us who come from Cork, and particularly that part of the county from which I come.  At a recent sitting of the Railway <Col N="1421" /> Tribunal, the general manager indicated that amongst the proposals to be considered by the company at an early date&mdash;and this was reported by the Press&mdash;was a proposal to cut off the entire railway service from Cork City to Bantry, taking in the whole western portion of the county and depriving the people in that area of railway services.  This is an extremely urgent and menacing situation for the people in that position, apart altogether from the 500 railway workers, many of whom have given 28 and 30 years' honest and faithful service in the industry and who are now in a position of uncertainity which may result in their being deprived of their employment in a short time.  I do not want to labour that situation, or to dwell on the might-have-beens in connection with this whole transport situation.  I do not think it will serve any purpose for me to rake them up unduly, but I sincerely hope that this being the best the Minister can show us&mdash;and it is a very poor best&mdash;it will justify the hopes that he has in the matter, although, in our opinion, the methods he is employing fall very far short of the urgent and menacing needs of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to make a very short reference to the composition of the tribunal.  I do not claim, like Deputy Corry, to be an expert completely in railway matters, but there are two types, in addition to those mentioned already, and in addition to the interests mentioned by Deputy Norton, I should like to see represented, if possible.  In addition to the agriculturists, I believe that another very large body of users of the railways, namely, the traders, who will be very much concerned with the findings of this tribunal, should be represented on it.  The towns and the cities, in fact every small country village that is served by a railway line or some road transport service, is vitally concerned in the findings of this tribunal.  It is a very important matter for traders who are dependent on the railway company for their supplies of merchandise. They, at least, should have some representation on the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> The second point is, as far as representation is concerned, that I want to raise is one that I discussed on the estimate for the Railway Tribunal.  It is this, that while many of those with various interests in the railways mourn and wail, so far as their own position is concerned, they are very often inclined to overlook the fact that you have a very large number of people in this country who have suffered intense hardship as a result of the failure of the railways, whether by mismanagement or otherwise.  They have suffered also by legislation dealing with the railways.  I refer to those who had their money invested in the railways. No one can deny that a great deal of money was invested in the Irish railways.  They were a trustee security, and money was invested in them by trustees on behalf of children, minors and old ladies who possibly had no other source of income.  These people have been very badly hit because those who were in a fiduciary relation to them were not prophets and did not keep their eyes open sufficiently to see that the railway crash was coming.  A number of those people have suffered severely.  Their only source of income has, for various reasons, been swept away, whether by the failure of the railways, by the effects of the legislation dealing with the railways and for a variety of reasons.  I think that representation on behalf of those people should be given on the tribunal so that, no matter what happens in the future, what little is left to them will not be further damaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather interesting matter.  I am in thorough agreement with the Minister that it is necessary to have some sort of a tribunal to deal with the matter, not from the trade union point of view&mdash; Deputy Norton dealt with that&mdash;or from the point of view outlined by Deputy Corry.  The Minister knows that you have thousands of people up and down the country who have been trying to make a living out of transport&mdash;just keeping to one side or other of the law.  I hold that these people should not be denied the opportunity of making a living.  If that should happen, as a result of the findings of the tribunal, then I say they should <Col N="1423" /> get decent compensation.  It is important, too, that the railways should continue.  I am quite satisfied that there is no hope for them, if what I may call this hole and corner business so far as transport is concerned, goes on.  I live in a part of the country near a beet factory where there is a good deal of transport work going on.  There is certainly an avoidance, in some way or other, of the law in order to continue keeping lorries on the road&mdash;even on the part of friends of mine who voted and worked for me.  I have sometimes intervened in order to keep them out of trouble.  I think that an enquiry is absolutely necessary.  I do not at all agree with the point of view expressed by Deputy Norton.</P>
      <P>So far as transport in rural Ireland is concerned, it is not a matter of hours or of settled working.  Of course, such conditions have been imposed on the railways by trade unions.  So far as the lorries are concerned, there are no settled hours of working, but I certainly hold that the people who have them are entitled to make their living.  What I want to put to the Minister is that those people who have been making their living out of transport before the last Act was passed, and since the last Act was passed, will get a decent compensation.  Otherwise, it will be simply confiscation.  If the Government deprives them of their means of making a livelihood, then it should compensate them. I hope that this enquiry will have the effect of putting the railways on their feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal put before the House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the solution of a great and pressing national problem will, I think, come as a great surprise, and to nobody will the surprise be greater than to the railway men of this country who received so many repeated assurances from the Minister on this matter in the past.  Deputy Norton, in referring to previous pronouncements made by the Minister on this matter, referred to a speech which, I remember, the Minister made in Athlone.  I will do the Minister the justice of quoting from a speech which he made in this House.  I will quote <Col N="1424" /> from the Official Records and not from memory, or from any newspaper that might not have made a correct report of his speech.  Speaking in this House on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party on the 9th December, 1931, at columns 2645-6 the Minister, who was then Deputy Lemass, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think there are no Deputies who will deny that preservation of the railways is essential to the industrial development of the country....  If we are seeking to attain that aim I think we must also make up our minds that public ownership of these services is desirable if not essential.  Unified control and public ownership are necessary for a number of other reasons as well....  I think that as strong a case, if not a much stronger case, can be made out for the public ownership of transport services as can be made out for the public ownership of an electricity supply. The position here is that the case is also strengthened by the fact that there does not exist amongst the people of this country any feeling of confidence in the existing railway management....  We are strongly in favour of public ownership of transport services with unified control outside the boundaries of municipalities.  Inside the boundaries of muncipalities we are in flavour of municipal ownership and control of these services.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a definite pronouncement by Deputy Lemass when he was the shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in this House on behalf of his Party on the 9th December, 1931.  Has the Minister forgotten that pronouncement or have the Cabinet and Government Party to-day turned down that policy?  If not, why does he propose, nearly nine years after he made that statement, to set up some outside body to give him advice as to whether the policy and pronouncement made then are correct or not, or whether he would be justified in going ahead along those lines?  Like some of the Minister's later prophecies which have not been fulfilled, is this a getting away from the policy and he pronouncement <Col N="1425" /> which he made in favour of public ownership.  In the Dáil on the 3rd May, 1933, when he was concluding the debate on the railways and transport Bills, replying, in a very emphatic and eloquent way, to Deputy Cosgrave, or to a speech made previously by Deputy Cosgrave, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These Bills are going to effect a substantial improvement on the transport position that will make possible a transport organisation that can be maintained on an economic basis.  That opinion is shared by everybody who knows anything about the transport problem, whether associated with railways or road transport, or those who have given the matter study with practical experience.  There is in all quarters a unanimous welcome for these measures.  It is only those who have shown by their actions and by their words that they know nothing at all about them that wasted time in criticising these measures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we come to the really prophetic portion of his remarks:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position that will be created by these Bills will be one that will ensure that traffic will be carried on the railways and on the roads at the lowest economic rates, and that the receipts will be sufficient to pay all charges for organisation and administration, while giving a reasonable return on the capital invested.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the plum of the lot is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is what we set out to achieve, and that is what these Bills will achieve.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if Deputy Dillon was in the House at the time or whether he cheered the Minister when he was making that prophecy, but he is here now to see that the Minister's prophecy in that respect has not been fulfilled, and the proof of that is the Minister's proposal here this evening to set up a tribunal to give to himself, his Ministerial colleagues, and the members of his Party, who were supposed to have a policy in 1931, advice as to <Col N="1426" /> the road to go on, now that they are in a mess and are responsible for making a mess of the transport industry of this country.  I was glad to hear from the Minister that he has a hope that the tribunal will be in a position to report before the House resumes its sittings on the 8th February.  I must admit that I was assuming that the tribunal, or commission, proposed to be set up would take a much longer period in which to do its job efficiently.  I am expressing surprise now that any tribunal the Minister may set up to make final and definite proposals as to the solution of the chaos in the transport industry to-day could possibly make a final and satisfactory report inside such a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, said that it was not proposed to appoint any transport experts on this tribunal.  Well, I do not know what the Minister's idea would be of transport experts or of those people, either inside or outside the country, who designate themselves as transport experts, but I think he would be ill-advised, at any rate, to constitute this tribunal from amongst a set of individuals who know nothing whatsoever about the transport industry, and that he would be well advised to get some experts, or so called experts, or somebody in the transport industry who has a technical knowledge of the business which is in such a mess at the moment.  Deputy Corry pleaded for representation of the agricultural community on this tribunal, and I daresay he knows much more about the Minister's intentions in this matter than I do.  If you are going to have sectional interests represented on a tribunal of this kind, it will take more than five or six weeks to enable them to make their report.  If one interest is to be entitled to seek and get representation on the tribunal, many other interests, I daresay, would be entitled also.  However, I am sure the House would welcome a more detailed statement from the Minister, when he is replying, as to the constitution of the proposed tribunal.  I should particularly like to know whether the Chairman is likely to be a High Court judge or a judge with some knowledge of the business with which it is proposed to <Col N="1427" /> deal.  The very fact that this is entitled a tribunal gives one the impression, from reading the matter the right way, that a judge is likely to be the person intended to preside over it. However, I should like to hear the Minister say something on that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred, and rather in a passing way, to statements and proposals which were put before him by the joint railway companies some time ago.  I have reason to believe that such proposals were in the hands of the Minister more than five months ago, and it has taken him over five months to make up his mind as to whether or not the serious statements contained in these proposals were worthy even of reference to the tribunal which it is now proposed to set up.  I have heard some of the railway people discuss the present position of the railway and transport industry, and I have sufficient information at my disposal to know that they proposed that the Government should advance them a considerable amount of money&mdash;sufficient at any rate to enable them to carry out a considerable amount of improvement of the existing railway services by improving the permanent way, making provision for better and more up-to-date rolling stock, and also sufficient money to buy out all the existing competing services now on the road.  They also indicated in their proposals their desire, with the consent of the Minister, to close down about 41 branch lines or sections of branch lines in this country.  As long as I remain a member of this House, I shall oppose with all the influence at my disposal and with all the strength I can command any proposal to close down any of the railway branch lines until, at any rate, the road transport service of this country has been regulated in such a way as to prove that there is no further necessity for carrying on these branch lines.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has, as he undoubtedly has, authorised the closing down of 120 miles, or thereabouts, of branch lines, and if the Great Southern Railways Company has asked him now to consent to the closing down of 41 more branch lines, it is because of the unregulated <Col N="1428" /> road transport system of this country which has not given the branch line railways any chance to survive.  I wonder, for instance, what the great River Shannon and the great River Barrow would be, or would they be the great rivers they are to-day, if they had not tributaries to make them great rivers.  In the same way, I think you can say that you cannot have a great trunk-line railway in this country unless it is fed by the branch lines.  Can anyone imagine some of the provincial towns in this country, where big fairs are held every month or every six months or every three months, being able to carry on without the assistance of the branch lines?</P>
    <P>Would anybody with even a nodding acquaintance of the branch line railways suggest that the large number of cattle and other produce sold at some of these monthly or three-monthly fairs could ever be efficiently served by road transport as compared with the efficient way in which they are served by rail?  If that kind of business is going to be carried on by road, and if the heavy mineral and other traffic of the country is going to be carried on by road, under any policy of the Minister, who is going to pay for the upkeep of these roads and for their maintenance in the future?  I can assure the House, from information that I have from people who know more than I do about rail transport, that one-sixth of the revenue of the railway companies is paid for the maintenance of the permanent way, whereas, in the case of road transport, the expenditure amounts to only one-twentieth of the revenue spent in the same way.  Why is that?  It is because the ratepayers and the taxpayers, but particularly the ratepayers of this country, are subsidising the roads in order to enable private carrying companies to operate profitably for private purposes.  These are things to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the members of this House will have to give careful consideration.</P>
    <P>What this country is suffering from to-day is a surplus of transport.  We have too much transport to carry the <Col N="1429" /> amount of agricultural and other produce which has to be carried over the rails and the roads.  Deputy Corry talked about mismanagement of the railway company.  All I would suggest to him is that at the earliest opportunity he should have a friendly conversation with the local people who are responsible for the alleged mismanagement.  He did not give any proof in support of the case which he quoted in connection with the quays in Cork.  For instance, if he wanted to prove his case he should have communicated to the Minister, and to all those who want to listen to that kind of case, the date or dates on which the railway company requested the supply of wagons for the carriage of coal from the quays in Cork to somewhere else.  He took good care that he did not give that side of the case at all, but if he wants to justify that kind of allegation he will have to state the whole of the case; he stated only half of it.</P>
    <P>I am aware&mdash;and so is every other Deputy in this House&mdash;of the fact that road transport service, and particularly the cruisers and wholesalers that run around this country without any regulation or control whatever, are carrying the necessaries of life from the port to the town in the country.  I suggested to certain traders on certain occasions that they were, as it were, black-balling the railway service and that it was very unfair in this way: the traders in provincial towns are people who get cheaper transport by road than they can get from the railway service, but are those traders passing on the reduced road rate to the community by way of reduced prices for the articles that are carried cheaper by road than by rail?  If not, what is the benefit to the community of having this service of cheap road transport which everybody knows exists in the country?  I agree with the Minister on that famous statement which he made here in this House in 1931, and time will prove whether it was justified or not.  The Minister said, and I agree with him, that the railways are essential to the preservation of existing industries and to the development of industry in this country.  If they are essential to the <Col N="1430" /> preservation and development of industry in this country, all that those who have a financial interest in the railways ask this Parliament to do is to give the railway company a fair chance of competing with their competitors.  Do not have one set of people engaged in the transport industry bound by red tape regulations, bound by rules and regulations made by the Minister, and the other side allowed to go scot free all over the country, pretending that they are wholesalers.  Even the miserable transport legislation which was brought into existence in 1933 has not been administered by the powers that be. There are many cases in which leniency of a type which should not be given has been given to some of those cruisers and wholesalers.  They have been allowed to break the law not alone by the failure of the Guards to watch them but by the failure of other people to deal with them under the terms of the Transport Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister can get a tribunal, and there is no doubt about it they will be scholarly men and prove to be real experts if they can bring in a report to him before 8th February.  If they can do so, then I will give them my blessing as far as I am concerned because they have a big job to undertake, and it is doubtful if they can discharge their duties to the satisfaction of the Minister in that short time. While I say that, naturally I do not want to prolong unduly the period of their inquiry.  I want an assurance from the Minister, however, that in the meantime he will not listen if the railway company again pleads for further power to close down any of those branch lines&mdash;pleadings such as have been put forward in the proposal submitted to the Minister by the railway company over five months ago. When moving this motion the Minister talked about the justification for taking major decisions.  The Government of which he is a Minister, and the Party of which he was a member in this House in 1931 and on whose behalf he spoke on the occasion referred to, now tells us almost nine years afterwards that the railway company is in a bankrupt state, that the transport industry is in a chaotic condition, and <Col N="1431" /> that the Government is up against taking major decisions.  The only major decision they have taken so far is to refer the issue upon which they said they had a clear-cut policy to a body of people who will not be experts to advise them upon it.</P>

      <P>An efficient and cheap transport service is an important factor in the economic life of any country, but in a thinly-populated country such as ours, with a good many people in a difficult position to tap, it is practically impossible to my mind to get a reasonably cheap road transport service operated by a company such as exists here in this country.  I should like to join with the Deputies who have asked that the primary industry in this country should be represented on this commission.  The transport service of this country should be examined in the light of the manner in which it affects our primary industry, namely, agriculture.  I think it is only right and proper that that industry should be represented on the commission.  Some Deputies have accused the company of mismanagement, and Deputy Davin has tried to defend the railway company here.</P>

      <P>The very fact that the company accepted the 1933 Bill at its face value proves that.  They raised £750,000 here, and what did they do with it?  They attempted to buy out, or thought they were buying out, the <Col N="1432" /> interests of privately-operated lorries all over the country.  They bought up a lot of dud, worn-out lorries, and they gave capital to people to go into competition against themselves.  That is how they used the £750,000.  If the directors of that company were business men they should have realised that the Bill was not water-tight, that there was a loop-hole and a very big loop-hole for anyone to take advantage of and operate a lorry as a wholesaler.  That, in itself, to my mind, proves the incompetence of the present company.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister whether he contemplates handing over a monopoly of the transport of this country to the railway company.  I should not be surprised if that were his intention, because he is the father of monopolies in this country.  Through his creation of monopolies, to my mind, he is the greatest enemy of agriculture in this country, because his policy is to continue piling on the load to the real people of this country, the backbone of this country, the people who have always carried this country, without any regard to consequences.  He creates monopoly after monopoly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to your ruling, Sir.  The companies under the Railways Act, 1933, proceeded to organise transport arrangements.  Take the passenger service from the City of Dublin. An evening train leaves on the main southern line at 6 o'clock, and another train for Carlow-Kilkenny at 6.30 and, at the very same time, two buses leave, one going by Carlow and the other by Athy.  Is there any sense in having that service of buses running parallel with the trains and, at the same hour? I suppose my right to criticise that is questioned by Deputy Davin, because I am a farmer?  Is it because I represent the agricultural community that I have no right to examine how a transport system should be run?  That was the innuendo thrown out.  Any intelligent man who attempted to operate passenger service of two buses and two trains knows that it would be more efficient to run one bus at 4 o'clock, a train at 6.30, and another bus at 8 o'clock, instead of the three running at the same hour.  That is the type of efficiency we have at present. I hope it will not be the decision of the Minister or of this tribunal to hand <Col N="1434" /> over transport, even apart from the passenger service, to such a company. I was in Athy recently and, when talking to a big trader about the proposed Transport Bill, he pointed to two motor wheels in his yard that had been sent down on a lorry.  This trader lives close to the railway station.  The lorry travelled to Athy with a pair of motor wheels and charged 5/- for delivery.  It then went back to Dublin empty. Imagine sending a lorry with two wheels to a place at the side of a railway station and charging 5/-.  That would not pay the wages of the driver for that journey.  I know another man in Carlow who sent a typewriter to Dublin to be repaired, and the charge on the railway was 4/6.  It came back in a lorry and the charge was 1/-.  Are we to conclude that the railway wants to encourage road transport rather than rail transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it necessary to run road services parallel with the railway services?  Is it not reasonable to expect that the railway companies should as far as possible operate lorries to feed rail heads, and not to run parallel services?  I do not see any attempt being made by the companies to feed the railways.  That should be the policy of an efficient company.  The agricultural community is in a peculiar position.  The approach to many farms is difficult but, with the rapid development of road services in the past few years, especially by keen merchants operating in rural areas, very effective service was given to those in remote districts.  These merchants could only give good service because they were able to use lorries between distributing centres like Dublin on two or three days a week, and, on the other days, use the lorries to distribute goods to farmers.  In that way it was quite possible for farmers to get three or four tons of artificial manure delivered at a charge of 5/-. That type of service cannot be beaten by any company.  That is the type of service we should be very slow to turn down.  The use of artificial manure should be encouraged, and it should reach farmers at the lowest charge possible for delivery.  It should also reach them at a price that would encourage them to use big quantities of <Col N="1435" /> it.  The whole question of transport should be examined in the light of how it is going to affect the agricultural community.  The burdens that that community have to carry are heavy enough.  While it is groaning under the burdens it is bearing other expenses should not be added.  I have no hesitation in saying that it is not the directors but the officials that are operating the railway companies.  The workers in these companies are dictating policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place there are 50 per cent. too many of them there to give cheap service.  There is not the slightest doubt about that.  That is one thing that is operating against the railways.  If conditions here are examined, and compared with other countries, that is the conclusion that must be come to.  Take the case of a man at Crewe junction dealing with 400 or 500 trains daily.  He has a lower wage than a man down in the country here, dealing with three or four trains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>These facts must be faced when examining this question. I hope they will not be lost sight of, and that there will not be an attempt made to find loopholes in the previous Act.  If you are going to create another monopoly, at a time when we have many monopolies, it is going to add one more burden to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing a good thing in proposing to inquire into this question before he takes any further steps.  It is a question which should be approached with great care, as the experience we have had of monopolies has been anything but pleasant.  There is monopoly at present, and it has been abused to such an extent that these companies do not deserve much consideration from the country.  The Minister is <Col N="1436" /> aware that down in my constituency a certain carrier was refused a licence because he did not apply at the proper time.  The railway company undertook to draw milk to a certain creamery but, after trying it for some time, they said their weekly wage bill equalled the total value of the milk carried.  The man who had been carrying the milk was able to do so, roughly, at one-eighth of its value, for something like 1/2d. or 3/4d. a gallon. After insisting that the other lorry owner should not get a licence, the railway company said they could not carry the milk under £7 10s. a week, which meant the whole value of the milk.  That is one instance.  When you have any monopoly that abuses its powers to that extent, the Minister should be very careful about enlarging their powers.  I could give other instances, but it is hardly necessary.</P>
      <P>Take the case of small parcels and light articles.  A man used to run a lorry between Dublin and our part of the country.  He used to bring things like bicycles at 1/6 each.  What did they charge for them on the railway? They charged 4/6 each, an increase of 200 per cent.  The same applies to other articles.  I think, when all these matters are taken into account, the Minister should be careful.  As Deputy Hughes pointed out, the people in the country are asked to carry burdens that they are unable to carry and, if you enlarge the powers that the railways have got, they are certainly going to be abused.  The less meddling with any of these things the better.  The experience of this House with regard to the railways should teach us caution.  Under the 1933 Acts the State forgave this company hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shareholders' rights were given away, and what is the result?  We have them coming back for further gifts from the State, and there are further restrictions to be placed upon the people who are operating and giving a good service.  Are we going to take the rights of these people who are giving good service and hand them to an inefficient company that will not give a decent service?  I believe, as other Deputies interested <Col N="1437" /> in agriculture believe, that the farming community and consumers generally will be seriously displeased if the railways get any further right to increase freight and restrict their services.  I ask the Minister to be very careful about setting up a commission, and if he does establish one, he should try to put the proper class of person on it who will pay attention to the needs of consumers, the agricultural community and others vitally concerned, as well as the interests of the railway companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that the resolution submitted by the Minister is a most important one, because it will be recognised that the railways at the present moment are in a very precarious position.  I did not intend to intervene were it not for the extraordinary speech delivered by Deputy Hughes.  According to Deputy Hughes, there are too many men employed on the railway, and the employees, he said, were dictating the policy of the railways. He had various other grievances.  He cited some cases where goods were delivered in certain parts of the country, presumably in his constituency, for 5/- from Dublin.  I do not think that is the type of carrying that this Government wants to encourage.  I sincerely hope that is not their policy.  Certainly we of the Labour Party would not like to encourage that kind of carrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes is probably unaware that the wages paid in some cases to lorry drivers engaged in that kind of traffic are as low as 8/- a week, plus food.  There was a case before the district justice in my constituency some time ago concerning a man engaged in lorry traffic.  It was proved on oath that the man who was driving the lorry, which was getting a considerable amount to do, was being paid 8/- a week, plus his food. I do not think anybody in this House, no matter what Party he belongs to, wants to encourage traffic of that kind.  So far as the number of men employed is concerned, I do not think Deputy Hughes can sustain his argument.  As a matter of fact, it has <Col N="1438" /> been proved conclusively that various railway stations are at the moment under-staffed.  The moment men become redundant they are dismissed, and unless something is done in the very near future, I think there will be a good deal more redundancy. Already a number of men are engaged for a short time.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Davin was speaking he referred to the tendency of the railway company to close down certain branch lines.  I suggest to the Minister that while this commission is deliberating he should ask the railway company to stop the closing down of certain branch lines.  In one part of my constituency, the newly-added portion, including the town of Borris, the railway company are contemplating closing down the line which goes to Palace and connects with Borris.  The town of Borris has been without a passenger service for some years and now it is contemplated to take off the goods service.  Borris is a place where there is a good deal of beet traffic and it would be a great inconvenience to the farmers there if Borris were cut off.  I suggest that while this tribunal is deliberating the Minister should ask the railway company not to carry out a policy of that kind.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the Minister giving a monopoly to the railway company.  I cannot find anything in this resolution which suggests that a monopoly is to be given.  So far as I can understand, the commission is to go into the whole question of railway and road traffic, and things of that kind, in order to find out what is the best that can be done under prevailing circumstances.  It might be a good thing if there was to be a monopoly. There is one thing that stands out on its own, and that is that the railways must be preserved in this country. They are the natural arteries of the country, and they are absolutely necessary for trade and industry.  Apart from that, they give employment, so far as I can ascertain, to 6,000 or 7,000 men.  If 50, 30 or 25 per cent. of these men are going to be thrown on the roadside, they will become a charge on the rates.  The farmers will feel that <Col N="1439" /> perhaps a good deal more than the difference in freight they would be called upon to pay if the railway company were to get a monopoly, and some of the road pirates were put off the roads, those who are paying miserable wages to the unfortunate men compelled to work for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope and trust that, as a result of the deliberations of the tribunal, the interests that are affected will benefit very much.  One would imagine, listening to some of the speeches delivered, that the House was discussing the report of the tribunal. The fact is that the tribunal has not been set up.  I hope and trust that, as a result of the tribunal's investigations, the Minister will be in the happy position of making an announcement to the House whereby any measures that may be presented will be the means of putting on their feet the great industries that are affected by the terms of this motion.  We all know the grave position of the railways.  We also know that the railways give large employment, and that there are good working conditions prevailing in that huge undertaking.</P>
      <P>I was rather sorry to hear many Deputies criticising the management of the railways.  I happen to have been connected with the railways for quite a long time, representing, as I do, the railway town of Dundalk and I can say that when one considers the difficulties under which the railways have worked for the past eight or ten years, it is marvellous how they were able to carry on at all and to give the employment they were giving.  In solving this problem of transport the great industry of agriculture must be borne in mind. If this proposed tribunal can galvanise those interests, agricultural and railway, into one harmonious brand it will be a very good thing for the country. I sincerely wish the Minister luck in the setting up of this tribunal.  Its success will only be achieved by co-operation of all Parties.  Deputies in this House must recognise the fact that we are only a small nation, and it is only by co-operation amongst all classes that we can bring the nation to a state of prosperity and bring success to our industries and to our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on his courage in the setting up of this tribunal.  There is one thing on which I strongly appeal to the Minister, and that is to keep the branch lines open in South Mayo, particularly between Claremorris and Ballinrobe. From Ballinrobe fair, I understand that on last fair day 80 waggons of cattle were railed.  There is a monthly fair there.  If that line is interfered with I have no hesitation in saying that the fairs in the town will be destroyed and the farmers of the district will suffer.  Unfortunately already too much harm has been done in Mayo by the closing down of branch lines.  The branch line from Westport to Achill was closed and so was the branch line from Ballina to Killala.  The Minister should see that we will get some sort of rapid transport from the West to Dublin.  Fifty years ago a traveller could travel more quickly from Mayo to Dublin than he can to-day.  What at that time took four hours now takes five hours.  If the Minister will put those matters before the tribunal, try to get a solution, and get rapid transit from the West from Mayo to Dublin, he will be doing a great benefit to the farmers, whom we all want to see prosper.</P>
      <P>We have also to take into account that the lorries must be allowed to continue to run in some places.  There are two ports in Mayo, one in Ballina and one in Westport.  If a trader at present wants five tons of flour in Claremorris all he has to do at 11 o'clock in the day is to telephone down to either of these ports and in four or five hours the flour is delivered to his place.  Now if that flour or maize had to be sent by rail it would have first to be delivered from the port to the railway station at Westport.  It would have to be transported then from Claremorris railway station to the shopkeeper's place and that would take about three days.  If the Government want to improve transport facilities they must first of all look for rapid transport and rapid delivery of goods and they should not close up the lines which are so essential to the farming community and to the success of the fairs.</P>

      <P>I welcome the setting up of this commission and I hope something good will come out of it. Certainly something needs to be done. A Deputy has spoken about parallel lines of lorries and 'buses and railway lines.  I could never understand what was back of the idea of having a railway company running a line of trains and at the same time 'buses and lorries.  I cannot see what was at the back of that because both lines run into the same district and call to the same towns, the only difference being that the 'bus instead of calling at the railway station pulls up opposite some shop in the town.  There is no necessity for this duplication.</P>
      <P>There was I believe a flaw in the Act of 1933 because compensation under that Act was paid out to private owners of 'buses and lorries and those private owners have gone in again.  I would not agree with Deputy Hughes in saying that the company was at fault.  I believe the defect was in the Act.  Heavy compensation was paid to private owners.  By the Act the Minister for Industry and Commerce caused thousands of pounds to be paid to the owners of lorries and 'buses but these people came along again, bought a new set of lorries, and ran their lorries to Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, brought back stuff and resold it in the particular towns.  That was what was done.  If the commission can settle that part of the business it will be doing some good.</P>
      <P>I think it is a pity to see so many of the branch lines closed.  If the Minister gives serious consideration to the setting up of this commission he will go a good part of the way towards solving the problem.  The Minister and everybody in the country knows that in some respect the railways in this country are not working properly.  If you ask the charge for travelling or transport of any kind down the country one will find that the buses and trains running parallel have different charges to the same towns.  Surely that is evidence of very bad business methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like to see any branch line closed, because these lines are a <Col N="1442" /> benefit to the public.  We all know, of course, that the railways pay very high rates.  This money has been lost to the local rates.  Then there is the line from Galway to Clifden, about 45 miles in length.  That line was built a little over 40 years ago, but two years ago it was closed down.  It is a disgrace to the Government of this country to see closed down a line that was built at heavy cost in order to serve a huge part of the country.  I again say that I welcome the commismission and I certainly hope that when it is set up a certain type of thing that happened under the 1933 Act will not be allowed to go on.  The Act of 1933 was in one respect a great safety to the public, for with all its faults it put a number of so-called buses off the road.  I hope that the commission will look into that matter very carefully and more so in the light of the public needs than in the light of the interests of the railway company, who are not able to manage their businesses.  Deputy Nally spoke about fair days down the country.  I am sorry to say that the management of the company at present are not able to estimate from one year to another the number of wagons required for a particular fair.  Possibly the Minister for Agriculture may be the cause of that trouble, because he had a lot to do with the upsetting of the fairs in the last five or six years.  I know that in the fairs in the West of Ireland buyers of live stock are very badly treated by the management of the railways who do not make sufficient provision to deal with the traffic.  In the town in which I live there is a junction for four railways.  I do not know when that railway was built, but there has been no improvement whatsoever in the railway rolling stock in that particular area.  Then we have the Civic Guards coming along every fair day and prosecuting farmers in that particular town for not dealing in the right way with their live stock.  It is a disgrace for any railway company that they have refused to make provision for the rearing of live stock.  Even a week ago the lack of provision in that town caused the death of a person <Col N="1443" /> crossing a level crossing.  I think all these matters should be dealt with by this commission when they are dealing with the matter of transport.  Provision should be made for the public. I think it is only fair that the Minister, when he is setting up this commission, should have every matter of transport included in the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>It seems now that commissions are to be the order of the day and, like Beecham's pills, are to banish all ills.  I hope that the commission will act as quickly as Beecham's pills.  The Road Transport Act of 1933 seems to have been nothing more than a mass of incompetence and muddle-headedness and I really think the Minister ought to be ashamed of himself for the way in which he has allowed the pirates on the roads to prosper at the railway's expense, and allow them to drive coach and four through his Acts.  We are all satisfied that the transport system of this country is in a hopeless mess and must be got out of that mess some way or other.  I do hope that the outcome of this commission will not be to give the railways a monopoly of this country because I am one of those who do not believe in monopolies.  I know what monopolies have done for this country and other countries and, as someone said already, we have enough monopolies at the present moment. The agricultural community for the last few years has had splendid service from those operating lorries in the country with carriers' plates, but I am sorry to say that those pirates or those who reaped a small fortune from the railways when they were compensated for being put out of business were allowed to turn out to be a commercial concern again and allowed to buy new lorries and carry on as if nothing at all had happened.  I think it was very unfair to those men with the traders' plates, trading in a genuine and honourable way, who were of great service, that they should be left with this unfair competition and many of them, in fact, driven to the brink of bankruptey by those pirates who have fattened and battened at decent business <Col N="1444" /> men's expense.  I really think that that matter should have been tackled along ago and that we should not be waiting for a commission which will be one, two or three years before it reports.  I know dozens of this type of men who started with an old crock of a lorry that was worth about £15, and who evaded the law&mdash;or at least the law does not seem to get them&mdash;and in a few months they have a secondhand lorry and you find them at the end of six months with a brand new lorry, carrying on, working night and day, and then you find them to be the gentry of the day, and at the same time they are working all the time outside the law.  I really believe that the Minister should have stepped in long ago and enforced his rights and his rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied also that the railway company are a great deal to blame themselves for their present plight.  In the good old days when prosperity was in this country the railway companies were not what you would call very civil to the ordinary plain people of this country.  Unless you were a large business man or had large shares in the company you were not heeded at all.  Many a time I knew a poor old farmer, bringing two stall-feds by the railway wagon, and if a big rancher happened to be on the road they would shove the unfortunate farmer back and leave him five or six hours waiting, while they would get every official and every servant of the railway company gathered around the rancher's cattle, giving him every facility.  I really believe they are responsible for a lot of their own troubles.  There were plenty of uncivil officials who would give endless trouble to the poor farmer but who never gave any trouble to the gentry of this country.  I believe, if the railways are going to get this monopoly again, we should see that they have officials who will give every type of people a fair crack of the whip and not cater for one class at the expense of the other.  I believe that if a certain amount of decent traders who have carriers' plates at the present moment are going to be put out of existence they should get fair and square compensation because, after all, <Col N="1445" /> many of these men are built for life, as the saying is.  Their lives are made on this class of livelihood an they are working these lorries solely as their living and if they are going out of business in perhaps middle-age they are at least entitled to compensation.  I hope this fact will not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I say again that we should all beware of monopolising and I believe myself that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is keen on giving the railway the monopoly in this country. If he does, he may live to regret the day because, after all, in any business in this country or any other country you want rivalry&mdash;clean, healthy rivalry&mdash;and if you have, the plain people will get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>Of course, the main thing about the commission is the type of men we put on it.  I believe that the agricultural community, who are really the key to prosperity in this country, should be catered for as far as possible.  We should see that they get at least a fair percentage of the membership of the commission, because they are the people for whom we really set up the commission.  If they go out of exist. ence, the country ceases to exist. Therefore, the Minister, if he has authority to set up a commission, should see to it that the right type of men are put on it, and not the type of people who do not know the first thing about agriculture.  Agriculture is the mainstay of the country, and, if this commission is to do its duty, it will have to do it for the agricultural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend of the discussion on this motion seems to indicate a general welcome for the proposed commission to be set up, mingled with surprise at the necessity for its being set up, because I think most Parties in the House had long since recognised the urgent necessity for doing something practical to rescue the transport industry of the country from the chaotic conditions into which it had dropped, but I think there was a good deal of feeling throughout the House and throughout the country that the Government had decided many months <Col N="1446" /> ago to introduce legislation on their own hind leg, so to speak.  Whatever has happened in the interval which has caused the Minister and the Executive Council to set up a commission, I think we should welcome that commission. and even if the time taken in coming to a finding will be a bit longer drawn out than the Minister anticipates, it will be worth while.  I consider that the matter being tackled is one of the most important, if not the most important, in the whole country.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the contributions from many benches in the House to-night will not be helpful to the Minister either in the formation of the personnel of that commission or in guiding the commission themselves on the lines they should take on this problem.  We have had all the small little local angles developed here as though they were dealing with the commission itself.  I think the main points are the speedy setting up of the commission, due regard to the type of people who are going to constitute it, and a reasonable time for coming to a decision, having regard to the seriousness of the position at the moment.  I wonder if Deputies in the House have realised how serious the position in the railway world at the moment actually is.  As a practical railway man myself, I can speak of the influences of this collapse upon the railway workers, and I am not narrowed in my views.  I am also aware of the chaotic conditions obtaining throughout the country in the competition and scramble for traffic taking place on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Giles, has spoken of the danger of a monopoly.  We have monopolies in the country that are doing no great harm. If the monopoly is properly controlled and in the interests of the majority of the citizens of the State there is nothing wrong with monopoly.  There is nothing wrong with the monopoly of transport any more than with the monopoly of light or the monopoly in the carrying of letters.  Nobody complains of the monopoly in the carrying of letters&mdash;the postal services&mdash;of this country.  There is very little complaint with the electric lighting monopoly, and surely the transport industry, in a <Col N="1447" /> general way, is of more importance than either of the two things I have mentioned, and if the railways are going to be controlled in a regularised way under State or semi-State control, I think we should welcome that because that is going to operate in the best interests of all parties concerned as citizens of this State.  I do not think we need be frightened by the bugbear of monopoly which has been held up to terrorise us by Deputy Giles and others preceding him.</P>
    <P>There is one remark on the part of Deputy Giles which I resent&mdash;the charge of unfair discrimination by railway servants in handling of cattle of the citizens of this country.  That is an unworthy suggestion, and after 13 or more years in the railway service I resent that on behalf of the railwaymen.  There is no question of handling ranchers' cattle with greater haste and respect than is given to the smallest farmers of this country, and I think that will be borne out by the live-stock traders in the country.  Deputy Giles gave very little support for the contention made against the railwaymen. There may be complaints to be made&mdash; there is undoubtedly room for complaints&mdash;against the overlapping that is taking place even since the railway company has joined all the services operating.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brodrick has spoken of two different sets of fares operating where the lines are running parallel.  I could quote an instance of that myself. There is definitely room for inquiry into what is taking place, but the main thing that matters is that a definite effort was made in 1933 by the Government and the House to regulate the transport industry.  That proved to be a failure because the House was not able to foresee the ingenuity of the road pirates.  Many of those pirates, after being bought out and compensated, blossomed forth as wholesalers.  Taking advantage of the compensation given them, they came out refurnished with new vehicles and commenced to undercut the railway company, who are compelled to charge reasonable rates as fixed by the Railway Tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> The transport industry should be regarded as secondary only in importance to the agricultural industry, which must always be regarded as the primary industry of this country.  If the agricultural and the transport industries are to be treated on this basis, some kind of regulation should take place and the chaos and lack of co-ordination that have been going on in recent years should disappear. Unfortunately, new vested interests have been springing up in every town and village in the country until we have a sort of anti-railway mindedness in the country because of the fact that so many people, some of them, perhaps, misfits who could not fit into any other profession, just got hold of old lorries and commenced to carry traffic at all sort of prices, working all kinds of hours.  Somebody mentioned here that railway employees work only a certain number of hours, certain regular hours. That is true.  My complaint is that those people who are competing with the railways work at all hours, sometimes sleeping in their lorries on the roadside, a menace to themselves and to other traffic.  If our roads are to be preserved for their original purpose, steps will have to be taken to control this traffic.  Our roads are not suitable as are the Continental motor roads, which have been specially constructed for motor traffic, for this incessant tearing round by lorries of all kinds, with all kinds of heavy traffic which should be rightly carried on the iron road provided by the railway company.  If this irregular traffic were controlled it would provide some reasonable measure of safety on the roads of the country for ordinary pedestrians and horse traffic.</P>
    <P>I think that this is such an important question that this debate would have justified itself even if there were no question of a tribunal. The Minister made one statement which was rather difficult to understand.  He said that he did not intend to invite any railway experts to act on the tribunal.  If we have had legislation previous to now, in which the Government undoubtedly had the counsel of railway experts, and if that <Col N="1449" /> legislation has proved to be ineffective, what is the idea now when conditions have become so much worse, of handing over this question for consideration to an unregulated commission of people, whose only qualification must be that they are not railway experts? It reminds me of a case which I once heard in court, in which several witnesses were called to give evidence and in which not one of them knew anything about the case.  The judge at length said, in despair: &ldquo;If there is anybody else in court who knows nothing about the case will he come to the witness-box at once?&rdquo; I hope the Minister does not intend to invite all classes of people to act on this tribunal, bar people with an expert railway knowledge.  That would be a dangerous impasse to arrive at, in seeking a remedy for the transport industry.  I hope that he will be able to assure the House that, while the members of this tribunal will be drawn from representative interests in the country, it will mainly consist of persons who are competent to advise as to how the transport system should be put on an ordered basis.  With these few remarks, I think I can conclude by thanking the Minister for setting up this tribunal which is the best thing that can be done in the absence of the direct legislation which we had hoped would be introduced in this session.  I only hope, while I should not like to see the matter speeded up unduly, that the Minister's assurance as to having the report before the 8th February will be realised and that we shall be in a position in the near future to put the whole transport industry on a healthy foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it is a fair assumption that the Minister's decision to set up this commission of inquiry is due to his fear of the magnitude of the problem that he has been handling himself for five or six years?  From the Labour Benches, five or six years ago, I heard precisely similar speeches to that which I heard to-night from Deputy Keyes, that the transport system of the country was in a chaotic condition and that it was time to regulate it.  Labour Deputies welcomed the Transport Acts <Col N="1450" /> four or five years ago.  Those have been failures and some scapegoat must be found now.  Hence all this talk about the pirate on the road, but it was these alleged pirates on the road who developed the bus traffic and motor transport in this country.  It was through the enterprise of the thrifty workingman, who put down all his savings as a deposit to buy a bus and who borrowed the rest from the bank that the bus traffic was developed. They were the pioneers of bus and motor transport.  The railway companies would never have developed that transport if they had not been forced to do so.  When these men had developed the trade, a howl went up to regulate it, and then it became necessary to compensate these people who put buses on the road.  That was done and the unfortunate taxpayer was plundered to provide that compensation.  The men, who were thrown out of that service because they saw a loophole in the Act and legally developed another trade, are attacked in this House.  We are told that there are 5,000 or 6,000 workers affected in the railway service.  Anybody must sympathise with them, but how many are employed in the bus services and the road transport services?  I am prepared to believe there are just as many employed in the motor transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the cause of the whole trouble?  Diminishing production and the development of a dual service, an additional service beyond what we had in our young days.  You have a road transport service to-day that you had not 20 or 30 years ago.  You have also a railway service which you had 20 or 30 years ago, and then you have less production in the country.  What is your commission, when it is set up, going to do?  To ration the transport of that diminishing production between the road and the rail services.  This House, I submit, would be better engaged in trying to increase the productivity of the country.  That is the real trouble.  The chickens are coming home to roost.  The slaughter of 500,000 calves was not for nothing.  They, at from £15 to £20 per head, would have provided good freightage for the railways to-day, but they are not <Col N="1451" /> there.  When we set about examining this problem, we ought to remember that if we cannot have increased production we will not have increased freightage.  Now we must ration the freight.  Personally, I do not care who is on this commission.  I presume that legislation will have to be enacted to implement its report, and then is the time for us to examine in detail what the recommendations will be.  I am afraid that any report which will be implemented here in legislation which makes any attempt to give a further monopoly to the railways will meet with serious opposition in this House and in the country.  I should like to know why have the railways failed; and how are we going to carry out this rationing?  Let us look at it in general terms.  Everybody will admit that railway charges are higher than road charges, and is it sensibly suggested here that you must increase all charges up to the level of the railway charge? If you do, you are in for trouble, and the country is in for a loss.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke of the miserable wage of a man in his constituency who has 8/- a week and his board.  What is the Government regulated agricultural wage in this country?

      <P>I am talking about 8/- a week and board as against 27/- a week.  There is not a terrible difference.  That, in the Government view, is the economic wage that agriculture can pay.  That economic wage produces goods which are carried by the railways and by the road services.  Is it suggested that a further bite must be taken out of that agricultural production and given to the railways, or that the road charges must be increased by a further bite out of agricultural production with the obvious consequence of still further reducing the agricultural wage?  We cannot destroy wealth without feeling it.  We are beginning to feel it now and we shall feel it more in the future.  Wait until this commission sits and examines the whole problem.  They will, I am quite sure, place the blame on the right shoulders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in attempting to condemn, in advance, the road transport services.  Road motor transport has come to stay in this country and in a country so sparsely served by railways as this mobile motor transport must not only be protected but developed. Deputy Hughes struck the right note when he said that the railways should develop transport at the termini of the railways and not run it side by side with the railways for long distances throughout the country.  It is no harm to give expression to views of that kind, so that a commission, whoever its personnel may be, will have some guide as to the lines on which we here, so far as we reflect the opinion of the country, are thinking. In imagining points for criticism, while expressing our views generally on the causes of the present chaotic state of transport, we may think that we are able to fix the blame, but there is no way of finding that out exactly without an impartial inquiry and I think the best wishes of all Deputies and Parties should go to the Minister, together with a request to pick his commission judiciously and to pick it from people who may be helpful, not only in arriving <Col N="1453" /> at a conclusion, but in knowing sufficient of various aspects of the question as to be able to put good questions to witnesses when they go there to give evidence.  I hope the Minister will get into his stride quickly and hasten the investigations of the commission so that we will get an early report.  I hope the speed with which this commission will report will disappoint many of us who have lost 99 per cent. of faith in commissions.</P>

      <P>I welcome this proposal to set up a commission and I am sure the people throughout the country will appreciate it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The road transport employee's average is about one-third of the standard rate paid on the railways.  This inquiry will be very beneficial because, while maintaining the railway system and making it operative throughout the country, it will, at the same time, help to adjust the road transport system.  The Road Transport Act was a failure simply because the civilian population of the country, who had made various complaints, did not stand by them; in other words, did not assist the Guards in proving the cases against the people concerned.  That was mainly the cause of a breakdown of the Transport Act and, consequently people who received large sums of money from the railway companies came along and, in the guise of distributors, competed against the railways. That system must be inquired into and adjusted.  It will be an unlucky day for this country if the railway system is not maintained and developed.  The people at the moment may imagine that the cutting of prices by road transport services&mdash;lorry owners and others &mdash;will help to lower prices generally, but once the railway system is wiped out or not developed on proper lines, <Col N="1454" /> the road transport system will become a monopoly and the people generally will lose out.</P>
      <P>The point that we make in regard to this inquiry is that not only should there be an effort made to remedy the abuses under the road transport system at the moment, but that there should also be an effort made to adjust the headquarters organisation of the railway company.  At one time I suggested and others in the areas concerned suggested, that a board somewhat similar to the Electricity Supply Board should be established: in other words, that the Minister should nominate a representative to act in co-operation with the directors of the railway company with a view to defining policy and to arranging a transport system.  I believe that a move in that direction would tend towards greater efficiency, and would help to bring the system&mdash;a system that Deputy Belton has described as inadequate and 30 years behind the time&mdash;up to date, so that it would be able to meet the requirements of the country as we know them at the moment.  On behalf of the people whom I represent, people who are well conversant with the position, I gladly welcome this proposal to have an inquiry.  We certainly are confronted with this question of pirates who pay little or no wages and who, in my opinion, are a menace to the transport system of the country.  They have come along and offered themselves at starvation wages, and at very low rates to the farmers in our district.  We realise that while that may be very attractive at the moment, that eventually it is bound to be detrimental to the maintenance of a sound transport system for the country.  The Minister saved the railways in 1932-33.  I realise now, and people who have studied the position realise, that his decision to set up this tribunal, and to have a thorough investigation will once and for all save our transport system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to lend my support to the efforts the Minister is making in this matter.  So far as the main industry of this country is concerned, it would be absolutely disastrous <Col N="1455" /> to it if anything should happen to the railways, so that it is of first-class importance to have immediate steps taken to preserve them.  In the interests of the agricultural community it is of the greatest importance to preserve the railways for the carriage of cattle and of heavy goods.  You could not strike a greater blow at the agricultural community at the present time than to do anything that would tend to damage the railways.  They are required not only for passenger traffic but for the transport of cattle, manures, feeding stuffs and almost everything that concerns the welfare of agriculture.  They are our chief form of transport, and I desire to give my hearty support to the efforts that the Minister is now making to save them.  In addition, we have the tourist traffic which, if it is to be maintained must be maintained principally on the railways.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the competition of the buses.  It must be remembered that there are large parts of the country which have been developed by bus traffic and in which railway facilities are not provided at all.  I believe there is a certain amount of co-operation between the two now.  In my opinion, where the railways and the buses are running side by side they are injuring one another.  In a great many cases, so far as passenger traffic is concerned, the bus rates are very much higher than the railway rates.  I believe it would be absolutely disastrous to the whole country if we were to allow the railways to go down.  Therefore, I support the Minister's proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to read to the House, from the Official Debates, two statements which I made in the House some years ago.  The first was made on the 9th of March, 1933.  Speaking then on the Second Reading of the Road Transport Bill, I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I would strongly advise an examination of the whole transport problem by, let us say, two officers of his&mdash;the Minister's&mdash;Department, whom he knows as well as I do, with an accountant and an engineer added <Col N="1456" /> to them, to present to the Ministry, what, in their opinion, would be the best scheme that ought to be adopted in order to give the people an economic transport system; and to get the maximum number of persons employed; to save, if it is possible to save, the money which is being invested in this enormous concern, and to meet the natural and normal requirements of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, on the 3rd of May on the Fifth Stage of the Bill, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the Second Reading of this measure the Minister was informed from various parts of the House that this Bill would not solve the country's transport problem ....... These two measures, notwithstand ing what the Minister may say, will not improve the transport problem. To a certain extent they stabilise it as it is so as to give the Minister an opportunity of correcting and lessening any further complications that may arise in connection with the services; but they do not solve the problem .......  On the Second Reading I mentioned to the Minister what appeared to be a practical way of bringing about a solution of this whole question.  He has in his Department, certainly, two officials who would be quite capable of sitting down to consider and resolve the whole question along with an associated accountant, an engineer with a knowledge of transport and an engineer having a knowledge of railway transport.  My suggestion would be that that committee would have full power to examine the whole question, bearing in mind the idea that the railroads should form the main transport agency; that the main consideration was economic transport; that they would be entitled to consider in respect of any recommendations that they would make the claims that persons might have in respect of compensation; what compensation properly should fall upon the transport agencies; and what compensation ought to be paid by the State.  That committee could produce, in effect, a Bill which would be a Schedule to a single &lsquo;clause Act&rsquo; giving it the force of law and <Col N="1457" /> putting it outside of the competence of Parliament to consider it; keeping ministerial control out of the recommendations and viewing them and considering them solely from the point of view of economic transport, having in mind the maintenance of the railway organisation as the particular agency for transport in the country, not ignoring the fact that a new form of transport has extended transport throughout the country, is extending it and is likely to still further extend it.  That should form the main subject of this committee, and I think that granted such a proposal as I have put to the House, even the House itself would vote with an overwhelming majority in favour of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister in doing now what it was suggested to him he should do five and a half years ago.  I understand that he stated to the House this evening that this tribunal will have the power to investigae&mdash;that it will be responsible for an investigation into the problem.  The general impression in the House is that a tribunal is a body which sits and hears evidence and that brings in a report upon the evidence submitted to it.  If that be the intention with regard to this particular body it is absolutely useless. What concerns everybody is the concern of nobody.  If the Minister undertakes to make an investigation then he ought to get his Department working on the investigations that are necessary in order to get a sensible report from this committee, and we ought to expect some results from it.  But if this particular treatment in connection with transport is on a par with the rest of the Government's policy then I am afraid we have got to wait another five or six years for the Government to see a little bit of sense, that is if they ever will see it.</P>

      <P>Apart from the last speech, most of the other speeches made in the course of this discussion contained only very casual references to the motion before the House.  I am glad, however, that the discussion took place.  I think that those speeches, although if taken individually they may have been of little value, made between them a case for this motion. <Col N="1458" /> They revealed the same absence of information, the same muddled thinking and the same diversity of conclusions on this subject that one would expect to find in the anonymous letters that appear in the <i>Evening Mail,</i> and that is why it is necessary to set up this tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy, and I think I ought to be allowed to speak now without interruption from him.  I said, when moving the motion, that a stage had been reached at which major decisions on transport policy had necessarily to be made.  Even a decision to do nothing would be a major decision.  If we are going to ensure that the decision made will be a right one, it is necessary that the House and the public should be fully informed as to the facts.  That is what this tribunal is for&mdash;to get the facts and to make recommendations based upon these facts in relation to the problem.  The tribunal is not going to be representative of agriculture or of traders or anybody else.  Nobody will be on the tribunal who will be representative of anybody.  The tribunal will consist of one, two or three individuals specially chosen because of their ability to get the facts and to draw the right conclusions from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is apparent that many Deputies who have spoken have either declined to face the realities of the situation or do not know what these realities are.  I intimated in moving the motion that the position of urgency had arisen by reason of the fact that both railway companies operating here are not making their working expenses.  Do Deputies realise what that means?  It means that apart from the prospect that something will be done here, or that there will be some change in the situation which will alter the financial results of the company's working, these companies are going to stop.  They cannot carry on working at a loss.  There is no question of making profits.  There is no question of paying interest on their preference or guaranteed shares; there is no question of paying interest <Col N="1459" /> on debentures; they are not making their working expenses.  Yet we have people like Deputy Nally who tell us that the railway from Claremorris to Ballina must be kept open, even though, of course, you will get the flour in quicker by road and even though nobody intends to use the railway, it must be kept open because it will be bad for Mayo if it is closed. The railway from Dublin to Cork or the railway from Dublin to Belfast cannot be kept going at a loss, much less the various branch lines, the closing of which is essential to the preservation of the main lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brodrick objected to the closing of the branch line from Galway to Clifden.  That line had reached such a state of insecurity that it was contrary to the public interest to allow trains to run over it.  The putting of that line into a condition of reasonable safety would involve an expenditure of £800,000.  There was no possibility of that line ever earning 1 per cent. upon £800,000; it was not even earning its working expenses.  Those very Deputies who protest that these railway lines should be kept open, who are objecting to their being closed, who will come with deputations to my Department every time a railway company proposes to close one, are the same Deputies who, in public and in this House, say that there must be no monopoly.  Of course we must have competition; of course the independent owners of lorries must be allowed to operate.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot have that competition which has forced down railway rates to an utterly uneconomic level and at the same time keep the railways open.  That is the fact that I want Deputies to face.  There has not been a diminution in traffic.  The total tonnage of merchandise carried by the Great Southern Railways last year was 8 or 10 per cent. higher than in the first year of that company's existence&mdash;1925&mdash;the first year after the Amalgamation Act of 1924 came into operation.  But the amount they got for carrying it was not sufficient to pay the cost of it and that is due to the existence, not so much of these <Col N="1460" /> pirato operators that Deputies talk about, but to competition of another kind to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was glad of the opportunity of saying that this transport situation is entirely the fault of the Minister.  So long as he can say that he is satisfied.  Deputy Dillon, of course, was also, like Deputy Cosgrave, glad to say, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; Deputy Dillon knows that he says so much about everything it is impossible to visualise any situation arising in this country at any time about which Deputy Dillon could not say, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  He has got it all wrong. Other Deputies who spoke in the same strain have also merely shown their inability to understand what has happened since 1925.  The Railway Act of 1933 set out to give the company a monopoly with the approval of every Party in this House, even the approval of Deputies who are now denouncing monopolies.  It was 90 per cent. effective.  Despite what Deputy Dillon said, so far as passenger traffic is concerned, it was 100 per cent. effective.  So far as goods traffic is concerned, it is quite true that some people did find a successful method of evading its provisions.  We may be at fault in that we did not foresee those possible evasions.  If we are at fault, we are in the company of every other Government in the world which legislated in this matter.  Certainly our legislation was no more ineffective than the legislation in Northern Ireland, which was not prepared by the inefficient Minister for Industry and Commerce, but by the same type of expert tribunal that Deputy Cosgrave was talking about a few minutes ago.</P>
    <P>All the traffic carried by those people who evaded the Act, these pirates whom Deputy Davin talked about or the cruisers mentioned by other Deputies, does not matter that much in relation to the position of the railway company.  Not a single Deputy will face the fact that the most effective competition to the company was the private lorry which is not carrying goods for hire, not even engaged in carrying on a faked distribution organisation in order to get carrying goods <Col N="1461" /> for hire&mdash;the private lorry, the private car.  If we are going to secure that there will be available to the railway company a volume of traffic sufficient to enable it to carry on its organisation and secure profitable rates of charge for the carrying of that traffic, it is that most dangerous form of competition that will have to be regulated. I can see at once that there will be many good arguments for doing nothing, for allowing the railway company to close down.  There are people who contend that we in this country, in our circumstances, can carry on without railways at all.  There are people who will contend that a much more efficient transport organisation can be provided on the roads if the railways disappear.  Perhaps they are right, but I do not think they are.  That contention is seriously made by serious people.  Deputies who spoke here as if it were possible to achieve some Utopian situation have to face that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin said the railway companies are not paying high enough wages, that they are not employing sufficient men, that the branch lines they closed down should be reopened. He spoke glibly along that line, miles away from the realities of the situation, without facing the fact that what we are trying to do is to impose limitations on the other forms of transportation in order to preserve, in the national interest, the main lines of railway, because it is only the main lines that can be preserved.  In so far as the areas served by branch lines are concerned, public transport in those areas was never an economic proposition.  Deputies talked about pre-War conditions.  I invite them to read the report of the Transport Commission set up in 1922.  Deputy Cosgrave will remember that commission and its report.  Even before the War, when there was no other form of public transport available, the railway companies in this part of Ireland were earning on an average 3 per cent. on their capital, and they earned that 3 per cent. on the basis of low wages and extraordinarily bad conditions of employment for their workers&mdash;wages and conditions of employment which were swept away during the War.  The Transport Commission in 1922 stated <Col N="1462" /> that the railway companies in this area can never get back to pre-War conditions, to conditions in which they earned 3 per cent. on their capital.</P>
    <P>That situation has changed even more in that direction since then, for a great part of this public transport was provided by subsidy.  Either the cost of constructing the railway lines was provided by a Government grant or the cost of operating the lines was provided by a local subsidy or by an arrangement for baronial guarantees or something of that kind.  Deputies have to face that fact.  If they want to preserve and assist the railway services, they cannot at the same time say that, in relation to these railway services, everybody who chooses to buy a lorry is to be allowed to go into competition and force down the cost of transportation to such an extent that, no matter how efficiently the service is run, the working cost cannot be secured.  I do not say that the Great Southern Railways or the Great Northern Railway have run their services efficiently.  I do not say that they have even tried to get the best results out of the 1933 Act.  I think quite the reverse.  I think that neither company has made a really serious effort to turn to the fullest possible advantage the position created for them by the legislation of 1933. But to say that the existence of transport difficulties now is due to the 1933 Act is sheer nonsense.  The railways would have disappeared in 1933 if that legislation had not then been passed. For a number of years following 1933, the railway position was definitely improving.  The receipts were improving.  They were able, not merely to maintain their operations and to pay some interest upon their shares, but they were able also to recover some of the arrears of maintenance expenditure which had gone by default in earlier years.  This year was a bad year.  Perhaps the circumstances of this year are purely temporary and will not exist at all next year.  Perhaps we are agitating ourselves unduly.  Unfortunately, I do not think that that is the case. We have got to face up to the fact that this year working expenses are not being made, and that, unless something is done, the operations of the companies must cease.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> I do not think that there is anything else to which I should like to refer at this stage.  Obviously we have got to leave the field clear for this tribunal to act without any pressure being put upon them in one direction or another.  It is clear that we cannot go back on the policy adopted in 1933.  Whatever steps are taken must be an advance upon those taken then.  My recollection of the type of criticism we got in 1933 was that we were going too far.  Those who spoke against the measures that year did not do so on the grounds that they were inadequate to deal with our transport problems.  In so far as they were criticised at all, they were criticised on the ground that they were giving the companies advantages which were unnecessary to their preservation.  I intimated then that time might prove that we were not going far enough.  It is clear now that that is so, and that if public transport is to be preserved here and operated on a profitable basis, something more must be done.  I do not think that we did wrong.  I think that we were fully justified in giving the Great Southern Railways Company an opportunity of showing whether it could make good under conditions which it itself believed to be adequate to enable it to make good.  We gave it these conditions in 1933, and if it has not succeeded in turning these conditions to full advantage then expected, it is time to review the position. That is what this tribunal is for. Deputy Dillon made some sarcastic reference to the commission which we set up regarding transport in Donegal. I want to say that the persons who carried out that inquiry did extraordinarily useful work and published a report which was a model report&mdash;a model for its clarity and for the conciseness of the views expressed.</P>

A few months ago, I indicated that I was having the position of the pig and bacon industry examined and that, as a result of that investigation, I proposed to bring further legislation before the Dáil.  That legislation is not ready but I expect that it will be brought before the Dáil in the spring. Almost inevitably, part of the new recommendations will deal with a change in the constitution of the two boards.  Whether it will result in the establishment of one board or not, I do not know, but there is certain to be a change.  Under the present law, the boards are due to be elected in December and January&mdash;the last day of December, in the case of the pigs board, and the 10th January in the case of the bacon board.  This Bill is designed merely to avoid the necessity for that election and to enable the boards to carry on until we make the necessary changes.  That is all this Bill does.</P>
