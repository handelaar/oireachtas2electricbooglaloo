      <P>As indicated in my reply of 27th October last, the approval of plans is conditional on the acquisition of additional land.  It is understood the board of health have now completed negotiations for the acquisition of the additional land and that proposals in the matter are about to be submitted for my approval.  I am not in a position to say when the erection of the cottages will be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>I have no information regarding the price or quality of maize meal sold ex-mill Liverpool, but it would not be possible to have maize meal mixture sold in this country at £7 15s. per ton, having regard to the fact that the cost of Argentine maize delivered at mills situated at ports in Ireland is rather more than £8 per ton.</P>

We understood the Government proposed to adjourn for some weeks after next week.  We suggested that the next stage of the Shops Bill should be left over until after the adjournment, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce objected.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies will have noted, this amendment proposes to repeal the entire Section 18 and to substitute a number of new provisions therefor.  In so far as the ordinary class of workers is concerned, the outstanding point of these new provisions is a slight reduction in the number of hours of overtime that may be worked in a period of four weeks, or in the course of a year.  There is no variation in the hours of overtime which may be worked in each week.  The principal change, however, to which no doubt Deputies have directed their attention, is the introduction of a new period of 56 hours which will apply in respect of workers employed in hotels. When the Bill was introduced, it applied only to a certain limited class of hotel workers, and I informed the House during the discussion in Committee <Col N="395" /> that it seemed clear that we should either have to exclude hotel workers altogether, or include them all.  I came to the decision to include them all, but I recognise that, in doing so, we are creating new difficulties and that the circumstances applying in hotels are in many respects dissimilar from those applying in ordinary shops and that different provision in respect of hotel workers will be necessary.</P>
      <P>The Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, distinguished between industries, making different provisions for those industries which were worked by day and those which had to be worked by a continuous process.  For the day industries, a 48-hour maximum week was prescribed, and for the continuous process industries, a 56-hour maximum.  I think we can see some similarity between the type of work done in a hotel and in a continuous process industry in so far as the work proceeds ordinarily around the whole period of the day, and that there is, therefore, a justification for a differentiation between the maximum hours permitted in hotels and those permitted in shops.  There are other considerations which apply also. In respect of a very large number of hotel workers, it is correct to say that they reside on the premises in which they work and, consequently, there is no time lost by them in going to or proceeding from their place of work to their homes.  The provision of a longer normal working week for hotel workers involved, as a consequence, a variation in the maximum hours of overtime permitted. I think that it is necessary that some liberality in respect of overtime for hotel workers should be authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the circumstances existing in hotels which cater particularly for a holiday trade, where a very large rush of business occurs at particular seasons, and very often very limited seasons, while considerable slackness is experienced at other periods of the year.  To enable the proprietors of such hotels to cater for abnormal business of that kind, occurring in very restricted seasons, some exceptional provision in respect of overtime is necessary.  It is proposed to make that here for hotel <Col N="396" /> workers.  While Deputies may be perturbed by the institution in the Bill of a longer working week than that originally contemplated for all shop workers, I think it can be said with confidence that the inclusion of all hotel workers within the scope of the Bill will mean a very great improvement in their working conditions.  Even the 56 hours authorised by the proposed new section will involve in many cases a substantial reduction in their working hours, whereas the operation of the holiday and the half-holiday provision will confer on these workers benefits which they did not previously enjoy.</P>
    <P>I think the general scheme, the sum total of all the various provisions, will mean a substantial improvement in the working conditions of this class of workers.  I do not say that we are fixing 56 hours as the normal working week for hotel workers in perpetuity. It is, of course, necessary again to remind Deputies that what the Bill proposes to do is to fix the maximum limits beyond which workers cannot be employed.  It establishes the minimum standards of employment which must be observed, and there is, of course, nothing to prevent any hotel proprietor observing better standards, or any hotel worker seeking to obtain them.  In any event, the experiment in the regulation of hotel work which this Bill will commence will enable data and experience to be obtained which will perhaps permit of fresh legislation governing that type of work at some future date.  I am satisfied that we should not go further than it is proposed in this new section at present in the regulation of the hours of work in such shops.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are seven amendments tabled to Section 18.  The section, as recast in amendment No. 34, appears to contain concessions on the lines suggested by amendments Nos. 35 to 39.  Amendment No. 40 would not fit in with the redrafted section.  It would be possible, making certain alterations, to allow those amendments to be submitted to the proposed new section. That course, however, would be unsatisfactory in many ways.  I suggest that Deputies might consider how <Col N="397" /> far the concessions, or what appear to me to be concessions, meet the points raised, and then resubmit their amendments <i>mutatis mutandis</i> on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the discussion proceeds, I should also draw attention to other changes which the amendment effects in accordance with various suggestions made in Committee.  We are prohibiting the employment of juveniles under 16 years of age on overtime at all.  The overtime provisions, so far as they affect juveniles, relate only to juveniles over 16 years of age.  Reference was also made to the difficulty in determining what would be the normal working week for a worker in a week in which he received a holiday, and in order to deal with that circumstance, we are providing that the worker shall be deemed to have done eight hours on a day on which he gets a whole holiday, so that if he gets a holiday in a week he will be entitled to overtime in respect of any period in excess of 40 hours' work within that week.  We are also providing that where a shop assistant does industrial work for his employer, or where he works for another employer, the total work done by him is to be taken into account for the purpose of determining what his working hours were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what has become of sub-section (4) of the original Section 18?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now sub-section (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister.  I think there is considerable <Col N="398" /> difference between the workers in hotels and the workers in ordinary shops, owing to the fact that the shop assistant is there the whole time working, and in the case of the hotel worker. there is a very considerable interval in the day during which he is not working, but just sitting down.  That makes a substantial difference.  What puzzles me in this section is sub-section (4), which refers to the question of leave <i>(sub-section quoted).</i>  The whole holiday there is part of the assistant's annual leave, and that whole holiday is to count as eight hours of shop work. I think I understand what the Minister means.  If one day of the 14 is taken casually, the Minister intends, I think, that that should count as eight hours of work.  Suppose this state of affairs comes about: the holidays are taken not on a Monday, but in the middle of the week.  Let us assume that the 14 days run from Wednesday until the following Wednesday week.  Then, it appears to me that every one of these 14 days will count as eight-hour working days so far as part of the first week is concerned.  If the holidays run from Tuesday, the assistant will have free Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday of that week, and these will count as eight-hour working days. I do not think that that is the Minister's intention.  In the following week, they would not count in that way because he would be getting the whole of that week, but the days in the following week on which he would still be on holiday would count as eight hours because he would not be getting the whole of that week.  I do not think that it was the Minister's intention that, if 14 days were taken consecutively, they should count as eight-hour working days for the week in which they occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I understand the Deputy properly.  The difficulty we had to contend with was that the Bill prescribed, as a normal working week, a week of 48 hours.  The question would then arise: What would happen in the week in which a shop assistant gets the whole period or gets two or three days of annual leave? Could the 48 hours be crowded into the remainder of the week &mdash; into three or <Col N="399" /> four days or into five days.  In order to deal with that situation, we had to fix, in relation to the day on which he gets leave, a number of hours in respect of which he could be said to have worked for the purpose of determining what the working week would be.  A shop assistant who gets one day as a whole holiday, if he is working the normal working week, will work 40 hours in the other five days.  If he works more he is entitled to overtime pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case I put.  He is working one day in the week and, for the other five days, he has holidays because he is taking his annual leave.  As the section stands, that would count as 40 hours. The Minister says that the number of hours he works in the week will be taken as 48, and that 48 hours will have to be taken off the 216 hours in any period of four consecutive weeks.  The period of hours is not confined to one week.  It will come off the 216 hours in any period of four consecutive weeks and it will come off the 2,600 hours in a year.  I do not think that that is the Minister's intention.  I do not know whether the Minister appreciates the point I am endeavouring to explain.  It is very difficult to explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct to say that the assistant will be deemed to have worked eight hours both for the purpose of sub-section (2), which deals with the ordinary working week, and for the purpose of sub-section (3), which deals with overtime.  Otherwise, it would be possible to contemplate the possibility of a man getting five days' holidays in the week and being required to work 60 hours in one day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not thinking of that.  The time comes off the long period.  If a man is allowed 14 consecutive days' holidays, commencing on a Monday, no trouble arises.  Nothing is taken off the 216 hours for the 14 days' annual holiday <Col N="400" /> and nothing is taken off the 2,000 hours.  On the other hand, if the holiday begins on Tuesday then this section operates and the five days' holidays are to be counted as 40 hours, which will be taken off the 2,600 hours, so that there will be a considerable difference between the annual holiday beginning on a Monday and the annual holiday beginning on a Tuesday.  That is what puzzles me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is necessary to maintain that.  It is necessary that eight hours in respect of every day's leave should be taken from the total number of hours he might work in four weeks because otherwise you would have a position where the whole of the four weeks of permitted overtime might be concentrated into two weeks.  As a matter of fact, it could not be worked in that time, having regard to the overriding maximum of an 11-hour day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <P>May I direct the attention of the House to this aspect of the question: This Bill is intended to be a code which will rigidly bind every shop proprietor in the country and every breach of which will make him liable to the law.  You have the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has been consulting his permanent officials, probably, for the last six months about this Bill; you have Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, a lawyer of wide experience; you have members of the Labour Party, who have probably consulted over this measure with their trade union officials, and it is abundantly clear that all of them find considerable difficulty in arriving at certainty, even after discussion, as to what the exact meaning of these provisions is.</P>

Not a single one of them has turned his mind to conditions obtaining in rural Ireland, with the exception of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  I do not deny that the other Deputies taking part in the debate are experts, probably, on shop conditions in cities but there is no analogy between conditions in city shops and in the rural areas.</P>

If Deputy Heron says that conditions in Dublin are ideal, then we ought to know that the Bill was drafted to remedy abuses existing in the country, but not a single word has been said about that in the debate.  If certain types of abuse exist in the country&mdash;and I am sure there might be abuses existing there&mdash;then this Bill has not been handled with an eye to conditions in the country.  There are strict regulations as to the maximum number of hours that may be worked in a given week.  My recollection is that either in this Bill or in the Shops (Hours of Trading) Bill there was some proviso that at certain seasons of the year there would be greater laxity in <Col N="402" /> the matter of overtime.  It appears from Section 18 that there is no differentiation between the Christmas season and any other season as to the maximum number of hours overtime that can be worked in a week.  Nobody wants to have overtime unless it is necessary, and the employer has to pay his employees more for working overtime. But, suppose that Christmas falls on a Saturday, and that Monday and Tuesday are normal working days, when the assistants work eight hours, the country people would have only Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of that week for their Christmas shopping. All the work would be concentrated into three days.  How are you going to get the work done if there is not sufficient overtime to keep the shelves filled?  The thing cannot be done. Once you fix this no shopkeeper is going to make an assistant work overtime when it is not necessary.  It seems to me to be an extremely imprudent thing to have the overtime hours as rigid as that in a country town.  It simply will not work, and people will have to be sent home without their Christmas goods.  There are those who say that that kind of objection can be offered to every reform of legislation. If I were making this objection in respect of the whole year round, or if I said that if shopkeepers in country towns were not allowed to remain open until 9 o'clock the people would not get what they wanted, I would agree with Deputy Heron that that is the kind of obstructive demurrer that might be offered to every piece of legislation. That is not the case I make.  I am making the case that at Christmas these people have to wait for money to come from America, or from the Christmas fair, because they will not do their shopping until they have something to pay on account They get the money either from their children or from what they sell at the Christmas fair.  It may be said that that is a bad system but you would have to abolish the whole credit system in rural Ireland if you want to do away with it.  If you cannot meet the convenience of the people in respect of Christmas requirements real hardship will result.  I do not blame the Minister for Industry and <Col N="403" /> Commerce for feeling that that is not a valid objection, because he does not know anything about it.  He was born in the City of Dublin and has lived all his life in it.</P>

An employer could then tell his assistants to go home and take a good rest after the Christmas rush.  It is a time that puts a very great strain on everyone concerned <Col N="404" /> with the work.  It is an emergency that arises once a year and seeing that shopkeepers and their assistants live out of the farmer for the 12 months, the least they can do is to convenience them after their exceptionally arduous work.  That would not be too much to ask for the agricultural community.</P>

I do not believe that if you were to go round those benches and ask any single Deputy who knows rural conditions in Ireland to stand up that he will contradict what I say&mdash;not one, if they have the moral courage to say so.  The next thing that I want to point out is that you prohibit all overtime for juveniles in this new section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use arguing about it now.  I am not going to wrangle with the Deputy, who can read what was said in the Official Report. Whatever the Minister said, this Bill operates to prevent overtime for persons under 16 years of age.  That may be right or it may be wrong, but at least open your eyes to what you are doing.  That means that any boy who is serving his apprenticeship in a country shop must be sent off the premises at the end of his 48 hours in any given week.  Either we believe in the apprenticeship system or we do not.  There is <Col N="406" /> a good deal to be said against the apprenticeship system; there is a good deal to be said for it.  I believe it is a system which is capable of great abuse just as the boarding school system is capable of great abuse, or as most other human institutions are capable of abuse.  On balance, I think that the system is a good system, and that it is a good method of getting a training for juveniles who will have to earn their living later in the ordinary way.  But, if you categorically prohibit all work over 48 hours a week for the apprentice under 16 learning his trade, it means that in Christmas week &mdash; and mind you that is the week that is going to give rise to all the difficulty: the rest of the year may require adjustment, but it can be met&mdash;a certain proportion of your staff must be put off the premises and the remainder left there to get the work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the ordinary well-organised establishment divides its work into certain routine duties for each section of the staff.  The junior apprentices will be doing the simplest routine jobs.  As they rise up and gain experience their responsibilities extend until the junior paid assistant is doing reasonably responsible work.  If you have to put your apprentices out in the evening, and have to call upon your paid assistants to do the routine jobs that the apprentice normally does, it means that your whole organisation becomes chaotic.  You are immensely hindered and involved in all kinds of difficulties that it is hard for the person who has not got practical experience of running a shop to understand.  Here, again, I believe that this difficulty is going to arise almost exclusively during the Christmas season.  I apprehend that if this difficulty is going to be left in its present form that, taken together with the other restrictions provided in the Bill, it will sooner or later abolish the apprenticeship system in every decent shop.  Nobody who does not want to trade on his apprentices and abuse them will retain apprentices.  I agree that the man who is deliberately misusing his apprentices &mdash; trying to make them do the work of salaried men &mdash; may find it worth his while to wind his way in and out of the provisions <Col N="407" /> of this Bill, but the decent man who really wants to give his apprentices an honest, decent training will simply say that they are trouble enough as it is &mdash; that if on top of being responsible for the youngsters' moral and general upbringing and for teaching them their business, he has to comply with a pyramid of regulations he will say that it is not worth his while, and will clear out his apprentices altogether.  It may be that the Legislature has made up its mind that it wants to do that.  Very well, if you have made up your minds to do that, then, in the name of God, abolish the apprenticeship system altogether.  This kind of thing will mean that the bad master will continue to take apprentices, and that the good master will chuck them.  That is the worst thing that could happen.  Abolish the system altogether if you want to do so now, but do not allow a situation to arise in which you will have to come back and abolish it in two or three years' time because you yourselves have created such abuses in connection with it that it is no longer possible to tolerate its continuance.</P>
    <P>The new section also provides for time and a quarter, and this must be read in conjunction with Section 22, which is virtually unamended.  Under Section 22, you provide that existing rates of wages must continue to be paid even though the terms and conditions have been improved and the hours shortened, and under this new section, you further provide that time and a quarter must be paid for any period over 48 hours which an employee works.  That means that the employer who has pushed wages up to the last penny that he was able to afford to pay in existing conditions is now required to pay 25 per cent. on that high wage which he had fixed for his employees out of his own sense of duty before this Bill was ever heard of, whereas the sweater, who kept his men down to the lowest penny that he could persuade them to take, is only going to be required to pay 25 per cent. extra in consideration of the improved conditions provided for in this Bill.  There are individuals whom I know who have honestly tried to <Col N="408" /> squeeze out of their business the last penny that they could economically give their employees who, perhaps, are working 54 hours a week now as well as substantial overtime around the Christmas season.  But making full allowance for all the profit that the shopkeeper was able to get on the basis of a 54-hour week and free overtime at Christmas, he was giving to his employees the last penny that he could afford.  Let us assume that that is not only subjectively true for the shopkeeper but objectively true; in fact, that he was giving them the last penny his business could afford to pay.  He is now called upon to shorten their hours and to raise these inflated wages by 25 per cent. in respect of every hour's overtime work.</P>
    <P>But what is the position of the sweater next door who is paying the lowest rate of wages that he can persuade his employees to take?  There is a nominal provision in the Bill that the Minister can fix rates of wages if called upon to do so, but the position of the sweater at present is that he need only pay time and a quarter extra on a sweated rate.  That is simply not rational.  It is penalising those who have tried to do their duty and is setting a premium on bad conduct in the past.  The Minister may ask me, what do you propose to do?  My answer is perfectly simple.  It is that you cannot fix overtime rates if you do not fix wages.  If you are going to provide by law that overtime must be paid for at time and a quarter, you must go on and fix minimum rates of wages for industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to remind me.  I am not in the habit of making one speech in Athy and another in Dáil Eireann.  What I am saying now will probably be published.  My answer to that question, in the light of this body of regulations, is yes, provided it is done by an informed body who will really look into the difficulties and complications surrounding the situation.  If you are going to fix overtime rates, you must fix a minimum wage, otherwise you set a premium on the bad employer and gravely penalise the man who is trying to do his duty.</P>
      <P>Let me put this last point to the House.  This is the kind of situation that is going to arise.  You have provided that overtime must be paid on this time and a quarter rate.  Take a merchant who has honestly been paying the maximum he can afford to pay on the basis of the present hours of work, and who has also provided his assistants with three weeks' holidays with full pay, instead of the fortnight provided for in the Bill.  Is it contrary to the spirit of this Bill for that employer to say to his employees hereafter: &ldquo;I am going to lay you off for a week in the summer, give you two weeks' holidays and a week off without pay, and when Christmas comes round, out of the pool created by laying off all the assistants for one week in summer, I will pay you the overtime you will earn by working overtime at Christmas&rdquo;? If you are to take Section 22 literally, that is certainly contrary to the spirit of the Bill, but would it be all unreasonable thing to do?  I do not think it would.  I should like the Minister to speak honestly and tell us what he thinks.</P>

      <P>They may suffer in silence.  The Minister will surely recognise that there is some value in having somebody to talk to instead of civil servants.  The Minister spends all his time talking to officials who have nothing else to do only to riddle the puzzles which he provides for the public, and the public have something else to do than trying to find out the puzzles put to them by the Minister.  I speak largely as a citizen who knows a great deal about the conditions which are going to be affected by the Bill.  I want information, and I think this is the time to put before the Minister and the House the difficulties that some of these regulations are going to create.  I think it is a perfectly legitimate question to ask whether, in the light of Section 22 with its reactions on Section 18, it would be in the spirit of the legislation to gather a pool of money in the summer by giving a week's holiday without pay, laying off the assistants for a week without pay, and giving back that money to the assistants at Christmas in exchange for such overtime as they may work? I put three or four deliberate questions to the Minister and every Deputy interested, and I think they ought to be answered before you leave the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">

      <P>With regard to a great deal of what Deputy Dillon has said, I think that he answered himself when he said that this kind of objection is made to every measure the object of which is to give protection to any section of the community.  In the main, I think that Deputy Dillon's case has been special pleading.  In reference to this question of overtime during the Christmas rush period, I suggest to Deputy Dillon that, as the Bill stands, the shop assistants on Christmas Eve, or the day before Christmas Eve, could be kept at work for 13 hours, making an allowance of two hours for meals.  I presume the Deputy would permit the assistants to eat during that period of 13 hours.  They will be at work for 11 hours, but if you add on the two hours for meals, they will be <Col N="411" /> actually on duty for 13 hours in one day.  I suggest that it is long enough to be on duty from 9 in the morning until midnight.  I suggest that that is long enough for any shop assistant to work on any day during the Christmas rush or any other day.</P>

      <P>It is wrong, I think, for the Deputy to suggest that the Bill, as it now stands, is unreasonable in relation to Christmas trade conditions in country shops.  That is my view.  On the other question, the question of penalising the fair employer in the interests of the unfair employer, Deputy Dillon suggests that, having regard to the overtime provision in the Bill, the sweating employer will get his labour cheap and the good employer will be compelled to pay overtime rates.  This portion of this section of the Bill purports to regulate hours and, in regulating hours, it is impossible to go into the question of what every individual employer is paying in wages at present. But I suggest to Deputy Dillon that the bad employer and the good employer will be relatively in the same position as before so far as the hour-fixing section of the Bill is concerned.</P>

      <P>What is the alternative? Deputy Dillon, when asked for an alternative, suggested that wage-fixing machinery should accompany any hour-fixing machinery &mdash; that there should be a legal minimum wage.  I, personally, am glad, and I am sure every member of the Labour Party is glad to hear Deputy Dillon say that.  We believe that there ought to be a national minimum wage for all workers, including shop workers. But Deputy Dillon overlooked the fact that in the Bill there is provision for adjusting wages and the elimination of the bad employer.  There is a section in the Bill which provides for the establishment of a wages board which will be given authority to fix wages.  Surely that meets the objection made by Deputy Dillon.  If it is the view of the Minister that, in a particular district, there are sweating employers taking the kind of advantage of this legislation which Deputy Dillon refers to, then a wages board can be established.  The good employers and the shop assistants in a particular area can make representations to the Minister to have a wages board established to deal with the sweating employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take an arbitrary figure, not binding ourselves to saying whether it is the right figure or not.  Suppose the wages board meets and says that the minimum wage shall be 50/- in this area.  Supposing the good employer says: &ldquo;I have been able to afford £3.&rdquo;  Why should he be required to pay overtime on the basis of £3 per week if the wages board fixes the wages at 50/-?  He should not be.  The Bill does not provide that, if you fix a minimum wage by the wages board, all the employers in the area will be entitled to pay overtime on the basis of that wage.  They must go on paying <Col N="413" /> on the basis of the wage they were paying when the Bill came into operation. That is what I say is wrong.  I know many cases of agricultural employers who had not to change the wages at all, because the wages we were paying not only paid the agricultural labourer's wages, but we had a substantial sum in addition towards overtime if he worked 12 hours.</P>

      <P>I shall pass from that. Does Deputy Dillon seriously believe that a 48-hour week for juveniles without overtime is going to lead to the abolition of the apprenticeship system? Does any other Deputy believe that?  I do not think so.  As regards the Christmas week, there is a provision in the Bill for the exemption of special trades from the hours provisions in any special period.  In the ordinary course remember Christmas does not fall on Monday. It only falls on Monday in one year in seven.  Where it falls on a day in the middle of the week no difficulty will arise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash; because there will be adequate scope for overtime within the existing hours, subject to the overriding maximum of eleven hours per day which the Bill lays down.  It may be necessary to make some additional provision in relation to that matter when Christmas day falls on a Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it falls on Friday or Saturday, there are five days during that week during which the overriding maximum of eleven hours per day can be worked.  The maximum hours which can be worked are 55 in that week, and an assistant can work up to the limit provided by the Bill, on every day, without any alteration in the overtime provision.  The only circumstances in which some alteration in the overtime provision might be necessary would be when Christmas Day falls on a Monday, and then only in relation to specific types of trades that might be affected, or perhaps only in special areas.  I know that in Dublin it used to be the custom to remain open until one or two o'clock on the morning of Christmas day.  That custom has now disappeared, except in relation to certain provision shops.  I think most business establishments are closed down at 10 o'clock or 10.30.  There may be special circumstances in rural areas, and power to deal with these special circumstances are taken in the Bill.  When an Order is made under sub-section (7) or (8), which <Col N="415" /> deals with the general exemption from the powers of the Bill, provision is made for consultation, but an Order can be made at any time to deal with a special problem arising in a special trade or in a special area.  That can be used to deal with any special circumstances that may arise.  It was mainly designed to meet with such special circumstances as might arise on some occasion such as the Eucharistic Congress when crowds might flock into one particular area and an unusual leniency in regard to hours might be called for.</P>

      <P>However, the reason that I suggest that you should suspend the provision for overtime in the Christmas week is this: It is no use in saying that during Christmas week you can work 11 hours per day.  I do not want to work 11 hours on every day before Christmas.  I only want to work eight hours on the day on which there is no particular reason to work more.  Supposing I work a normal day on Monday, that my customers come in in crowds on Tuesday, and that the shelves are cleared.  I then have got to fill the shelves for Wednesday's trade.  How am I going to do it under the conditions laid down here?  There is no use in telling me that if I had foresight to do it on Monday I would not be required to work late on Tuesday. I could not pile the stuff up on the floor.  I would simply have got to wait until the shelves were cleared. Supposing you had a big reserve stock of sugar, and that after your shelves were cleared on Tuesday, you found that what the people had bought was currants, and you had plenty of sugar but no currants, what were you going to do?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a Deputy who comes tumbling down from Skerries to talk about what is happening in County Mayo!  If a shop assistant becomes unemployed in Ballaghaderreen, he does not go out and march up and down the street waiting for someone to call him in to a job.  He goes home to his mother, and his mother may live away at Tourlestrane, or out on the side of a country road, perhaps 30 or 35 miles away.  He, perhaps, tells some of his companions: &ldquo;If you hear of a job will you send for me.&rdquo;  During Christmas week, when I am called upon to deal with a sudden rush of customers, I cannot send a message to tell Paddy MacNulty, 30 miles away, that there is a job waiting for him, and even if I did succeed in sending him that message, it would cost him more to come in a car than he would get for that day's work.  That is what I am trying to emphasise.  The conditions in rural Ireland are quite different from those in Dublin and other large centres of population.  In Dublin, in London and <Col N="417" /> in other big centres in which I have worked myself there is a floating population of temporary labour always on tap, and they turn up every morning at the employment exchange.  If you want ten, or even 50, or 100 hands, there are means of getting in touch with them overnight.  That does not apply in rural Ireland.  I agree with Deputy Heron that if we had recourse to a pool of that description all my case would fall to the ground.  If it were possible to get extra help immediately I do not think I could argue for getting exemption for rural areas, but that difficulty is there, and we cannot surmount the difficulty by any other means.  That is why I want the overtime provision to be waived for Christmas week.  If the Minister evolves some plan, or can explain how a country shopkeeper could get a staff on the lines suggested by Deputy Heron, then the bulk of my objection falls to the ground.  Of course, it is not possible to get such a staff.  For that reason, I think the proper course here would be to waive the overtime provisions for Christmas week.  If the representatives of the Labour Party or decent employers come to the conclusion that that gives rise to abuse, Parliament will still be sitting, and we can always come back to it and remedy that situation.  The Labour Party have no reason to think that in this matter they are struggling against a hard-shelled, conservative and reactionary opposition.  They are not. Every side of this House, the Government, the Opposition and all others, are anxious to provide a decent standard of living for the workingman in this country, and they have given ample evidence of that in the last two or three years.  Let us not adopt tactics as if we were pushing against a conservative, reactionary majority, from whom we had to wring every concession. Everyone is anxious to lend a hand, and we should approach those problems in the knowledge that that is so.</P>

This employment is of a very seasonal character, and in all probability the workers would have to go elsewhere if they did not get this particular form of employment. It is a very serious matter for those people.  Their profits are not very large, and I think this is a case where the Minister could perhaps see his way to make some concession.</P>

It has been represented to me that it is a very big one, and that those people cannot afford to pay for extra hours, or for a double staff which is probably what it would mean as the employment is very seasonal.  This is a matter of some seriousness to those people, and I should like the Minister to try and find some method of dealing with this situation.  I think, having regard to the fact that the workers themselves come down and visit those resorts after their work is done, something will have to be done to meet the situation, unless they are to be charged a very much higher figure for their entertainment. I am simply bringing this matter to the Minister's notice to see if he can do anything to remedy it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by order under this sub-section amend or revoke any order made under this section (including this sub-section). <Col N="420" /> Apart from the alteration of the section by the exclusion of refreshment houses, it is, I think, necessary to have a further safety valve, and this amendment is designed to make it possible for the Minister to make an order amending the sub-section in respect of any type of employment where it may be urged that such an amendment is required.

There is something to be said for this amendment. I am not quite sure how much, and perhaps it might be more desirable to deal with the matter after inquiry than in the way suggested.  It is believed that the hours of work in a railway bookstall, that is a bookstall on or adjacent to a railway platform, must depend fairly largely on the hours of arrival and departure of trains.  Although in the case of some railways, the bookstalls remain open in the ordinary way of shops, in others they do not.  I think on the whole &mdash; I do not know what the view of other Deputies would be &mdash; it might be as well to insert the amendment.

      <P>As far as I can see, there is no provision dealing with a certain emergency in amendment No. 47.  Amendment No. 49 deals with the hours during which the person concerned actually works, but it does not deal with the putting up of the notice.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy is right.  In amendment No. 49 it is provided that, where a proprietor <Col N="423" /> of a shop is charged with an offence in connection with amendment No. 47, which will now be a section of the Bill, it shall be a good defence for him to prove that the alleged contravention was rendered necessary by reason of illness amongst the members of the staff or other unforeseen causes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that, where the proprietor is charged with an offence under this section there is a safeguard, but that that is a new section.  I am quite sure it is the Minister's intention to provide a safeguard, and I am only pointing out what I think is an oversight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Deputy's point that, if the proprietor is charged with failure to exhibit the notice, there is no safeguard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is the matter of substitution.  I am referring to sub-section 2, in connection with amendment No. 47, where it says that the proprietor of a shop may from time to time substitute a new hours of work notice for an existing hours of work notice, but shall not do so unless, not less than 48 hours before such new hours of work notice comes into operation, he has informed each of the members of the staff, and so on, of his intention to so substitute a new hours of work notice.  Let us suppose that there is this case of sudden illness, or some such cause, and the employer has got to get workman &ldquo;A&rdquo; to do the work which workman &ldquo;B&rdquo; would do ordinarily.  He cannot do that because he has workman &ldquo;A&rdquo; working during times which are different from the times of his notice, and he cannot change that without 48 hours' notice.  I suggest that, in the case of a sudden emergency, the employer should be allowed to change the notice immediately and the employee could work his new hours during that particular day and then return to the other conditions under which he is covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

Amendment No. 49 also says that where the proprietor of a shop is charged with an offence under this section, it shall be a good defence for him to urge that the doing so was rendered necessary by reason of illness among the members of the staff or other unforeseen cause; so that, in fact, in the case of illness or other unforeseen cause, it is possible for him, without being subject to penalty, to work assistants at hours without the notice specified.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any possibility of that misunderstanding arising.  However, I shall have the point examined.

      <P>(a)  by substituting, for the day which is a public holiday by virtue of paragraph (b) of the said sub-section (1), the 1st day of January, or the 6th day of January.</P>

      <P>(c) by substituting for Whit Monday, the Feast of Corpus Christi or the 29th day of June,</P>
      <P>(d)  by substituting for the first Monday in August, the 15th day of August,</P>

      <P>(4)  The Minister may by order under this sub-section amend or revoke any order made by him under this section (including this sub-section).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a question of the substitution of public holidays by Church holidays. I would be strongly opposed to making it optional on the employer to substitute Church holidays for public holidays.  It is a fact that in certain parts of the country the ordinary practice is to observe Church holidays and not public holidays; all shops and businesses close down on Church holidays and keep open on public holidays. <Col N="430" /> This amendment is taking power by order to alter the practice in such areas.  If we are to have an alternative day to the public holiday it will be an alternative day for everybody. It seems to me that if there is to be enforcement at all, and also in order to secure reasonable opportunity of having an enjoyable holiday, that we must have a uniform practice in every part of the country and not allow any individual discretion in the matter. In some parts of the country the Church holiday is probably the best business day of the year and it would be a considerable hardship upon employers if their shops were to be closed.  In the diocese of Ferns the very reverse to what happens elsewhere is the case.  Even if we were to compel the shops to close on public holidays in that area the people would still close on Church holidays and no business would be done on these days. This amendment gives us power to bring the law into conformity with the practice in an area like that.</P>

      <Col N="432" /> In page 14, at the end of Section 28, to add the following new sub-section: &mdash;</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purpose of this section the expression &ldquo;salary or wages&rdquo; shall include in the case of a member of the staff of a shop to whom annual leave is allowed who, immediately before the commencement of such annual leave was entitled to receive as part of his remuneration either board or lodgings or both board and lodgings such allowance in respect thereof as is determined by the Shop Wages Board in respect to the district in which the shop is situated to be the cash value of such board or lodgings or board and lodgings as the case may be.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that board and lodgings shall be taken into consideration when paying for holidays.  The Minister is aware that in trade agreements this has been done.  It is necessary that board and lodgings should be taken into account in calculating salary or wages.</P>

      <P>The proposal in the amendment seems equitable but I do not see how we are going to enforce it.  I do not think it would be possible for the Shop Wages Board to deal with that question, district by district, having regard to the circumstances prevailing in different districts.  If we could take a purely arbitrary figure and say that that shall be regarded as an allowance in respect of board and lodging, it would be the nearest we could get to it.</P>

      <P>This appears to be an equitable amendment and I will support it.  I quite see that in every case the value of the support of a man could hardly come before the Shop Wages Board.  There is a difficulty in that, but it seems to me that in most cases you would probably get an agreed figure between the employer and employee.  I think if the principle were embodied in the Bill it could be worked out.  What I suggest now is rather tentative, but what occurs to me is that we might indicate such a figure as the employer and employee would agree upon as the value of his support and, in default of agreement, I would suggest, not the Shop Wages Board, but the ordinary district court.</P>

      <P>There are difficulties in determining what constitutes board and lodging and in making provision for a person who has board or part board, or board and lodging or part board and lodging.  I think the best way to deal with it would be upon some percentage basis of the cash earnings, so that there will be no room for disagreement. The possibility of a large number of cases going to the district court or to the Shop Wages Board does not appeal to me.  I would prefer to have an arbitrary arrangement so that where he has board and lodging he will get his cash earnings plus a percentage.</P>

      <P>In page 15, before Section 29 (3), to insert the following four new sub-sections: &mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Where the period of annual leave allowed to a member of the staff of a non-special-trade shop falls wholly within one week neither sub-section (1) nor sub-section (2) of this section shall apply in respect of that week.</P>
      <P>(4)  Where the period of annual leave allowed to a member of the staff of a Sunday-trading shop falls wholly within two weeks, neither sub-section (1) nor sub-section (2) of this section shall apply in respect of those weeks.</P>
      <P>(5)  Where the period of annual leave allowed to a member of the staff of a non-special-trade shop falls within two weeks, sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section shall apply only in respect of such one of those weeks as the proprietor of such shop may select, and the day specified in a notice under the said sub-section (2) in the week so selected shall not be a day which falls within such period of annual leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  Where the period of annual leave allowed to a member of the <Col N="436" /> staff of a Sunday-trading shop falls within three weeks, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say: &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) neither sub-section (1) nor sub-section (2) of this section shall apply in respect of the second of those weeks,</P>
    <P>(b) sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section shall apply only in respect of such one of the first or third of those weeks as the proprietor of such shop may select and the day specified in a notice under the said sub-section (2) in the week so selected shall not be a day falling within such period of annual leave.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for a half-holiday each week to the staffs of a non-special-trade shop or a Sunday-trading shop. This amendment seeks to ensure that a worker will not be entitled to an extra half-day in respect of any week during which he had leave and, if such leave covers part of two consecutive weeks, the employer may not appoint one half-holiday in such a way that it falls on a day during which the assistant is on leave.  A similar provision is made in cases where the workers are entitled to 14 days' consecutive leave and the leave might be spread over three weeks.  It is a fairly cumbersome amendment, but that is the effect of it.</P>

Deputies will recollect the case made on behalf of the chemists.  I have been considering the representations made by them, and I think it is not unreasonable to provide that where a member of the staff works for not more than two hours on Sunday the obligation to provide a holiday or half-holiday in lieu should not apply.  That is the effect of the amendment. Where the assistant works not more than two hours, no consequences arise.  Where he works more than two hours and not more than four hours he becomes entitled to a half-day in lieu of the Sunday work.  If he works more than four hours he becomes entitled to a whole day.  That meets the representations made on behalf of the chemists, and I think it is not an unreasonable provision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Shop assistants generally are entitled to a half-day a week, and in certain cases they will be entitled to another half-day as compensation for Sunday <Col N="438" /> work.

      <P>In page 16, line 50, Section 33 (1), to delete the word &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide a minimum of 12 days' holidays instead of six, as the Bill provides. It has been a well-established practice in shops in the cities and in the larger towns, at any rate, as long as I remember, to allow shop assistants a fortnight's holidays or 12 working days' holidays in the year, apart from bank holidays.  I think that the Minister will recognise that that is the practice at present in Dublin City and most of the larger towns.  I happen to know that, even in the smaller centres, there are existing agreements in a great many cases between shop assistants' organisations and local shopkeepers or shopkeepers' organisations providing, amongst other things, for a continuous holiday of 12 days during the summer leave period.  As the purpose of this Bill is to protect the unorganised shop workers, I think that what is a well-established practice should be accepted as the standard for minimum conditions in this Bill.  I, therefore, appeal to the Minister to accept 12 days instead of six days as the leave period.</P>

      <P>I intimated on Committee Stage that this was one of the provisions of the Bill upon which the Government had made up its mind and by which it must stand.  We are only providing for a statutory minimum.  In so far as trade unions have secured agreements providing for longer holidays, these agreements will stand. There is nothing in this Bill to invalidate or upset these agreements in any way.  We merely fixed the statutory period as one week.  When we shall have that one week generally recognised and accepted as a normal feature of employment, then we can consider moving forward.  At that time, I think we should try to move forward in a uniform way in respect of all employments. So long as there is a minimum statutory period provided in the case of industrial employment, the same minimum should apply here and in all employments and the possibility of increasing that period can be considered later.  For many employers, this is a not inconsiderable expense and a new expense.  They have not become accustomed to it and it will be some time before people will come to regard this annual holiday arrangement as a normal and natural provision.  When that occurs, we can consider lengthening the period but, at the moment, we have done as much as we should do in fixing a statutory period of one week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment provided for a 12-day period for all employees, I might not be in entire agreement with it, but when we are dealing with shop assistants specifically, we are dealing with people who are a race apart.  They generally live away from home, either in &ldquo;digs&rdquo; or on their employers' premises.  They have to work on Saturday night until the shop closes.  Their six-day holiday would, therefore, start on Sunday morning or late on Saturday night.  As travelling facilities are not as good on Sundays as on week-days, the assistant has to stay in his place of employment or in the town on Sunday, with the result that his holidays are reduced to four or five days out of the six.  In order to resume work on the following Monday morning, he has to travel on Saturday, owing to lack of facilities on <Col N="440" /> Sunday, so that he has really only Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday as a holiday.</P>
      <P>When I moved this amendment on Committee Stage, I intimated that it was only giving legislative sanction to what was already the general practice. I think the Minister was inclined to disagree with that and say that he had not heard of it.  Since then, I have made a great many inquiries and I have ascertained that this practice is nearly universal in the country and, particularly, in the larger towns.  Numerous agreements have been made providing for 12 days' holidays.  The City of Dublin is chock full of these agreements and, even in Mullingar and elsewhere throughout Southern Ireland, it is the practice.  In view of the fact that the shop assistant generally lives away from home, there is a strong case to be made for special treatment in his case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, before Section 33 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where in any employment year the proprietor of a special-trade shop has allowed or purposes to allow any member of the staff of such shop a whole holiday on one or more of the public holidays enumerated in Section 27 of this Act such proprietor may deduct a corresponding number of whole holidays from the 14 consecutive whole holidays specified in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1)  of this section and such proprietor shall be deemed to have complied with the provisions of this section in such employment year when he allows such member of the staff of such shop the reduced number of consecutive whole holidays.</P>
      <P>While there are plenty of special-trade shops which keep busy on bank holidays, there is a smaller class of special-trade shops which cater for the business community to which that does not apply.  The Minister is probably aware that a certain number of shops in Dublin serve meals for a number of the business community.  When a bank holiday comes along, these shops shut up.  If they kept open, none of their customers would put in an appearance. I am sure that there are similar places in other centres.  My amendment proposes that on days on which these shops would do no business, they can close up, allow their assistants a holiday, same as the business community, and deduct these holidays so given from the 14 days leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit the force of the Deputy's argument but, having examined the matter, I am satisfied that the amendment would introduce <Col N="442" /> such a complication of the Bill as not to be worth while.  It is probably true of all shops that there are days in the year when they could shut up because there is no business to be done.  If we were to allow these shopkeepers to spread the annual leave of their assistants over these individual days, we would destroy the whole principle of annual leave.  These shops are permitted to keep open on public holidays and to employ their assistants. Because there is no business to be done, they do not avail of that permission. I suppose there is hardly a shop in the country which would not find itself precisely in that position on some one day in the year.  This proposal is all very well from the point of view of the proprietors but, from the point of view of the assistants, it is obviously undesirable that the proprietor should have the right to give the assistant his annual leave not in a consecutive number of days but in individual days throughout the year. I do not think I could agree to the amendment, even though, when argued from the Deputy's point of view, there appears to be something to be said for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was arguing in respect of ordinary days, and with that I should entirely agree.  There are certain days when the proprietor would find himself doing no business, and it would be obviously unfair that he should be allowed to say: &ldquo;We will shut up to-day and take one day off your leave.&rdquo;  Why should the Minister arbitrarily put these people into a class to which they do not belong?  That is the point I am making.  They take their business from the business community and they serve the business community.  On a public holiday the majority of the refreshment houses are serving holiday-makers and that is what makes them busy and that is why you want them to keep open.  It would be obviously <Col N="443" /> absurd to insist on a refreshment house keeping open on a public holiday when it can do no business.  I can understand the Minister's point of view.  He does not want a special-trade shop to be allowed to dodge from one class to the other, but I think that with certain safeguards which the Minister could very easily draw up they might be allowed to do that.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will realise that in the working of Acts such as this there should be a certain amount of flexibility.  I do not want that flexibility to be used for the purpose of evasion, but I submit that it is merely bringing the Act into ridicule to ask a person to keep open on a day on which he can do no business at all. It is not a question of his getting up in the morning and discovering that he cannot do business on that particular day, which was what I rather thought the Minister was suggesting. I should like the Minister to look into this matter and to see whether, with proper safeguards, this question could not be further dealt with.  The Minister will appreciate my point when I say that there are special-trade shops which come into a different category. Although they are special-trade shops, they come into the category of ordinary business houses.  They open and close with them.  That is the point I wanted to make.</P>

      <P>In admitting the force of that argument, I have, nevertheless, to plead the extraordinary complication which it would introduce into the Bill if we were to attempt to distinguish between shops, not merely by reference to the nature of the trade they do, but to the character of their clients.  That, I think, is what Deputy Dockrell is suggesting.  We take these restaurants and refreshment houses, and put them in a special category, and recognising what the ordinary circumstances under which they carry on their business are, we give them certain special provisions different from those applying to ordinary shops. The Deputy wants us to go further. He asks us to divide these restaurants and refreshment houses into two <Col N="444" /> classes according to the general character of their clients.  I do not think we could do that without introducing very great complications into the Bill and creating the risk of weakening its enforcement and permitting the evasion to which the Deputy has referred.  The inspector, or whoever might be charged with its enforcement, cannot easily distinguish between one type of refreshment house and another.  The net result of the position in which these shops find themselves because of the provisions of the Bill is that they are obliged to give 14 days' consecutive leave instead of seven.  I think we have to leave it at that as the easiest way of adapting the Bill to the circumstances of the trade.</P>

      <P>We seem to be at cross purposes.  The amendment says: &mdash;</P>
      <P>Where in any employment year the proprietor of a special-trade shop has allowed or purposes to allow any member of the staff of such shop a whole holiday on one or more of the public holidays enumerated in Section 27 of this Act such proprietor may deduct a corresponding number of whole holidays from the 14 consecutive whole holidays....</P>
      <P>I am not asking that their assistants should be allowed less than 14 days, because I quite agree with the Minister that they are refreshment houses, and that is the law for them. What I am suggesting is that the Minister, with all due respect to him, is doing something really absurd in asking people to keep open on a day when they do no business, or to shut up and pay their assistants on a day on which they earn no money.  I do not want to put them in any better or worse position than other refreshment houses.  I merely want a certain amount of flexibility and I suggest that, with proper safeguards, it could be worked.  I do not know whether a notice in the shop or the special advising of somebody would satisfy the Minister.  I am not seeking to assist evasion, but the Minister will see that there is undoubted hardship in relation to this limited class which does a special trade and which is tied up with the business community.</P>

      <P>I am sure it is the experience of every shop proprietor that there are days when he has to open his shop and pay his assistants while he does no business.  I do not think it is possible to deal with these cases in the manner the Deputy suggests. I think it would be impossible to keep cheek on them.  We can distinguish between shops according to the class of business they do&mdash;a restaurant from a drapery shop and a drapery shop from a railway bookstall &mdash;but to distinguish between shops and to make different provisions because of the general character of their clients would be an impossible task, and that is what the Deputy is suggesting. The net result of the position is that the proprietors of these shops are entitled to keep their shops open on bank holidays.  If they do not do so because they are not likely to do any business, that is their concern, but it does not exempt them from the obligation of giving annual leave to an employee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> (a)  the board shall hold an investigation into the subject matter of such agreement, but shall before commencing such investigation publish in some newspaper circulating in such area, a notice specifying their intention to hold such investigation and inviting interested parties to submit evidence, and shall consider any evidence so submitted;</P>
    <P>(b)  on the conclusion of such investigation, the board shall do one of the following things, that is to say: &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  make, subject to the provisions of this Act, rules fixing minimum rates of wages (which shall be the same as the rates of wages specified in such agreement) for such class, as the board thinks proper and specifies in such rules, of members of staffs of shops of such class, as the board thinks proper and specifies in such rules, situate in such area as the board thinks proper and specifies or delimits in or by such rules, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  report to the Minister that in their opinion it is not expedient to make such rules.</P>
    <P>The question of existing wages agreements was raised for discussion on the Committee Stage and I intimated my intention of making some provision in relation to them in this part of the Bill.  We are setting up a shop wages board for the purpose of fixing minimum wages, subject to confirmation by the Minister.  This amendment provides that where an agreement, whether made before or after the passing of the Act, has been made between representative bodies, and such agreement is sent to the Minister by one or other of the parties, the Minister may refer that agreement to the board, and the board may make rules fixing the minimum rates of wages for the classes of shops in the area specified by the board, or may report to the Minister that in their opinion it is not expedient to make such rules.  The amendment is put in that way, as <Col N="448" /> generally speaking it may be inadvisable to apply it to all shops in an area selling a certain class of goods the terms of such agreement.  Furthermore, as Deputies are aware, the Agreement Wages Register adopted under the Conditions of Employment Act of 1936 has not proved operative. It is not easy to discover why it has not operated, the only explanation being that there are reasons which are not apparent on the surface while, on the other hand, minor changes in the agreement cannot be made to make registration possible. As some Deputies are aware, some agreements were presented for registration but could not be accepted because of minor defects, such as the defect of having no definite provision for its duration.  The Act provided that agreements must be expressed to operate for not less than one year. Some of the agreements sent for registration could not be registered merely because they had not that provision, and yet no change was made in the terms of the agreement to make registration possible.  Some agreements had to be rejected as they covered matters other than rates of wages.  I am having that section of the Conditions of Employment Act considered in consultation with parties likely to be interested in the amendment.  If possible I prefer to work along that line, that is, to secure uniformity of wages in various occupations by means of registered agreements, rather than by rules made by the board but enforceable by law.  Because of the fact that we had run into such difficulties along that line, I thought it desirable to experiment along another line.  I think the special circumstances that prevail in the retail trade necessitate another line.  What we propose here is that the agreement may be presented. Effect will not be given to the wages rates prescribed in the agreement by any firm on registration but, instead, the Wages Board will examine the agreement and make rules prescribing the wages, but this determines what shall be the limit of their operations.  In other words, we get over all the difficulties that occurred on the question of the registration of <Col N="449" /> an agreement by giving the board power to say how long it shall operate, to what class of shops it will apply, and over what area.  This way will be found more effective, even if from another point of view, it is less attractive than the other one.</P>

We take the agreement but we do not try to register it, as it may have <Col N="450" /> been drawn up in vague words which may relate to a lot of other things besides wages, and it may contain other features which make registration difficult.  We take the agreement and extract from it the rates of wages, embodying these in an order to the board, authorising the board to define the area, the type of shop or other circumstance which will determine the operation of the rates.  That will get over the essential difficulty of wages agreement rates, which is this, that agreements are not phrased in legal language at all but are phrased in language for the purpose of making them understood, which, of course, is totally unsuitable for a document made a legal document, in effect, by the process of registration.  This system will prove better, although I would prefer the other if it could be made to work.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave one account of registration.  I was wondering if foolish workers or foolish employers prevented registration from coming about.  I think the Minister would want to go a little further in this matter.  He told us about things that should not be in the agreements. I am afraid he will have to get on or get off with regard to agreements that he wants to have registered.  I suggested when discussing the Conditions of Employment Act that he should draw up a skeleton agreement.  Enterprising bodies think they could send in an agreement and ask the Minister to use the blue pencil on it, so as to make it perfect.  The Minister surely will see that if there is to be a registered agreement he must start himself by providing some sort of a skeleton on which to work.  I suggest to him that in this Bill he should have a skeleton schedule which could be filled in when agreements are come to.  That would do away with the difficulty facing bodies of employers and employees who want to draw up an agreement for registration and find that it is impossible to do so.  That, I suggest, is absurd.  After all, if an agreement is going to be enforced the provisions that ought to prevail are those agreed to between employers and workers.  Under this scheme are we going to have a board which will say to the workers, &ldquo;Well, <Col N="451" /> you should not have put down so and so,&rdquo; and to the employers, &ldquo;you should have put down so and so.&rdquo;  If the Minister provided the skeleton schedule that I have spoken of &mdash; one that would simply need to be filled in &mdash; it would, I suggest, go a long way towards making agreement possible, because there is no doubt that there were bodies of employers and workers who were ready to draw up agreements for registration and found that it was not possible to do so.</P>

I think it will be accepted as reasonable that where there are special circumstances which make it impossible to provide suitable or sufficient conveniences, and where such suitable and sufficient accommodation is otherwise conveniently available, that there should be this power of exemption.  We come to the point, then, which is the most suitable body to determine whether that exemption should be given.  I cannot for the life of me see any more suitable body than the sanitary authority of the district concerned.  That, in my opinion, is the appropriate authority to exercise the very limited discretion permitted in sub-sections (6) and (7).  As Deputies know, Part VI of this Bill is only in here for reasons of convenience. Ordinarily, these provisions would appear in a Public Health Bill promoted by the Department of Local Government and Public Health because they deal with public health matters. If that part of the Bill appeared under the auspices of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I do not think that anyone would question the selection of the sanitary authority as the most suitable authority to exercise the power of discretion conferred in these two sub-sections.  I certainly could not suggest any more suitable authority than the local sanitary authority for that purpose.  The discretion should be there where there are special circumstances and where adequate and suitable accommodation is otherwise available, and if it should be there, it can be carried out by the <Col N="454" /> sanitary authority and not by anybody else.</P>

      <P>In page 27, before Section 51. to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be competent for a trade union representative of persons to whom this Act applies in the event of the failure of a sanitary authority <Col N="458" /> to enforce the provisions of this Part of this Act to require such sanitary authority to secure compliance with the provisions aforesaid and for that purpose may, in default of such compliance, apply to a judge of the Circuit Court for the district in which such sanitary authority has its chief office and the court may, upon the hearing of such application, make such order as appears to the court to be just and equitable.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to give the trade union representative of the employees power to take action in the Circuit Court in a case of failure of the sanitary authority to make an order.  Deputy McGowan has given instances where there may be reason for members of the local sanitary authority to fail in their duty in this matter and we think the trade union ought to have the right to take action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an entirely different case from the other section in respect to which we discussed giving certain powers to a trade union.  I think it would be very undesirable to give a trade union the right to prosecute a sanitary authority.  I think the obvious course for a trade union to take in a case of that kind would be to report the matter to the Minister for Local Government or approach the Minister through the parliamentary representatives. It is the Minister for Local Government who should proceed against the sanitary authority if it is clear that it is not carrying out its duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This turns on a recent decision given against the Distributive Workers' Union, which was discussed yesterday at length, which was that to succeed in an action for mandamus the person must be a good relator and have an interest.  In other words, a shop assistant would be able to maintain an action for a mandamus against one of these local bodies, but the position would be rather peculiar.  What employee is going to institute proceedings against his employer when he knows that in a very short time, for some reason or other, his services will be dispensed with?  Is it not much better to give the power to his trade union and <Col N="459" /> let them institute the proceedings and perhaps succeed?  I consider that it would prevent vexatious litigation.  In the case of, say, a malcontent employee, who has some grievance against his employer who may perhaps contemplate discharging him, what will happen?  He may start an action for a mandamus and maintain it, whereas if the trade union were given power to do it and he went to his trade union, they, being sensible men, will not move if they see that they are going to be mulcted in costs, which in fact did occur in this particular case.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;apply to a judge of the Circuit Court... and the court may, upon the hearing of such application, make such order as appears to the court to be just and equitable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it that that order must be within its existing jurisdiction.  You cannot give jurisdiction in this way to a Circuit Court which it has not got. Therefore it would have no power to give a mandamus against the sanitary authority.  Besides, this amendment does not even say that the order is to be made against the sanitary authority. It is so vague that the court may make an order against the individual without hearing him, because there is nothing about the individual being served.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion on which we discussed the powers of trade unions it was in relation to prosecutions for offences of an individual employer.  Here we are talking about a sanitary authority, and I suggest that the way to deal with a sanitary authority that is neglecting its duty is through the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  A trade union is not debarred from moving in the most effective way to compel such a sanitary authority to carry out its duty, namely, directly through the Department of Local Government or through their Parliamentary representatives. That is the way to do it, and that is why I would be disposed to oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 27, before Section 51, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If any person being either the owner or the occupier of a shop, who has incurred or is about to incur any expenses for the purpose of securing that the requirements of this Part of this Act are complied with in respect to such shop, alleges that the whole, or any part of the expense ought to be borne by any other person having an interest in the premises, he may apply to the district court for the district in which the shop is situated, and that court may, upon the hearing of such application, make such order concerning the expenses or their apportionment as appears to the court, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the terms of any contract between the parties, to be just and equitable, and any order made under this section may direct that any such contract as aforesaid shall cease to have effect in so far as it is inconsistent with the terms of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Believe it or not, this is an amendment which I think would be of considerable help to a shopkeeper.  Under this part of the Bill, a sanitary authority can compel a shopkeeper to carry out certain improvements and if he does not do so, certain penalties are provided.  These improvements will involve the shopkeeper in certain expense.  In some cases it may involve him in considerable expense.  The idea underlying the amendment is that where that particular shopkeeper happens to be a tenant, paying rent to a landlord, he shall have the right to apply to the local district court, in default of agreement, to have the expenses which he has incurred apportioned between himself and the landlord. I think it is a very reasonable provision.  There is a provision absolutely similar to it in the 1934 Act passed by the British House of Commons.  I think it is only reasonable that a shopkeeper tenant should be compensated in some small way by his landlord for such expense.  I think it is a very reasonable amendment.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise what the position is?  In a country town the assistants generally live at the other end of the town or of the village.  Ordinarily, in the country, as in the United States, the people do not take afternoon tea.  The meal in the evening is supper, and they frequently take no other meal before they retire. If you send them home for half an hour, you are going to extend their work by half an hour longer than would be otherwise necessary, and they will not take their tea at that time, because it is not suitable.  After their work they ordinarily go home, change their working clothes, and then sit down to what they call tea, but which <Col N="465" /> nobody in Dublin would call tea.  In Dublin it would be called supper.  They take that at their leisure, then dress, and go out for the evening to pictures or to some other entertainment.  This, instead of being a benefit to the country employee, is going to be an intolerable nuisance.  You will have them breaking off work for half an hour and lounging round the town, and then they will have to remain in an hour longer than they otherwise would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to that, I should like to ask the Minister a few questions, and I want to direct the Labour Party's attention to this.  What would be left undone if, instead of passing this immense and complicated measure, we passed a simple measure providing that all shops must close after having had their doors open for eight hours, and secondly that every shop must pay their assistants the minimum wage as fixed, or a greater wage?  Is there anything in this elaborate and extremely difficult Bill to understand which would be left undone if you had a simple Bill providing those two things?  I ask the Labour Party to digest that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the Minister that, having in my opinion reasonably and effectively resisted an amendment from the Labour Party designed to prohibit the employment of persons under 15 in shops, on the ground that he would not enact such a provision until the school-leaving age was raised to 15, his general prohibition of overtime for persons under 16 years of age will operate exactly in the same way, making it impossible for any youth between the ages of 14 and 16 to get employment in a shop.  I assert most positively that it will do so, because I know the first question always asked is: &ldquo;Will you be 16 years before Christmas?&rdquo; If not, the boy would only be a nuisance.  He would be creating heart burnings and worry for the remainder of the employees, because when a rush time came it would be a case of: &ldquo;Now, John, you go home, but <Col N="467" /> everybody else must stay.&rdquo; You do not want a boy like that.  This would operate to prevent employment as an apprentice of any youth who will not have attained the age of 16 years on 1st December following his employment. I think that is a great mistake. I think you are doing a very foolish thing.  With the general provisions of the Bill, there is no danger of a general abuse arising in the way of slave driving of juveniles in the retail distribution trade.  This distinction in respect of juveniles under 16 is simply going to upset the apprenticeship system in a way in which you do not want it upset. It is much better to abolish the whole system altogether, or else accept it with its admitted dangers, and not try half measures of this kind which will create nothing but confusion. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.  If he would only ask some people who know the trade he would discover that this prohibition of juvenile overtime will operate exactly the same as if he had prohibited altogether the admission to employment of juveniles under 16.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is wrong, and I will give him two reasons. Precisely the same argument was advanced when the previous Conditions of Employment Bill was before the House, and that Bill prescribed a 40-hour week for juveniles under 18.  That was the ordinary working week prescribed, and it has not operated to reduce the number of such persons employed in industry.  The second argument is that this provision prohibiting overtime for persons under 16 has been the law in Great Britain for some time and has not had that effect</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £5,257 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an tSoláthair; chun Páipéarachais, Cló-dóireachta, Páipéir, Creamuíochta agus Leabhra Clóbhuailte i gcóir na Seirbhíse Puiblí; agus chun Ilsheirbhísí Ilghnéitheacha maraon le Tuairiscí Díospóireachtaí an Oireachtais.</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £5,257 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1938, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Stationery Office; for Stationery, Printing, Paper, Binding and Printed Books for the Public Service; and for sundry Miscellaneous Services, including Reports of Oireachtas Debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purposes for which this Supplementary Estimate is required are set out very fully in Part III of the Estimate. There is a number of accidental and casual variations there, due largely to the additional work which was imposed on the Stationery Office last year, first of all by reason of the general election, by reason of the debates on the Constitution, and other matters. There is one new sub-head to which I might refer, and that is sub-head F (8), which provides for the preparation and publication of the Oireachtas Handbook. It is proposed to issue at the expense of the Government a sort of compendium on the lines of the Free State Parliamentary Companion, because <Col N="469" /> it is felt that it is desirable that such a publication should be at the disposal of members of the Oireachtas, and incidentally of those persons who have business with Government Departments, and of the general public who may be interested in matters of Parliamentary Government.  We have come to the conclusion that it is not possible, in view of the circumstances here, for such a handbook to be undertaken as a private enterprise, and we are accordingly undertaking that obligation ourselves.  We propose, in fact, to purchase whatever rights there may be in the existing Free State Parliamentary Companion, and to continue it as an official publication.</P>

I should like to know whether or not it is open to any person to go in and get distributor's terms from the Government Publications Office in the same way. Suppose, for instance, I were to go in and purchase 20,000 copies for distribution, will I get the same terms as, say, Eason's?</P>

      <P>In accordance with Sections 4 (4) and 5 (2) of the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1938, which became law on the 20th January, 1938, orders were made by the Minister on the 24th January, 1938, appointing the 26th January, 1938, as (a) the date on and from which the increased rates of unemployment assistance provided by the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1938, came into force; and (b) the date on and from which the additional contribution at the rate of £50,000 per annum from the Unemployment Fund became payable.  Without any addition the sum of £1,121,000 provided for unemployment assistance for the 1937-38 financial year would, it is estimated, be adequate to meet the cost of the payment of unemployment assistance at the increased rates that came <Col N="480" /> into force on the 26th January, 1938, for the reason that actual expenditure on unemployment assistance during the portion of the financial year that has expired, has been less than was estimated. It is, however, necessary to have a Supplementary Estimate for the nominal amount of £10 for the purpose of extending the ambit of the existing Vote so as to authorise therefrom payments of unemployment assistance at the increased rates provided by the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1938.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Section 5 of the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1938, an additional amount at the rate of £50,000 per annum is payable from the Unemployment Fund for the portion of the current financial year from the 26th January, 1938 &mdash; the date appointed by Order of the Minister under Section 5 of the 1938 Act &mdash; to the end of the financial year.  The actual amount that will be payable is £8,904 and this will be brought to account under sub-head L &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid. By reason of this appropriation it is necessary to show a sum of £8,914 as an additional sum required for unemployment assistance (sub-head J), as a set-off against the amount that becomes payable from the Unemployment Fund in order that the nominal Supplementary Estimate may be fixed at £10.</P>

The <Col N="483" /> excess in sub-head H (3) arises from the fact that during the year, after the Estimates had been prepared, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was elected as President of the International Labour Conference which opened at Geneva on 3rd June, 1937. His personal attendance there and the fact that he held that honourable position involved the delegation in additional expense to the amount of £505. The Minister is here now to deal with the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just been listening to the statement of the Minister for Finance about the honours conferred on the Minister for Industry and Commerce by his appointment as Chairman of the International Labour Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has dealt with the circumstances relating to one sub-head, in connection with the expenses of the Irish delegation to the International Labour Conference at Geneva.  The second sub-head makes additional provision for minerals exploration.  The Department has undertaken the exploration of the gypsum deposits in the Kingscourt-Carrickmacross area, County Cavan.  Gypsum, as Deputies are aware, is a substance which has become of considerable importance as an industrial raw material.  It is known there are substantial deposits of gypsum in that area, and we are undertaking this exploration for the purpose of investigating their extent and the consistency of the quality of the deposit throughout its entire extent. The exploration is necessary as a preliminary to any proposal for the development of the deposit or the establishment of any of the industries which use gypsum as a raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third sub-head deals with the provision of an Irish pavilion at the Glasgow Exhibition this year.  It was decided that Ireland should participate officially in the exhibition, following an official invitation to take part which was received some time ago.  A suitable site on the ground of the exhibition has been placed at the disposal of the Government, free of charge, and <Col N="484" /> on that site a pavilion is being erected. It is intended that the pavilion shall contain a suitable array of exhibits relating to various aspects of our national life.  The building has been designed by a firm of Dublin architects, and the construction of it is now under way.</P>
    <P>The total cost of construction, together with incidental charges, such as architects' fees, quantity surveyors' fees and legal expenses, is estimated at £4,400.  We have to have the building complete before the end of March, so as to enable the interior decoration and the arrangement of the exhibits to be completed before the opening, which is fixed for 3rd May. It is intended that the exhibits in the pavilion will relate, not merely to our industrial and agricultural production, but will also cover the social, cultural, and other aspects of our national life in such a way as to give the visitor to the pavilion a general impression of the progress of this country in these various spheres.  It is not possible at the moment to give a precise estimate of the total cost of participation in the Exhibition, but it is not expected to exceed £20,000. The present Vote covers the proportion of the total expenditure which, it is estimated, will become payable in the present financial year. That includes the £4,400 I mentioned on account of the cost of constructing the pavilion and incidental charges, and £1,600 on account of the cost of preparing and dispatching exhibits, as well as a provision of £500 for publicity expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These three sub-heads are all extremely interesting in their own way.  With regard to sub-head H (3), it was a source of satisfaction to many of us that the Minister should preside over the International Labour Organisation deliberations in Geneva, as it was a source of satisfaction to us that the President of the Executive Council, as he then was, should preside over the plenary session of the League of Nations on an earlier occasion.  As I read of their respective activities, I could not help asking if either of these <Col N="485" /> gentlemen, as he marched to his seat as a representative of an independent and sovereign State, put himself the question whether he was there by virtue of institutions the establishment of which he denounced as a supreme act of treachery to the historic Irish nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask in what capacity the Minister for Industry and Commerce went there if it was not as a representative of a sovereign State.  I invite him to dwell, reflect and cogitate upon that and, when he has done so, to give his less responsible colleagues behind, who have swallowed his pabulum, a taste of, and a short exercise in, digesting and learning the common sense he has learned about many of the things he has come to understand in the last five or six years.  Then, if he would summon up a bit of courage, he might slip into the Prime Minister's room and tell him that it was time for him to turn these things over in his mind as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the gypsum deposits, suppose valuable deposits of gypsum are found in this area, I think it is true to say they will vest in the Land Commission or in the State.  Is it then propose to give concessions to individuals to exploit these deposits, or how does the State intend to permit the exploitation of these deposits? Surely, if you want to exploit deposits <Col N="486" /> which are vested in the nation, you are expected to put up sufficient money to do the prospecting yourself.  Then, if you find, as a result of your exploration, valuable deposits, it is reasonable that you should go on to ask for a concession to exploit what has been discovered through your enterprise.  If the Government is going to do all the speculative part of the business, then I think we ought seriously to consider whether it would be proper to allow any private company to capitalise a speculation undertaken under public auspices.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell us what the intention of the Government is with regard to the exploitation of these deposits, if such deposits are found.</P>
    <P>Now we are going to the Glasgow Exhibition and I am sure Deputy Tom Kelly will be there.</P>

      <P>I make the submission that it is strictly relevant.  Only members of the Commonwealth of Nations are entitled to erect pavilions at that exhibition.  This exhibition is strictly confined to members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  I see on the other side Deputy Munnelly, who has torn passion to latters through the Province <Col N="487" /> of Connaught regarding his inflexible resolution to burst the bonds of the British Empire asunder.  What is Deputy Munnelly going to do now?  Is he going over to Glasgow to take a whirl there?  I see a dashing Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party from West Donegal on the opposite benches who has often undertaken to destroy the base, bloody and brutal British Empire.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to say by whom the actual commercial exploitation of these deposits will be undertaken, if commercial exploitation is proved to be possible.  We have undertaken these mineral exploration activities in advance of the possibility of commercial exploitation. That was a change of policy.  It was <Col N="490" /> the policy of my predecessor to undertake mineral exploitation work only when he had in the background some private concern that was willing to engage in commercial activity if exploration work proved successful. I decided that, in our circumstances, a change of that policy was necessary and that we should ascertain the value, extent and quality of our mineral deposits first, and then, on the basis of our knowledge, seek to secure commercial development. That is what we are doing in this case.  These deposits are being exploited to some extent at present.  A company called Gypsum and Bricks, Ltd., is working there producing certain building materials from the gypsum, but the area of the deposits is fairly extensive and, of course, the commercial uses to which gypsum can be put are very considerable.  I have given the matter some thought and if it is decided to utilise gypsum in some commercial enterprise, it might be necessary for the State to engage, directly or through some of these semi-State companies, in that activity in so far as we might not succeed in getting anyone, else to do it.  For every commercial purpose, it would be much better if the gypsum were developed and treated by ordinary commercial <i>entrepreneurs</i>, and that being so, it is impossible to give the Deputy a clear answer to his question.  In fact, some of these deposits are possibly in private ownership, while others are in State ownership, and I do not suppose it would be possible to get even now without very close research a clear statement as to where the ownership of the minerals rests. The same circumstances arose in Arigna when we were carrying out exploration work there, and they arose, and still exist, in Slieveardagh where we spent money on exploration work.  We feel it is in the national interest to do this exploration work and contribute that amount to the possible commercial development of the deposits, and the provision of employment in the area of the deposits, irrespective of whether we got any return for the expenditure in a direct form to the national Exchequer in the end or not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are wide deposits there.  Perhaps that does not explain the situation sufficiently.  We have been continuously exploring the possibility of establishing certain industries here, and we have discussed them with parties that might be prepared to finance an undertaking.  In relation to some of these possible industries, the questions arose: Is there a sufficiency of gypsum in the country and is that gypsum of the right quality?  In order to answer these questions, we have to undertake these works.  We will give the information to the parties concerned when we get it.  They will then have to go out and secure the right to mine the minerals.  They may have to secure it from the private owners or from the State.  If they secure it from the State, the ordinary procedure under the Mines and Minerals Act will be followed.</P>

      <P>Gypsum is used in the manufacture of various building materials, in the production of certain qualities of cement and in the manufacture of plate-glass, certain classes of pottery and for certain agricultural purposes.  It is also used in the manufacture of many kinds of paper, paints, certain chemical fertilisers and products like dental plaster and other more or less medical commodities of <Col N="492" /> the kind.  There is quite a wide field of commercial use for gypsum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks of its being used in the manufacture of crockery.  Suppose one company, by private enterprise, has done all its own prospecting and has discovered deposits out of its own money, is it fair for the Government to come along and do all the expensive exploration work for some rival company?</P>

I do not say that we are merely leaving the situation Like that, hoping that somebody will see the report and undertake the development of whatever deposits are there.
