      <P>That a sum not exceeding £11,116 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for Transport and Meteorological Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular Estimate, which was formerly only of routine importance, has acquired additional significance, mainly on account of the additional two sub-heads &mdash; sub-head B, relating to civil airports, and sub-head C, relating to meteorological services.  The Dáil is aware that the Government has engaged in the construction of two civil airports, one at Dublin and one on the Shannon.  The main provision for the construction of these airports is made, of course, on the Vote for the Department of Public Works, but the sum of £10,100 is provided for various purposes in connection with these airports on this Estimate.  I gave the Dáil on an earlier occasion an estimate of the cost of the airports, both the Shannon and the Dublin airport, which, of <Col N="544" /> course, was only an approximate estimate because nothing more detailed could be made available at the time.  It appears from the information now available that the total cost of the land aerodrome on the Shannon will be approximately £535,000.  The question of the provision of a flying boat base on the Shannon was reconsidered last year, and in the light of the information available it was decided to proceed with a scheme of partial development of a flying boat base at an estimated cost of £270,000.  The estimate of the total capital cost of the Shannon airport, therefore, is £805,000.  The Dublin airport is estimated to cost £360,000. The sub-head of this Estimate dealing with airports provides for the acquisition of land in connection with both the Shannon and Dublin airports.  Furthermore, the operation of experimental flights from Dublin and the Shannon, pending arrangements for the management of the airport either by the State or by Aer Lingus Teoranta, may require the provision of an aerodrome staff, and £1,000 is included in the Estimate to cover such expenditure. Although, as I have stated, the main cost of the airport is provided on the Vote for Public Works, there may be items of equipment arising in connection with experimental transatlantic flights which cannot be regarded as pertinent to the permanent airport, and a small sum is provided in this Vote to cover such expenditure if it should arise.</P>
    <P>The meteorological service, as Deputies are aware, is a new service.  Following a decision taken by the Government in 1936, an Order was made under the Ministers and Secretaries Act transferring to the Department of Industry and Commerce from the Minister for Education the functions in regard to meteorological services allocated to the Minister for Education under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  The meteorological organisation as it now exists consists of a small headquarters staff, a skeleton organisation at the Shannon operated on an agency basis by the Meteorological Office, London, pending the appointment of trained personnel to the aerial service; a network of five telegraphic <Col N="545" /> reporting stations, and about 190 climatological and rainfall stations.  Provision was made in the Estimate for last year for extension of the organisation as taken over from the British authorities. It was subsequently considered desirable to defer certain developments until the present year.  The present Estimate, therefore, includes provision for certain developments originally scheduled to be effected in last year, that is to say, the establishment of a Meteorological Office at the Dublin airport, the extension of the networks of telegraphic reporting and climatological stations, as well as further developments.  Circumstances during the last year did not permit of the recruitment and training of personnel for the aerial service as originally intended.  It is anticipated, therefore, that, provided a sufficient number of suitably qualified candidates is available, recruitment will proceed in the present year, and the necessary provision is made in this Estimate.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister anything to say about the airport that was intended to be built near Cork?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork airport was the project of the Cork Corporation. There was a question of Government financial assistance for the construction of such an airport, but as I understand it the matter is in abeyance with the Cork Corporation.  I am very anxious that there should be provided a suitable civil airport in the vicinity of Cork, and would be very glad if the Cork Corporation would revive interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Three different public bodies are concerned in the provision of this airport for Cork&mdash;the Cork Corporation, the Cork County Council and the Harbour Board.  I do not think the Minister or anybody else would question the desirability of having this air station, and you are fortunate in having one of the best sites, in the neighbourhood of Midleton, for the provision of this station.  It has been selected out of ten sites offered, including the seaplane base at Aghada and the former air station at Ballyquirke, Killeagh.  Owing to the large extent of level ground around this site <Col N="546" /> it is looked upon by the experts who have been appointed as being one of the best.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what is going to be the contribution from the State.  I understand it is 50 per cent. of the cost, and the other 50 per cent. would be made up of contributions from the corporation, the county council and the harbour board.  Of course the corporation will get the lion's share of the advantage, so they will probably make the lion's share of the contribution; but at the same time the other public bodies, which will not gain such a large amount of advantage, will not be backward in making their contribution.  We are fortunate in having the Lord Mayor of Cork present.  I hope that he will do everything in his power to get his body to make the desired contribution. There is no question about it, that if it is not done Cork and Cork County will have to retreat into the background.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I am stating what is true.  If you do not uphold modern systems of transport, there is no question about it, the great County of Cork and the great City of Cork &mdash; which is no mean city &mdash; will undoubtedly have to take a secondary place. If the Minister will state the amount of the grant they are prepared to make, I think it will pave the way towards the making of their contributions by the public bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters in connection with this Estimate on which I should like to have information. The Minister has described the activities which are going on with a view to the provision of a civil airport for Dublin.  We would be very much interested to hear somewhat fuller details of what he has in mind.  Dublin ought to be very easy to provide a civil airport for, because the city as yet is comparatively small, and the usual difficulty will not present itself of having to place the airport at a very great distance from the centre of the city. The question of so arranging it that it will be free in future from obstruction such as high power electric service <Col N="547" /> cables and obstructions of that character which ordinarily harass civil airports in other parts of the world is a matter upon which I should like to hear the Minister now.  Am I right in assuming that the civil airport is to be at Collinstown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and legislation was enacted which gave full power to limit building and other developments in the vicinity of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting at this stage if the Minister would outline what his intentions are, and how he proposes to use the powers conferred on him by that legislation.  I am not aware whether or not his plans have reached that stage, but I assume that as he is laying out considerable sums of money on this civil airport some comprehensive plan must have been completed before the work started.  The second question I want to ask is this: Is there any provision in this Estimate for any subsidy to Aer Lingus Teoranta?  Under what Vote does that come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister exercises general supervision over that service.  As a general rule, my experience is that that service, comparing it with Continental and American services, is reasonably efficient, but one would wish to see it progress rapidly.  I am aware that, in the initial stages of any such enterprise, it is very difficult to provide as perfect a service as the older established air lines are in a position to give.  At the present time, if you take an airplane from Baldonnel to London you will find that, when you get to Croydon, you are obliged to go to the nearest railway station and wait for 25 to 35 minutes for a local train to make your way to Victoria station, and then get as best you can from Victoria to wherever you are staying in London. At first glance that does not seem to be an unreasonable arrangement, but in fact it is an unreasonable arrangement, because when the airplane arrives at Croydon you may have a number of people coming off <Col N="548" /> seasick and with luggage.  It is a great nuisance to have to transport that luggage from Croydon to a small local railway station where there are no railway porters at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that the Minister has control over that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that he has some sort of a supervisory function in the matter.  I do not know whether one is entitled to advocate on the Estimate that some provision should be made by way of subsidy to enable the company to overcome that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on a small subsidiary Estimate such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Estimate, I think, under which any such subsidy would have to be made.  I have no doubt that the transport section of the Minister's Department has some sort of supervisory function in the matter. At any rate, if you arrive there with luggage it is not convenient to be deposited at a small local station where the facilities for transporting heavy baggage are very limited.  You then get into a local train, and when you arrive at Victoria you have to sort yourself out as best you can because, as I am sure the Minister is aware, no porters are available at the platforms at Victoria at which the local trains arrive.  The reason for that, I suppose, is that 99 per cent. of the passengers who come off these trains have no luggage.  I have arrived at Victoria, fortunately with no more baggage than I was able to carry myself, and found that there was no porter on the platform there.  It has occurred to me that if a passenger from abroad had availed of the service from this side, particularly a lady, and was taken on to Victoria station with two heavy bags, well, she would have to sit on the bags until somebody ran to get a porter for her.  I have arrived at Croydon at the same time as Imperial airplanes coming in from Paris and the Continent.  The passengers coming off the two services were carefully segregated, the sheep from the goats.  The sheep, who came <Col N="549" /> by Imperial Airways, were put into a comfortable conveyance and carried into London, while the lone goat was sent to the local railway station and taken on one of these local trains to Victoria simply because he had come by the Aer Lingus Teo. service.  That would create a very unfavourable impression on foreign visitors who might avail of the service between Dublin and London.</P>
      <P>It has occurred to me that, if the British company would co-operate with Aer Lingus Teo. in providing facilities at Croydon, the Government ought to consider urging on it to link up with Imperial Airways, because if we had an understanding with Imperial Airways it would be quite easy to provide that when anybody arrived at Croydon on an Aer Lingus plane he could avail of the transport provided by Imperial Airways from Croydon to London.  That would abolish all the difficulties that at present exist.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is important that people travelling to Croydon by the Aer Lingus service should not get the idea that, if they avail of it, they will be involved in all sorts of inconveniences. If they get that idea, they will not avail of it at all.  If, in the initial stages, they find that the service is good, and that they are not likely to be faced with difficulties such as I have mentioned, they will undoubtedly get into the habit of using that air service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the meteorological services that I want to refer to.  I have been informed that, when the Minister first undertook the matter of the development of meteorological services in this country, he employed, without public examination, two non-nationals as scientists for the meteorological station here.  Now, that may be true or it may not be true.  I desire to afford the Minister the opportunity of correcting that rumour, if it is untrue.  I want to make myself quite clear.  It would ill-become any Irishman to object to a non-national securing a position in this country if the allocation of those positions depended on public examination, and if a non-national proved to be more efficient than any Irish applicant for <Col N="550" /> the job &mdash; because we have Irishmen working in Great Britain and all over the world who have got jobs in those countries.  They are non-nationals in them.  They have been made welcome, given good positions, and allowed to get ahead.</P>
    <P>We should not preach the doctrine in Ireland that anybody not born in Ireland will ever be allowed to get a job in this country.  It would not suit us, and it would be an ungrateful and a churlish attitude for us to adopt. But I do submit that, if positions in the public service are to be given to non-nationals, they should only be given after public examination of the non-national has demonstrated that he is a better man than any candidate who has presented himself from the home country.  The allegation is that, without any public examination, the Minister gave two positions to non-nationals without affording Irish scientists, who got their qualifications in this country, the opportunity of demonstrating their capacity to fill the jobs.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister that in future, before making appointments of the kind, a public examination should be held, and if a non-national proves to be the best man, then by all means let him have the job, but if one of our own young persons who has got his scientific training here or abroad is equally well equipped, then I think he has an equal, if not preferential, claim on the Government's patronage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Cork airport, it is not possible to give any indication at this stage what form the Government's assistance to the local authority in the construction of such an airport may take.  When the matter was originally mooted there was a question of the allocation of funds from the Vote for the relief of unemployment.  As Deputies are aware, the money provided by that Vote is allocated with a direct relation to the unemployment needs of particular districts, and the amount which might be provided for a scheme of public works in the area mentioned would be determined by the state of unemployment in that area.  I think <Col N="551" /> that, in fact, at the moment in that district unemployment is by no means acute, and, on the basis of the method of operation by the Board of Works in such matters, it would be difficult to get money from that Vote for any employment scheme in that locality.  But, if the local authorities are anxious to proceed in the matter, and I would like to see them proceeding, I am quite willing to meet them, and to discuss some basis of working towards the construction of an airport there.  The provision of road transport at both ends of the Irish Sea Airways Service is, I understand, having the consideration of the Joint Committee of Management. There is, of course, an arrangement for provision of road transport at this end at present, and I understand that the Committee are considering the possibility of providing a similar service at the Croydon end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's information concerning the meteorological service is not quite accurate.  Two meteorological experts were appointed.  One was of Irish parentage and the other was an Irishman.  Both were, of course, acquired from the British service, but the statement that they are not of Irish nationality is not correct.  A substantial expansion of personnel in connection with that service is contemplated, but I think the difficulty will be the getting of personnel and not the allocation of existing posts amongst the applicants for them.  We are anxious to maintain a very high standard in connection with this service, because its importance in the scheme of things will be very great. The meteorological service of this country will have a much greater importance than the meteorological service provided by other countries while, at the same time, our ability to pay for a first class service is limited.  Consequently, we must try to make our service, while small, of excellent quality.  On that account, a very high standard of efficiency and training will be required from those appointed to permanent posts in it.  As I have said, the director of the service is of Irish <Col N="552" /> parentage, and the other expert is of Irish birth.</P>

      <P>I do not want to press that point because there was some desire to finish the Estimate yesterday and the Deputy might not, on that account, have availed of the opportunity to raise the matter.

      <P>I merely take the opportunity of saying that soon the position will have to be gone into.  A number of people are interested who could not be regarded as ordinary shareholders.  I refer to those people who were trustees for orphans and to old ladies and gentlemen who had money invested in the railways which they regarded as excellent security. These people were depending on the income from their investment which was an excellent one 20 or 30 years ago.  By legislation and various other circumstances, they have lost their income from that source.  They are as much entitled to compensation as a lot of the people who shriek about what happened to them in respect of the railways during the last 15 or 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  Any action taken by the State in relation to the railways has been designed to assist them and increase their earning capacity.  The fact must be faced that very large sums of money which were invested in railways in this country have been lost.  Railways which were built had to be abandoned. The capital which went into these railways and which earned money for a time has been lost.  It would be a big burden upon the economic life of the country if we were to try to make the remaining railway system carry not merely obligation to pay interest on the capital invested in that system but interest on the capital invested in railway lines that had to be abandoned and which, as the Deputy is aware, were established originally by separate companies from the Great Southern Railways Company which now survives. All these small railway systems throughout the country were forcibly amalgamated by legislation in 1924, and arrangements were made at that time for enabling the amalgamated <Col N="556" /> company to carry the loss which it was anticipated it would incur through the operation of these systems.  That arrangement involved the payment by the State of a substantial sum of money to the amalgamated company for a number of years, but at the end of that time, these railways are still being run at a loss and the policy is to abandon them wherever that is the case, particularly where adequate road services can be substituted for them.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think that there is a possibility of the Railway Tribunal's job being made easier and more successful in the future?  There are some very definite things sticking out of the present situation. The railways find themselves in such difficulties that at present, if the Minister or any of his friends are travelling third class from the West of Ireland, particularly in the latter part of the year, they will find that although they pay their full fare, they will have to stand, because the position of the railways is such that they are saving in every possible way, and one of the ways is to keep some of the rolling stock off the lines.  The Minister will find that, week after week, passengers travelling from the West of Ireland, after reaching Mullingar, have to stand for the rest of the journey, simply because the tendency of the railway receipts as shown by the Minister's figures is to go down and down.  The average weekly railway receipts in 1931 were £95,750, they were lower in 1934 and 1935, and in 1936 they had decreased to £85,050.  Last year they were still further down, being £84,225, and so far as the figures are available for the first three months of this year, they are still further down. The railways have been put in as favourable a position as possible. Rates of all kinds for the last couple of years have been increased.  There is a regular vicious circle, but the tendency is for the receipts to go down and down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have been put in the favourable position, too, of controlling all the road traffic, and of being enabled to squeeze traffic on to the railways which would otherwise desire to travel by road.  We have the position as shown by the <Col N="557" /> figures that, while the number of passengers tended to rise during the last few years, back to 1934, the tendency for the number of miles run by the buses is to decrease, so that apparently in the road services there is a skimping of the running facilities provided, while the number of passengers increases.  If the Minister takes up the attitude that there are certain of the railways existing at present that will be found to be uneconomic and are going to be cleared away, the sooner we have a review of that situation the better, but the economic position generally as disclosed by the position of the railways, as one of the factors in our economic situation, is very bad.  There is a steady decrease in railway receipts; there is inconvenience to people travelling; and there is a steady rise in railway rates, whether for passengers or carriage of goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will jump to wrong conclusions if he studies the figures relating to railways only. The essential idea behind the 1933 legislation was that road and rail transport should be put under joint management, and operated as part of a single system.  Consequently, any attempt now to estimate the position of the company itself, or the trend of events in transport, by studying the figures relating to the railways only will be misleading. The whole service must be studied and the position of the service, which is a combined road and rail service, taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not pretending that the railway company is not facing certain difficulties. That is undoubtedly the case, and nobody will say that the transport facilities which they are able to provide are adequate or fully satisfactory because that is not so.  The circumstances are such, however, that an improvement of these facilities by the company is a matter of great difficulty but improvements are being made &mdash; gradually, it is true, and not nearly as rapidly as we should like to see, but nevertheless of not inconsiderable dimensions.  The expansion of the road services operated by the company accounts in large measure for variations in the utilisation of our rail services.  The closing of branch lines <Col N="558" /> and the transfer of the business from these lines to road services, and similar changes, have all operated to affect the figures relating to the rail services only, and, of course, only figures relating to rail services are published in these official returns.  The company is not making a profit in the sense that it has been able up to the present to pay a dividend on the ordinary shares, but nevertheless there is accruing to it from these road services a return which must be taken into account when calculating the financial result of its operations.</P>
    <P>However, it is undoubtedly the case that there are many problems to be solved in connection with our public transport.  There are a number of branch lines which will, I think, inevitably go and be suostituted by road services as soon as it is possible to provide these road services, and there will have to be a further offort to secure effective co-ordination between road and rail services so as to provide in each part of the country that type of transport facility which the circumstances of that part of the country make most suitable.  That was the idea behind the 1933 legislation.  That idea has not been fully implemented, because difficulties have arisen in the operation of the legislation and because some people have discovered means of avoiding its provisions; but if we succeed in making that idea effective, I think we shall have done everything possible to provide this country with the best transport services which its general circumstances will make possible.</P>

      <P>I want to put just this to the Minister.  The Minister speaks casually of the probability of the winding up of branch lines.  Will he keep in mind this fact: although it may be made out on paper that an adequate road service can be substituted for a branch line, the effect of closing a branch line leading to a country town <Col N="559" /> is virtually to kill the trade of that country town?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want this to be present to the Minister's mind: If a branch line to a country town is closed, it means that the facilities for carrying live stock become disreputable in the eyes of dealers.  They have the idea that loading live stock on to a lorry, carting it a certain distance, unloading it and reloading it on to the main line truck so exhausts and disturbs the live stock that the town becomes disreputable as a centre for a fair.  They simply boycott the town and concentrate all their attention on the main line towns.  That is something that should be borne in mind by the Minister when he is excogitating the problem of the branch lines.  I do not know whether it has ever been brought home to him that there is no use trying to help the railway companies until the railway companies face this simple fact, that their sundry traffic rates are archaic, out of date, and out of touch with modern conditions.  There is no use fixing rates for sundry traffic on an economic basis according to the railway company's calculation, if my lorry is standing idle in my yard, because I can send that lorry down to Sligo and bring back two tons of sundries for which the railway company would charge, according to scale rates, £3 or £4.  I can send my lorry round the town of Sligo, to the quays and to the establishments of various wholesale merchants, and take these goods back to my place for an out-of-pocket expense of 10/-.  That is the real problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I feel is that the Minister, in implementing his railway legislation, has lost sight of the fact that though you may restrict road competition a great deal, there does come a point when you cannot stop a man from using his own lorry for transporting what are genuinely and honestly his own goods.  So long as scale costs are applied to sundry traffic that must go on.  That is one of the difficulties that have got to be faced.  This is neither the time nor the place to go into detail on that matter, but that is the kind of traffic that has been growing immensely for the last two or three years.  You probably must have a lorry for your business in any case.  It is probably standing idle in the yard between jobs, and you see that you may save £3 or £4 by bringing some distance a load of sundry traffic for which the railway company would charge the scale rates.  Until the railway company provide a competitive service, which I believe they can, by quoting you lower rates for sundry traffic, that is a problem that is going to be more acute with the passage of years.  It is going to induce people, who do not at present use lorries, to purchase lorries.  There are many people who simply keep a horse and cart to cart goods from the station, but if they see that, in addition to having that work carried out by a lorry, they can also use the lorry to take sundry traffic over longer journeys and thereby save considerable sums, they will get rid of the horse and cart and purchase a lorry.  Therefore, if you are going to tackle that problem you should tackle it now before a large additional number of people are persuaded to buy lorries in order to save overhead costs.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question regarding the financial condition of the railways which, I think, is relevant to the Vote. The average weekly receipts of the railway companies fell by about £1,000 last year as against the year before. Do I understand from the Minister <Col N="561" /> that what was lost on the railway side would probably be made up from income on the road services?  I should also like to ask him, if it is thought desirable to publish the average weekly railway receipts, in the form in which they are now published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, whether the figures from earnings on road traffic in so far as it is carried by the railway companies, are available, and why they are not published so that we could get a complete picture of the financial condition of the railway companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain statutory obligation to publish statistics relating to railways.  These figures, which were of real significance when the railways were the sole means of traffic, are becoming of much less significance nowadays.  The point I want to make is that a decline in the volume of goods passing over the railways or in the number of passengers carried, does not necessarily mean a decline in the total quantity of goods or passengers transported because, in fact, there has been growing up beside the railways this entirely new form of transportation, growing with exceeding rapidity.  In fact, there has been a diminution in rail services due to the closing of branch lines.  If the Deputy wants to draw any conclusions concerning economic conditions from the statistics relating to railway transport, he has got to associate these statistics with whatever statistics are available relating to road transport services as well.  The accounts of the Great Southern Railways Company will of course show their gross earnings from all sources and their net revenue for the year which is available for the payment of dividends.</P>

      <P>I should like to get from the Minister some explanation of the increase of £30,000 in the Estimate for unemployment assistance.  One of the features which have characterised the unemployment situation over the whole country since the beginning of the year is that the normal tendency of the figures to fall, which ought to have shown itself from the beginning of the year, has not been disclosed. Their tendency was to rise rather than to fall for the winter months.  There is no part of the country where the number of registered unemployed has not for some months past been substantially greater this year than last year.  If it is argued that there are a number of people registered as unemployed who are not actually unemployed, I shall turn to the figures relating to the number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Taking the number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance in the Dublin area for the month of June last, there were 2,049 more people in receipt of unemployment assistance during that month than in the same month last year.  All the figures I am giving are indicative of the situation during the month of June.  In the North Leinster area there were 670 more persons weekly in receipt of unemployment assistance this year than last year.  In South Leinster the increase was 431; in North Munster there were 421 persons more in receipt of unemployment assistance in June than in June of last year.  In South Munster the increase was 951; in North Connaught, 1,449; in South Connaught, 351, and in the three counties of Ulster, 1,116.  In the country <Col N="564" /> as a whole, whereas at the end of June last year there were 36,526 persons in receipt of unemployment assistance, the numbers had gone up by the end of June this year to 44,974, an increase of something like 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister is asking us to vote an additional sum, and I should like to hear from him some explanation of why, in this particular year, when we have so many rosy statements about the really prosperous condition of the farmers and the much better time ahead of them, and how well things are going on industrially, more money is sought, and, particularly, why at present the number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance shows such a remarkable increase over last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many of the Deputies who spoke on the Industry and Commerce Vote devoted their criticism to the administration of unemployment assistance.  Deputy T.J. Murphy referred to it as chaos, indescribable and deplorable. It would be quite easy to clear up that chaotic condition if one were to yield to every demand made on the Department irrespective of the merits of the demand.  It would also be quite easy to tuck in all the loose ends if one were to decide on the face value of every application without a sympathetic examination of all the facts and in the belief that all the applicants were not able to make out a case properly or set out the facts of their case properly.  The administration of unemployment assistance is not a simple matter.  It is a question of dealing with public funds, and is governed by statute, and I contend that the administration of the Act by my Department is carried out with sympathy for the unemployed and with the desire to help and give all the benefit possible to people who are unfortunately out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Pattison and Deputy Murphy complained that unemployment assistance payments were often suspended because of the receipt by the Department of anonymous letters.  That is correct.  It is unfortunately true, also, that the information received in these <Col N="565" /> anonymous letters is in the majority of cases correct.  Payment is not suspended in these cases until investigation is made, and if at any time the information that we receive in the Department is found to be incorrect, payment of accrued arrears is made as soon as possible to the man about whom the complaint was made.  I do not like anonymous letters or anonymous letter-writers, but in administering the Department it is my duty to take cognisance of every piece of information bearing on the administration of the Department, no matter from where it emanates.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Pattison and Deputy Murphy complained that they cannot intervene on behalf of applicants for unemployment assistance.  That is not correct.  They can intervene and, not only can they intervene, but they have intervened, and notice is taken and consideration given to the representations made by Deputies on behalf of these people.  But we always feel that a man who has an application before the Department for unemployment assistance is in a better position to know the facts of his own case, and we always try to get the man's full story and to get his point of view. There is no objection to intervention by any Deputy interested in an unemployment assistance applicant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison also complained of delay in investigating the means of applicants for qualification certificates. That is not a matter for this Department at all, but for the investigation officers, who are controlled by the Revenue Commissioners.  These officers are not only concerned with unemployment assistance applications, but also have to investigate means in relation to old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  This is not a simple proposition.  There is practically no similarity between any of the cases which have to be examined, and the work is very arduous and complicated, and these officers try to get through it as expeditiously as possible.  Deputy Pattison also made reference to people who have suffered at the hands of the Department.  I think the Deputy and his colleagues might very easily have <Col N="566" /> paused and considered the very great number of people who have derived substantial benefits and help from the work and outlook of the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy spoke about the disallowance of claims for unemployment benefit by landholders.  That is a very ancient question in the Dáil.  There never has been a disallowance of a claim by a landholder as such, but a claim is disallowed when it is proved beyond yea or nay that the man was self-employed and could not be considered unemployed.  This, too, is a complicated question, and we deal with sympathy with all these claims. I have a great deal of sympathy with the point of view of Deputy Brasier and I have gone very carefully into the matter that he raised, but I find that we cannot meet the case made by him without new legislation.  The only thing therefore that I can do, having sympathy with the point of view that he has expressed is to have the matter carefully examined again with a view to meeting his point of view if possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan suggested work and not maintenance as an ideal for this Department.  I agree.  In spite of all the hard cracks of politics that Deputy Belton referred to, we do not bow down our heads in defeat and regard unemployment as absolutely inevitable.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Department to make every possible effort to provide employment.  When we look around at the various countries of the world under varying types of Government, we see that not alone is the position in these countries under the various types of Government as bad as regards unemployment, but unfortunately worse, in most cases.  We are doing our best.  I believe one factor about the solution of the unemployment problem is the carrying out of the industrial policy of this Department. We all agree that a solution of unemployment is the ideal to be aimed at, but instead of the criticism that we sometimes have, it would be much better if we had thoughtful criticism. As the Minister stated, it is not a matter for one Party.  Every Party should try to tackle it in the best possible spirit.  I thought the attack made by Deputy Hughes on <Col N="567" /> the policy of the Department to be a most dangerous one for the country. I have no doubt that the Deputy is an expert and a very well informed farmer.  His attitude to the policy of the Department, if accepted, would, to my mind, intensify unemployment fourfold. There is an old Irish saying: &ldquo;Is ar sgath a cheile maireann na daoine&rdquo;; it is on the shadow of each other the people live.</P>

In the Department we would appreciate a little sympathy, help, and consideration from the representatives of the farming community in our efforts to provide a livelihood for that respectable body of people who have no property.</P>

      <P>The only matters that arise on this Vote are matters of administration.  If the Deputy is asking for the causes of variations in the numbers of persons seeking unemployment assistance benefit, that would require a very elaborate survey of the economic position before they could be given.  As the Parliamentary Secretary explained, the actual increase in the Vote is due entirely to the fact that the rates of assistance have been increased.  In some areas there are more people claiming unemployment assistance than last year and in other areas less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin, I think, that is due almost entirely to the fact that at this time last year there were large numbers of men employed at the Collinstown airport, which work has now ceased.  In other places there is a diminution in the number unemployed, due to local causes.  For instance, there is a diminution in Blessington area where the Poula-phoucha power scheme is proceeding. You will get local causes, as a result of which there are variations in the numbers unemployed one year against another.  It is true that there were some factors to prevent the normal trend in respect to employment and unemployment operating fully this year.  That may be attributable to abnormal circumstances, such as industrial and commercial dislocation arising from the prolongation of the London negotiations and the uncertainty which followed their conclusion. It might be said that that was the whole cause, were it not for the fact that similar abnormal factors have interrupted the normal trend in other countries also.  The Deputy must face the fact that it occasionally happens that fluctuations of one kind or another may be due to causes which are very hard to trace.  In any event, it is unwise to jump to conclusions on the experience of a very short period. <Col N="569" /> As the Deputy will have noted from the Estimate, the Department does not anticipate any substantial increase in unemployment this year, or any substantial diminution in employment.  In fact, we are making a somewhat increased contribution for increased provision towards the unemployment insurance fund, because we anticipate that the number of persons insured and making contributions to that fund will increase, and that employment will increase as it has increased for a number of years past; we assume that the increase will continue.  Consequently, we had to provide for an increased contribution from the State because, as Deputies are aware, the State pays a definite part in respect of every person employed, for each week that such person works.  It may be found that the assumption on which our proposal is based is incorrect, that it may be too optimistic or too pessimistic. At this stage, it would be impossible to give a convincing explanation regarding the number of persons employed, or registered for unemployment assistance in any part of the country, because that would require much fuller information than is available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may be allowed to speak.  The anticipated cost of the increased rates of unemployment assistance as stated in the Bill was £55,000.  The increase in the rates of unemployment assistance necessitated the provision of £55,000 additional. We are only asking for £30,000 additional because we think the total expenditure on unemployment assistance will be less if allowance is made for the variation in the rates.  If there were no variation we would be asking for less money this year than last year. This is only an estimate, and it is <Col N="572" /> impossible to make an estimate so accurate that every possible variation in the number of persons applying for unemployment assistance will be foreseen twelve months ahead.  The number applying in June may be greater than last year; in July it may be less. Local circumstances and national circumstances all operate to effect variations of that kind.  I am admitting that there has been some cause operating to prevent the development of normal trends this year in the reduction of unemployment.  What that cause is I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That fact has been noticed much more in Great Britain. The Deputy may have noticed that the British Prime Minister made very definite references in a speech last week to the unexpected increase in the numbers of the unemployed in Great Britain in the summer when a diminution in unemployment was expected.  The same thing has happened in Northern Ireland and has been referred to in speeches and newspaper comments only in the course of the past few days.  The same thing has happened elsewhere.  But we can trace an increase in the number of persons unemployed here to one known cause and that is the suspension of industrial activity in many quarters due to uncertainty arising from the British negotiations and the trade Agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In any part of the country.  The mere fact that industrial activities are suspended in one part of the country does not mean that only in that part of the country will the effects of it be noticed.  The effects of it will be shown all over the country. Deputies were talking about factories, boot factories for example, working on part time and some of them closed. That is going to affect these figures, too, but we know that the causes that affected the boot factories are temporary and will disappear, and, therefore, there is no reason to be perturbed <Col N="573" /> on that account.  We do not anticipate any increase in unemployment in the year as a whole.</P>
      <P>Having said all that, I want again to remind Deputies that there is an interDepartmental Committee sitting permanently, watching the trend of the statistics relating to employment and unemployment, getting all possible information concerning the factors which may be affecting those statistics and putting them in reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had a talk with them the Deputy would accuse me of trying to influence their report.  I could not even say who they are at the moment.  Their reports are furnished regularly.  They are full and very informative, and Deputies would be well advised to study them and not put them in the wastepaper basket, as it would appear they are doing.  Many of the speeches we hear from time to time relating to unemployment statistics would not be made if these very informative reports were studied by Deputies, and I recommend Deputy Mulcahy particularly to get these reports and peruse them.  They will give him a great deal of information.  They are not doctored reports.  They are not designed to lead the readers to any definite conclusion.  They merely purport to give the information and an analysis of the information, breaking the various statistics down to their component parts so that Deputies will have an opportunity of fully understanding them.  That is what these reports are for.  They have been published regularly in respect of each period, and the next report will, I think, be available shortly.  Nobody except those who give the very detailed and minute study which the members of that committee give to our employment statistics could possibly make a report of that kind.  They give that detailed study and, consequently, their report is of real value, and Deputies should not ignore those reports, as apparently they are doing.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £22,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for a Grant-in-Aid for Peat Fuel Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that a Grant-in-Aid was given to the Peat Fuel Development Company last year to enable them to complete the experimental work on which they were engaged.  The funds provided by that Grant-in-Aid have now been expended, but, notwithstanding that, the position <Col N="575" /> of the undertaking has not altered materially except, of course, that considerable further experience of the operations of the company has been acquired, but the undertaking cannot yet be regarded as a commercial proposition.</P>
    <P>The amount of raw peat brought to the factory at the end of 1937 was estimated as sufficient to produce about 11,000 tons of briquettes, whereas the original estimate for the season was 30,000 tons. The company's present position is that further Government assistance is necessary to enable them to carry on their operations.  The amount of the financial assistance required has been estimated at £30,000, of which about £5,300 is required for new plant and machinery.  I am advised that if that assistance were forthcoming it would enable the company to carry on the milling and harvesting of about 120,000 tons of raw peat this year, from which about 40,000 tons of briquettes, it is estimated, would be manufactured.</P>
    <P>This year, as last year, it is reasonably clear that the commercial prospects alone would not justify the giving of further assistance by the State.  I feel, however, that the process worked by this company has not been fully tried out, and if the operations were now to cease no final conclusion could be reached as to the economic possibility of harvesting and briquetting peat in Ireland by the methods adopted by this company, and as a considerable amount of money has been provided, not altogether by the State but by private interests for the conduct of this experiment, it is advisable to bring the experiment to a conclusion, particularly, as I am advised by my technical experts and the board of the company and others who have examined the matter, there is good reason to anticipate that the technical difficulties of the company have been overcome and that the process can be shown to be practicable and worth proceeding with.</P>
    <P>The amount advanced to the company is, of course, secured by a debenture on the assets of the company <Col N="576" /> and we have an option to require the company to issue to us ordinary A shares against the money advanced, each of these ordinary shares carrying two votes as against the other ordinary shares, which have been designated as B shares.  The position is that at any time the Government desires to exercise that option, it can acquire the voting control of the company.  That, I think, is a reasonable safeguard in the circumstances.  It is undoubtedly true that some of the private capital and other money invested in this company must be regarded as having been lost, in so far as it was expended upon experimental works which were not quite successful, and upon machinery which had to be subsequently adapted at additional cost before it became really suitable.  At the same time, the enterprise offers such substantial prospects for development, if it is a success, that we think we should proceed with it to the end.</P>
    <P>I will be in a position to report to the Dáil before the end of the year whether or not the additional expenditure has been justified by the success of the experiment.  So far, I am informed, there is every appearance that it will be successful, and already a substantial harvest has been secured which will result in the production of a substantial quantity of fuel, the sale of which will bring in revenue for the company and assist its future operations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands that this is the harvesting season and everything depends on the harvest that will be won.  That harvest will not be translated into briquettes and the briquettes will not be translated into cash until the end of the financial year.  But before the end of this year it will be possible to see whether it is apparent that the difficulties which hampered the company in the past will be overcome.  That statement will be made, perhaps, in <Col N="577" /> reply to a Parliamentary question. The financial results will not be available until the end of the financial year, until the briquettes have been manufactured and disposed of.  I think there will be no difficulty in disposing of the output of the factory if the technical difficulties in production are overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So when the Minister says he will report before the end of the year, it will be only a question of casual reporting &mdash; there is no intention to make a systematic report before the end of the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister's suggestion that he is going to report is not so very important at the moment.  I should like to ask him one or two questions.  What is the total amount of money inclusive of this £30,000 which will have been issued by the State to this company, what is the value of any other assistance given, and what is the total amount of private capital invested up to date in the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of private capital authorised and fully paid up is £47,004.  Then there was money advanced on a mortgage debenture by a bank amounting to £20,000. The State guaranteed a loan of £90,000 and made advances last year of £35,000 and this year of £30,000, making a total of £65,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not precisely in the form in which the Deputy requires it. That is one of the matters on which information has to be procured &mdash; what is the lowest cost of production that can be secured.  The briquettes were sold last year at 30/- a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister holds out hopes that this experiment will be a <Col N="578" /> success.  Surely if the experiment is carried out intelligently we should know at this stage what is the cost of production per ton.  If the cost was 35/- a ton, there might be other factors in the experiment which would warrant its continuance in the hope that the cost of production might be reduced, and I would not blame the Minister for continuing the experiment. There might be other factors which would give him hope that the cost of production would be reduced; but surely he knows now the cost per ton of producing those briquettes that were sold at 30/-.  He certainly ought to know now their cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the cost of production depends upon the output. The difficulty is that an output which would enable the company to be conducted on commercial lines has not been secured because of technical difficulties in the operation of the plant and because of other obstacles of that kind.  If they could get an output of 40,000 tons a year they could make a profit at 30/- a ton, but with a less output than 40,000 tons a year they cannot do so.  The profit to be made depends upon the output.  It is in relation to that point that the difficulties have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I wanted to find out.  We can all appreciate that if there is only production of one ton of briquettes the cost per ton would be enormous.  The cost per ton of production would diminish as the quantity produced is increased.  I wonder can the Minister say, at the present cost of production, including overhead charges, what output would he need to reach so that he would be running level, selling the briquettes at 30/- a ton&mdash;would 40,000 tons be the figure?</P>

      <P>I cannot speak as an expert but the Deputy is aware that this is a process of milling turf, milling it into a powder.  The powder dries very much more quickly than the sod of turf and it is collected more quickly from the bog.  This is a process that has been working most successfully in Denmark.  Before we encouraged the process here its working was inspected by our experts in Denmark.  The difficulties that might arise were attributable to the character of the bog and to climatic conditions.  The bogs here are of a different character from the bogs in Denmark.  The bogs here are much deeper than the bogs in Denmark.  There is a higher percentage of moisture here and the bogs are larger in size.  It was found that the particular method that was successful in Denmark could not be made a success here and the whole of this experiment has been directed towards the adaptation of these machines to Irish bogs.  Now the experiment is working towards success.</P>

      <P>I think this year will decide that.  The progress made this year will be the determining factor in the experiment.  The year has been good from the climatic point of view. The opinion of the technical experts associated with the company is that they can make the thing a success this year unless they may come up against some insuperable difficulty.  The moisture content of the peat was reduced by the process of milling in the bog.  The powder is dried subsequently and then it is transported to the place where the briquettes are being manufactured.  The moisture content is reduced by 10 per cent. before the actual briquette is made.</P>

      <P>If the company succeeded in carrying out its production programme and getting to the point of producing 40,000 tons of briquettes which could be sold at a profit, it would be a commercial success.  But some consideration must be given to the fact that there is so much dead capital.  The question might arise whether the Government may exercise its right of taking control of the company or some other question may arise the solution of which may entail favourable consideration.  When Deputy Hughes speaks of subsidies I want to say it is not so much a matter of subsidy but making capital available. The State has power to take over control of the company, and it may exercise that power.  If it did it would have to provide further working capital so as to make it possible for the work to be continued.  It may be necessary in the future to provide, not a subsidy but additional money, but I do not think that is likely.</P>

Money may be lost in this plant but if, as a result of the money spent in it, the new process is shown to be a commercial success the money is well spent.

      <P>Whatever the employment potentialities of the company are one must not confuse the number of employed at a particular time with the capital sum expended.  This experiment may make employment available for 40 or 50 years to come to 150 men.  The expenditure of £30,000 would seem out of proportion to the employment of 150 men, but if you look at the possibility of the future where this work may be carried out in several areas as a result of this experiment the matter will look quite different.  This is a fuel-producing process which will permit of substantial reproduction of that process in other factories throughout the country.  The utilisation of these factories for the purpose of turning a native resource into a high-grade fuel is one that has caught public favour. The demand for the briquettes of this factory was far in excess of the actual supply.  There seems to be no doubt that the briquettes can be sold if they are available, and the one point that we hope to make clear is that they can be made available by this process. I could not say what the normal employment in a factory of this size would be once it had been placed upon the basis of ordinary commercial working.</P>

      <P>I think Deputies would be inclined to be sympathetic with the Minister so far as this year is concerned, in so much as he has given an undertaking that he will be able to decide at the end of the year whether the experiment is going to be successful or not.  There is one point, however, on which I think Deputies would require information, and that is the result of the experiments and of the experience of other countries.  We would like to know in how many countries on the Continent have experiments been tried, and the length of time over which those experiments have been tried; the rate of wages paid in the industry and, generally, information as to the success of peat development in those Continental countries; also, of course, the relative conditions under which the peat is found in those countries, and how it compares with this country.  Having regard to the fact that this matter of peat development has been tried out, over a number of years, in certain countries, I think information of that kind would be extremely useful &mdash; more useful, perhaps, than any information the Minister can give with regard to the experiments made here over a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, the general question of peat development is a much wider one.  As Deputies are aware, the Turf Development Board are proceeding with the production of peat fuel by mechanical means at Turraun and other places in the country.  They are following there what might be called the German method.  That enterprise has every prospect of success, but, of course, it will be at least another 12 months before the development stage is completed and the production stage begun. The Germans, of course, are producing <Col N="584" /> turf by that particular method quite successfully, and have been doing so for some time past.  In Russia, they are using peat for the generation of electric power to a very considerable extent and very successfully, but the conditions there are very different from the conditions here.  They get the peat very largely by hydraulic methods: that is, by washing the peat out of the bogs by means of jets of water pumped at great force into them. That, however, is not suitable here, nor is it necessary here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular process this company is operating has a different history altogether.  The process was the subject of experiments many years ago in Great Britain, and a company was formed there which, I think, was financed by the British Government to the amount of several million pounds, during the period of the war.  I am not quite clear as to what the outcome of that expenditure was, but there did emerge a patent.  A process was evolved which was patented, and the ownership of that patent ultimately passed from one company to another. No commercial working, however, followed from the granting of the patent until quite recently, when, following certain further experimental ventures, a company was formed in Denmark which established a briquetting plant and operated this process of harvesting on Danish bogs.  Just at that stage a company was formed here to do the same work in this country, and the company are proceeding on commercial lines.  The Government became interested only when an application for a trade loan guarantee was made.  At that stage the Government employed as its advisers certain people who are regarded as experts in matters relating to peat, and, in fact, have been regarded as the world's foremost experts on these matters.  These experts went to Denmark and inspected the process that was being operated there.  They went into the whole matter thoroughly and produced a report, the effect of which was to recommend the Government to assist this company to carry out the development here on an experimental basis, having regard to the benefit it would be if the first experimental factory proved to be a <Col N="585" /> success.  Consequently, a company was formed which has the right to operate this patented process in Ireland, and which was financed to a large extent by private capital and a portion by trade loan guarantee, and they set out to work.</P>
    <P>They ran into difficulties.  Their initial difficulties were not dissimilar to those which other commercial companies met.  They planned to get going in 1935, but through delays of various kinds they did not get going until 1936, with the result that their working capital had been absorbed and they found themselves unable to continue in 1936.  They met that difficulty by issuing debentures, but 1936 proved to be a particularly unsuitable year from any point of view, and also, as I have mentioned, the company began to discover that the machinery which was, apparently, quite successful in Denmark, was not suitable for operation in Irish bogs.  Consequently, they had to carry over until 1937, and in that year we helped them by means of a loan charged against the assets of the company.  That gave them the means of providing for that year.  It meant the readaptation of the machinery and the reorganisation of the process on the basis of the experience gained in 1936.  They got to the point, at the end of 1937, where they could see, according to their own conclusions, the possibility of successful working in this year, but, of course, they were up against the fact that they would not be selling the material they produced until the winter, and that some temporary financial arrangement would have to be made which would carry over their operations until the winter.  If their plans work out as they expect, they will get back from their sales this winter an amount sufficient to repay the loan they are getting.  Of course, we will not press them to repay it because they will still require some working capital, but if their plans work out they should recover this amount advanced to them for capital from the sales this winter.  If that is done, then their future working is only a matter of some arrangement to enable them to continue.</P>

      <P>Does the company anticipate making any experiments in artificial drying?  As Deputy Belton says, if you are going to depend on sun-drying, and if you have an abnormally wet year such as we have this year, it is going to be very difficult.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, and it was to deal with them that this process was designed.  This milling process on the bog permits of the turf being reduced to 55 per cent. moisture content in a very short spell.  A day or two will get it down to 55 per cent. moisture content, and it is at that moisture content it must be delivered to the plant.  Further drying is done in the plant.  The plant was constructed by Messrs.  Babcock and Wilcox, and there was an undertaking &mdash; I forget the particular form of it &mdash; that if turf of 55 per cent. moisture content was delivered to this plant it would be produced in briquettes of certain efficiency.  That undertaking was given by Messrs.  Babcock and Wilcox, who were responsible for the construction of the plant, and who are, as Deputies are aware, a very eminent engineering firm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the suggestion of Deputy Hughes, I should like to say that I think the Minister would be well advised to adopt any experiment which would tend to eliminate the necessity for natural drying by sun and air.  Under the old methods, the production of turf had to depend on the weather.  I am quite satisfied that its production cannot be a commercial success until we can defy the climate and dry the turf artificially. I agree with the continuance of this experiment until all hope of its being a success has gone.  I think the Minister has the support and good wishes of every Deputy in the House for the success of the experiment. <Col N="587" /> When I say that I think he should be on the look-out for artificial means of drying, I say that because I believe that only on those lines will peat production be a success in this country. The climate is too moist, the bogs are too wet, and the dry season too short to produce a fuel that could possibly pay for the overhead charges.  The plant costs, I think, £65,000, the balance of £25,000 being for working capital.  With £5,000 lying idle for the greater part of the year, the industry could never hope to be a success.  I am not very well up in the mechanical processes of turf production, but I think that while peat production depends upon drying by sun and air it will not be a success.  I think that that success will be ensured only by having artificial means of drying the peat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am also right in saying that there is no loom in the country which will weave sheetings wider than 90 inches.  There is a certain limited demand for sheetings of a greater width than 90 inches.  There is that demand I think for widths up to 140 inches or possibly more.  Those sheetings are always admitted under licence.  I do not want to suggest that there is any difficulty about that.  There is not; we can always get a licence to import them, but I would ask the Minister <Col N="588" /> to consider whether this order could not be revised so as to permit those wide sheetings to come in free, without the necessity for applying for a licence.  Deputy Dockrell mentioned the other day that he could get licences within a fortnight.  He is more fortunate than we are; we usually find that it takes at least three weeks.  I admit that a well organised business should place its orders in time, so that the three weeks' delay would not make any difference, but there are occasions when emergency arises, and it is very awkward if you cannot import.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether it is possible to amend the order accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very much to do that if it were practicable, but as the Deputy is no doubt aware there is no duty in operation here which has caused more difficulty than this one. Every attempt to make it water-tight proved unsuccessful.  Various methods of getting round the duty were not merely discovered by individual importers, but were in fact announced in trade journals in other countries. &ldquo;How to Evade the Free State Duty&rdquo; was the heading to articles which appeared in certain trade journals. During the whole of last year, in conjunction with persons with expert knowledge of the business, a new series of definitions, exemptions and exceptions was prepared, which we hope will prove to be water-tight.  If we found it necessary to exclude from the scope of the duty certain sheetings of a width not made here it would probably open some door which it was not intended to open.  However, I will have the matter examined.  It may be possible to deal with such sheetings by an amendment to the duty.  If not, of course, the only alternative is to try and make the procedure for the granting of licences as formal and expeditious as possible.  The general intention, however, and the instructions which were given to those who were dealing with the reformation of this duty were that it should apply only to the class of goods to which it was intended to apply, and that all the goods which were not being made here and on the import of which no restrictions <Col N="589" /> were intended should be excluded, but it was not possible to do that.  In the specific case of cotton blanketing, for example, there was no method which could be devised to exclude it from the duty, even though it is not made here, and we had to proceed to grant licences.  The same may apply to the sheetings to which the Deputy refers, but I will have the matter examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not the Minister is in constant touch with the trade.  Would he tell me where I would get a licence to import? I am supplying the people of Ballaghaderreen and district with those commodities, and so far as I am concerned I am paying 40 per cent. duty on the bulk of the stuff I am selling. <Col N="590" /> I am paying that duty because I cannot get the stuff anywhere else.  The country people who come into my shop are being charged 1/- a yard for what I think ought to be sold for 9d.  If the Minister can tell me any way in which I can get a licence to import that stuff, free of duty, and pass the benefit on to the consuming public in Ballaghaderreen, I will be very glad to do it, but I know of no means by which I can get it.</P>
      <P>I take it that this order covers flannelette. I can get a limited amount of flannelette from the Greenmount and Boyne Linen Company, but I know of no other source of supply in this country.  I do not know whether the Greenmount and Boyne Linen Company are making dyed flannelettes. They are making a very limited range of striped flannelettes.  In that commodity alone, the imports which you have got to have result in the people being required to pay 1/- a yard for what they ought to be buying for 9d. That means, as I have so often pointed out in this House before, that the country woman and the labourer's wife are going to pay on the three and a half yards of flannelette required to make an under garment or a nightdress, a tax on that article of 10½d., and if you are earning 24/- or even 30/- a week a tax of 10½d. on one garment &mdash; on the material required for making one garment &mdash; is a very formidable charge.  I do not believe for a single moment that the cotton materials required for this country are ever going to be made here because it is obviously unthinkable, considering the immensely wide range of materials manufactured of cotton that are required, that they can ever be produced here.  They can produce them in Great Britain because they have got a great international trade and an immense home market, and we get the advantage of that. They can produce them in America for similar reasons, and we get the advantage of that if we buy from American sources of supply.  But you cannot get them here without raising the costs to an altogether unreasonable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of union piece goods, their sale has practically stopped in this country because no one can afford <Col N="591" /> to buy them.  There used to be a limited amount of union piece goods sold here, but they are no longer being sold.  I must say that I think a levy of 4d. a yard on the ordinary materials required constitutes an altogether unjustifiable tax on the people.</P>
    <P>That is in so far as this tax hits the ordinary consumer.  But there is another aspect of it.  This Imposition of Duties Order covers the unwoven material normally used by shirt makers for the manufacture of semi-stiff fronts, cuffs and collars for shirts.  It is true that, if they import this material to manufacture it into shirts, they can get back from the Revenue Commissioners a rebate on exports in theory, but in practice it is quite impossible.  Nobody in this country can manufacture this unwoven material which is the material from which semi-stiff cuffs and collars are normally made, and nobody here wants to manufacture it.  There is no danger whatever, if its import is permitted, of its being substituted for any other purpose than that of making semi-stiff collars, shirt fronts and cuffs, and yet the Department of Industry and Commerce steadfastly refuses to give shirt makers in this country a licence to import this material.  In doing so they are gravely jeopardising the shirt-making industry.  They are injuring it and preventing the shirt makers from getting their fair share of what used to be a valuable export market.  The business in this type of shirt is now going to Derry and to the British manufacturers.  Why the Minister will not give a licence to import that stuff I cannot imagine, but up to date he has refused to do so.</P>
    <P>I have made repeated representations to the Department, not on behalf of one shirt-maker but on behalf of all shirt-makers, asking that that material should be made the subject of a general licence, and I have been refused.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to change his mind or not, but so far as the public are concerned, it constitutes, in my opinion, a grave and an unjust tax on the poorer sections of the community.  It will never yield any proportionate return <Col N="592" /> in the shape of increased industry in this country, and is so far as it reacts on the shirt-makers it is jeopardising a valuable existing industry in the interests of an industry which, I believe, will never achieve any degree of prosperity.  There is no use believing what we want to believe. No sane man in this country believes that the cotton textile industry in this country is ever going to develop into anything of real importance.  The cost of developing it is going to be infinitely greater than any benefit that we can confer on it.  We are set here right opposite the greatest cotton manufacturing country in the world by far.  We are depending on that country to purchase all our agricultural produce and we have got to buy something from that country if we are to get paid for the things we sell them.  Why on earth we do not buy from that country the commodities that they are best fitted to send us, and concentrate our industrial activities on those branches of industry in which they are not the primary leaders, God only knows.  Why we should invite Athlone to go into competition with Manchester nobody knows.  It is the very acme of insanity.</P>
    <P>As certain as we are sitting here, no matter what tariff you put on the cotton industry, it is never going to develop in this country, and you can go on piling on costs until such time as the people find some other substitute and chuck buying the stuff altogether.  Meanwhile, great inconvenience is being caused as well as great hardship on poor people, while a well-established industry that could get an increasing share of foreign trade, such as the shirt industry, is being embarrassed by the Government's refusal to allow them to get their raw materials, and all because there is some kind of a cotton textile plan in the Minister's mind.  What the textile company in Athlone is producing at the present time I do not know.  I believe it is devoting itself principally to materials for the manufacture of towels and intends to extend into other branches of trade, but it is absurd to suggest that it should go into competition with Manchester.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> Take the case of calico, of which we sell very great quantities in the West of Ireland.  You can buy from Manchester a 4? cloth, a very substantial cloth that serves a multitude of purposes in the ordinary day-to-day life of our people.  You cannot get that cloth at all from any Irish source of supply.  Take sixpenny long cloth, of which thousands of yards are sold every day in the West of Ireland. That cloth is not being produced in this country at all.  If the people are to buy the equivalent of it, it will cost them 8d.  That may sound a trivial matter here, but it is not a trivial matter in the West of Ireland, where the people have not got too much money to throw about.  It is impossible for any person in this House to go through the drapery trade in detail. The Minister ought to have done it. I do not believe he has, but anybody who is handling the drapery trade standing behind his counter, as I have stood behind my counter, must feel that he is acting as a tax-gatherer for the Government on every yard of stuff that he sells.  It is becoming abundantly clear that the burden which is being placed on the poorer sections of the community is out of all proportion to any advantage that can possibly accrue by attempting to establish the cotton-weaving industry in this country.</P>

      <P>I do not think that we should serve any useful purpose by discussing whether it is possible to establish a cotton-weaving industry in this country or not.  Deputy Dillon says that it will never succeed.  I say that there is no reason on earth why it should not succeed.  It was only an accident which prevented the big development of cotton spinning and weaving which took place in the last century in Great Britain taking place in this country.  Anybody familiar with economic history is aware of that. A mere chance prevented that development taking place here.</P>
      <P>So far as flannelette is concerned, the 4d. duty does not apply to it.  It applies only to cloths for dungarees, bed sheets, bed-ticking and to terry cloths.</P>

There is no reason whatever why this industry should not prove to be one of the most successful in the country.  It is one for which the country is particularly adapted.  Undoubtedly, some inconvenience and, perhaps, difficulty will be occasioned at this period.  This is the transition stage.  We are changing over from dependency on imports to home manufactured goods and it is inevitable, no matter how carefully we try to adjust conditions to meet requirements, that some inconvenience will be caused, but that inconvenience will become substantially less in future as our manufacture increases in volume.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This is an important matter for the shirt-makers.  I now pass to Order No. 328, which relates to enamelled hollow ware.  My information is that a heavy duty has been placed upon all these commodities, which are of daily use, in order to protect what is described as a new <Col N="595" /> Irish industry.  We are told that the vitreous enamelled hollow ware being supplied from home sources is of Irish manufacture, the fact being that all hollow ware is brought into the country and the enamel applied to it here.  It is not manufactured in this country at all.  They bring in the blanks, spray the enamel on them and go through whatever process is customary in applying enamel to such vessels.  Then, they sell these goods as Irish manufacture.  That is all the manufacture there is about it.  I am told that the prices charged by the enamellers in this country are out of all proportion to the prices at which this merchandise can be purchased from abroad.  I put it to the Minister that some steps ought to be taken to investigate the terms under which these people are operating.  Furthermore, I think it is in connection with this business I have heard it suggested that the producers of vitreous enamelware in Ireland are selling the stuff to the chain stores, like Woolworths, at prices that make it possible for these chain stores to offer the articles retailed as cheap as, or cheaper than, the wholesalers can buy them.  If you give a virtual monopoly to one firm in the supply of articles of this kind, then, I think it becomes the duty of the Minister to see that this firm carries on its business on reasonable lines and gives everybody a chance to do business in a normal way.  It is not fair that bona fide retailers up and down the country should be placed in a position in which they cannot get supplies of this enamelled hollow ware on competitive terms with the chain stores.  A number of shops in the city and throughout the country deal in this merchandise and it is not reasonable that they should be forced into a position in which the article they have to price at 1/- is obtainable in Woolworths for 9d.  My information is that it is not a question of Woolworths or the chain stores taking a narrow margin of profit and the private trader trying to get an exorbitant price.  I understand that they are selling this stuff at a price lower than the factory is quoting the wholesalers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I cannot say of this <Col N="596" /> firm what I was able to say of Cement, Limited.  I was glad to be able to say that the product of Cement, Limited, was good.  I cannot say that for this firm.  My information is that this stuff chips and gives really bad wear and is not comparable in quality with what was coming in from foreign sources before this tariff was imposed.  I do not know what precautions the Minister takes to check up on the prices and qualities of the product of a firm like this, but my information is that this firm is not trying to live up to its obligation, that it is offering inferior stuff and charging unfair prices for it and that its practice, as between one firm and another to which it gives supplies, is not ethic inasmuch as it is differentiating unfairly between the various customers that go to it.  Since it is now the only source to which dealers in this country can turn, it should be made to treat them on an equality and give all of them a fair &ldquo;do.&rdquo;  I do not know to what Order No. 142 applies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember that, last year, I raised this question of dolls and pointed out that certain wholesalers who depend very much on the provision of sundries of that kind were gravely embarrassed by the circumstances I then outlined.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that if there was no improvement in the situation steps would be taken to rectify it.  The difficulty is that the nature of the trade of these merchants is such that if they are to get supplies in time to distribute them to retailers for Christmas they must send in their orders now.  They are unlike any other trade in that respect.  They cannot wait until autumn to bring forward their supplies and distribute them in the six or eight weeks preceding Christmas.  They must lodge their order in the early spring.  It is spring <Col N="597" /> no longer.  It is summer now.  I should be glad to know, and I think they would be glad to know, from the Minister whether, if they apply for licences to import these goods, they will get them.  What is the result of the Minister's inquiries into this business? Is he satisfied now that these dealers have a reasonable cause for complaint and that excessive profits were being asked for assembling these Continental dolls which had been coming in here heretofore?  If he is satisfied that excessive profits were being charged will he now inform the wholesalers that they are free to place their orders for these cheap toys with the usual sources of supply in the knowledge that when their stuff comes forward they will get licences from the Department or from the Revenue Commissioners to import them free of duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the vitreous enamel hollow-ware is concerned, the industry is carried on here in precisely the same manner as in other countries. It is not usual in any country for the firm which does the welding and enamelling also to produce the stampings. They are purchased from firms that specialise in that class of work &mdash; foundries that produce this material for sale unenamelled.  So far as this company is concerned, they are quite willing to purchase these unenamelled parts from Irish foundries, and we have been making arrangements for some of these parts at least to be produced in due course by existing foundries here.  Eventually, I hope that all these unenamelled parts, the raw materials of this company in Tralee, will be produced by other firms within this country.  So far as the Tralee firm is concerned, their function is to get these parts, to weld them, enamel them and fire them, and they are doing that work very satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asks if the Department takes steps to supervise the work done by firms of this kind in respect of both quality and price.  We do.  It is inevitable that if there are any serious grounds for complaints, the <Col N="598" /> complaints will, in fact, reach the Department.  In relation to this firm, we have had no complaints whatever. In fact, the general impression amongst traders appears to be one of satisfaction with the quality of the goods produced at Tralee, and I am surprised, therefore, that the Deputy should find fault with them, because nobody else made that complaint to the Department.  Also, the arrangement as to price entered into with the company, which limits their prices in relation to the prices of similar goods sold ex-factory in Great Britain, has, so far as we have been able to discover, been consistently carried out by them.  It was, however, clear from evidence submitted that many British firms were selling these goods here cheaper than they were selling them in Great Britain, apart from the dumping of occasional lots of &ldquo;seconds,&rdquo; which is a problem in this industry as in the pottery and certain other industries, and on that account it was necessary to review the duty in order to ensure that the firm would be given a reasonable chance of success.  It is, I think, going ahead satisfactorily and giving useful employment in County Kerry, and there appears to be no reason whatever why it should not be encouraged in every way to extend its activities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point as to the sale of goods at lower prices to one firm than to another, that is not a matter in which the Department would ordinarily interfere, provided it was not clear that discrimination was being shown.  I take it that no discrimination has been shown in this case, but the price varies and the discount increases according to the quantity of goods sold on one order, and a firm which orders a very large quantity of a particular class of goods &mdash; a pot or a pan&mdash;of one size and shape will be able to get that article supplied at a cheaper wholesale price than a firm which merely orders half a dozen or dozen. On that account firms which are able to place large orders get some advantage over their smaller competitors, but that is a condition of affairs that applies not alone to this industry but to practically every industry, and particularly <Col N="599" /> to those industries where a large order for an article of uniform size and shape can be executed much more cheaply than an order for a small number of the same article of different sizes and shapes.</P>
    <P>So far as dolls are concerned, the position is that we now have power to grant licences, and licences are in fact issued to firms on application, on production of the usual evidence required by the Department that the goods required cannot be supplied here.  I do not want to go into the general question as to whether the complaint made as to price and quality of some of these toys was well-founded.  You would require a judicial commission to get a decision on some of the things, and I do not purport to be a judicial commission in dealing with these matters. My prejudices may lie in one direction or another, but some of the complaints appear to be well-founded and some not, but so far as the trade is concerned, the position was eased by the introduction of the licensing provision, because the main difficulty was not in relation to the quality or price of the articles, but the ability of the firm to supply anything like the quantity required by traders.  Now that the licensing provision is there, that difficulty has been overcome, apart from the fact that other firms are now engaged in the production of these articles in addition to the one firm which commenced and on whose behalf the duty was originally imposed.  The Gaeltacht Department of the Department of Lands has been responsible for a development in West Mayo which promises to be quite useful and toys of excellent quality are being produced there.  I hope the activities of that Department in that regard will be extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; in relation to certain commodities covered by these orders.  &ldquo;Seconds&rdquo; is a trade term and has particular reference to Order No. 139, which is to be confirmed by this Bill.  Recently there was an increase in the duty on imported china of 45/- per cwt. and this Bill confirms that increase.  That increase has been <Col N="600" /> got on the grounds that Continental china was coming into the country and making it impossible for the Arklow and Carrigaline factories to capture the trade.  Does the Minister realise the amount of tax which this order represents on the day to day purchases of the people?  I do not know if he is familiar with the ordinary white cup and saucer known to the trade as &ldquo;sprigged china&rdquo;?  It is an ordinary, common white cup with a gold band around the outside and a gold shamrock in the bottom of the cup.  Immense quantities of that stuff came into this country from Stoke, and I should say that seven-eights of what came in was what are known to the trade as &ldquo;seconds&rdquo;.  Now, Stoke-on-Trent &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; are, in fact, almost as good as the best the Irish factories produce.  That is the plain fact, because anything with the slightest flaw in the glaze &mdash; a flaw which the ordinary person would not perceive at all &mdash; is rejected in Stoke as &ldquo;second.&rdquo;  The ordinary person looking at one of those cups or saucers would be quite unable to find any flaw at all, but the skilled potter, testing the glaze under his finger or by the reflected light, sees flaws in it which disqualify it from the accepted standard for first-quality china.  We got all those at throw-away prices.  They were sold to the public in rural Ireland at about 2d. a cup or 3d. a cup and saucer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are required to buy Arklow cups and saucers of the same type and, in my judgment, of the same quality but technically they are No. 1 quality merchandise from Arklow and we have to pay the same price that we would have paid for No. 1 quality from Stoke-on-Trent.  Nobody, however bought No. 1 quality from Stoke-on-Trent formerly.  I am not as familiar with the prices of these goods as I am with the prices of many other classes of goods, but I do not think I am over-stating the case when I say that what was available in a keen merchant's establishment at 3d. prior to the imposition of these duties now costs the average country person 6d. To levy a tax of approximately 70 per cent. on the cups and saucers that the people have to use in their own <Col N="601" /> houses seems to me to impose a very heavy burden on them.  I have no doubt that the Arklow factory is an enterprising and developing industry, but how much are we prepared to levy on the unfortunate people slaving on the land in order to maintain that industry in Arklow?  Everybody in this House knows that many of my friends are actively engaged in the Arklow pottery factory, but the fact that my friends are engaged in that industry is no reason why I should hesitate to criticise that industry any less than any other industry when criticism is necessary.  I do not think it reasonable to put an overwhelming tax on the people in order to produce this commodity in Arklow.  I think the consumer has some right to consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister on a previous occasion waxed very eloquent because we dared to criticise some industry in which political supporters of this Party were engaged, and he issued a general warning that any supporters of ours who dared to approach him in future for assistance for an industry would have to give him some undertaking that that industry would not be criticised by the Fine Gael Party or he would give them no help.  I do not think that is a sound parliamentary practice at all.  I do not think that the personal relationships of anybody in this House should deter us from doing our duty or that we should refrain from criticism out of regard for those associated with any industry if we believe that it is uneconomic or that it cannot be maintained except by imposing a prohibitive burden on the people.  It is our duty to expose these matters and we shall continue to do so whether or not it disgruntles the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do think that there is a case for instituting an inquiry into the comparative prices of the common cup and saucer prior to the imposition of these duties and the price to-day.  If the Minister makes that inquiry, I think the result would astonish him.  My suggestion is that in order to develop an industry you must have the goodwill <Col N="602" /> of the people behind it.  It is quite possible by a patient examination of the special problems of an industry of this kind, to make it a success without imposing an undue burden on anybody because there are plenty of articles manufactured in the Arklow factory, in addition to the common cup and saucer.  The Minister could exempt the cup and saucer from these duties and let Arklow have the market for other types of china.  If a person wants to buy a flowered tea set or some other fancy article, let him pay the price for that, but you cannot ask our people who drink their tea out of a mug &mdash; and when I say a mug I do not mean the metal mug which bears a duty of 45/- per cwt. &mdash; to pay this tariff. I am referring to the mug out of which country people usually take their tea and to the common cup and saucer, usually coloured white with a golden shamrock on the bottom of it.  Could we not exempt these articles from the duties and let those who want to buy the dearer articles or the fancy articles bear that duty?</P>
    <P>The complaint I make against the Minister is that I do not think he ever bothers to investigate that side of the story when an application is made to him for the imposition of a tariff.  He simply slaps on the tariff and hopes it will all come out in the washing.  It does come out in the washing, but it creates an immense amount of inconvenience in rural Ireland.  After all, the unfortunate people who buy the stuff are entitled to some consideration. I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that he should look into the question of whether the common cup and saucer and the mug could not be exempted from this tariff.  The balance of the china trade, whatever it is, could then be left to the Arklow factory to make whatever they can of it.</P>

I am talking of the common cup and saucer and the common mug, which came from Stoke-on-Trent. Deputy Moore would be familiar with these.  I do not know whether the Minister is, because he is a Dublin man and has lived all his life in Dublin, but if you are visiting a country house you will see these mugs hanging over the top shelf of the dresser.

All I ask is that the Minister would look into the matter, have an investigation and, <Col N="604" /> if he discovers the bulk of the stuff came from Stoke-on-Trent, he could exempt it from duty.  This cheaper type of china coming from Stoke-on-Trent could be exempted from the duty and the tariff could still operate on sets coming from Japan.  If the Minister will look into the matter, he will find that Japan did not supply any considerable quantity of the stuff to which I refer.  If he even gave a preference to the Stoke-on-Trent stuff and leave the tariff on the Japanese stuff it would meet the situation.</P>

      <P>Both Arklow and Carrigaline are mass-production factories, and they could not be worked economically unless they had a big output. They have installed these Dressler ovens, which must work continuously, so that the important lines for them are the lines for which there is a continuous steady trade.  The important lines for them, therefore, are the cheap lines of goods.  The whole difficulty is to secure for these firms an output of these cheap lines such as would make their whole operations economic.  Arklow certainly is not, and Carrigaline is only to some extent engaged in the production of high-class fancy goods, but if we take away the most important of the bread-and-butter lines of pottery from these concerns, probably we will make the whole thing impossible to carry on. That is why the whole duty is designed to secure to them lines in which there is a steady demand all the year round, where there is a volume in the output, and which are the important lines to maintain for these concerns if they are to be successfully operated.</P>

People buy these, and they are to the country kitchen what pictures or articles of bric-a-brac are to the suburban home.  If the price of these things rises too high, the people simply stop using them; they become luxuries, and they cease to buy them.  The Minister is pursuing a chimera if he thinks he <Col N="605" /> can maintain a market for these commodities at the same time as there is a substantial rise in the price of them.</P>

From the point of view of the efficiency of the equipment, I say that there is no pottery in the world able to beat them.  If they get the output there is no reason why they cannot get down the price to that at which the same articles can be produced elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the dilemma from my own knowledge. Let the Minister call the hardware and china merchants in and ask them the questions I am raising.  Let him get an official of the Department to see the china merchants and put the question to them whether the raising of the price of articles like the common jug, mug, and cup and saucer will not operate substantially to reduce the consumption of these articles.  If he is satisfied from his inquiry that that is true, is it not clear that we are getting into a vicious circle?  We are saying that Arklow and Carrigaline cannot get on if they do not get the volume, but we are allowing the prices to rise to a point which is going to destroy the whole demand.  It does not matter to Stoke whether we buy from them or not, but it may mean the destruction of factories such as Arklow and Carrigaline if you dry up the bulk of the demand.  Would it not be much better to examine the whole question and see if you can get a bulk demand in the form of teapots or other articles of everyday use instead of just hoping that if you put sufficient tariff on you will drive the available trade into Arklow and Carrigaline? You are in serious danger of drying up the demand altogether, and then you will hurt people and fail in your purpose of making Arklow and Carrigaline a success.  I can assure the Minister that these matters are worthy of investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As members of the previous Dáil are aware, this Bill was introduced early in the year and was considered here both on Second Reading and in Committee.  It was wiped out by the dissolution of the Dáil and has to be reintroduced.  For the information of Deputies who were not in the last Dáil, I may mention that it is a Bill to establish new machinery for the control of the industrial alcohol undertaking.  The question of whether that undertaking should or should not have been started, or how it is conducted, probably does not arise on the Bill.  The only question that does arise is whether it was better to have the undertaking which is there controlled by a committee from the Department of Industry and Commerce or by a company set up for that purpose. We think it is better to have the company procedure, which has worked successfully in the case of the sugar enterprise, the Electricity Supply Board, and other activities of that kind.  In fact, experience has shown that the operation of an industrial concern of any kind through the Minister <Col N="607" /> for Industry and Commerce, the Minister acting, as he must act, through an advisory board, is not a satisfactory arrangement and, consequently, this change is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we could discuss the desirability of continuing the industrial alcohol undertaking quite relevantly within the meaning of the Bill, but our position is that we are resolutely and convincedly opposed to the whole experiment.  We think it is a gross waste of money, great foolishness, and must eventually end in a smash in which a lot of money will be lost, a lot of time wasted, and a good deal of damage done.  But we divided on this in the last Parliament, it has gone before the country, a decision has been taken in the country on it, and for that reason we do not propose to divide on it to-day.  Not that we have changed our minds by a hair's breadth, because we are convinced that the whole thing is an economic cod from beginning to end, and we are convinced that the Minister knows that as well as we do, but he is now engaged in a face-saving operation.  The sensible thing would be to wind up this whole nonsense, close up these ridiculous factories, sell the machinery for scrap, and get out as best you can.  That would be the courageous thing to do and the right thing, and I believe the Minister knows that as well as we do.  The Minister told us he was going to provide a market for potatoes at £2 per ton. Deputy Moore is quite distressed because the farmers want £2 a ton for potatoes when the Poles are prepared to produce them for 15/-.</P>

      <P>Let us be clear that if they make that offer they mean they are going to deliver potatoes at the factory at 30/- per ton.  The average freightage is going to be 8/-, and the Minister's scheme to deal with beet is 30/- a ton at the factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and I take great consolation from the fact that four years ago they would have to take it and lump it.  Now they can just laugh when it is offered to them, but that effort to laugh will cost the taxpayers about £10.  Although I like to see farmers laughing as well as anyone else, I think £10 a laugh is too expensive. Deputy Moore pointed out on a previous occasion that he found me unreasonable in opposing this scheme, and said he was in a position to show that Germany, France, America and a number of other countries were producing industrial alcohol.  He asked why should we not do so.  I never heard anyone advance any valid reason why we should produce industrial alcohol.  To tell the truth, I was at a loss at first to imagine why any country would want to produce industrial alcohol.  I begged the Minister to tell me the reason, but he would not do so.  Then I found out, the fact being that the industrial alcohol business was founded on the coincidental existence of two factors, one being the presence of large quantities of the by-products of some other economic industry, which would have to be jettisoned if not converted into industrial alcohol, and, side by side with <Col N="609" /> that, a demand by other industries in the State for a spirit other than petroleum. A number of industrial processes required some spirit, other than petroleum, so they had to make it up from whiskey, brandy or gin.  As alcohol could be derived from inexpensive by-products, these by-products were molasses from the sugar industry. But no rational person would have suggested the establishment of industries, even from these worthless by-products of the sugar industry, which were going to be dumped into the Atlantic Ocean if not used for conversion into industrial alcohol.  No one would suggest such a use of worthless commodities for alcohol when petrol could be used instead.  The only reason for setting up refineries to convert this worthless raw material into alcohol was because they were obliged to choose between that stuff and what would be more expensive, and that is alcohol distilled from grain.  Therefore, the foundation of the industry was the existence of worthless raw material about to be jettisoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have regard to the facts with regard to the industry in Great Britain, where they are importing molasses.  They would not get molasses from the sugar factories because they are too valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative was to buy whiskey, gin or brandy and to distil that into alcohol suitable for industrial purposes.  That would be an immensely expensive article, and was, in fact, for many years used in industrial alcohol operations of that kind. It was the presence of cheap molasses, which were, in fact, habitually thrown into the sea in order to get rid of them, that made it possible to establish the industrial alcohol business. The reason molasses are carried from Trinidad and Cuba to England for conversion into industrial alcohol is because it is cheaper to produce industrial alcohol out of molasses carried from the ends of the world than from potatoes.  Is not that so?  Is not that the reason for bringing over molasses in tankers from the far ends of the world, that they can produce industrial <Col N="610" /> alcohol cheaper, even after ferrying them across the Atlantic, than they could if they got them from distilleries?</P>

      <P>This insane Government that we have, having discovered that the beet sugar industry is grossly uneconomic and ridiculous, but that there were by-products, are establishing factories to deal with these by-products, at a cost of £1,000,000 a year, despite the fact that the molasses from the beet-sugar factories in Great Britain are too expensive and can be got cheaper from Cuba or Trinidad. With that example, we are to spend £1,000,000 a year in developing an industry and that was described as a grotesque procedure.  The astonishing fact is that Deputy Moore is quite incapable of adding two and two together without having a plus.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  I put it to the Minister that in other countries factories were set up because there were available quantities of raw material, which would be thrown into the Atlantic Ocean if not converted into industrial alcohol.  In this country we are setting up factories and growing crops to feed these factories and to keep them in business, or is it because the Minister is going to start importing molasses from Trinidad?  If the intention is to import molasses from Cuba, will that justify the expenditure of £175,000 on these molasses for conversion into industrial spirit in factories that will, in fact, employ 200 men?</P>

My advice to the Government is to dismantle the factories, sell the machinery for what can be got for it, and then blow them up.  That is the sensible thing to do.  That is the economic thing to do.  That is the best method of benefiting agriculture in so far as this Bill is concerned, and I will promise you this, if you will give us an undertaking that, having established Monarchán Alcoil na hEireann, Teo., your first instructions will be to buy 6 <Col N="612" /> cwt. of dynamite and blow the whole six factories to blazes and sell the machinery for scrap, we will give this Bill a cordial endorsement, and it will be the best day's work you could do for the country if you blow the whole shooting match to blazes and save the money you are going to waste on it. And the Minister knows it.  No man knows that better at the present moment than the Minister, and what puzzles me is why he has not the moral courage to say, &ldquo;I have made a mistake over this.  I thought it was useful and worth trying.  I find in practice the whole thing is a gigantic cod.  Give me the price of 6 cwt. of dynamite and I will remove this out of your way for the rest of time!&rdquo;  If you do that, you will have the unanimous support of the House, and you will be doing the first useful thing you have ever done for the economic life of this country, and that is to blow up one of your follies.</P>

      <P>I know very little about industrial alcohol.  As a matter of fact, I know very little about alcohol of any kind.  But I know a good deal about potatoes and the growing of potatoes, and because I know something about potatoes I am very interested in this Bill, although it does not, I must say, concern the constituency which I represent.  I believe that if I were to study the question from the point of view of gaining popular support I would be inclined to oppose this Bill, but I feel that it is the duty of representatives of the people here to study every question that comes before us from the point of view of what is in the best national interests.  Viewing this question from that point of view, I am at a considerable disadvantage, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not stated exactly what his case is in support of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, so far as I can judge, the main arguments that can be advanced in support of this Bill are, first, that it provides a means of getting rid of certain of our surplus <Col N="613" /> potatoes; secondly, that it may provide an industrial fuel in face of a national emergency.</P>
      <P>As far as I can judge, the first argument in support of this factory is not altogether as sound as some people might imagine.  I believe that there is or that there should be some other means of disposing of our surplus potato crop besides converting them into industrial alcohol.  I believe that there should be and that there is in certain Continental countries a system under which the surplus potato crop or a substantial portion of the potato crop is converted into concentrated food for live stock.  I think that a scheme on those lines would be more advantageous to the country than the scheme for converting potatoes into industrial alcohol.  But, in regard to the second argument, I believe that there is a certain amount of ground for it.  I believe that it is the duty of every independent nation to take such steps as may be necessary to make itself self-sufficient in commodities which are absolutely essential, and I think motor fuel is an absolutely essential commodity. Therefore, for this reason, and for this reason alone, I am prepared to support this Bill.  I feel, however, that the Minister should keep in view the fact that there may be alternative methods of disposing of the surplus potato crop, and I believe that the Minister should also keep in view that it is desirable in the national interests, in the interests of relieving unemployment and in the interests of promoting increased agricultural output to promote an increase in the acreage under the potato crop.  But the Government should direct their attention to having that increase utilised mainly as a substitute for imported feeding stuffs.  That is my view of the matter, and I think that in considering the development of those industrial alcohol factories the Minister should be guided by that consideration and he should not seek to extend the development of those factories to any great extent but should retain them merely as a safeguard in case this country is cut away from our external supplies of motor fuel or of such supplies being restricted in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we reach the Committee Stage of this Bill there are a few things I would like to know. As I interpret this Bill the new company is purely to be a committee under the Department of Industry and Commerce and, as the State is going to guarantee everything it does, and the entire cost of this stock and all the money involved in the undertaking, I would like to know if the technical staff are going to be permanently employed whether or not any potatoes are supplied to these factories during any given period, and if the managing director is going to be paid permanently. Assuming that no potatoes are received in the factory and that no alcohol is turned out, are you going to pay these salaries?  Is that going to be part of the scheme?  Simply because the State is security, are these men going to receive these substantial wages &mdash; they are salaries, not wages. Are they to be paid irrespective of whether they earn the money or not and whether the factories earn the money or not.  The whole scheme strikes me as being uneconomic; that these men should be employed, master distillers, assistant distillers, technical staff should be there and paid simply because the State is a guarantor, and the State is the milch cow for this purpose. I would like to know the financial construction of this thing.  What is meant by all this thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently in the Bill the State is to guarantee all the money and all the expenditure in the running of these factories.  I would like to know also if there will be any organisation and co-ordination in the management in connection with the transferring of technical staff from one to the other. During a period of unemployment in one factory, if a man is not wanted, will he be spared to another in order to save costs, or is a master distiller and an assistant distiller employed at each distillery to remain there during the year, or is there one master distiller that will be responsible for the entire five factories, having control of them and giving direction, in order to save cost?  What scheme of economy is there with regard to the internal working of all the factories, or is it <Col N="615" /> that they are all working as separate units independently of one another, each one having its own separate overhead charges and separate staff under the one managing director?  I would like to know these things before the Committee Stage is reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like to ask if he has included the amendments that were put in on Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are all included.  I do not think it is necessary at this stage to enter into any elaborate defence of the Government's decision to establish these factories and go ahead with this scheme.  That matter has been discussed very frequently here in the House on various occasions, and there seems no greater prospect of our being able to convince Deputy Dillon and his colleagues of the wisdom of our decision now than there was then.  We obviously did not succeed in convincing them in the past, but I think we were fully justified in the circumstances of 1934 in having decided upon this development and we are fully justified in maintaining it now, even though the circumstances now existing are very different to those of 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible, of course, except at considerable wasteful expenditure, to do what Deputy Cogan suggests, and that is to establish these factories and merely keep them there for utilisation in times of emergency when it might be necessary to supplement the supplies of motor fuel that could be imported.  An industry of this kind, which is of a highly technical nature, requires not merely factories, but also trained personnel to operate them, and that trained personnel could not be made available at short notice.  In any event, as I explained before, there are many useful purposes to be served by the operation of these concerns.  Not merely are they of very considerable benefit to the parts of the country in which the factories are located &mdash; and Deputies are, no doubt, aware that special considerations operate in respect of some of those localities &mdash; but also they <Col N="616" /> make possible the provision here of a motor fuel of a special quality.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, not generally appreciated that the mixture of industrial alcohol and petrol and benzol constitutes a very high-grade motor fuel, which is sold on its merits in other countries in competition with petrol, and the sales of it are substantially increasing, because people regard it as a superior fuel.  Apart from the use of industrial alcohol as a fuel, its use in other industrial processes is increasing. It is one of the essential raw materials which our country should endeavour to provide itself with, so that its ordinary life would be carried on in circumstances of emergency against which, unfortunately, all countries must plan at the present time.</P>
    <P>Those are all matters which were discussed on many occasions since the scheme was originally devised.  I am not, of course, disputing the right of Deputies to discuss any matter affecting the scheme.  The reason for the introduction of the Bill is because the Government have decided to transfer control of the enterprise from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a company to be established.  At the present time the enterprise is conducted by the Minister.  He has the benefit of the advice of an advisory board.  Everything is done in his name and his formal assent must be secured to any proposal involving expenditure or any major matter affecting the enterprise. The Minister is, of course, a public officer and the operations of his Department in relation to industrial alcohol are subject to the same checks in regard to financial matters, and the same supervision by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, as are its operations in relation to any other matter and no industrial enterprise can be run successfully by a Government Department controlled and limited in its operations in that way.  That is why we have decided that this enterprise, now that it has reached the stage where a full year's operation can be contemplated during the coming season, should be transferred to a company which will operate as any other private company will.  That company will operate in precisely the same way as any other privately-owned <Col N="617" /> company.  The only difference is that the shares in the company will be owned by the Minister for Finance and not by members of the public.</P>
    <P>I could not answer Deputy McMenamin's hypothetical questions.  It is not contemplated that these factories will be idle or that a staff will be maintained doing nothing.  It is contemplated that the factories will be worked to the maximum extent possible and that the staff will be fully occupied in their labours in that regard.  There is only one managing director.  The five factories will be run as part of one scheme by the company, but there will be, of course, separate arrangements for the supervision and operation at each individual plant, as is obviously necessary.</P>

      <P>The company is established with a capital which is ample to enable it to carry on the enterprise. Most of that capital will be transferred in the form of fixed assets, not in the form of cash.  If they require capital over and above that already provided, they will undoubtedly get it under a Government guarantee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told by Deputy Moore that molasses are a very valuable product.  I know something about molasses and they have very little or no food value, but they are added to sugar beet pulp to make it palatable for live stock.  I know that during the negotiations to fix the price of sugar beet this year an attempt was made to ask the farmers to take untreated sugar beet pulp, that is, pulp without molasses.  The molasses are added to sweeten the pulp and to make it palatable.  I rather gathered that it was the intention of the Government, when the farmer was asked to take the sugar beet pulp untreated, to divert the molasses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are installing plant for the utilisation of molasses in the alcohol factories, and any molasses the sugar company chooses to sell for that purpose will be utilised.  That is a matter of policy for the sugar company.</P>
