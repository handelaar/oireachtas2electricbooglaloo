      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the Combined Purchasing Section of his Department have accepted tenders for toilet soap, threequarter ounce tablets, at 10/- per gross, when soap of equal quality was offered at 5/3 per gross tablets; that they have accepted tenders for various other items of soap and soap powders set out on tender form B, No. 10 (soaps and soap powders), at prices from 10 per cent. to 80 per cent. above those quoted for products of equal quality; and also that they have accepted tenders for candles, as set out on form B, No. 29 (candles), at prices substantially in excess of those paid by the Post Office Contracts division for goods of exactly the same quality and description; and if he will state what consideration influenced the acceptance of these tenders and the rejection of lower ones wherever such lower tenders were submitted by a Dublin soap firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland) (for Minister for Local Government and Public Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>Official contractors for the supply of commodities to local bodies are appointed by the Minister on the advice of a Local Supplies Advisory Committee, who in making their recommendations take into consideration the standard of commodities to be supplied by persons applying to be appointed official contractors, and the previous record of persons as official contractors in supplying commodities of standard quality.  The committee in making their recommendations <Col N="1700" /> attach great importance to maintaining a high standard of quality of commodities at competitive prices, and throughout each year a system of testing of samples of commodities supplied to local bodies is carried out by the Department.  The particulars stated in the first and second parts of the question are substantially correct as regards the amounts of the quotations mentioned, but not in respect of commodities of equal quality.  The reply to the third part of the question is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that in the advertisement for these supplies, one of the commodities for which quotations were sought is described as a cleansing powder, O.K., O.K. being the trade name of Messrs. Dixon, soap manufacturers of the City of Dublin? For that commodity Messrs. Dixon, whose trade name is used in the advertisement, quoted 11/6 and Messrs. McCormack quoted 12/9.  Messrs. McCormack's quotation was accepted although the people who originated the product quoted 1/3 below the persons who were copying, and admittedly copying, this product.  Is he aware that Messrs. Dixon, who have been over 50 years honourably employed in the soap and chandlery business in this city and bear a reputation second to none in that business, tendered for soap at 5/3 per gross while Messrs. McCormack&mdash;who are an excellent firm, I have no doubt, but who are in business for only two years in the city &mdash;were awarded the contract at 10/- per gross?  In face of these figures, surely the Minister will agree with me that a case for special inquiry exists? All I ask is that he will call before him the persons responsible for tendering this advice and require them to account to him for the advice they have tendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said in the reply, the matter that has to be taken into consideration is the quality of the goods.  I do not want to decide as between the merits of the firms but I have here a list of 20 complaints from different bodies about commodities supplied.  It was on these complaints <Col N="1701" /> and on inquiries held, that the decision to give the contract was reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to the fact in connection with this firm's tender for candles, that the General Post Office Contracts Department have bought their candles from this firm at the price tendered to the Central Purchasing Authority? Nevertheless, the Central Purchasing Authority on being offered wax candles of 25 per cent. at 12/- per dozen lbs. by Messrs. Dixon gave the contract at 15/- per dozen lbs. to Messrs. Rathborne.  The General Post Office authorities have, as I have stated, bought 25 per cent. wax candles from Messrs. Dixon at the price tendered to the Central Purchasing Authority and have declared that they are satisfied with the quality and propose to go on buying from them. Surely here is something which requires investigation.  May I ask the Minister if he is aware that as recently as the 5th of this month the General Post Office bought wax candles from the firm of Dixon and Company and, in the light of these facts, will he cause special inquiry to be made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he proposes to hold a sworn inquiry, as suggested by the Circuit Court judge in County Monaghan, into the circumstances surrounding the non-payment of part of the housing grant to which a Mrs. Matthews was declared by the court to be entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister considered very carefully all the circumstances of this case, which arose out of an action taken by Mrs. Matthews against the Monaghan County Council for the payment of a loan of £50 agreed to be advanced to her under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  At the hearing of the case reference was made to a sum of £40, being portion of a grant of £80 allocated by the Minister under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts to the Monaghan Public Utility Society in <Col N="1702" /> respect of the erection of a new house for Mrs. Matthews.  In accordance with the regulations an instalment of the grant amounting to £40 was paid by the Minister to the Public Utility Society when the house had been roofed.  The Minister has obtained documentary evidence that the payment of £40 made to the society was properly applied to the purpose for which it was made.  There are, therefore, no grounds whatever for holding a sworn inquiry.  The balance of the grant has not been paid as the house has not yet been certified by the appointed officer to be satisfactorily completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the course of the court's investigation of this transaction a doctor in the public service in County Monaghan went into the witness-box and swore that he got this woman's paying order, that he forged her name to it and cashed the order?  That is his own sworn testimony.  He swore that he forged the woman's name and cashed the order, and on that evidence the judge awarded a decree against the county council for the full amount of the order which had been forged. I do not enter into the merits of the question, whether the doctor subsequently applied these moneys to what he thought were proper purposes or not.  I am asking that in the face of these admitted facts the Minister ought to hold a sworn inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the money supplied by the Minister, £40, has been properly spent, and that the balance has not been paid because the certificate from the appointed officer has not been forthcoming.  When it is, I presume the remainder of the grant will be paid.  In the circumstances, I see no reason for holding an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the paying order, in the issuing of which he is concerned, was forged and that the money was paid to a person other than the person to whom the paying order was to be issued?  If these facts are true, will the Minister not hold a sworn inquiry into the <Col N="1703" /> circumstances surrounding that transaction? It was alleged in open court that a public servant forged a citizen's signature to an instrument governing public money.  Surely, under these circumstances, the Minister should inquire into what happened.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health when he expects that the hospital building and extension scheme for Dublin City will be under way; and whether he will consider taking steps to co-ordinate supplies of building material and labour in consultation with representatives of builders' suppliers, contractors, organised labour and manufacturers with a view to avoiding delays and unnecessary rises in the cost of the works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that in certain parts of the country the established fairs sometimes fall on a bank or public holiday; and if, as such fairs cannot be postponed, he will make an order permitting the shops in such areas which are required to be closed to open for business on such days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, and the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, <Col N="1704" /> provide that certain specified days, or certain other days which may by order be substituted therefor, shall be public holidays for the purposes of the Acts. Those purposes relate to the holidays to be allowed to members of the staffs of shops and to the closing of shops on the weekly half-holiday, but there is no provision in either Act which of itself will require that any shop shall be closed on any public holiday.  The holiday provisions of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, take cognizance of the fact that certain types of shops are normally open on public holidays and members of the staffs of such shops get additional leave.  In the case of shops not falling within that category, it is provided that where a member of the staff is not allowed a whole holiday on a public holiday, he shall be allowed an alternative whole holiday within 14 days. No question arises, therefore, of the making of an order permitting shops in any particular area to open for business on a public holiday which is also a fair day for that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether in view of the damages recovered against licensed, seed dealers in Éire by farmers whose crops of Red Marvel wheat had failed, and of the decision by the arbitrator appointed by the Agricultural Seed, Trade Association adverse to these seed dealers, he will compensate them for the losses they have sustained in carrying out the recommendations of his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The restrictions on the importantion of wheat imposed by the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts render it necessary for a person importing seed wheat to obtain a permit to do so from the Department of Agriculture. A dealer importing seed wheat for resale is not doing so for the purpose of carrying out any recommendations of the Department, but as a business transaction for his own profit involving the usual trade risks and obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To secure, as far as possible, that importers would meet their obligations to farmers purchasing seed wheat, it was made a condition of every permit <Col N="1707" /> that the importer would purchase, by name, any seed wheat imported by him and would invoice it by the name by which it was purchased.</P>
    <P>If, in making his purchases, any trader binds himself to a form of arbitration and thereby risks a decision such as that mentioned in the Deputy's question, no responsibility for the consequences attaches to my Department, nor am I prepared to consider compensating such a trader for any loss he may thereby suffer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that he urged the people of this country to sow Red Marvel wheat, and that, consequent upon that recommendation, certain seed dealers anxious to co-operate with his policy imported true Red Marvel wheat?  When this wheat was sown it became manifest&mdash; as every intelligent agriculturist in the world already knew&mdash;that Red Marvel wheat was not a spring seed wheat for this climate and, accordingly, the crops did not ripen.  People sued the sellers of the wheat because the crops did not ripen, the seed not being proper spring seed wheat, to recover against them, and when that went to the arbitrator under the Corn Producers' Association of Great Britain, his comment was that the Minister for Agriculture in Éire had reduced farming to the level of dog racing or horse racing, in inducing the farmers to take the risk involved in sowing Red Marvel wheat as a spring wheat.  In the light of these facts, will not the Minister squarely face his responsibility, and indemnify these unfortunate men for the immense losses they suffered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether it is his intention to base the pensions of national teachers who retired between the 1st April, 1934, and 1st April, 1938, on their full salary and not on the salary less the cut of 5 per cent., which was restored on the 1st April, 1938; and, if so, when he proposes to introduce the necessary financial resolution to give effect to that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is it not true that only a few hundred men and women, <Col N="1710" /> all elderly persons, are affected by this cut in their pensions, and that it amounts in no case to more than £10 a year; that its restoration would create a rapidly diminishing charge, and that the failure to restore this wretchedly small sum will establish a deep sense of grievance amongst a very restricted class of persons?  In the light of these facts, would the Minister not consider doing this act of grace in respect of the few teachers who retired in those two or three critical years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, the Government take the position that to do what the Deputy asks would involve a change in principle, because the recent increase of 5 per cent. in the salaries and allowances of national teachers was granted in view of the changed economic conditions since 1934, and it is not to be regarded as a restoration of the cut imposed by the settlement of that year.  Therefore, there is no question, in our view, of any modification in the present method of calculating pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the situation that a cut of 5 per cent. was made for one reason some years ago, and that, technically for an entirely different reason, 5 per cent. was given back some months ago?  The net result of that is that those who resigned between those two dates have suffered a cut in their pensions which no other teachers who resign will have to suffer.  Though you may explain the principle, it affects this miserably small body of men.  As a pure act of grace, could we not give it to them and specifically reserve the principle?  Let us specifically reserve the principle in making the act of grace and point out it is not an admission of principle, and I feel sure that neither the teachers' organisation nor anybody else will seek to quote it as a precedent if the Minister will consider that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed the view that the Government, if they were to do this, would be admitting the principle that the cuts imposed in connection with the pension settlement of 1934 have been restored.  We <Col N="1711" /> are not prepared to admit that principle. I have already informed the representatives of the teachers' organisation that that is the position, and I have nothing further to add to what I have already said.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Financial Resolution No. 1.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want shortly to raise a point in connection with this Resolution and I want to make it quite clear that I am not trying to make a propaganda speech nor am I suggesting to the Minister for Finance that it is fiscally possible to put into operation the matter to which I wish to refer <Col N="1713" /> forthwith.  But I would be interested to hear the Revenue view on this question for it is one that has often occurred to me.  Under the income-tax code, we levy income-tax on citizens who earn a certain income, and then, in respect of their family responsibilities, we proceed to give them substantial remissions.  In respect of each additional member of the family we make an additional remission.  That may be regarded as a remission of taxation or as a State contribution to the maintenance of that family.  This much is true that, as that taxpayer's family burdens grow larger the State comes further and further to his aid. A man may start out as a young married man with £400 a year.  The day after his wedding day he is liable for a certain measure of income-tax.  If he lives to have a family of six children and his salary does not increase, he will pay no income-tax.  Therefore, as his family responsibilities are gathering, the State comes further and further to his aid and eventually discharges him from all liability.  Now, look at the other end of the social ladder.  You take a labouring man who is earning £2 a week.  He marries. The day after he marries he still has £2 a week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the Financial Resolution dealing with the rebate of income-tax for persons of property.  I am putting this point-a person who marries, and at the time is earning £2 a week, finds himself by the time he is the father of six children still with £2 a week.  He finds that the State has done nothing at all to share his family burden.  I am not pretending that that is a reflection on the Fianna Fáil Government, the Fine Gael Government, the British Government, or any other Government.  But I would like to hear the Revenue answer to that dilemma. It seems to me that a case can be made &mdash;it may be a fallacious case&mdash;that the State should concern itself to share the family burden of a man who married who was earning £2 a week.  The State concerns itself in sharing the family burden of a man with £400 a year, and <Col N="1714" /> who got married on that income, but does nothing at all to share the burden of a person who it was admitted should not be made liable to any tax at all at the time he married.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I would like to get from the Minister in connection with this duty which is imposed from the 19th May to the 1st November is&mdash;are non-fabricated steel and iron, free of duty?  Fabricated steel will be subject to a duty of 50 per cent. and a preferential rate of 33? per cent.  Now, the effective duty on the non-fabricated steel coming from Great Britain is obviously 33? per cent. After the 1st November non-fabricated steel in Ireland will be subject to 37½ per cent. duty, with a preference rate of 25 per cent.  Fabricated steel and iron would be subject to 50 per cent., with a preference of 33? per cent. I am informed that the effective difference between the duty on non-fabricated and fabricated steel and iron of British manufacture is 8? per cent., and that as far as that particular concession is concerned it will materially affect quite a number of firms in this business in Dublin.  I do not know that there are firms concerned with it in other parts of the country.  Apart from that question, I <Col N="1717" /> think it is presumed that there is a 15 per cent. duty on fabricated steel, with 10 per cent. perference, through the former period.  I have not been able to find that particular imposition.  I wonder if the Minister knows anything about it?  In any case, so far as this duty is concerned, the position would appear to be very much against any possible activity on Irish manufacture and that the alterations that are made are entirely outside that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty on fabricated steel at the moment is 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, with a preference of 33?. That is a reduction upon the duty previously in force and is in consequence of the changes arising out of the Trade Agreement with Great Britain.  In the ordinary course the duty of 33? per cent. would appear to be sufficient protection for firms engaged in the business of fabricating steel.  The duty imposed by this Resolution will not come into operation until the 1st November next.  When it does come into operation it is to be hoped that the various classes of unfabricated steel to which it applies will not be imported but will be available from Saorstát sources and at a price which will still allow an adequate protection to the firms engaged in the fabrication of that steel under the existing duty.  If firms concerned can in that case show that there are certain circumstances operating which make the duty ineffective, or at any rate will not enable them to secure a reasonable proportion of the trade here, then the matter can be considered. We have already had representations from the firms interested in the matter, and we have asked them to submit their representations in detail so that the matter can be examined carefully.  But until they have done so, I do not think any action is called for.  No change in the existing circumstances will take place until this duty comes into operation in November.  In the meantime these fabrication firms have the assistance of the 50 per cent. duty, with the 33? per cent. preferential rate in the case of Great Britain.  I think that they will find that duty will still be sufficient when the Irish steel becomes <Col N="1718" /> available, but if that is not the case, then the matter can be considered again.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say whether, under this proposed alteration, Continental steel which came in here free of duty, will come in subject to a 37½ per cent. duty?  In that case, with that extra charge on the raw steel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>You must take into account what the price of the raw materials will be.  If the Irish firms are put into competition with the British and Continental firms, they will be suffering a great disadvantage.  It is on that particular aspect that I would like the Minister to give information to the House.  I would like to know if he can give any information regarding the price of the raw material to be produced by the Irish firms. While it may benefit one particular activity of industrial development in one direction, it ought not to be at the expense of firms that have been a long time in business and that know every aspect of the business within recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to give the Deputy definite information until manufacture has commenced.  I know of no reason why it should not be possible to manufacture this steel here at the same price as that at which it can be imported from Great Britain. If that should prove not to be the case, if there should be an increase in cost, that fact will have to be taken into consideration in determining the protection to be given to the firms engaged in fabricating that steel.  It is essential <Col N="1719" /> to these firms and to the firm that will be making the raw material that the protection on fabricated steel should be adequate.  If, after the 1st November, it can be shown to be insufficient in the circumstances then prevailing, the matter can be dealt with.  But no change is called for at the moment that I am aware of&mdash;that is, subject to whatever representations may be made to me by firms in consequence of the discussions they have already had with the officers of my Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister will concede that as far as Continental raw steel is concerned, it can be imported free of duty, but on November 1st it will be subject to 37½ per cent., and British steel to 33?.  If those firms have been using Continental steel, they are obviously going to pay a considerably increased price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister overlooked a very important part. What are the fabricators of steel to do when they are tendering in the meantime? I take it there is some object in putting a duty on raw steel.  The Minister appears to be hinting, although he has not said it, that the price will not be increased; in other words, the price to the fabricators will be the one price as if no duty existed.  It is elemental that the price to the fabricators will be the world price, plus the duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, I think, almost a law.  What is the fabricator to do in the meantime when asked for a tender?  He is faced with this situation, that he will have to pay 37½ per cent. more for the foreign steel that he has been buying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I submit to the Deputy that the firm engaged in importing and fabricating its material is in a much better position.  In this case we have adopted the unusual practice of postponing the operation of the duty to a fixed date six months ahead. That enables those interested to make arrangements with their customers in the clear knowledge of what is going to happen.  If they contract for a supply of Continental or British steel fabricated after the 1st November, it means they have to import the material before that date.  If they choose to wait-until after that date, they know precisely the circumstances that will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained only part of the matter.  He does not realise that the fabricator's purse or storage capacity is not unlimited. The Minister says, &ldquo;Let him get in anything he wants after the 1st November, before the 1st November, and he will not have to pay any duty on it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said anything he has contracted to supply, which is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>His purse is not unlimited, and one type of steel may be required for one job and another type for a second job.  For the sake of argument let us take, on the Minister's showing, two fabricators, A and B. They are tendering for two jobs.  A thinks he will get one job and he brings in the steel that he thinks will suit.  B thinks he will get the other job and he orders the steel for it.  When the tenders come along the position is reversed.  It is absurd to think that the fabricators have not got at the present time to envisage the position that will occur on 1st November, namely, that they will require steel of a particular <Col N="1721" /> type and that is to be 37½ per cent. dearer.  I would ask the Minister to look into that position immediately because that is the fabricator's difficulty. He cannot tender for a job without covering himself.  He finds that he may have to pay 37½ per cent. more for his foreign steel.  That position is going to put him out of business as regards the finished product, because the British finished product can be imported with a duty of 33? per cent.  Now, nobody would think of accusing the British manufacturers who are engaged in steel fabrication of being inefficient or anything like that.  They have the latest machinery, they have cheaper wages and a whole category of cheaper expenses, and the position is that the market is practically being handed over to them with this in the offing.  If this is going to give any effect, the day of the fabricator here is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be quite certain that that is not going to happen.  Why should we establish a steel mill here if we are going to allow in fabricated steel?  Common-sense shows that that is not going to happen. If the duty is not sufficient to exclude fabricated steel and to provide a market for Irish fabricated steel, then both will be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I should like to suggest that it looks as if arithmetic would come before common-sense in appealing to the Government, and the arithmetic is on the side of the fabricators, if they see their raw materials increase by 37½ per cent.  The Minister says that if that happens, we will see to it, but how are we going to see to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not happen.  It cannot happen.  The Deputy is assuming that, if a duty of 37½ per cent. is imposed, the price of the local commodity is bound to be 37½ per cent. above existing prices.  That is what <Col N="1722" /> the Deputy generally seems to assume. That will not happen, however.  Whatever increase there may be, it will not be 37½ per cent.; it would be considerably less.  If, however, there is an increase, and if it is of such an amount as to make 33? per cent., an ineffective protection for the steel fabricators, then that 33? per cent. will have to be increased; but they have got to show that protection to that extent is insufficient, and they have not done so yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask just this question.  The Minister says that he awaits the arrival of the fabricators of steel to convince him that it is necessary to raise the tariff on fabricated steel in order to protect them when they are using raw steel of Irish manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Or any steel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or any other steel. Quite.  Well, I do not think we need doubt that there will be a deputation around pretty soon in that connection. but when the Minister was contemplating the establishment of the raw steel industry, did he address his mind to this aspect of the question at all? Will the establishment of the raw steel industry operate to raise the cost of fabricated steel so high in this country that it may substantially reduce the consumption of fabricated steel in this country and eventually complete a vicious circle which would react unfavourably on the steel fabricator and on the manufacturer of raw steel whom it is proposed to encourage to set up in Haulbowline?  The reason I ask that is that it appears to me, from what the Minister has said here to-day, that he has never addressed his mind to the picture of the steel industry. from the raw product down to the finished product, and eventually into consumption.  I suggest that, where immense sums of capital are going to be invested. such a review ought to be <Col N="1724" /> made so as to ensure that there will be no loss of capital owing to something that was not foreseen or anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1937" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what has been said, one would like to ask what is the differential as between the fabricator in England, Scotland, Wales or the Continent and the Irish manufacturer.  There was a difference of 60 per cent. in his favour in selling his product.  Time and time again in this House we have been told that a certain firm has closed, and it has been imputed, as it was again imputed to-day in general terms, that such closing down is due to the wage differential.  There is not a word of truth in that.  They get the same rate as in England, Scotland and Wales generally&mdash;the Clyde rate of wages&mdash; and in some cases lower than in certain areas in Scotland.  Generally speaking, however, in connection with steel fabricating, it is the same rate of wages as the English rate.  Now, as we are talking about raw steel, what is it?  It is the ores before they are thrown together, and the price for the raw steel is there for anybody to examine.  Added to that, there is the freight charge, which is 8 per cent. In some cases it is 10 per cent., and some say 15 per cent.  I am sure that Deputy Dockrell can give the actual percentage.  The wage is the same and therefore the only difficulty in connection with the Irish manufacturer is that the plant is antiquated. The dockyard, however, did not close because they had not got sufficient plant or because of the wages question, but because of the rationalisation policy of those who control the yard and because they were only using this yard as a weapon in their own hands against their competitors.  I say that there is sufficient tax on that steel now if the people would carry out their business in a business-like way.

In fixing that, we were providing for possible future capital expenditure.  Capital expenditure to date has been £266,000, and then it is estimated that before the appointed day there will be a further expenditure on capital account of £4,000, and, as I informed the Dáil on Second Reading, it is proposed to capitalise the excess cost on the first year's working, the interest on the capital for the first year, and the royalties which are payable to the firm that has given the Government technical advice in relation to the industry, which are payable over a period of four years; and also to provide working capital of £30,000.  That brings the present figure for capital expenditure of £266,000 up to £356,000. That company has been formed with a nominal capital of £500,000, because it was anticipated that further capital expenditure may arise, although we are not in a position at the moment to say that it will arise, because no decision to go beyond the £266,000 has been taken.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Industrial Alcohol Bill, 1938&mdash;Committee.</Title>
    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;industrial alcohol&rdquo; means ethyl alcohol, whether denatured or not, which has been distilled or rectified to a strength of not less than forty degrees overproof by a process other than the pot still process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 30, to delete the word &ldquo;forty&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;fifty-five.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the original Bill the expression &ldquo;industrial alcohol&rdquo; was defined as meaning ethyl alcohol, whether denatured or not, which has been distilled or rectified to a strength of not less than 55 degrees overproof.  That strength has been reduced to 40 degrees in the Bill before us now, and, though this matter was raised on the Second Stage, we could not get from the Minister <Col N="1731" /> what appeared to be a fully satisfactory explanation of the change.  We, therefore, afford him by this amendment an opportunity of giving us a somewhat more detailed explanation of why it was deemed expedient to lower the proof in the definition of &ldquo;industrial alcohol.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression&mdash;apparently, a wrong impression&mdash; that I had given an adequate and most lucid explanation.  The strength was fixed at 55 degrees above proof in the original Bill in order to exclude the possibility of whiskey distillers requiring a licence under it.  We were informed by the Revenue Commissioners that whiskey distillers occasionally distil whiskey slightly above 50 degrees overproof.  By fixing the figure at 55, we placed ourselves in a position whereby only one firm, other than the industrial alcohol factories, would require a licence&mdash;the Cork Yeast Company.  Now, however, we think we can exclude the whiskey distillers by inserting the words &ldquo;other than the pot-still process&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;agricultural alcohol.&rdquo; By bringing the strength down to 40 degrees overproof, we secure to the industrial alcohol factories the manufacture of industrial alcohol used in certain commercial process by manufacturing chemists in the production of perfumes.  The manufacture of that spirit in our factories would, in our opinion, be a profitable sideline to the main activities of the company.  That is the main reason why the change is being made.  The effect of the change is to secure that the degree of control for which the Bill provides over the manufacture and use of industrial alcohol will apply to all forms of industrial alcohol.  We have retained the position by which a distiller will not require a licence and the only other firm which is likely to require a licence would, in any event, under the earlier definition, with a higher definition, require it.  The idea is to secure that industrial alcohol used for commercial purposes will be brought within the definition so that the possibility of selling that alcohol will be secured to this company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what relation industrial alcohol bears to that type of alcohol normally consumed as whiskey, gin or brandy, but the Minister might tell us now what proof the stuff will be which it is proposed to sell to the people who will actually mix it through the petrol.  Is there any ideal proof at which that should be done?  So far as I am aware, if you distil alcohol, you can reduce the proof by adding water to it.  If I want to reduce whiskey which is delivered at 40 degrees overproof to the statutory level at which it is normally sold for consumption&mdash;24 degrees under-proof&mdash;I add a certain calculated amount of distilled water to the whiskey.  I cannot see how it can make much difference to the alcohol factories at what proof they produce the alcohol.  What is relevant is the proof at which they will sell the alcohol at the fixed price.  The Minister has told us that he expects the Industrial Alcohol Company to sell industrial alcohol at 3/- a gallon. When he says that, does he mean that that will be industrial alcohol of 43 degrees overproof?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise any difficulties.  I differ profoundly from the Minister as to this industrial alcohol project, but let us get down to the technicalities of the question.  We are to have industrial alcohol of 40 degrees over-proof.  It has been represented to the Minister that that will be sold to the petrol companies at 3/- and he has given his approval to that proposal.  We do not know at what proof it is going to be sold.  If industrial alcohol is identical with whiskey, gin or rum, you would reduce that industrial alcohol to proof by adding spring water to it.  Does the Minister understand from the Industrial Alcohol Company that they are going to sell industrial alcohol to the petrol-mixers at proof, or at what degree <Col N="1733" /> over-proof, because, until he knows that, he does not know what proportion of the commodity they are going to get 3/- a gallon for will consist of spring water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum amount of water which can be in the alcohol is .2 of 1 per cent. 99.8 per cent. of what is supplied must be pure alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in this difficulty that if I were reducing whiskey 15 degrees, it would take far more than .8 per cent. of volume to reduce it.  You have by definition reduced industrial alcohol from 55 degrees overproof to 40 degrees overproof.  If it is possible to produce industrial alcohol at 55 degrees over-proof, industrial alcohol at 40 degrees overproof has <i>prima facie</i> a large percentage of distilled water.  Does the Minister propose to raise the proof of that distilled alcohol before it is sold to the mixers and, if so, to what proof is it going to be raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition has nothing to do with the strength of the alcohol to be produced in the factories and sold to petrol consumers.  The only form in which industrial alcohol could be used for motor purposes is as absolute alcohol.  It is desirable there should be no water whatever, and, in fact, the only margin allowed is the very small one I have indicated; but if the Deputy will study the Bill, he will see that certain restrictions are placed upon the purchase of industrial alcohol by anybody in the country.  The reason this definition of industrial alcohol is inserted is in connection with these provisions in the Bill, and it is designed to secure that industrial alcohol used for commercial purposes and which may, and does, contain a high percentage of water will nevertheless come subject to these provisions so that a market will be secured for these factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So these factories are intended to produce two separate articles. One is alcohol unadulterated with any water, so far as it is humanly possible, and the other industrial alcohol for chemical purposes which will be sold at a certain ascertained proof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they have given the Minister no particular undertaking in regard to the price which will be charged for the industrial alcohol which is to be used by the chemists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is subject to control, but the Deputy can take it that industrial alcohol used for commercial purposes of that kind is generally sold at a higher price than we will be charging the petrol distributors.  The average price, if my memory is correct, is well over 3/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is going to be a most extraordinary position.  If you are going to require these people to sell absolute alcohol at 3/- a gallon and then permit them to add, by volume, 20 per cent. of pure water and authorise them to charge substantially more for that water and alcohol than is charged for the pure alcohol, a most extraordinary situation arises, which, I think, requires careful consideration. I have at least directed the Minister's attention to that aspect of the position.</P>
      <P>The second question that arises on this definition is this: Let us assume that this company is going to deliver to the petrol mixers industrial alcohol, or, as defined by the Minister, pure alcohol.  Can the Minister tell us now if it is true that while it is possible to construct a highly efficient petrol engine, and while it is possible to construct a highly efficient alcohol engine, it is not possible to construct a highly efficient engine that will burn both fuels?  If you insist on the consumer in this country burning pure alcohol&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you insist on forcing the consumer here to use petrol which <Col N="1735" /> contains a considerable percentage of industrial alcohol in an engine which was constructed for the combustion of petrol, the resultant wear and tear on that engine will be substantially increased.  That is a matter of fact.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that Deputy Dillon has the experience of several of the most important countries in the world on which to base a conclusion with regard to this matter?  It was pointed out in the debate on the British Budget, for instance, that the consumption of industrial alcohol in England by motorists has risen from less than 200,000 gallons in 1931 to 8,000,000 in the current year.  In Italy there is a 15 per cent. mixture.  The Deputy knows that the French engineers are not altogether contemptible in the world of engineering and since it was discovered French motorists have been using industrial alcohol as a blend.  Of course, he knows that that is the case in Germany, too, to the extent of 10 or 12 per cent., so that why our Minister <Col N="1737" /> should go to all this suggested trouble I do not know.  As the Minister has remarked, it is admitted that for aeroplane engines it has a high octane quality&mdash;do not ask me what octane means&mdash;and for ordinary motors it is supposed to be a strong anti-knock spirit.  Altogether so far from there being any disadvantage, there is an advantage to motorists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this point on the Second Reading, and I am sure the Minister has a very satisfactory explanation, but to me it does look strange that moneys which arise from an enterprise of this kind, an enterprise which is altogether apart from the ordinary work of the Government, should be paid into the general Exchequer and used as ordinary revenue.  The same question arises under Section 13, sub-section (2).  I would imagine that it would give a false idea of revenue, for instance, if in the receipts issued by the Minister for Finance from time to time, there is included any substantial sum from such a source as that, seeing that those moneys are not really general Government moneys at all, but are altogether exceptional, and are not intended to have anything to do with the ordinary activities of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the matter arises on this section, whatever about any other.  This section provides that the Minister for Finance may lend a sum not exceeding £1,500 to the company to defray its formation expenses, and that whatever money is repaid to the Minister for Finance will be put into the Exchequer.  I do not know what else we should do with it.  The money is going from revenue, and going back into the Central Fund of the State in the ordinary way.  There is no question here of realising an asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is repayment of moneys advanced for a capital purpose, for a purpose altogether outside <Col N="1738" /> the ordinary activities of the Government. Such a repayment is to appear in the accounts of the Government as an ordinary receipt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not realise the difference between capital and current expenditure.  This does not strike him as incongruous at all.  His solution of those problems is that you mix them all up together; you borrow and you tax, and whenever you have a deficit you call the deficit capital expenditure, and borrow for it.  At the end of the year, when you find you have borrowed too much, you call it a revenue surplus, and have three cheers at a public meeting at College Green.  Of course, Deputy Moore is perfectly right.  This money is issuing forth from the Treasury for a capital purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and as capital expenditure, expenditure in regard to which the Minister for Finance would put his hand upon his heart and say &ldquo;No one will challenge my right to borrow for this item of expenditure in as much as it is clearly a capital sum.&rdquo;  But suppose he borrowed this, as he might legitimately do on the representation that it was a capital expenditure, Deputy Moore points out that under the terms of this Bill that will come <Col N="1739" /> trickling back into the Treasury as a casual receipt, and appear as revenue, to be used as revenue&mdash;a thoroughly unsound practice.  But as it amounts only to £1,500, and as the Minister for Finance has been doing this in respect of millions for the last six years, why Deputy Moore should start tossing on his peaceful pillow now I cannot imagine.  He has slept sweetly through this performance for six Budgets.  Why the industrial alcohol Bill should start him off I cannot imagine, and I sympathise with the Minister's display of embarrassment and dismay at this assault upon his flank.  But Deputy Moore is right.</P>

Did he ever in his wildest moments look forward to the day when he might make a mistake, when he might say something which was not correct or jump to a conclusion that was a wrong conclusion?  There is a very rude awakening waiting for him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But he is not quite so clever as he thinks he is.  Perhaps if he takes the trouble to study in the Official Reports the remarks he has just made he will realise that this long anticipated error of judgment, this one mistake against which he has been training himself all his life, has happened at last.  He is wrong.  We have in this country the practice of maintaining a Central Fund into which all revenue from all sources is paid and out of which all expenses for all purposes are met.  In other countries they have a Capital Fund.  They keep a separate fund into which and out of which purely revenue receipts and <Col N="1740" /> revenue expenses are paid, and a Capital Fund for the purposes of which the Minister for Finance borrows, and which is used for the purpose of defraying capital expenditure as authorised by law.  That does not happen to be the practice here.  But in this particular case it would not matter.  The transaction under this section will be completed well within the financial year.  The advancing of £1,500 to defray the formation expenses of this company, and the repayment of that amount, will all occur within a very short period.  Consequently it is not necessary to go into deep financial theories, however entertaining they may be to Deputy Dillon, in order to understand precisely what this section means.  Deputy Moore's point would probably arise in another connection.  I think if he studies the financial statement made by the Minister for Finance this year he will find that a very large part of it dealt with that precise matter, and justified my preference for the practice of this State as compared with others.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 1, page 5, to delete the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to reduce the limit beyond which the Minister may not go without coming back to Parliament for further authority. Under Section 10, sub-section (2), the total amount which may be expended by the Minister for Finance in the acquisition of shares of the company shall not exceed £500,000, less the nominal value of the shares to be issued to him under the next following section.  It appears to us from the figures afforded by the Minister for Industry and Commerce so far in the course of the debate that a sufficient sum for the present would be £300,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we would be prepared to meet the Minister in that matter if an additional £56,000 would meet his point of view, but we object to leaving in his hands&mdash;or indeed in the hands of any Minister&mdash;the right to commit the State to an expenditure of a further £150,000 without coming back to this House with some kind of a report on the progress of the enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that these amendments were drawn before the Money Resolution was discussed and that we had to arrive at as good an approximation of the figures as we could get.  The Minister says that this leaves him £56,000 short.  Is he sure of that?  Because the amount provided for in sub-section (3) of Section 10 is governed by Section 11, and the Minister is to receive shares in respect of the money that he has paid to the company for &ldquo;the acquisition of any land, easement, <i>profit á prendre</i>, or other right, the construction of distilleries, rectifying plants and other necessary works and the purchase of machinery, plant and equipment.&rdquo;  Those purposes having been financed by the Minister, the Minister is entitled to transfer the assets to the company and, on his certificate, <Col N="1742" /> to get shares issued to him.  That represents £266,000 of the sum of £356,000 to which the Minister referred. Therefore the Minister will have allotted to him £266,000 in shares at once.  Section 10 operates to give him the right to subscribe for £234,000 in addition to that.  Our amendment would restrict him to subscribing for only £44,000 in excess of that allocation of shares.  He told us that the amount required for working capital was £30,000.  That would leave him a surplus of £14,000 over the actual requirements of working capital for such other incidentals as he mentioned.  Will that not meet the Minister's requirements?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is much wiser to fix the nominal capital of the company, that is the total amount the Minister for Finance may invest in the shares of the company, at a figure reasonably in excess of the known requirements.  It is known that the Minister will have to get under Section 11 shares to the value of the capital expenditure already incurred.  Furthermore, the company will be in immediate need of additional capital, the total amount of the expenditure to date, and the immediate capital needs for working capital required being, as I said, £356,000.  It is not likely that any substantial additional capital expenditure beyond that will be undertaken immediately.  Some minor capital expenditure may be required, but if a substantial expansion in the capital expenditure of the company should be contemplated, then it will be necessary to come to the Minister for Finance, and the Minister will have to come to the Dáil.  There is no taking away of the powers of the Dáil here, because the Minister for Finance has no money for the purpose unless the Dáil makes that money available and, consequently, the Dáil will have an opportunity of expressing its opinion on the matter at any time.  But, even if the money were voted by the Dáil, the amount invested in the shares of the company could not exceed £500,000 without an amendment of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why, for example, we should make provision in this Bill for payment of interest on the money.  Assuming the Minister puts £500,000 into it, portion of the provision which the Minister announced to us this evening was to pay interest.  There is an ample sum allowed in the £300,000, with the £30,000 for working capital, and £4,000 for such expenditure as the Minister indicated.  If further money is required what is the objection to coming to the Dáil for it instead of getting a blank cheque for the whole sum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a blank cheque up to £500,000, of which £356,000 is to meet capital expenditure.  The margin is the difference between them.  That is not an unreasonable margin to allow in the case of a commercial enterprise of this kind.  We cannot have a commercial enterprise of this kind in the position that it cannot undertake any capital expenditure whatever without having further legislation promoted.  That would be involved if we were to limit the provision in Section 10 to the amount known to be necessary, the amount <Col N="1744" /> already expended or involved in the immediate operations of the company. Some margin beyond that is required, and the margin suggested is, I think, not unreasonable if this enterprise is to be run with the same freedom of action that a commercial enterprise would require.  It seems to me that we would be better under this system than to work as we are working at present with everything being done by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and in his name, even though in practice he delegates his function to an advisory board.  That system has not proved satisfactory, and it is never likely to prove satisfactory, as the whole machinery of a Government Department is not suitable to running a commercial enterprise. That is why we are going away from that system to another system which will set up a company which will be as independent of the Government as any other company, apart from the fact that the Minister for Finance will be its only shareholder. We think that that company should be given precisely the same liberty which an ordinary commercial undertaking would have if it is to work successfully as we hope a commercial company would.</P>

      <P>The most the Minister can make a case for is £356,000, assuming there is to be no more capital development than at present.  The Act under which he has been operating up to date is the 1934 Act, I think, and his estimate of expenditure from that period amounts to £356,000.  That is the amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In these circumstances, we put it that this new company should not have, or any nominee of the Minister should not have £144,000 to play with or experiment with.  In fact, we consider that he <Col N="1745" /> would be supplied fairly well with £266,000, £30,000 as working capital and £4,000 in addition, and that when any further development is required we ought to hear about it.

The Dáil is asked to give too much money away even to the Minister's nominees in this case&mdash;to give £144,000, plus interest and royalties and everything else and to assume that the company will make no money.  If my recollection is correct, the Minister stated that we are in a position to make money from this industrial alcohol, selling it at 3/- per gallon.  I do not know whether they have charged that price up to this to petrol consumers but whatever price they have charged, I suppose they have made provision for a profit.  I do think that the Dáil ought not to give the Minister, or whatever officers he may have, more than this £356,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister changes his feet briskly.  When caught on one foot he slips lightly over to the other. He said that there was no necessity for alarm, no necessity for the amendment, because, while there was power to issue additional capital if this section passed in its present form, the Minister would have to come back to the Dáil before he could buy further shares, but Section 15 exonerates him from any such necessity.  Under Section 15 he can borrow money without further reference to the Dáil of any kind.  Say that we authorise the company to issue capital up to £500,000.  We authorise the Minister to borrow for investment in industrial alcohol.  Having subscribed that £500,000, the company can then proceed to borrow on debentures without limit.  There is no limit to its borrowing power under debenture, and the <Col N="1746" /> Minister has an unlimited power of guarantee.  They can borrow £1,000,000 under Section 14, and the Minister can guarantee it.  Is that not so?  Under Section 14:</P>
      <P>whenever the company proposes to issue any debentures the Minister for Finance may, if he thinks fit, guarantee in such manner and form as he may think proper the due payment by the company in accordance with the terms of such debentures of the principal moneys and interest secured by such debentures.</P>

      <P>If we pass this section in its present form we not only authorise the Minister for Finance to subscribe £500,000 to the shares of the company, but we also authorise him to borrow or pledge the State's credit on debentures to the tune of another £500,000.  Our modest proposal is that he should be restricted to subscribing £300,000 or that he should not pledge the State's credit for more than £300,000.  I think that is a very reasonable proposal.  We do not stickle over £50,000, if the Minister states that the arrangements and commitments already entered into make that addition absolutely vital.  Personally, to give up a penny to this enterprise greatly depresses me.  There is no use discussing that now, but if the Minister says that he has entered into commitments which makes the provision of £350,000 essential now, we would be prepared to assent to that. I think the Minister could limit himself to that amount, especially in view of the fact that under Section 15 everything we do now can be added to at a later stage.</P>

      <P>The key to the Deputy's whole attitude is contained in the sentence <Col N="1747" /> in which he said that he would not give a penny towards this enterprise. That is the difference between us.  The Deputy wants to see the enterprise destroyed.  We think it is a good and reasonable enterprise, and we think that the Minister for Finance should be authorised to advance £500,000 for this purpose.  We propose to ask the Dáil to do that.  It is obvious that we cannot possibly reconcile our points of view.  The Deputy wants the whole thing washed out. We think it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister for Finance to provide up to £500,000 for the purposes of this enterprise.  We are telling the Dáil that the immediate capital requirements do not amount to that figure. They amount to £356,000, which includes £30,000 for working capital.  In fact, the total capital expenditure is less, but we are proposing to capitalise the items which I mentioned&mdash;the royalties paid to Messrs.  Noury and van der Lande, the interest on capital for the first working year, and the excess in the working costs for the first working year.  Perhaps the items may be grouped together, because they represent in a sense the same thing. The price of the product was fixed at 3/- per gallon.  That price is sufficient to cover the whole of the cost of production, and includes provision for the payment of interest on the capital advanced by the Minister for Finance in respect of shares in the case of the new company.  The working costs, however, were in excess of 3/- per gallon for the first year.  The year was not complete.  Some of the factories were only working for a very small part of the season; consequently the expenses were much higher than in a normal working year, but we believe that it would be possible to sell profitably at that figure in a full working year.  By selling at that figure for the first year, a loss was incurred, and that is being capitalised.  The capitalisation of that loss, plus the capitalisation of the efficiency and interest payments on the amount advanced for the first year, amount, as I have said, to £26,000 or two sums of £13,000.  In addition, we are capitalising the royalty payments. We think it is unreasonable to charge <Col N="1748" /> against the price of the product the bulk sum we have to pay for technical knowledge we had not got.  We think that it is more reasonable to capitalise that sum and charge it against the whole enterprise.  These two items of £13,000, plus the £30,000 royalty payment, plus the sum of £4,000, which represents capital expenditure not already incurred, plus the £30,000 required for working capital, plus capital expenditure, brings the total sum required to date up to £365,000.  Their requirements may, however, increase, and we think it is not unreasonable to propose that the Minister should be authorised to advance beyond that £300,000 up to a limit of £500,000 without having to come for new legislation.</P>

      <P>I invite the Deputy to rise in righteous wrath again and point out to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that by whatever quibble he scrambled out of the difficulty under Section 8 he cannot escape it here, because here the Minister can borrow money to buy shares and, having borrowed money to buy shares, he can then sell the shares to any purchaser and bring the money into revenue and use it as ordinary revenue.  The Minister may acquire £500,000 worth of shares, partly under Section 11 and partly under Section 10.  He may arrive close to the end of his financial year with one of his customary deficits, and it may suit his political hand to emerge triumphantly with a surplus, whereupon he can resort to one of the many large funds under his command and sell the shares in the Industrial Alcohol Company to one of those funds and arrive triumphantly at the end of the year with a surplus of receipts of £500,000, and devote all that money to defraying what would normally be a substantial deficit on his Budget.  What has Deputy Moore to say to that?  Come, now, Deputy Moore.  Deputy Moore is a gallant campaigner in the cause of righteous finance.  I cannot imagine that he has been so completely cowed by the Minister's observations a few moments ago that there is not a yap in him now.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy suggest what should go in there?  What would have to go in there would be something which would involve the creation of some separate fund other than the Central Fund, and I do not know that the Deputy will find that many experts in public finance would agree that that is sound policy.  I think that the deputy, if he examines the record of the administration of the public finances of this State for the past six years, will find that the rules of orthodoxy have not been departed from very often.  The Deputy spoke about our &ldquo;customary deficit.&rdquo;  I think if the Party opposite were alive to their business they would find much more effective ground for criticising the Government in the fact that the surplus each year has been too large.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the company proposes to issue any debentures the Minister <Col N="1753" /> for Finance may, if he thinks fit, guarantee in such manner and form as he may think proper, the due payment by the company in accordance with the terms of such debentures of the principal moneys and interest secured by such debentures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 41, to delete the words &ldquo;if he thinks fit&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;with the prior consent of each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to restrict the Minister from multiplying the rights of subscription to the share capital of this company by two without coming back to the House, and requires the Minister if he is going to guarantee the debentures for this company to come back to the House for authority to do so.  I think that is a reasonable proposal.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has founded his case all along during this discussion on the contention that £500,000 provides an ample margin for every contingency that can be foreseen at the present time and that he does not at the moment foresee any contingency which will require the use of all that money, but he likes to have the knowledge that it is there if a contingency should arise.</P>
      <P>Section 14, as at present drafted, provides not only the margin included in £500,000, but £500,000 on top of that again without any further reference to the Oireachtas.  My amendment does no more than require, in the event of his having to spend a full £500,000 in subscribing for capital, that he will have to go back to Dáil Eireann and inform them of his intention to guarantee debentures of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to that nor would any provision of this kind have any precedent.  This is not the first Bill; this is only one of many designed to set up companies under the auspices of this State or to authorise <Col N="1754" /> the Minister for Finance to invest in the shares of companies.  Consequently this Bill is in standard form.  I do not think we have ever had it suggested in relation to any of the many Bills which preceded this for the establishment of companies for one purpose or another that a provision of this kind should be inserted, nor do I think it desirable, on the face of it, that we should have the affairs of a commercial enterprise subject to public discussion upon every occasion upon which additional capital expenditure has to be undertaken by it. I cannot agree to the amendment.  I think we have got to give this company a fair chance.  I do not think we should allow Deputy Dillon's hostility to it to induce us to so cripple it that it is desirable that an enterprise in which the State is interested should be run not by a Government Department, but by a company established upon the lines of an ordinary commercial undertaking, then they have got to facilitate that line of development by ensuring that these commercial companies will have the liberty of action and the possibility of success which a privately-owned company would have.  If the Deputies want to get rigid control by the Legislature over all the commercial activities and undertakings of this kind the way to do it is to maintain the present position under which the Minister for Industry and Commerce runs the show and not a company set up in the manner contemplated by this Bill.  I do not think they want to do that.  If they do, in relation to this particular enterprise, it is a departure from their usual policy in such matters.  They have always expressed the view, which I hold, that a State Department organised as the Department of Industry and Commerce is organised is not capable of running a purely commercial enterprise.  I know that the red tape and regulations necessary in a Government Department where public funds are being administered and every penny accounted for in a particular manner to the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is because of that we are proposing to transfer this enterprise from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a commercial company, but, if we do that, we must give that commercial company a reasonable prospect of success and not ring it round with restrictions and limitations such as the Deputy now proposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but they have got to go and make a case on the merits of their enterprise.  The Minister does not give them a general benediction, and indicate that there is a guarantee available for them without any question. The Minister does not give them an undertaking that the Government will always have their issues guaranteed. At this stage there is no question <Col N="1756" /> of the merits or the demerits of this enterprise.  Rotten as it is, our job is to make it as efficient as it can be made, in the knowledge that it is floated by this Parliament.  But in that set of circumstances we have got to adhere to the reasonable rules of prudence. It does not seem to me to be in accordance with the reasonable rules of prudence to authorise the Minister to provide a sum quite as much as that which the Minister for Industry and Commerce says represents the maximum that he can say is necessary, looking as far ahead as he is able to look.  I am not asking the Minister to put into this Bill a prohibition against issuing any further moneys to this company at all.  All I am asking is that if the Minister wants to put on the State a further liability of £500,000, that he would come back here and ask for it; that he would come and ask the consent of each House of the Oireachtas.  The Minister represents that attitude as striking a death blow at the whole enterprise.  His attitude is that it would be a death blow at the enterprise if Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, were to stand up here and say: &ldquo;I am about guaranteeing debentures for the industrial alcohol factories&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I quite understand Deputy Smith's position.  His spiritual home is Berlin.  But we have educated Deputy Smith in the past five years and we have also educated the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Deputy Smith has got some education in the last five years, and there is a <Col N="1757" /> hope that in the next 15 or 20 years we will almost civilise him.  Having educated the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the last five years, I do not despair that within the next ten years we will make him a good democrat.  At the same time, I do not expect the Minister to take kindly to the proposition that he will answer to the House for what he has to do. I do not expect that he will welcome the position in which, instead of guaranteeing these debentures on his own authority without any reference to the Oireachtas, he will stand up here and tell the most insignificant Deputy of this House what he proposes to do.  My amendment that the Minister is to get the prior consent of each House of the Oireachtas before <Col N="1758" /> guaranteeing any further debentures for this company is construed by the Minister as a dastardly attack on this industrial alcohol enterprise.  That is how the amendment looks to people with the Hitler mind.  To the ordinary man, to the ordinary mind, the proposition is one that is perfectly right and proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I always prefer to assume that he is peculiarly prone to falling into error.  As the Minister is aware, Votes are introduced here for general subsidies, giving the Minister a wide discretion as to how those moneys shall be allocated, and I see no reason why, under Section 20, he <Col N="1761" /> could not pay the subsidy out of moneys which had been voted by the Oireachtas under the general head of subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that I cannot remember for the moment, but I seem to remember that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a general authority to pay subsidies on industrial exports, for instance, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself determines which of those exports he shall pay a subsidy upon. There is a special Vote taken in this House every year, called &ldquo;Export Bounties and Subsidies.&rdquo;  It is No. 70 in the Book of Estimates.  The heading of that Estimate is &ldquo;An Estimate of the amount required in the year ending 31st March, 1939, for export bounties and subsidies.&rdquo;  There appears to me to be, in this heading, no restriction on the ambit of that Vote.  I cannot say what amount of that Vote was surrendered at the end of last year, but the sum appropriated was £2,242,010.  Whether there was any surrender at the end of the year or not I do not know, but I am quite satisfied that under sub-head F, which provides for bounties and subsidies on exports of potatoes and other agricultural products, and expenditure on trial consignments to external markets, or under a new sub-head, a provision might be made within the ambit of that Vote for a subsidy on industrial alcohol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, this is interesting, because I question that.  Suppose that you proceed to export some of this industrial alcohol.  Under the subheads that have been already opened, it would certainly be possible to pay a subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but, clearly, Section 20 would not be required in the Bill in that case.  If the Deputy is correct, Section 20 would not be required. Why do we have to put Section 20 in the Bill if we already have power to pay it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You may or you may not have power to pay on the export of industrial alcohol, but suppose that you do come to pay out the money, will you then have to come back to Dáil Eireann to give that money or will you turn to some cover-all Vote and get, out of it, the requisite money referred to in sub-section (2)?  I submit that that is possible, and I think it is a contingency which ought to be provided against, that, if the Minister proposes to pay subsidies to this company, a fresh proposal should be brought before Dáil Eireann.  Where are our liabilities in connection with this enterprise going to end?  We are going to subscribe, or have taken authority to subscribe, for £500,000 share capital and have taken authority to guarantee £500,000 debentures, and we are now asking authority to issue subsidies to this product.  At the same time, we have fixed the community with notice that we are going to authorise this company to collect the equivalent of £175,000 per annum in subsidy, in the price which they are going to charge for the industrial alcohol, which they are going to sell to the public.  Is not that so?  The Minister told us that he is going to sell a certain quantity of industrial alcohol at 3/-, to take the place of the petrol which can be purchased at 4d. <Col N="1763" /> That represents a subsidy of 2/8 a gallon on industrial alcohol.  Suppose we spend the £500,000 on shares and guarantee the debentures, it means that we are going to spend £1,000,000 for the purpose of purchasing a millstone of £175,000 per annum to hang around our necks.  I contend that, along with the plain and unadorned mill-stone of £175,000 a year around our necks, the Minister wants us to give him authority to hang a whole lot of little mill-stones on to the big mill-stone, whenever he wants to do so.  Surely, you have made a good enough bargain for that enterprise without adding this additional precaution? Surely you do not apprehend that, if you are going to collar 3/- a gallon, you will want any further financial assistance for this enterprise? If the Minister thinks that it is conceivable that any additional assistance should be required, he should tell us now, because it is nothing short of fraud to put this enterprise through Dáil Eireann on certain representations of maximum liability, and then, under cover of Section 20, to come back in 12 months' time and say &ldquo;We are now deeply committed, and we shall have to shoulder further liabilities if the enterprise is to be carried on.&rdquo; Either Section 20 is unnecessary or else it conceals an intention of materially increasing the cost of this deplorable enterprise to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No single penny can be paid by the Minister for Finance in subsidy to this company without the money being provided by the Oireachtas; that is to say, unless an Estimate is submitted here and passed. I do not expect that any subsidy will be paid, but I think it is a wise precaution, in enacting legislation of this kind, to make the statutory provision for it, because circumstances might arise at some future date which would make it good policy to do so.  At present, however, in so far as we can foresee the future, no subsidy will be payable, nor will the circumstances which might justify a subsidy arise. The price we have fixed for industrial alcohol, as I have said, probably will <Col N="1764" /> be added to cover the entire cost of production and pay interest on capital invested in the enterprise.  There is a certain amount of speculation about that, because we have not had the experience of a full year's working of the enterprise yet, nor do we quite know what the cost of manufacture will be in a full year.  Of course, at any time there may be a variation in the price of materials, the costs of labour, or in the price of power which would have a bearing on prices.  But at the present anticipated cost of potatoes, labour, coal, barley and the other commodities that are used by the company, we think that 3/- a gallon should prove quite capable of recovering the entire cost of production and still leave the margin which I have referred to.  There is therefore, no intention of paying a subsidy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy proposes that certain words should be deleted from the section.  Whatever case he had for deleting the words in an earlier section, where the question of guaranteeing debentures is involved, there is no case here, because this section is inoperative until something has happened in the Dáil, namely, the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate authorising the Minister for Finance to make a payment for the purpose and providing him with the money wherewith to do it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is unnecessary here.  Sub-section (2) is precisely the same as the Deputy's amendment. The section itself provides that&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may from time to time authorise the payment of subsidies to the company on such terms and conditions...</P>
      <P>and the Deputy wants to insert after the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo;&ldquo;as each House of the Oireachtas may from time to time approve.&rdquo;  Sub-section (2) of the section provides that&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any moneys required for the payment of subsidies under this section shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>That, in effect, is the same thing.</P>

    <Col N="1765" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is not, because there are two distinctions.  One is that my amendment would require the Minister to get the sanction of this House for the terms upon which he proposes to pay a subsidy which, I think, is in itself desirable.  The second thing is that my amendment would bring the Minister's technical justification for the subsidy before this House and the Upper House, whereas a financial resolution could be disposed of in this House alone.  Now, you resurrected the Upper House yourselves as a vocational body which was to give some kind of expert advice to Ministers on certain matters.  I think you were wise in doing that.  You resurrected it on certain lines.  Now, let us put it to work.  If it has certain qualifications that this House has not got, let us avail of them. It is supposed to have certain technical qualifications that this House has not got.  Here is a chance to avail of them. If you want to give a subsidy to the industrial alcohol business, bring your proposition to the Seanad and tell them what it is about.  Let them declare that, having heard the Minister, they are quite satisfied with the proposal, and that a subsidy for the industry is defensible and good.  Why should the Minister desire to cut the Seanad out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Seanad has no functions whatever in relation to public finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. I want to make my amendment effective by requiring the Minister for Finance to justify to the Oireachtas the conditions upon which he is going to give a subsidy. It is quite true that the Seanad has no authority over Money Bills, and, therefore, sub-section (2), which brings this matter before the Oireachtas only by way of a Financial Resolution, leaves the Seanad completely out of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the functions of the Seanad is to advise and counsel this House.  If the Dáil proposes to give a subsidy on terms to an enterprise, surely it is quite within the competence of the Seanad to say: &ldquo;It is none of our business how much you give, but we advise you that if you are going to give this firm a subsidy, you ought to require certain conditions to be fulfilled, and we think that they ought to give you a certain undertaking.&rdquo; Otherwise, what function has the Seanad if you are going to withhold from them every expert matter upon which they might reasonably be expected intelligently to pass judgment? Why should you dig them up at all?  Why not let them repose in silence?</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 19, before the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is one of considerable importance, because Section 21 purports to give to this company power to authorise an inspector to enter upon anybody's land and there conduct inquiries, make examinations and do a variety of other acts which constitute a substantial infringement of an owner's title to his land.  It is recognised that for certain public purposes it may be necessary to give inspectors that right, but it is a right which should be carefully circumscribed and should not be vested in any person who does not carry with him the authority of a Minister of State.  My amendment is, therefore, designed to secure that any authority issued by the company to this end will be countersigned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and unless so countersigned will not give an inspector any authority to trespass on a citizen's property.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 35, before the word, &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;the local authority and the&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the section which gives the company power to lay down certain pipe-lines and carry out certain works which may interfere with public roads and passages for which a local authority is ordinarily responsible. Sub-section 2 requires the company to get the previous consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health before they interfere with a public road in the laying down of a pipe line.  I feel that it would assist the Minister and make for good feeling all round if the local authority were brought in here and the sub-section were made to read: &ldquo;The company shall not, without the previous consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the local authority, lay down any pipe line under any public road&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read it back to front, but it does not make much difference.  The net result, if matters <Col N="1771" /> were pushed to a crisis, would be the same, because the Minister for Local Government, I think, by sealed order could compel the local authority to give the necessary permission so that if the Minister were satisfied in his mind that the permission was reasonably sought and was being unreasonably withheld by the local authority, he could issue his sealed order and command the assent of the local authority.  The introduction of my amendment would require the local authority to be consulted in each case. I am convinced that if it is not done quarrels will arise in every case where a public road is to be interfered with. I am satisfied that in nine cases out of ten if this amendment is inserted no difficulty will arise with a local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to accept the amendment.  I think the section as it stands provides sufficient protection for the local authority in that the consent of the Minister must be secured.  I may say in relation to the whole of Part III that it is scarcely necessary at all.  In so far as the industrial alcohol factories are concerned, it is not intended that there should be any substantial extension of the enterprise beyond its present size, and, therefore, it can be said that all the construction work intended has already been done. Part III of the Bill is taken in its entirety from other legislation of a similar kind.  The most recent legislation of that kind was the Air Navigation Act.  The whole of the corresponding part of that Act was dumped in here because it was considered desirable that all these provisions should be inserted.  In fact, however, no construction works of major importance are contemplated or likely to arise for a long time to come. So far as the particular point raised is concerned, I think the consent of the Minister for Local Government alone is sufficient protection for the local authority, and I may point out that the section is precisely the same as that in all the other Acts that have passed the Oireachtas authorising Government Departments or bodies <Col N="1772" /> set up by the Government like the Electricity Supply Board, the Sugar Company and the Air Navigation Company to undertake works of construction. No difficulty, to my knowledge, has arisen in consequence of the operation of similar sections in these Acts.</P>

      <P>Does it not seem essential that there should be some consultation with the local authority? Take a public road under which you want to put down some drain pipes and with which you interfere in doing so.  There must be some agreement that the road will be left in its proper condition, and only by consultation with the local authority can that be done.  It may be a kind of gentleman's agreement, if you like, but it ought to be there.  There ought to be some consultation with the local authority. Of course, the Minister, I presume, would have overriding authority, but for the sake of peace and of getting the thing done as it ought to be done, there ought to be some consultation with the local authority.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that it will probably never arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no experience of local authorities' work. If he had he would not adopt that attitude. If there is personal contact with the local authority, in the person of the county surveyor, for instance, the whole thing will be settled immediately. If the Minister put in some such words as &ldquo;consultation with the local authority&rdquo; it would get the county surveyor into the matter, and arrangements would be made to ensure that the work would be left in a proper condition.

All that work has been done, and no difficulty has arisen, although the relevant section of the original Act was precisely the same. This part of the Bill is really there because the 1934 Act is being repealed and the corresponding sections have been carried over here; but unless it is decided at some later stage to build a sixth factory in some new part of the country this part of the Bill will not have to operate at all because all the factories are already built and in production.</P>

      <P>As a matter of purely academic interest, would the Minister satisfy my curiosity as to how Section 22 relates to and is consistent with his own amendment later on to Section 23?  Section 22 says that the company can lay down pipes under the roadway, but the Minister's own amendment says that they are not to do it.  It says that they are not to acquire any land or any right in any land used or owned by a local authority for the purpose of gas or water undertakings or anything of that description.  Are there not gas pipes, water pipes and sewers under public roads, and therefore that part of that road is owned by the local authority for the purpose of a gas or water undertaking?</P>

It says: &ldquo;The company shall not acquire any land or any right over any land held or occupied by a local authority for the purposes of any railway, tramway, dock, canal, water, gas, electricity or other public undertaking.&rdquo;  In order to put down a sewer pipe, the local authority must have the bit of land through which it goes and it is then owned or occupied by the local authority for the purpose of a sewer pipe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Company may for the purposes of the business of the Company do, with the consent of the Minister, <Col N="1775" /> all or any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  compulsorily acquire (either permanently or temporarily) any land;</P>
    <P>(b)  compulsorily acquire (either permanently or temporarily) any easement, way-leave, water-right, fishing right, or other right whatsoever existing over or in respect of any land or water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 41/42 and lines 43/44, in sub-section (2), lines 50/51 and lines 1/2, page 8, to delete the words and brackets &ldquo;(either permanently or temporarily).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment. The proposal here is to give the company a power of compulsory acquisition which I have never seen given.  We are all familiar with the power conferred upon public authorities or bodies like the E.S.B. compulsorily to acquire lands which are required for the normal development of their responsibilities, but I have never yet seen a power conferred on such a body to acquire land permanently or temporarily as they may see fit.  They can compulsorily acquire any land, permanently or temporarily, under paragraph (a) and under paragraph (b) they can compulsorily acquire permanently or temporarily any easement, way-leave, water-right, fishing right, or other right whatsoever existing over or in respect of any land or water. Suppose this company came along and temporarily acquired my fishing right over a stretch of water, wrecked it, and then handed it back to me at the end of a long period, where am I?  During the entire period of their tenancy I am in doubt as to what their ultimate intention is.  I do not know how long they are going to remain tenants of this piece of property which they have temporarily acquired, and I am not in a position to make any alternative arrangements for the employment of my time or energies. Normally if a man wants to come and take your land, he takes your land; you get your compensation, and you can buy another farm and start up somewhere <Col N="1776" /> else.  If he subsequently discovers that he does not want the land any longer, he puts it on the market, sells it for what he can get for it and writes off his loss&mdash;the difference between the price he realises and the compensation he paid&mdash;or takes to credit the difference if he gets more for it than in fact he gave.</P>
    <P>Here, this entirely new arrangement is introduced.  I could multiply instances in which the inconvenience of having a compulsory tenant thrust upon you is demonstrated, but I do not think it is necessary.  For instance, a man might acquire an easement or a way-leave over your land and become an intolerable nuisance, and then throw the whole thing up after having made your land uninhabitable for the purposes for which you normally used it. It is true to say that no matter what kind of injury you inflict upon your neighbour there must be some measure of the loss which can be ascertained.  In theory that is true, but in practice it is not, and I submit to the Minister that we ought not to introduce this new principle of temporary compulsory acquisition. If we are to have compulsory acquisition by a public body or the State, then let it be acquisition for fair compensation, and give the person whose property is temporarily acquired an opportunity of starting up elsewhere. Do not let us leave people suspended like Mohamet's coffin, not knowing the day or the hour when the tenant who has thrust himself compulsorily upon him may pull up his stakes and move off, throwing back on his hands the property which was compulsorily let under this Section.  We have, therefore, moved to delete the words &ldquo;either permanently or temporarily&rdquo; wherever they appear in this Section.  That leaves the Section fully effective for the purpose of compulsorily acquiring such lands as may become necessary for the proper conduct of this industrial alcohol business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot agree that this Amendment is of any importance.  It seems to me it does not make much difference one way or the other whether these words are included in the Section or are left out.  As I <Col N="1777" /> understand it, if the words are left out, and the word &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; left without qualification, it means to acquire permanently. But the company can of course dispose of any property which it acquires.  The position is, therefore, that there is some property the cost of permanent acquisition of which may be regarded by the company as prohibitive. They can, as the Bill stands, take a lease of that property for whatever period they need it, but if the words are left out it means they have to acquire it and dispose of it when their use for it is finished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The owner of the property will have the same right to compensation as he would have if the property were permanently acquired.  The compensation will be determined, in default of agreement, under the provisions of the Land Clauses Acts.  I do not see how the point made by the Deputy arises in that regard.  If the user of the property by the company is such as to destroy its subsequent utility to the owner, then presumably that will be taken into account in determining the compensation to be paid or in fixing the agreed rent to be charged.  Either way, it does not seem to me that the owner is any better off by leaving the words out.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister see the difference between my arriving at his house to-morrow and announcing that he must move out his <i>lares et penates</i> as I am going to become his tenant for an indefinite term, and my arriving and saying he must move out his <i>lares et penates</i> as I am going to buy his house and he must make up his mind to take a new residence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, a difference, but is the owner any better off?  Is it not much better to enable the company to take a temporary lease of the premises, if a temporary lease <Col N="1778" /> is all that they require?  What the Deputy is trying to do is to put the company in the position that they must acquire it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the owner has no choice in the matter.  All those powers of compulsory acquisition are put in here because the Government is the owner of this company.  The Deputy knows quite well that when the Government goes out to buy or lease property the price charged for it goes up at once by 100, or 200, or 300 per cent.  The Government cannot get property at the market value. Consequently, unless there is power of compulsory acquisition it will not get property at all except at fabulous and ridiculous prices.  I said the other day that quite recent experience showed that the mere knowledge that the Government was supporting an enterprise undertaken by a private company had precisely the same effect upon the value of the land which that private company decided to acquire.</P>

      <P>Therefore, we have to give powers of compulsory acquisition. If the company requires merely a temporary lease of property it should have power to take a temporary lease. The power of compulsory acquisition is there mainly to ensure that a temporary lease will be given at a reasonable amount.  In fact, as the Deputy knows, it is very rarely that the power of compulsory acquisition has to be exercised.  I cannot remember a single case during my period as Minister apart from such matters as the acquisition of the Shannon fisheries or a few cases of the kind where this power of compulsory acquisition of land had to be exercised. But the knowledge that the power was there ensured that we were able to get the land at its market value, or something above its market value. The same applies in the case of a temporary lease.  The knowledge that we can get it compulsorily will make the owner of the property reasonable to deal with.  The deletion of the words merely creates this situation, that the owner is no better off except that the company will have to acquire it completely with a view to disposing of it when the use of it has expired.</P>

      <P>The discussion has become entirely irrelevant for the purpose proposed as I understand by the amendment.  If I might be, perhaps, not quite so irrelevant as the Minister was, I should like to direct his attention to a case that is at hearing to-day in reference to one of the operations of certain people connected with industrial alcohol.  Perhaps the facts of the case when he learns them, if he does not know them already, might, perhaps, give him a different view of the way in which these powers have been, in fact, operated.  We do not object to the power of compulsory acquisition. In fact, the amendment gives a wider power than the Minister was seeking.  Everybody knows that for the purpose of allowing a Government or any public authority to acquire land there must be power of compulsory acquisition, coupled with the right of the owner of the property to get a fair arbitration.  That procedure <Col N="1780" /> is supplied in Section 24 which follows. Both the Minister and the owner have an opportunity of presenting their case on the question of the amount in accordance with the principles laid down by the Act of 1919.  We are not objecting to that.  What we are objecting to is the power of temporary acquisition of certain rights or of a piece of land.  If the Minister requires the power of temporary acquisition I suggest that there ought to be some provision put in providing that the company should only be entitled to acquire temporarily on certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Take the case Deputy Dillon referred to.  If a house is taken over, say, for five years by temporary acquisition, there is nothing in the Bill to say that at the end of the five years the company is to hand it over in good order, repair and condition.  If a lease is given to a tenant by a landlord of a house the ordinary covenant is to keep it in good repair and to deliver it up in good repair.  Under this section, the company can acquire premises for five years and then go to the arbitrator and say they were only taking a lease for five years, give evidence of the letting value of the house, say, £20 or £25 per year, and say that five times £25 is £125 and that should be the compensation.  There is no power that I can see in this section or in the arbitrator to say: &ldquo;You cannot acquire this land or this house unless you undertake to deliver it up in the same condition as you got it when you compulsorily acquired it.&rdquo;  If it is a house it is an obvious example.  If it is a right-of-way lorries and other heavy traffic can go over it and destroy the ground for years after the expiration of the temporary user by the company, and there is no power to impose upon the company the condition that they will deliver up that roadway or the right-of-way that they took in good condition, in the condition they acquired it originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the kind of notions which are at the back of this amendment. If there were something in the section saying, if it is merely temporary acquisition, that there should be certain conditions imposed on the lines I suggest, <Col N="1781" /> the matter might be fairly equitable and not likely to work hardship. But under the provisions of the section you must get compensation once and for all.  You have only one arbitration and one award of compensation. So that if a house is taken over for a period of five years the arbitrator fixes the compensation on the basis of a five years' period and when that is paid, and it is determined once and for all, then at the end of the five years the house may be in a shockingly dilapidated condition as the result of user, neglect, or any other cause which may occur to any one.  There is no provision providing for a contingency of that kind.  It is matters of that kind that really require consideration and that motivated the putting down of this amendment.  It is not any suggestion that there should not be the power of compulsory acquisition.  It is only the idea that if it is desired there should be this power of acquisition for a temporary period then there should be some conditions in relation to the compensation attached to it.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree that this is without precedent because, in fact, the section is taken word for word from the 1934 Act.  I do not think it is important, because in practice it makes no difference, I believe, whether the words are in or not.  I realise that that argument is as much against myself as the Deputies, because if I strongly resist the amendment I am doing so without due cause, in the same way as they propose it without due cause.  If the Deputies are very strong about it, I am prepared to take these words out. In practice, I do not think it will make any difference.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to agree that in ordinary cases longer notice should be given and I think in every case much longer notice is given. Where, however, a public enterprise is being pushed ahead, different considerations arise.  This section appears in the same form in all Bills of this nature, whether dealing with railways, canals or harbours.  We cannot allow this enterprise to be held up indefinitely merely for the purpose of giving longer notice to people whose tenancies are likely to be disturbed.  I have not, however, known any case where a very long notice was not given.  In the case of the Poulaphouca scheme, for instance, more than 12 months' notice was given although the provisions regarding the giving of notice were precisely the same as in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (4).</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) provides that the orders that are referred to in the section, which may contain practically anything that comes into the Minister's head, shall have the force of law.  In other words, it gives very wide power to the Minister to legislate and to usurp the functions of Parliament.  It is on that question of principle that the amendment is put down.  We do not wish to hamper the Minister in the exercise of any power which it is desirable he should have in the making of these orders but it does come rather as a shock that the order which the Minister is empowered to make, after inquiry, &ldquo;shall contain such provisions as the Minister thinks necessary or expedient for the purposes of such order.&rdquo;  Anything that he thinks proper can be put in the order and it is to have the force of law, just the same as if it were passed in the Dáil.  I think that is going beyond the legitimate purpose of a statutory order and should not be insisted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a general power in the widest possible terms given to the Minister to say that anything he thinks necessary goes into the order, and once he puts it into the order it is the same as if it had gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is going beyond anything that has been done in <Col N="1785" /> the way of delegated legislation in this Oireachtas since it was established.  I doubt if there is any precedent for it but, if so, it must have slipped through unnoticed in this House.  I think it is quite sufficient that the Minister should have power to make these orders without adding this extraordinary provision that they are to have the force of law, just the same as if they went through the ordinary process of legislation here. The widest possible power is given to the Minister to put into the order anything which he thinks necessary or proper, but I think it will come as a shock to the public conscience that it is to have the force of law.  Even if that were not enough, the sub-section proceeds to say that without prejudice to the generality of the overriding paragraph, the order may contain certain provisions.  That involves the company, at all events&mdash;a matter in which I am not very much interested&mdash;in a criminal proceeding, but it may also involve private individuals in criminal proceedings, because the Minister might put in something creating an offence if he thinks it proper to do so. He may think it necessary or proper to create an offence and, at the same time, provide that it should not be heard by the ordinary courts but by the managing director of the company. I do not suggest that any responsible Minister would do that.  I am merely producing a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> for the purpose of giving point to my argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved here is a legal point.  As I understand it, the insertion of that section is necessary because of the provisions of paragraph 9 of sub-section (2) relating to the penalties which are involved in a breach of the order.  I consulted the parliamentary draftsman on this matter&mdash;I was not clear myself as to why the clause must appear in that precise form&mdash;and he has advised that because of the penalties provided in paragraph 9, sub-section (2), sub-section (4) must go in.  The only observation I have to make in that connection is that we are not establishing a precedent as a precisely similar sub-section appeared in the Cement Act, in the Air Navigation Act, and in a number of other <Col N="1786" /> Acts as well.  This section relates to transport works orders.  It gives the Minister power to authorise by order the construction of certain works.  The only difference between the powers given in these orders made by the Minister and those ordinarily given in the case of a private company, is that the private company would have to seek these powers by way of a private Bill.  In this section we give the Minister power to make orders authorising the construction of such works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was put down by me on a matter of principle and not because of the particular character of this Bill.  If there is any precedent in the Acts mentioned by the Minister I regret that these provisions were overlooked when the Bills were passing through.  Certainly it was a shock to my legal conscience, shall we say, or to my constitutional ideas, when I saw that these orders were to have the force of law.  I have no recollection of seeing anything like that in previous measures.  It is merely for the purpose of preventing such a precedent from growing up that I have put down this amendment.  Delegated powers are the subject matter of very considerable controversy in this country, and very much more so in Great Britain.  The Minister stated that he had got certain advice.  I would not presume to disagree with an opinion which I have not seen or the reasons for which it is worth, but I am entitled to say that as far as my opinion goes, for what it is worth, there is no necessity for sub-section (4) in order to give effect to paragraph 9.  Frequently we find statutory orders and rules being made under statutory orders which create offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, provided they do not go outside the powers provided by the Act.  It is perhaps objectionable that statutory orders should create offences and prescribe penalties but it is still more objectionable that, when that power is given, it should have the force of law because if the provision in the statute does not provide <Col N="1787" /> that it is to have the force of law, then it is possible to attack these provisions as being <i>ultra vires</i> and there is a check on the arbitrary use of these powers in that way.  There is no check, however, under this legislation by Departmental order.  This is legislation of the worst description. It applies not merely to paragraph (ix) but to the whole of anything that the Minister likes to put into the order.  In effect, he may create an offence that is not mentioned specifically in the section, which will then have the force of law.  I press upon the Minister as forcibly as I can, and not with any desire to obstruct, that this is a bad precedent to follow.  It is on the point of principle that I press it, and for no other reason.</P>

What I say is that if he leaves out sub-section (4) he will be in a position to do what is required in the public interest.  To add sub-section (4) in my submission goes beyond the power given under any Act of our Parliament, because it gives the Minister power to legislate without reference to the Oireachtas.  I do not think that is necessary.  The Minister has led himself into a false analogy.  If a private company was applying for these powers it would have to have a Bill.  Perhaps it would get the powers contained in Section 30, but it would not get sub-section (4).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Take the Dublin Tramways, which is a public company operating transport services.  A statute is passed giving them power to operate transport services, and that contains general power to make bye-laws in reference to A, B, C, D and E, matters specifically enumerated and set out seriatum in the Bill.  In a general way the details are all filled in by the bye-laws. The company then has power to make bye-laws which have authority but not the force of law.  They have statutory authority derivable from the statute.  Here I want to leave power to the Minister to do all things.  In Section 30 he has full statutory authority to do everything, but to put in sub-section (4) is wholly unnecessary and is going beyond what is reasonably required.  Certainly, in my view, it is putting in something that is a matter of grave dereliction of principle.</P>

    <P>(1) On the after the appointed day the company may, whenever and so <Col N="1791" /> often as it thinks fit, by order (in this Part of this Act referred to as a sale order) do, with the consent of the Minister, the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) fix a specified quantity of industrial alcohol to be the allotable amount for the purposes of such order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), line 49, after the word &ldquo;quantity&rdquo;, to insert the words &ldquo;not exceeding one gallon of industrial alcohol to forty gallons of mineral hydrocarbon light oil&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I confess to the Minister that I am not at all clear what the purpose of it is.  I did know it some time ago, but I think the general purport of it is this: that a certain amount of industrial alcohol will be made by the various factories that will bear a certain proportion to the amount of petrol, shall we say, that is consumed in the country.  The object of this is to prevent, say, the whole of the output of the factories being, so to speak, unloaded on to the petrol suppliers at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or on one company. I think that is the idea.  At the present time it may be said that the proportion that the total production of industrial alcohol of which the factories are capable will bear in relation to the total consumption of petrol in the year will be one to 40 and, if that continues as the ordinary practice, alcohol will be distributed to the distributors in that proportion.  They will get one-fortieth of their imports of petrol, but clearly it would be unwise to fix that percentage in the Bill because the percentage of the consumption of petrol may go up or down.  It would cause difficulty, and if it prevented the distilleries getting rid of their alcohol it would make it impossible to operate.  There is, in fact, not the slightest danger of all the alcohol being unloaded on the distributors at the one time.  Quite the reverse.  The storage at each of the <Col N="1792" /> distilleries is only sufficient to hold a fortnight's output, so that there must be a continuous outflow of alcohol from the distilleries to the distributors, or else the distilleries will have to stop working.  There is not the slightest danger of holding up supplies until a large stock of spirit is ready, and then passing it out in a short while to distributors. That could not happen. They have not the storage.  In fact, the arrangements are such that unless there is a steady and continuous outflow from the distilleries to the distributors the factories cannot work at all.  While therefore, I say that it is intended to do that to maintain a steady distribution of the spirit, to distribute it evenly amongst the distributors in proportion to their withdrawal from bond of imported petrol, at the same time we cannot fix the percentage in the Bill, because to do so would tie us down to a system of working based upon this year's experience, which might be altogether impracticable in the case of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial alcohol will be only about one fortieth of the total consumption of motor spirit in the country, but I am informed that it is not practicable to mix petrol and industrial alcohol in the proportion of one to 40 and, in fact, a much higher percentage of industrial alcohol must be used to get a proper blend, the correct mixture, and, in fact, what is intended is to put a new spirit on the market which will contain petrol and alcohol in the best proportions to constitute a good motor spirit and endeavour to sell that spirit as an adjunct to the existing lines.</P>

I notice the Schedule consists practically of the memorandum and articles of association of the company.  I think that is practically what the Schedule is.  I wonder is it possible to include more powers or reserve more powers for the Minister in the memorandum and articles of association, particularly in regard to the control of the company and the appointment of all the directors. I think only a majority of the directors may be appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as long as certain conditions obtain.</P>

In practice what it provides for is that certain directors will be appointed by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the balance will be appointed by the shareholders, but, of course, in this particular case, the only shareholder is the Minister for Finance, so in practice he appoints them all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a bee in my bonnet for a long time as regards control. There have been certain undertakings in this country like this, semi-Government, in which there are a lot of what I might call foreign experts in control.  Generally, when there are a lot of foreign or some we will call <Col N="1795" />&ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo; on the board, there has been certain manipulation carried out to the detriment of the country and to the other individual shareholders. It has been alleged and, in fact, it can be proved, that in some of these connections where there is raw material being delivered from the foreign country to a factory here in this country and a director of the company in Ireland is also a director of the company in England or whatever country it may be, the raw materials are sold by him to the company in Ireland and he collects commission on that as a buyer and as a seller.  Furthermore, it has been shown and can be proved that, in addition to that, that particular company sells raw material to another company in Ireland, that some of these people happen to be directors of the third company, and that they have, in fact, collected a commission on two or three occasions.  That has actually taken place in semi-Government controlled companies, and the bee I have in my bonnet is this, that the Minister should get more control whereby he can go in and ask for the entire books of these companies and see who is not.  I know it is rather late in the day to raise these points now, but I can give the Minister definite proof of where commission has been collected on three occasions on the same matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Slaughtered and Detained Animals (Compensation) Bill, 1938, is intended to extend still further the principle, contained in two Acts already in operation, of compensation to owners of live stock, cattle, sheep and pigs, exported from this country and slaughtered or detained at a port in Great Britain in consequence of an outbreak, or suspected outbreak or apprehended danger of foot and mouth disease.  The original Act dealing with this matter provides for a payment from a fund created under the Act which was passed in 1928.  This fund awarded compensation in respect of live stock slaughtered because of this disease.  Another Act was passed in 1932; this was brought in to extend the provisions covering compensation in respect of detention, lairage and feeding charges.  Even though the cattle may not be slaughtered owing to foot-and-mouth disease, compensation may fall to be paid.  The fund is built up of a levy paid by the owners of live stock to trustees created under the Act in respect of each animal exported, and there is no charge whatever on State funds.  The levy is 2½d. on each head of cattle, ½d. on each sheep, and 1d. on each pig.  The fund is managed by the live-stock exporters themselves, through the trustees.  It was provided by the original Act of 1928 that, whenever the fund reached £40,000, or, in the opinion of the trustees, when it reached such a level as would be sufficient to meet any charges that might reasonably be expected to be payable under it, the collection of levies should cease.  As a matter of fact, this position <Col N="1797" /> was reached on the 24th April, 1934, when the Minister made an Order under the Act suspending the levy.  It has not, up to the present, been found necessary to resume the levy.  The second Act dealing with the subject is the Detained Animals (Compensation) Act, 1932, which extends the principle of compensation to live stock which, though not slaughtered, are detained at a British landing place for a period beyond the normal period.  The Act provided for compensation in respect of such detention to cover the lairage and feeding charges.  This Bill carries the principle of compensation still further, and provides for losses due to depreciation of live stock detained at British landing places beyond the normal period of detention.  The compensation will also cover losses in cases in which the animals die at the landing places during detention beyond the normal period.  Compensation in all cases except death will be payable after consultation with the National Executive of the Irish Live Stock Trade.  The regulations may be amended from time to time as required.  Compensation for animals which die in the lairage beyond the normal period of detention will be determined by a committee of assessors, as in the case of the Slaughtered Animals (Compensation) Act, 1928. Section 2 of the Bill provides for compensation being payable on and after the first day of October, 1936, in order that some cases which arose about that time may be the subject of compensation. Section 5 of the Act increases the compensation which may be paid to the secretary of the trustees from £200 to £300 per annum.</P>

      <P>Presumably the Minister has looked into the incidence of foot and mouth disease in the last three or four years as compared with the years 1928 to 1934.  In view of the spread of foot and mouth disease during the last 12 months, would it not be wise to extend very considerably the provision of £40,000?  Whatever the cause of the spread of the foot and mouth disease and its extension to new areas, there are speculations as to that. At any rate, it is evident that at no time within the last ten or 15 years has there been so much foot and mouth disease as during the last 12 months. In consequence, it would be well if this advisory body would consider the question of increasing the insurance, because that is what it amounts to. Obviously, an interruption in trade may occur in which compensation may have to be paid.  This would make considerable inroads into the fund. Nobody feels very much the particular charge that is being made and it would be just as well to be on the safe side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about taking precautions against the spread of this disease?  It is commonly reported that a good deal of the prevalence of the disease in England is due to the several kinds of packing that come across.  As has been pointed out to me, there is a good deal of empty sacking or sacks in which potatoes are brought in.  Is there anything coming into the country from the Continent that would be likely to have a bearing on this disease? There is no doubt about the seriousness of it in England, especially in the last year.  All the necessary precautions would not be misplaced, and everything that could possibly be done should be done to prevent the spread of the disease.  A man in Waterford mentioned sacks and sacking to me as one of the causes of the spread of this disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, there is nothing to prevent the fund exceeding £40,000 if the trustees so advise.  Up to this, the accumulation of the interest has been sufficient to defray any expenses that have arisen during the last four years.  If we were to put on <Col N="1799" /> a levy again, the ordinary income from live stock would be more than sufficient to pay any compensation that would be necessary, unless, of course, there was an outbreak in this country.  Then our animals might perhaps have to be slaughtered at the other side.  That is the sort of contingency that was provided for when getting the fund up to £40,000.  If that contingency had not to be provided for, there would have been no need to have accumulated any fund at all.  It is quite true, as Deputy Cosgrave said, that detentions at the other side are becoming more prolonged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, more widespread, but we have sufficient income at the moment to defray any expenses that may arise.  If the trustees think they ought to increase this fund above £40,000, there is nothing to prevent them doing so.  They can proceed to collect the levy again and build the fund up higher even than £40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Gorey, the veterinary authorities in the Department of Agriculture have been very particular about packing coming into this country.  As a matter of fact, practically every week we get requests to allow certain things in, packed in material that is prohibited under the veterinary rules, and these people always make some very strong plea that if we do not allow the packed article in, it will have to be sent back to Czecho Slovakia or Russia or some other place at enormous expense.  I always have a certain amount of sympathy for the importer, but not for the shipping company, because they know these regulations and they do not take sufficient trouble and care to inform the importers about these regulations.  If we were to be too easy with these importers and did not allow the straw or whatever it may be to be burned on board, as the request is very often, we feel the shipping companies would not exercise any care at all.  I am saying this now because I feel that any Deputy may be asked to investigate <Col N="1800" /> at any time when there is a refusal.  We may be told that we are harsh with the importer, but we must do it.</P>

      <P>When the House was on the point of rising last night, I was endeavouring to show that the agricultural workers were looking forward with very considerable hope to the results of the passage into law of the measure proposing to regulate and standardise agricultural wages.  They had been looking forward for a number of years to seeing that hope realised.  It was, therefore, a matter of very considerable importance to them, and many people amongst the agricultural workers were optimistic enough to think that, with the passage into law of this measure, most if not all of their economic difficulties would immediately disappear.  They were very speedily disillusioned on that point, because very shortly after the Act was passed into law, and before the appointed day which gave effect to it had arrived, they had evidence of the fact that all was not well with the proposals, and the machinery in preparation to give effect to the proposals, to regulate agricultural wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the constitution of the board, I understand that, to some extent, the line formerly set by the British Government in this country in the constitution of wages boards was more or less followed.  I think, in spite of certain difficulties that might have arisen, that in the constitution of that board the organised workers of this country should have been taken into consultation and confidence by the Minister.  That did not happen, and that was the first indication that <Col N="1802" /> things were not entirely well in this whole connection and that hopes that were cherished were not quite so rosy-looking as they had at first appeared. The Minister constituted that board by the method of asking members of committees of agriculture in some cases, or in all cases perhaps, to nominate employers' representatives, and he asked members of this House to make nominations also.  Without any specific plan or any definite scheme a board was set up, a board on which it became quite evident in a short time that workers were in a very insignificant minority.</P>
    <P>Very much the same practice was followed in the setting up of the subcommittees of that board, or area councils, that function in many parts of the country.  I understand that such bodies, the minor committees, met first to discuss the question of a standard wage for agricultural workers.  On the standard there was very sharp difference of opinion at various meetings of the area committees; in fact, in some cases no decisions whatever were reached, and the fact that no decisions were reached was conveyed to the Agricultural Wages Board for their consideration. The whole method by which the area committees function, the procedure at meetings of the committees and other things in connection therewith, have left a good deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>I understand the minutes of the area committees, and latterly of the Wages Board itself, are not circulated to the members of the board and that, in fact, the board and the area committees really do not, for all practical purposes, exist; that the strong hand and the strong voice and the real power is the individual who is the chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board, who is the Minister's nominee on the board; that, in fact, all the other people are, to a great extent, in a purely ornamental position.  The chairman's is the hand that wields the power.  The Minister may say that, having appointed this man, he is a perfectly free agent.  I venture very respectfully to suggest that is not so.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the board has, or had at least, very close political associations with the Minister.  He is paid <Col N="1803" /> a very substantial salary.  His qualifications for the position, perhaps, are indisputable&mdash;I understand he is a farmer&mdash;but at least he is the nominee of the Minister, and everything that we can ascertain, as to the whole procedure and method of standardising or fixing agricultural wages in this country, goes to show that the chairman of the board is the mouthpiece of the Minister.  The voice might be the voice of Jacob, but the hand is the hand of Esau.  The voice in this case might be that of Mr. O'Leary, but the hand be that of the Minister for Agriculture. Consequently, in relation to this wage of 24/- a week, I think that the Minister for Agriculture must accept the major portion of the blame.</P>
    <P>This wage of 24/- a week, that was originally fixed by the board, seems to have a knack of always cropping up in the matter State employment. Over a number of years, in connection with public works or works of that kind, this unhappy figure of 24/- seems to crop up again and again and again. To the dismay of the agricultural workers, it issued again solemnly from the Agricultural Wages Board, or, rather, from the chairman of the board who, in the absence of a decision on the matter, took the responsibility on himself of fixing this wage.  I understand that there were prolonged deliberations with regard to the value of perquisites and that, again, the chairman's ruling on matters of this kind resulted in the final decision.  I understand, too, that there were wholesale applications for exemptions made to the board.  Now, I want to be strictly fair in this matter, so far as I can, but I understand that far too many applications of the kind received favourable consideration.  That, however, is one point that I am not quite sure about, and if I have overstated the case in any way with regard to exemptions, I should be very glad to be corrected and, in the proper time, to correct myself.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the fixing of the 24/- wage for a 54-hour week created widespread discontent amongst the agricultural workers.  It was obvious that it would, and the agitation of agricultural workers in this connection has <Col N="1804" /> gone on since.  That agitation was manifested at meetings of the area committees, and certain members of the area or subsidiary committees of the Agricultural Wages Board were very vocal&mdash;certainly, outside the meetings of the area committees, and presumably at the meetings of the area committees&mdash;but they were very effectually silenced.  They hold office for 12 months, and when that time expired the members of the area committees, who had taken up a hostile view to the fixing of 24/- a week as a rate of agricultural wages, were relieved of their responsibilities on their board, and more accommodating people were found and placed on the board.  Now, I do not want to dwell on this matter at any length; it is an old story, but it is a rather sordid and shabby story, and a story with which I should regret to see the Minister for Agriculture, who is certainly a very charming and courteous Minister to meet, and a very courteous opponent in this House&mdash;I should regret to see him, as I say, associated with that transaction in any way.  It was a very unworthy transaction and I think that perhaps the most merciful view to take of the matter is not to dwell on it unduly in this House this evening, having regard to the fact that it has been happening over a considerable time and that it is a matter about which, perhaps, it would be best to say nothing further.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to intervene for a moment?  Of course, I do not accuse the Deputy of saying anything in which he does not believe, but I should like to assure him that there is absolutely no foundation for that statement.  There was no person relieved from any of the committees unless complaints were made to me in the meantime to the effect that he was not an agricultural labourer.  Every such complaint was submitted to the inspector, under the Department, for the area.  I can guarantee&mdash;and I can show the files to the Deputy if he wishes me to do so&mdash;that in every case it was on the advice of the Inspector of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am glad to know that, and I should be very glad to have any further information from the Minister in this matter.  As a result of this agitation, to which I have been referring, a new situation arose some time ago, and at a meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board, or as a result of a meeting of the Board, a wage of 27/- a week was fixed for agricultural workers.  I do not know what took place at the meeting of the board where that decision was reached, but I should be very much surprised if that were a unanimous decision of the board; and, again, I think there is ground for suggesting that this wage of 27/- a week, that was fixed recently, is the decision of the power on that board, the chairman of the board.  Let us try to examine the value of this 27/- to the agricultural labourer and his family. He gets a nominal increase of 3/-, from the rate of 24/- that was originally fixed.  That is an increase of 12½ per cent. on the wages originally fixed. Now let us see what the other side of the story reveals.  The other side of the story dealing with the value of perquisites goes to show that this increase of 3/- is to a considerable extent offset by the increase in the value of the perquisites which are taken into account if he is receiving perquisites in the way of food or other things from his employer.  The value of food in the case of potatoes has been increased from 1/11 to 2/1, or an increase of nearly 9 per cent., and the rent of land let for the planting of potatoes, under the terms originally fixed, has been increased by about 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, here are some figures that, I hope, will bring home this matter in fairly clear and definite terms to the House.  The wage is 27/- a week for a <Col N="1806" /> married man.  He gets his food in his employer's house, exclusive of his breakfast and exclusive of his Sunday meals.  He does not work on Sundays. His dinner for six days per week will cost him 5/- at 10d. per meal; his afternoon tea for six days at 2d. per meal will cost him 1/-; his supper for six days at 6½d. will cost 3/3, making a total deduction of 9/3 from his wage of 27/- leaving him with 17/9.  Out of that 17/9 he has to maintain himself and his family.  I am assuming that the agricultural worker we have in mind is a man with a wife and three children. He has to provide for them over the whole week out of this 17/9, and, in addition, he has to provide out of that sum the cost of his own breakfast each morning, and of all his meals on Sunday.  I think that this estimate will be regarded as fair, because the value of the meals is fixed at something like the same rate as that which applies to his employer.  I think that the estimate is a conservative one because, in the case of certain commodities, the workman cannot purchase them in the same quantity, nor are they as easily accessible to him as they are to his employer.  In my opinion the estimate ought to be higher.</P>
    <P>The figures are as follows, and I ask Deputies to remember that the amount that this workman has to cover everything is 17/9.  The cost of his food on Sundays, and of his breakfast on the other six days of the week, is 3/9½ Sunday dinner, 10d.; Sunday tea, 2d.; supper, 6½d., making a total of 5/4.  So that as regards the worker himself, with the 9/3 already referred to deducted from his wages, you have to consider him bearing this additional deduction of 5/4, which is necessary in order that he may sustain himself over the seven days of the week.  These two figures give a total deduction of 14/7 from his wages, so that his wife and three children are left with 12/5.  Now, let us try and arrive at what it will cost his wife for her meals during the week.</P>
    <P>I think that the figure I propose to give will not be held to be based on any sort of an exaggerated calculation. This is the allowance made to a farmer in respect of the cost of food given to a boy of 18 in his employment <Col N="1807" />&mdash;1/9 per day or 12/3 per week.  If we take half that amount as the basis of our calculation for the three children, we get the figure of 18/5, making the gross total of 30/8.  But there are other things to be added.  The rent for a person in that position would be about 2/6.  Perhaps that may be a little too high, so we shall take the figure of 2/-, the rent of the average labourer's cottage that is now being built or that has been built in recent years.  The figure for fuel and light is 3/-; the cost of clothing and other things required for a home, that I need not enumerate, I take to be 4/-, making in all 9/- which, when added to the 30/8 gives you something like 40/-.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to remember that the people who require this amount, after deductions have been made in respect of the food of the wage-earner, have only got 12/5 to meet that 40/-.  That shows immediately, I think, the very unsatisfactory, the very unhappy and the very degrading position in which the workers employed in our principal industry, as it is so often referred to, find themselves.  Very frequently we grow eloquent in this country about our main industry.  We talk with pride of it, and I should say that applies to all sections of our people and to all parties, but while the workers in it are in the condition that I have described, I think we must be filled with feelings of humiliation. While you have such a condition of slavery, I do not see how we can afford to talk in terms of pride of our principal industry.  It can easily be shown that the wages they receive could not, in any possible circumstances, provide themselves, their wives and families with a decent measure of support and maintenance.</P>
    <P>This wage of 27/- a week is in respect of a 54-hour week.  I calculate that it would take a worker 19 out of the 54 hours to earn sufficient to pay for his food, and that if he has broken time he may easily find himself at the end of the week in debt to his employer for that food.  Together with the main and basic argument that a gross injustice has been and is being <Col N="1808" /> perpetrated on the agricultural workers of this country and on their dependents, there is, of course, the other very important argument, that living costs in the country have increased.  Apart from the nominal increase, which has been largely offset by an increase since in the value of perquisites, an increase which by the way indicates clearly an official admission that the cost of living has increased, there is the question of the living costs for the people whom the worker has to maintain at home.  The International Labour Office at Geneva has issued very interesting figures regarding food and living costs in various parts of the world.  The figures that I propose to quote are based on calculations made from the figures supplied by the International Labour Office in October, 1937, which is not a very far distant date.</P>
    <P>The item taken into consideration is a basket of provisions required for the maintenance of an ordinary household. It will be seen from what I have to say that the basket of provisions cannot be said to include any expensive luxuries.  This basket of provisions would cost in New York 35/-; in Dublin, 8/6; in Johannesburg, 8/2; in Budapest, 8/1; in Paris, 8/-; in Vienna, 7/7; in Wellington, 7/6; in Berne, 7/6; in London, 7/5; in Melbourne, 7/5; in Montreal, 7/-; in Stockholm, 6/9; in Copenhagen, 5/7, and in Warsaw, 4/9.  Let us see how agricultural workers are treated in some of the countries I have mentioned, where food and living costs are considerably lower than in our own country.  Some time after a wage of 24/- was fixed in this country for agricultural workers, the British Agricultural Wages Board fixed minimum rates varying from 34/- a week to 41/-in Lancashire for a 48-hour week.  The newly-established Wages Board in Scotland fixed minimum rates varying from 34/- to 40/- for a 48/-hour week. In New Zealand&mdash;a country that was almost entirely unpeopled up to 100 years ago and a country much more recent in its historical development than our own, which cannot boast of the ancient traditions associated with this country&mdash;they give us a remarkable example of how much more <Col N="1809" /> humanely they regard the needs of agricultural workers than we do.  The rate of pay for agricultural workers in New Zealand is 62/6 per week, with 28 days' holiday in the year.  That represents an increase of the standard formerly fixed of 17/6 per week.  The entirely inadequate wage paid to agricultural workers in this country is a great reflection on all of us.  It is a great reflection on the industry with which these workers are associated, and it is in most unfavourable contrast with the place we accord this industry when talking about it here.</P>
    <P>I said last night that I realised that there were difficulties and that we, on this side of the House, could not and would not ignore the difficulties with which agriculturists have to contend. We believe they should receive assistance, encouragement and co-operation. Co-operation would be very willingly extended from this quarter of the House to enable them to better their position and to get for the products of their labour a price which would not be subject to fluctuations, variations or uncertainty.  These constitute the source of many of their difficulties. Their difficulties were very considerably accentuated in the last few years, but that chapter is now happily ended and one can refer to it now without any suggestion that one's words are injurious to the interests of the country.  The present period should be regarded as one for taking measures to help the agriculturists to get on their feet and to recover from the difficulties they have encountered.  It should be a period of reconstruction of agriculture. The restocking of the lands and many other matters will occur as useful measures to people in this House more familiar with the needs of agriculture than some of us can claim to be.  In that reconstruction, a situation is bound to arise, if there is the necessary drive behind it, by which the agriculturist and agricultural labourer will be assured of a better and a happier place in the life of the country than they enjoy at present.  That matter can be discussed on other occasions but, lest my statement should be regarded as purely negative or one-sided, I think it right to make reference to it now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> Reverting to the family budget of the worker, apart altogether from the considerations I have mentioned, the hard and grinding facts surrounding the efforts of the worker's wife to sustain the people in the home and to maintain some standard of living there must have been very obvious to anybody who has tried to understand it. It must have been obvious to the chairman and members of the board, and to the Minister responsible for appointing the chairman.  The figures I propose to quote show the difference in prices of certain commodities between this country and Great Britain.  They are based on statistics issued by the International Labour Office in October, 1937.  The price of bacon is 9 per cent. higher here than in England, flour 10 per cent., eggs 19 per cent., bread 22 per cent., sugar 22.8 per cent., coal 28.7 per cent., tea 47.8 per cent., and rice 80 per cent.  It is true that beef, mutton, pork, butter, and milk are cheaper, but tea, coal, sugar, bread and flour are commodities that cannot be done without in the working person's home.  The figures I have mentioned reveal the urgent need for abandoning this policy of neglecting the agricultural worker or, at best, giving him something which merely enables him to eke out a miserable existence.  It is an undisputed fact that many agricultural workers could not possibly carry on and rear their families were it not for the efforts of their wives.  The wife of an agricultural labourer is generally a most industrious person. Up to some time ago she was able to show her talent for supplementing the little income of the home by devoting her time to the keeping of a certain number of poultry, but the decline in poultry kept in this country is a most alarming one, and, in my experience of several months dealing with applicants for unemployment assistance and going into little worldly goods they possess, I have, time and again, come across cases where the poultry possessed by the wife of the labourer amounted to only three or four hens.  It may be, as the Minister said last night, that disease amongst poultry is largely responsible for that. I do not want to argue that now.  Very <Col N="1811" /> probably the cost of feeding has a good deal to do with it, but whatever has caused this state of affairs, the fact is that the poultry are not there, and I mention the matter in order to emphasise that the opportunities which the wife of an agricultural labourer had for doing something to supplement the small wages of her husband have very largely disappeared.</P>
    <P>As this is the only opportunity that comes to the House during the year of referring to the operations of the Agricultural Wages Board, I want to say that the responsibility they have for following along this low rate of wages, which seems to be inseparably associated with Government Departments, is a very serious one.  The position in the rural areas is extremely bad. School managers point to the fact that the attendance of children at schools is diminishing very rapidly.  There are various reasons given, but the main reason is the economic necessity in the rural areas, and the fact that people are unwilling to accept obligations that might mean living in a state of abject and continuous poverty.  The rural areas show very definitely and reflect very truly, in my opinion, the present lamentable and regrettable state of the agricultural industry, represented not alone, as I said last night, by the very alarming decline in many directions, but by the poverty of those people who, by a strange irony, are the workers in the main industry.  Surely that is a very contradictory state of affairs and one that ought to be regarded as most urgent and compelling from the point of view of finding a satisfactory solution.  Other countries have had a much higher conception of the value of the services of their agricultural workers, and while I grant that, in many ways perhaps, we have had special difficulties, I think it will yet be one of the most difficult things to explain, when the records of 15 years of native Government and 15 years of deliberations by an Irish Parliament come to be examined, that, during that time, no reasonable step, and, in fact, no step at all, was taken to improve the position of agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>Many other speakers will discuss this Estimate, not so much from <Col N="1812" /> different points of view as from a special and intimate knowledge of certain branches of the work of the Department controlled by the Minister. I propose, therefore, to pass on from this question of agricultural labourers and to bring this statement to a conclusion after referring to two or three other matters.  The decay is not peculiar to the rural areas alone, and those of us who live in the small towns and villages know that the decay is spreading like a paralysing plague into the small towns.  The small towns and villages are becoming deserted, and the business formerly very actively carried on from one end of the week to the other, but, in particular, on certain days of the week, is entirely disappearing.  Various reasons are given for that condition of things, and I think that some of the arguments advanced as reasons for that decay are entirely fallacious.  It has been suggested frequently throughout the country that it is the result of the visits of hawkers who, as it were, come along and prey on the inhabitants like vultures, devour all they can of the local trade, and then clear off.  I think that is entirely wrong, and, similarly, I have no sympathy whatever with this clamour, which seems to me to be the result of failing to give any consideration to the matter, for taxes on what are described as travelling shops.  There is a delightful vagueness about the description &ldquo;travelling shops&rdquo;.  I know that in a number of cases these travelling shops are just the vehicles used by local shopkeepers to reach the rural areas and reach the trade that does not come easily to their doors.  There are very many reasons for it, but surely we are not so bankrupt of intelligence, or of willingness to give consideration and thought to this problem, as merely to think that because people come to the markets one day during the week, sell odds and ends on the market square in accordance with the policy that has been carried on for many years, for as long as the oldest man here remembers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was discussed on one of the financial <Col N="1813" /> resolutions and indeed I do not see what responsibility the Minister for Agriculture has in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just coming to that.  I hope to be able to convince you, Sir, that the Minister for Agriculture has a very special responsibility in this matter.  My suggestion is that the decay in the towns at present is largely the result of the failure of the Minister for Agriculture to take steps to protect the reasonable interests of the people in the towns in a certain way.  The fact is that the Minister has very largely subsidised the real offenders against the traders of the towns, because this Estimate contains very substantial provision for the creamery industry.  I know that pratically all the towns I know of in West Cork are deserted to-day because they have been ringed around by co-operative creameries which have gone into business and have taken away from the people in the towns the business they formerly enjoyed.  I do not object to reasonable competition.  I think it is inevitable that it is going to be the basis that will decide trade in this or in any other country in our time, or in the future, but the fact is that the competition in this case is not exactly on equal terms.  A farmer supplying his milk to a creamery may not be bound in writing to trade with the concern, but, in fact, he is expected to do so and, in reality, the position becomes one in which his commodities are exchanged for the commodities he can get there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold no special brief for traders in the towns.  In a great measure their views on purely political matters would be very different from mine, but I think that, just like the agricultural workers, the people of this country as a whole have got very generous support from the town dwellers.  At every stage of the agitation for the betterment of the people of the country, and in a particular measure, the betterment of the farmers of the country, in the struggle to give them the possession of their own homes, which is one of the most remarkable and laudable reforms that have taken place in the history of this country, the town workers bore a very substantial portion of the burden. <Col N="1814" /> To-day it is the fashion to regard them as outcasts.  There can be no doubt about the fact that the philosophy of certain people in this country is, as they say, that we ought to make grass grow outside the shopkeepers' doors.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister must realise that there is a limit to this position.  There is a limit beyond which it is not fair to thrust those people.  There is no objection whatever to creameries as such.  There is no objection to creameries trading in the agricultural requirements of their customers, but there is an objection to their taking over all the business and putting out of existence people who have on the whole been pretty useful citizens, people who in regard to employment and matters of that kind may not always be 100 per cent. excellent, but who on the whole represent a useful and decent type amongst the citizens of the country.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter.  I am not suggesting that he should take any vindictive action.  I am not suggesting that the matter ought to be pursued in any vengeful or agressive way, but there ought to be some method by which there will be recognition of the rights of the rural population, in the matter of their agricultural industry, to combine for their own purposes, with some line of demarcation, so that the people to whom I have referred to-night&mdash; without any special brief from themselves or any special request that this matter should be discussed&mdash;will not be put completely out of business.  I will leave the matter there.  The Minister knows fairly well the extent of this problem.  It may not be peculiar to all parts of this country, but certainly it is peculiar to the constituency I represent. I sincerely hope that the Minister may be able within a reasonable time to make an announcement which will give some assurance to the town population that they are not going to be completely and finally exterminated. I hope they will be assured of some reasonable co-operation all round in pursuing their very peaceful and harmless way, trying to live in circumstances and in times which are not for many of them extremely favourable.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, your ruling has precluded <Col N="1815" /> any reference to the question of fisheries.  That will be dealt with at a later stage and under a separate heading.  I want to make just a few other references to matters which may not be altogether inappropriate here, and one of them is this question of land reclamation.  Small grants are being made available to small farmers in certain areas for the purpose of land reclamation.  That is an extremely laudable and useful work, and is an activity on the part of the Minister's Department which is worthy of a great deal of praise, the only difficulty being that the areas are entirely too restricted. The schemes apparently follow on the lines of the old Congested Districts Board administration, and some other areas.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be a much more generous application of this principle of giving grants for reclamation work.  Let us take the case of the small farmers of this country who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  A number of them &mdash;in fact, all of them&mdash;who come within a certain category get unemployment assistance at a certain period of the year, and they are then expected to find work elsewhere.  The Minister must know that that work is not available. They are just small farmers in name.  They have a little holding of a few pounds valuation, and for the greater part of the year, with the exception of perhaps two or three weeks, they are available for labour anywhere or everywhere.  I suggest that many of them have on their own little holdings an opportunity of doing this particular kind of work, and that it would be a very considerable relief to them.  I consider that grants for small drainage work would be a welcome alternative to the system of loans given by the Agricultural Credit Corporation or the Office of Public Works, at high rates of interest, and after long, painful and exhaustive inquiries.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give further consideration to this matter.  I am not mentioning it with any desire to criticise, but rather to express my approval of the lines already taken by his Department, and to plead for an extension of that improvement in the light of the needs of the small farmers <Col N="1816" /> and the labourers who, to some extent, might share in the employment that would result from schemes of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer and that is the allotment scheme, also carried out by the Department or under the auspices of the Department and by local authorities and other organisations. I should like to see it extended to the smaller villages and towns which have not local authorities for the purpose of taking charge of the scheme. I know that certain charitable organisations and societies have in some places taken on hands schemes of this kind and carried them through, but if the boards of health in the various counties were given power to acquire land for the purposes of this scheme, I think very useful results would follow.  I have tried, Sir, in this statement to temper my objection to and condemnation of the policy of the Minister's Department in certain matters with the deserving word of support and praise which is their due in regard to other matters.  In the main, Sir, the Minister must be, if he looks at this matter calmly, in a rather unhappy state of mind with regard to the agricultural industry as a whole.  Our thousands of poverty-stricken agricultural labourers are a standing indictment.  There may be many factors in the whole position outside the Minister's control, but we have to examine the position as we find it and to a very considerable extent fix on the head of the Department the responsibility for the unhappy position of agriculture in this country.  I feel that in the matters I have mentioned in the decay of our rural population, and in the steady and devastating decline that has overtaken the towns, a case has been made for further consideration of this Estimate, and consequently I move the motion standing in my name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently an Agreement was made between this country and Great Britain.  It was felt that that Agreement was made by our representatives very largely in the interest of agriculture.  We felt <Col N="1817" /> that in making that Agreement there was a recognition by the Government that agriculture was the main industry of the country, and that because of the penalties being inflicted upon agricultural produce, Ministers, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, were very anxious to end that dispute. We were, consequently, all very glad when the dispute was ended.  But any person who considers what this country has lost during the last six years, and who had an opportunity of listening to the Minister last night, must be very sorely disappointed indeed.  During the last six years this country has been robbed and plundered. While our total trade with Great Britain went down from £60,000,000 to £40,000,000, we find Australia boasting of its trade having gone up by £28,000,000.  We find New Zealand, Canada and Australia also boasting of the increase in their trade with Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Now, when we are back on level terms with them, what are the suggestions of the Minister or the Government to the farming community in order that we might get back to somewhere near where they found us? There has not been a solitary suggestion that the agricultural community should take any steps whatever so that they would be in a position to compete and beat their competitors on the market which we have now got back.  Instead of that, we have had what amazed me, a resurrection by the Minister of the evil-smelling episode of the slaughter of the calves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister likes to go back on that evil-smelling episode, but he dug into it last night up to his neck.  Why he went on the defence so early I am at a loss to know if it was not this&mdash;that the main industry of the country is entitled to serious consideration, that there are big problems to be faced, and that the Minister is not prepared to face them. The Minister wanted to avoid them. He drew a red herring across the trail. All the Minister can say will not convince anybody of anything but the downright stupidity of the people who followed that course at that time.  The Minister endeavoured to give figures to show the necessity of following that <Col N="1818" /> course at that time and, as a matter of fact, the advantage it was to the people of the country.  Of course, the figures would not compare even with the published Government figures if we were to make any comparison of what might be called the peak slaughter year and the aged cattle of to-day.  There is no excuse that the Minister or anybody can offer for that which would be accepted by any sane person.</P>
    <P>Coincident with our losses which are on record, and which show that our total trade with Great Britain dropped from £60,000,000 odd to £40,000,000 odd in that period, we have an increase in this Estimate of practically two-thirds since the Minister took office&mdash;an increase of practically £200,000, from £400,000 to £600,000 odd.  Could there be any better evidence than that while our main industry was losing to that extent, the Department&mdash;which was supposed to be catering for that industry&mdash;had increased its administrative costs by practically two-thirds. That is what has happened, nevertheless. There was a feeling when the Agreement was signed that the Government had at last realised that agriculture was the basic industry of the country; that it would have to get not alone support, not alone every market which could be opened to it, but wherever there were any weaknesses it would have to be nourished and brought along and shown the right course in which to go.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately for agriculture, when Fianna Fáil got into power the first thing they did was to try to show the agriculturists what was the best thing for them to do.  But the agriculturists knew much better than they did.  The net result, in any case, was that while we passed Act after Act and put them into operation and increased our administrative costs by two-thirds, our production went down and down and down.</P>
    <P>Have we any opportunities now?  We have free entry into the British market. I admit that we were clamouring for that for six years.  It took six years to educate the Fianna Fáil people. There is no question now of thanking God that that market is gone, of saying that it is a blessing in disguise that <Col N="1819" /> it has gone.  We are glad of the conversion. But what are we going to do to get any value out of it?  Is there anything we can do?  There certainly is.  But the Minister has either deliberately evaded it because it is too big, or he has not thought of it.</P>
    <P>What always struck me as the greatest losses we have met with are the losses which the actual soil of the country has been made to carry.  We cannot compute them, but they are there.  Let the readers of the <i>Irish Press</i> not be convinced by leading articles which tell us that a schoolboy with the most elementary knowledge of agriculture knows that tillage will improve land.  That is about the rottenest agricultural heresy that anybody could preach.  That is what I read in &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; quite recently.  Is it any wonder that we are where we are when the Government organ publishes something like that? I have been a tillage farmer and an advocate of tillage all my life, but if you want to make sure to kill land, kill it with tillage&mdash;that is the way to kill it.  I agree that you can improve land by tillage, but no one should run away with the idea that if you till land it improves as a result of the tillage.  It does not.  As a matter of fact, if you neglect land, if you leave it there, if you do not till it or graze it, if you do not do anything with it, you are not killing it, because immediately anybody tries good husbandry on that land they will find plenty of plant food there latent in the soil.  In fact, during all these years when the land was neglected it was accumulating there.</P>
    <P>What had we in this country for the past five or six years?  If any person wants to let his mind run away with the idea that the land of Ireland has an inexhaustible supply of plant food, he had better get that idea out of his head as quickly as he can.  There is no such thing in this country except in a few isolated cases where the land is exceptionally rich and where it would take many years to kill it.  Much better land than the best land of Ireland has been killed, in Canada, for instance.  The soil of this country has, even to my own knowledge&mdash;and I am not so very old after all&mdash;been improved <Col N="1820" /> enormously by manure, by manuring of tillage, but particularly has it been improved by manuring of pastures.  What has been the result of the policy pursued by the Government for the last six years?  As far as that particular end of their activities is concerned, the figures are here.  In the year 1936, as compared with the year 1931, there were 30,000 tons less put out for top-dressing, that is of basic slag and superphosphate.  What did that represent?  It represented a manurial top-dressing of 60,000 acres. I have here before me the figures relating to the importation and the manufacture of manures in this country and they set out quite clearly what the position is and what the position has been for the last six years, year after year, drop after drop, but, mind you, there was an increase in certain manurial mixtures such as nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia.  What is the effect of these on the soil?  Do they put any plant food into the soil? They are practically entirely stimulants, which compel the soil to give up what it has.  That is the effect they have.</P>
    <P>We had a decrease in live stock with a consequent decrease in live-stock droppings.  We have had a decrease in stall-feeding with a consequent decrease in farm-yard manure.  We had an enormous decrease in that respect in the feeding of oil cake, with a consequent decrease in the value of the manure produced.  All that has had its effect on the soil of this country.  Now we are supposed to go back into the British market after five years' losses.  We are supposed to go back into the British market upon these conditions and to compete with people who have gone ahead in that time.  What are our prospects?  Does any man tell me that we can get back there to compete with, and best, competitors in the British market unless we attend to the fertility of our land? We have not a shadow of a chance.</P>
    <P>There are some people in this House who think that Fianna Fáil has had a tillage policy in this country, that they have gone ahead with it and succeeded with it.  They have not done any such thing.  Let them take up the figures for tillage in this country, let them <Col N="1821" /> find out how many of these acres have had any kind of manure applied to them, which has had a very lasting effect or which is of any good to the soil and they will find where we have arrived.  If we are going to take plant food out of the soil, we must put something back.  That is going to be the secret of the success of this country. It is either going to stand or fall by that test.  Moreover, as far as some of the tillage policy is concerned, I know the manner in which some of the land has been laid back in grass.  That is one of the most important things, if not the most important thing, with which we have got to deal in this country.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture, in his various travels up and down to London, to get this Agreement for us, was not blind to the steps taken in Britain to try to get better grass.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read with very great interest of the steps taken in Germany and other countries with regard to pastures.  There is only one type of agriculture that has left a profit in this country, an unsubsidised profit, and that is the rearing of live stock. Nothing else has done it.  The basic food of our live stock is pasture.  Consequently if we are going to make farming successful, and if Deputy Murphy is ever going to see any return to prosperity by the little towns and villages of the country, it will come out of live stock, and make no mistake about it.  Let no man say that the <Col N="1822" /> rearing of live stock is inconsistent with tillage.  Any man who says that does not know what he is talking about.  As a matter of fact, our population is very small, and even if we were to go in for what somebody has styled &ldquo;bag tillage&rdquo;&ldquo;bag agriculture&rdquo;&mdash;that is to sell in bags everything we produce&mdash;without live stock, the amount of tillage we could sell to our own people would be very small indeed.  The only thing that has shown us a profit and the only thing for which we have a market, is live stock.  I am convinced that that is what the Minister for Agriculture, whether he be Deputy Dr. Ryan, his successor or whoever he may be, should put his finger upon, if he is going to bring any prosperity to the country.  There is no use telling the people to produce something which will not pay them.  I remember a statement that was made at one time by the Taoiseach with regard to production, to the effect that they ought to produce for the common good instead of for profit.  That may be very good in theory but not in practice.  No one ever does that.  There is no use trying to get the people to go back to subsistence farming, and nothing else.  No one wants to go back to that. Farming and agricultural pursuits should be followed because they bring a higher degree of comfort to the people than any other pursuits.</P>
      <P>If we would only deal with the question of agriculture, and continue to deal with it, from the point of view of horse sense, which everybody understands, unless they are suffering from some disability, we would not be where we are to-day.  We must get back to first principles; to something that pays.  Let us devote our time and attention to that.  Supposing that this was an entirely new country on which 2,900,000 souls happened to alight one fine morning, what would be the first thing they would do?  They would see to it that they would be fed, by pursuing a calling that would bring them the greatest profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the basis of their existence, they would see to it that the soil was looked to all the time.  In this country we cannot afford to let it down, because we depend on the <Col N="1823" /> fertility of the soil either for our prosperity or our beggary.  If we are to compete with outsiders we must have a better article.  How are we to have it?  It is not enough that we should breed better animals, or that we should pay more attention to the distribution of good animals throughout the country.  It is absolutely essential that we should feed these animals, and feed them properly from the beginning, by seeing that they have a supply of the most nourishing food that can be got, and that is pasturage.  I am not pleading at all against tillage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have had a period of indiscriminate tillage and the figures prove that we have lost considerably.  In that case the fertility of our soil must naturally have gone down very much.  Not alone has our production been diminished most alarmingly during the last five years, but beyond any doubt our capacity to produce has diminished.  In my opinion that is our greatest loss.  When dealing with the pig question last evening the Minister adopted what I consider to be an extraordinary attitude.  With the establishment of the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board he thought he had set in motion machinery which, to some extent, would ensure pig production all the year round.  That has failed miserably.  The Minister then went on to say that the pig population varies in cycles over a number of years, going up and going down.  That is perfectly true.  But the Minister did not tell us that the question was more acute at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, Deputy Corry, or members of the Fianna Fáil Party deny that as far as this Party is concerned it has any influence with the people?  According to the Party opposite, this Party has no influence in that way.  We have been told that the Government was <Col N="1824" /> elected and that we were beaten. Despite that, the Minister believes that we influenced people not to feed pigs; that there was no profit in them. I tell the Minister that the people are not as soft as he thinks.  There are more people feeding pigs to-day than those belonging to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>Well, it does seem an extraordinary thing, if they took into <Col N="1828" /> consideration all the relevant factors in the rearing and feeding of pigs and fixed the price, that they were not able to put the producer in a way that he could continue pig rearing.  What did they omit?  Apparently, they have done one thing which certainly has been other than beneficial in the counties bordering Northern Ireland. I am referring to the people who were habitually going to market with pork, and the net effect of the Act was to kill those markets.  That is true.  The people in this particular locality who were accustomed to those markets find themselves at a terrible loss because they find that while they could go out to the markets and come back with their pigs if they did not sell, and go another day to another place, they have now to go to the factories and take what they get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, they had to sell, and somehow or another they appear to be at a dead loss, or at least they appear to have a grievance.  I do not know if the Minister recognises the grievance or not.  As far as I am concerned, I think they have a grievance. Now, that is just the producer's point of view.  What is going to happen in this country if we, the Minister and myself, if you like&mdash;let me again shoulder my responsibility&mdash;if we are going to allow the operations of the Bacon Marketing Board to form in this country a monopoly of a few firms?  What is going to happen?  Are we going to allow that?  Is there any danger of that happening?</P>

      <P>Yes, but, in any case, the result of the whole operation has been that we have not got the pigs. There is something wrong.  I think the Minister and everybody else in the House will have to seriously consider this thing.  The Minister, of course, I admit, has told the people in the House that he is prepared to consider the position.  I am very glad of that. I hope the Minister will not have any qualms of conscience in wiping them out completely if he feels that it ought to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good.  That is satisfactory.  The people in this country were advised to go into beet production, sugar beet.  Notwithstanding the fact that there has been a lot of trouble in this particular matter in the past few years the Minister was ominously silent on it last night.  I would like to hear something on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not seem to be much change for anybody out of the same scheme.  There does not seem to be any change for the taxpayers or for the beet growers.  Some Deputies said in the House the other night that they would welcome a beet factory in their locality.  Of course, we all would at a price&mdash;at a price. If we are going in for beet growing as we have been going in for it, let us know exactly what we are doing.  Let us go in for it with our eyes open.  I <Col N="1830" /> think I cannot do better than quote here, from a document issued by the directors of Comhlucht Siúicre na hEireann last August, when there was a dispute on with the workers of the factories.  This is what they said&mdash;&ldquo;The establishment of the industry has been possible only on certain economic bases and calls for sacrifices from the community in the form of an increased price for sugar, from farmers in the form of a reduced price for the raw material&mdash;sugar beet, and from the National Exchequer in the form of a loss of revenue estimated to exceed £1,000,000 per annum, which deficiency in national revenue falls to be met by way of contribution from the taxpayers.&rdquo;  These are the words of the directors of Comhlucht Siúicre na hEireann.  That appears to be the bee which we are following in this country.  I wonder how much honey we are going to get out of that bee at any time.  What are the prospects? Are we in this country going to pursue something which is either fundamentally essential and which we cannot do without, or something which will show us a profit?  It ought to be one or the other, I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government should immediately establish machinery whereby conditions of employment in the Civil Service and other matters which may from time to time be in dispute between the Government and the Civil Service would be settled by agreement between representatives of the Government and of the Civil Service associations, and, in default of such agreement, would be submitted for decision to an independent arbitration board, the awards of which, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas, the Government would undertake to implement. &mdash;(John A. Costello, Peadar S. Doyle.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very briefly to support the motion standing in the names of Deputies Costello and Doyle.  I think it is rather remarkable that at this stage of our history, when the Government is deciding for everybody how to manage their business, when the Government is deciding in every occupation, in every business, and in every trade what the relations between employer and employee should be, that the Minister for Finance will refuse what is, apparently, on the face of it, an innocuous motion of this nature.  The State is being put into the position that they will never do what they advise other people to do.  The Minister for Finance in this case will not do what ought to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the State is one of the biggest employers in the country&mdash;and, indeed, it is the very biggest employer&mdash;it should give good example to other employers.  We have various reactions to this motion.  One of the most amusing reactions was the statement made in this House by one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, when he said that the proper arbitration board would be a board composed of old age pensioners, small farmers, labourers and people of that kind.  I quite realise that that statement was made with one eye on the gallery and another eye on the Press.  I quite realise that the Deputy felt that the small farmer, the labourer and the old age pensioner down the country would say to themselves: &ldquo;We have one champion, anyway, to talk to these fellows in the offices.&rdquo;  One can realise what was at the back of that statement of the Fianna Fáil Deputy. He made that statement with his tongue in his cheek.  What he meant was that when the Fianna Fáil Deputy failed to secure a pension for the old age pension applicant, or failed to secure a privilege for some one else, the excuse would be &ldquo;do not blame the Government; do not blame the Fianna Fáil Party; do not blame the local Fianna Fáil T.D.s; put the blame on the officials.&rdquo;  And people in the country, when fed on that kind of thing, would believe that civil servants are not entitled to any consideration of the nature envisaged by this motion.  But I feel that any fair-minded person will <Col N="1832" /> realise that if the Government is to take upon itself the right of deciding the relationship between employer and employee; if it realises that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is going to act as negotiator, and get itself patted on the back for deciding disputes between the employer and the employee, then the least the present Government might be expected to do is to give a good example to the other employers in the country.  The Minister in this House stated that he had a Bill prepared, and as usual he held up in his hands, as he always does, a white paper.  In righteous indignation with the civil servants who refused to consider what they had been offered, he flourished that paper before the House. It was obvious that the Government were prepared to give the civil servants one kind of arbitration.  That was so long as the machinery was in their own hands, and under the thumb of the Minister.  But the Government was not prepared to establish any arbitration machinery that one could feel was fair and equitable for deciding the grievances of civil servants.  Without any knowledge of Civil Service conditions beyond what I have learned in this House, I quite fail to see why civil servants should be refused the right which practically every other employee in the country is given.  When a dispute takes place anywhere between employers and employees the Government send down their own officials. The officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce sit for hours as arbitrators on a dispute&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong about that.  They do not sit as arbitrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will take credit for settling the dispute, just as if their officials sat as arbitrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they do not, but they go down there and use Government machinery to settle these disputes.  Now the Government is <Col N="1833" /> denying the civil servants what they want to give to every other employee who has a grievance about his conditions of employment.  At least, the Government should give to the civil servants some machinery for ventilating their grievances.  I do not believe there is any person in the country, whether he be a small farmer, labourer or old age pensioner&mdash;even the man whose pension was refused, the man that the Fianna Fáil Deputy would like to put on an arbitration board of this nature&mdash;who would seriously refuse the right that civil servants ask under this motion.  Though the Minister may quibble about the use of the word &ldquo;arbitration&rdquo; he cannot equitably deny the civil servants' right to arbitration&mdash;the right asked in this motion for machinery whereby conditions of employment and other matters in dispute between the Government and the civil servants would be settled by agreement between representatives of the Government and representatives of the Civil Service.  I support this motion.  I do not believe for a moment when the Minister was so indignant about the terms of a Bill which he was offering the Civil Service, that that Bill was anything beyond a bluff calculated to mislead the ordinary person into the belief that the Minister had introduced a Bill setting up arbitration. That Bill was only a clever cloak which sounded like arbitration but which would actually leave everything in the control of the Minister.  I believe everybody is satisfied that the civil servants should have some machinery set up for them so as to give them a chance of ventilating their grievances and to secure that their fate will not be left entirely to the control of the Minister.  For that reason I ask the House to support this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That little trick did not work.  On the last occasion on which this motion was discussed we had a speech of two hours' duration from the <Col N="1834" /> Minister for Finance.  I do not imagine that any speech has yet been delivered in this House which contained more sanctimonious humbug than the speech then delivered by the Minister.  He spent a considerable amount of time lecturing the House on the meaning of arbitration.  To show the extent of his knowledge on that subject he quoted for us &ldquo;Redman's Law of Arbitration.&rdquo;&ldquo;Redman's Law of Arbitration&rdquo; is being quoted by the Minister against civil servants in 1938.  I wonder did the Minister know of the existence of Redman's Law of Compensation when in 1932 he went to the Town Hall in Rathmines and, in the hope of getting Civil Service votes, promised civil servants arbitration.  That was a promise he apparently has now no intention of keeping.  The Minister told us that the International Labour Office at Geneva had produced a report on the subject of conciliation and arbitration. He quoted long passages from that report, all purporting to show that the general view was one of opposition to what he described as compulsory arbitration.  He forgot to draw this difference between the report and conditions here.  He forgot to tell us that the International Labour Office's report on arbitration was dealing with the outlook of industrial trade unionism towards compulsory arbitration.  Trade unions have rightly rejected compulsory arbitration, because they are free to exercise their natural right to withdraw their labour.  Here the Minister for Finance implements the Treason Act which was passed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  In 1926 he denounced that Act as coercion.  But he is implementing the Treason Act to-day.  One section of that Act proscribes, or attempts to proscribe, the rights of civil servants to withdraw their labour in the same way as industrial workers can withdraw theirs.  The report of the International Labour Office on the attitude of the trade union movement throughout the world to the question of compulsory arbitration has nothing whatever to do with the attempt to establish an arbitration board here.  The Minister knows that perfectly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only incurable obtuseness on his part <Col N="1835" /> would have induced him to quote a report which was so irrelevant to the subject-matter of our discussion; but I thought the crowning achievement of the Minister on the last occasion was his lengthy quotation from a document issued by the then President Cosgrave to Civil Service staff organisations in 1924.  With all the artificial profundity of which he is capable, the Minister held up the document and quoted from it as if it came from the book of truth and revelation.  There is one thing that Deputy Cosgrave, when he was in office, apparently did, and that was that he established precedents which the Minister for Finance now slavishly follows.  We are told that because Deputy Cosgrave said certain things in 1924 to Civil Service organisations, that was the reason why the present Minister for Finance could not do anything different in 1938.  That represents the speed with which the Government are progressing! They are now just where the Cosgrave Government were in 1924.</P>
    <P>This whole question of arbitration ought to be taken in a much more serious manner than that so far displayed by the Minister for Finance.  It is beyond all doubt that in 1932 the present Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance went to the Town Hall, in Rathmines, and there, in definite, specific language, promised that, if elected to office, they would establish an arbitration board for the Civil Service to deal with matters in dispute between the Service and the Executive.  And, as if that promise was not sufficient to civil servants in that election, we had a manifesto issued a few days later, over the signature of the Taoiseach, in which he said: &ldquo;We are prepared to establish an arbitration board to deal with the grievances of the Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that election a questionnaire was submitted to candidates by the Civil Service organisations, and the questionnaire was in these terms: &ldquo;Are you prepared, if elected, to press for the setting up of machinery which will provide for the settlement of matters in dispute between the Minister for <Col N="1836" /> Finance and the Civil Service by an impartial tribunal, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas?&rdquo; Among the people who glibly said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that was Deputy Briscoe.</P>
    <P>In any case, he limited himself to a monosyllabic reply.  The Minister for Finance, of course, could not do that, because he went on to say not only &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, but that the Fianna Fáil Party had already indicated &ldquo;that it is prepared to investigate the grievances, particularly in the lower ranks of the Civil Service, and to provide, for the purpose of settling disputes, an impartial tribunal&rdquo;.  That was the Minister for Finance in 1932, sympathy with everybody, prepared to sign everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so, and I hope that you will make a better fist of it than the Minister.  What do we find now?  Six years after that promise was made the Government which was prepared to establish an impartial arbitration tribunal, and the Minister who said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to a question as to whether he was prepared to support the establishment of an arbitration tribunal to decide on matters, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas, now comes to the Civil Service and submits to them what he describes as a draft scheme of arbitration. What does the Government's offer to the Civil Service amount to? They are told by the Government that a chairman will be appointed in agreement between the staff side and the Government or, in default of agreement, by the Minister for Industry <Col N="1837" /> and Commerce, himself a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>We are told in the same scheme that the Minister for Finance is to have a permanent veto over a wide category of cases.  We are told in the same scheme that even in those cases over which the Minister does not claim a veto, that nobody can go to arbitration unless the Minister agrees.  And as if all these restrictions are not sufficient, the Minister goes on to say that he is going to proscribe the right of the Civil Service organisations to be represented before the arbitration tribunal by representatives of their own choice.  And as if that additional safeguard was not sufficient, the Minister again claims the right to be able to reject, if he dislikes the findings in any report made to him by the arbitration tribunal.  He wants a big say in the appointment of the chairman, a permanent veto over a large category of cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to take his jokes somewhere else and write poems about them.  He wants a permanent veto, and you can only get to the tribunal by the permission of the Minister.  There is to be restriction of choice by the Minister as to the representatives of the staff who will appear before the board, and, finally, a veto by the Minister over the awards of the board.  That is the method of implementing the solemn promise which was made in 1932 in exchange for votes for the present Minister for Finance.  In case anybody could even then complain about that procedure, the Minister in his scheme says that the award of the tribunal is not to be published.  It is to be treated as a confidential document.  That is the remarkable scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us analyse for a few moments the type of restrictions the Minister is imposing.  In so far as his permanent veto is concerned, he prevents any matter dealing with discipline, conduct, regulations, promotions, superannuation, recruitment, grading, organisation of work, cost of living bonus or its application to basic wages and salaries from ever being dealt with by any arbitration tribunal, and he is indicating that he intends, if necessary, to impose further restrictions. The Minister goes on to add in his draft scheme that this list of matters which can never be arbitrated upon must not be regarded as exhaustive. Other cases may be brought before the board, but you can only bring a case before the arbitration board if the Minister grants permission.  Of course, clearly the Minister will not grant permission to bring a case to the arbitration tribunal if he thinks he is likely to lose his case there. There could be no other purpose in the Minister insisting on his right to be consulted and to agree before a case can be brought before the tribunal.  The Minister wants to prevent any case going to the tribunal which he thinks he is likely to lose there.</P>
      <P>Then we have the other restrictions. The Minister wants to insist that only serving civil servants can appear before the arbitration tribunal.  Any civil servant who appears there and says anything about the Minister for Finance or about the system that is being operated by the Minister, or anything about the Department of Finance, will be brought to heel very quickly by the Minister and by the officials of the Department of Finance. I regard that restriction by the Minister as a most contemptible tyranny, and the mind that stands over it, I say, is the mind of a tyrant and a despot.</P>

    <P>If you take the position in Great Britain, in America, in Australia, in New Zealand, in South Africa, you will find that in all these countries where there is, at least, as good a brand of democracy as we have here, Civil Service organisations are entitled to be represented in any negotiations with the respective Governments of these <Col N="1839" /> countries by representatives of their own choice, and, in fact, every day in the week they do represent the organisations of which they are officials.  Yet, here in this country, the Minister for Finance could not see his way, of course, to line up with that kind of democratic thought or outlook.  In all the countries where democratic government still survives there has been a frank and open recognition by the Government of these countries of the rights of Civil Service organisations to be represented by persons of their own choice. The Minister for Finance here is probably the one person in a democratic country who can stand up and trample on that principle which is freely recognised throughout the world, except in those portions of the world where democracy is being suppressed and where trade union liberty no longer exists.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that a scheme, which gives the Minister a permanent veto over a wide category of cases, an omnibus veto over others, a restriction on the right of the staffs to be represented by persons of their own choice, and a final veto over the findings, has been contemptuously rejected by the Civil Service organisations? Nobody with any intelligence or with any self-respect would attempt to negotiate with the Minister on this scheme, which is a thoroughly disreputable scheme from beginning to end, and if it is not the product of the Minister's own mind, it is the product of the minds of people in whose pocket the Minister is.  That is the scheme which is now being offered to the civil servants, and it is a very different scheme from what the civil servants were told in 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's objection clearly is that, apparently, I am not entitled to say that the Minister has been converted.  At one time he used to be a republican, but the appointment of the king in 1936 suffocated the republicanism, and the activities of the Department of Finance have suffocated the radicalism of the Minister. He cannot help people observing that conversion and that change, and nothing crystallises the change more clearly than the glib promises of the Minister, in 1932, and the complete reluctance of the Minister, in 1938, to honour the promises that he made in 1932, in the hope that by making them he would get more votes in the 1932 Election.  Against this spurious scheme of arbitration which the Minister is offering to the Civil Service, the service is asking for a scheme which has some of the well known attributes of <Col N="1842" /> arbitration, as popularly and industrially known.  In opposition to the offer made by the Minister they have asked that a scheme of arbitration should contain certain essential features which are commonly associated with an arbitration tribunal.</P>
      <P>Is their scheme an unreasonable one?  Is there any claim made by the Civil Service organisations which is not recognised as an inherent feature of arbitration wherever arbitration is resorted to as a means of settling disputes? The staff's claim is that the chairman of the board should be appointed by agreement between the Government and the staff organisations; that each party should be free to select its representatives on the board and its advocates before the board; that each party should have the right to bring before the board any claim within a previously agreed category, without veto by the other party, the board alone having the power to decide whether a particular claim falls within the agreed category; that the Government should give effect to the award of the board, subject to the overriding authority of Parliament; and in the event of a dispute as to the meaning of an award, the board to determine its own findings. That is the claim which is being made by the staff organisations.  Not once in the course of his speech did the Minister, or any member of his Party, attempt to show that that claim was in any way an unreasonable one, or that it embodied any unique feature of arbitration.  Wherever arbitration boards function, they function on the basis of principles of that kind, and these are generally recognised to be essential features of a genuine scheme of arbitration.  The Minister has been asked, and the Department has been asked, to negotiate with a view to establishing an arbitration board based on principles of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not prepared to negotiate with the Civil Service organisations. Instead, he wants to compel them, by his unreasonable and stubborn attitude in his official position, to accept a scheme of arbitration which has none of the recognised features of arbitration.  We had talk from the Minister on a previous occasion <Col N="1843" /> about the constitutional difficulties which prevented his accepting a scheme of arbitration which provided for the acceptance of the award of the arbitration tribunal, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas. With all the airs of an eminent lawyer, the Minister told us orally, and in correspondence, that certain constitutional difficulties prevented the acceptance of a scheme which made Parliament master over the awards of the arbitration tribunal, but, as Deputy Costello pointed out in his opening speech, there has not been a single lawyer produced by the Minister to show that there is any constitutional difficulty either within the new Constitution or the old Constitution to prevent the Minister accepting a principle of that kind.  Not a single lawyer's opinion has been produced to support the Minister's contention, and the Minister knows perfectly well that he could not get a lawyer, whose opinion was worth anything, to subscribe to that foolish statement which has been made in an attempt to resist the reasonable claim of the Civil Service organisations.</P>
    <P>Where is the difficulty?  Where is the constitutional difficulty which prevents the Minister accepting a scheme of the kind I have outlined?  The normal procedure would be that a case would be referred to the board.  It would be argued before the board by the staff representatives on the one side, and by the Minister's representatives on the other side.  A decision would be given by an independent chairman in the appointment of whom the Minister would have a considerable voice.  The award would go to the Minister.  The Minister would consider the award and submit it to the Executive Council.  If the award necessitated the introduction of a supplementary estimate or some special type of financial provision to meet it, then the Minister would come before the Dáil with a proposal for expenditure of that kind, but he, all the time, had the safeguard that he was a Minister by virtue of the fact that he held a majority in the House, and if the award was extravagant, a preposterous award, completely against the run of <Col N="1844" /> the evidence and the merits of the claim, the Minister had all the safeguards that he could require either under the new Constitution or the old Constitution.</P>
    <P>Talk about a constitutional difficulty in this matter is humbugging talk.  The Minister knows that it is insincere.  He knows that the case that he has made in that connection would not hold water, and that of all the lawyers gravitating about the Government Party not a single one of them has been found to stand over the futile opinion expressed by the Minister for Finance on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not have negotiations. Now, on this matter the Minister and his Party did not always think the same about negotiations.  One time, when the Minister was looking for votes and his Party was looking for office, negotiation was the kind of thing which the Minister was always prepared to support.  In 1930 the Minister's Party was prepared to support negotiation when it only meant a matter of amending the worthless machinery described as the Civil Service Representative Council.  In 1930 the Civil Service organisations waited on the Fianna Fáil Party and asked them to support a proposal to send an all-Party deputation to the then Minister for Finance to endeavour to avoid the operation of certain cuts in the cost-of-living bonus being made operative, and to secure an amendment in the constitution of the Civil Service Representative Council.  After putting the case before the Fianna Fáil Party organisation of that period, a reply was received from that organisation saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have to inform you that the Fianna Fáil Party committee has considered the request made by the deputation from the Cost-of-Living Bonus Joint Committee, which met the undersigned on the 6th inst., and has agreed to appoint Mr. Seán Lemass with another member of this Party to join the deputation to the Minister for Finance for the purpose of advocating: (1) that the constitution of the Civil Service Representative Council be revised, in <Col N="1845" /> consultation with Civil Service organisations, in a manner that will be acceptable to all parties concerned.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate that joke from the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance, as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1930, presumably believed in that Party's policy then and accepted the Party decisions then.  The Party then was prepared to press for a revised Civil Service Representative Council &ldquo;in consultation with Civil Service organisations in a manner that will be acceptable to all parties concerned&rdquo;, but speaking in this House last month of the same Civil Service Representative Council the Minister, after telling us the manner in which it was constituted, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would like those Deputies who are interested in this question, and who have said that they are only anxious that the Civil Service of the State should have some method of adjusting its differences, to ask themselves: what more representative machinery could have been devised for the discussion of Civil Service problems?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1930 the Minister wanted the constitution of that body revised, but in 1938 he wants to know what more representative machinery could be established to deal with the grievances of the Civil Service.  The only thing that has happened in the meantime is that this Representative Council has got more disreputable than it ever was, and that the Minister has got into office.  In 1930, at all events, the Party believed in negotiation and was willing to join in an all-Party deputation to the Minister for Finance in order to avoid reductions in the cost-of-living bonus and to amend the Civil Service Representative Council <Col N="1847" /> machinery.  They are not prepared now to support that type of negotiation although, in 1930, when it was a matter of getting votes, the Minister's Party had no hesitation whatever in recommending that negotiation should be instituted on a matter of this kind. The striking thing that emerges from this debate is that, between 1932 and 1938, the Minister has somersaulted completely on the promise made by his Party to establish a genuine scheme of arbitration.  It cannot be denied that that promise was made to the Civil Service.  Six years after it was made, the Minister refuses to honour the promise and, instead, offers the Civil Service a type of machinery which has none of the essential features of arbitration and which would not be accepted by any organisation which had any pretensions to self-respect.  This motion calls upon the Government to enter into negotiations with the Civil Service organisations with a view to establishing a genuine scheme of arbitration &mdash; a scheme of arbitration such as was promised to the Service in 1932 whereby legitimate differences between the Government, on the one hand, and Civil Service organisations, on the other, could be dealt with through a type of machinery which is now generally recognised as more calculated to settle these differences than the worthless Representative Council machinery for which the present Minister stands.  Is there any reason why the Government, which promised arbitration in 1932, should not accept a motion which asks it, six years afterwards, to honour the promise which was then freely made?  There can be only one explanation for the change of front&mdash;that the Minister made the promise in 1932 in an insincere way and that he had no intention whatever of keeping it.  Having got into office, he tries, with the aid of rather a unique type of commission of inquiry, to find any reason, no matter how slender, for rejecting the scheme of arbitration so specifically promised by himself.  Deputy Costello has ascribed another reason for the change of front.  He says that this attitude <Col N="1848" /> of the Minister is the work of the bureaucrats of the Department of Finance who have been able to convert the Minister to their view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They &ldquo;put the Minister in their pocket.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They had a very inconvenient article in their pocket when they had the Minister.  I certainly should not like to be the official who owned the pocket in which the Minister was.  I think Deputy Costello is right in ascribing the change on the part of the Minister to the type of rigid control which is exercised over him by the Department of Finance.  There may be some difference in the political complexion of the present Minister and the last Minister, though there are signs that that difference is rapidly receding.  However, it is supposed to be there and the present Minister would probably claim that it is still there.  There is, however, one thing common to this Minister and the last Minister&mdash;that the Department of Finance have effectively prevented both of them from establishing a genuine scheme of arbitration.  The present Minister, as Deputy Costello said, is as firmly riveted in the vice of that official mind as his predecessor was.  This whole question of the establishment of arbitration for the Civil Service is of very important concern to over 20,000 civil servants.  The Minister's Treason Act attempts to prevent them from withdrawing their labour. Consequently they are prepared, for the moment at all events, to rely on the method of making written or oral representations to the Minister.  Entrenched with all the authority of his position, the Minister has refused to listen with reason and understanding to the representations made, with the result that the Civil Service organisations have found that method of representing grievances decidedly unsatisfactory. They have asked that an arbitration tribunal should be established so that these disputes between the Government of the day and the Civil Service organisations be resolved by impartial consideration of the claims and of the case against the <Col N="1849" /> claims and a decision given on the merits.  Is there any good reason why a Minister for Finance concerned with the welfare of Irish civil servants should refuse to establish arbitration machinery which would enable grievances to be resolved in that manner? If the Minister feels that he has a good case why should he hesitate to put his case before a tribunal impartially constituted and capable of pronouncing judgment on the merits?  The only reason any fair-minded person can ascribe for the Minister's refusal to do that is that he knows that, under the present machinery, he can unreasonably and stubbornly refuse to meet representations made in a reasonable way, and he dare not go before an arbitration tribunal, where the merits of the case would be considered in an atmosphere far removed from that rigidity and stubbornness which are so characteristic of the attitude of the Department of Finance to Civil Service representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A contented Civil Service is a national asset.  It is desirable that the Civil Service should feel, when it makes a case for improved conditions or for avoiding the worsening of conditions, that it can rely on the merits of the case, and that that consideration will determine in the long run the extent to which the grievances will be met, or the worsening of conditions avoided. Nobody would pretend to-day that, however strongly fortified the Civil Service organisation was, a just case based on reason and equity would be met by reason and equity on the other side.  The Department of Finance has never met claims in that way, and probably never will, until there is a complete change in the mentality of the people responsible for the structure and maintenance of that Department. Twenty-three thousand civil servants are entitled to expect from this Parliament much more favourable consideration of their case than has so far been accorded by the present Minister.  If the Government and the Minister were genuinely concerned for promoting the welfare and efficiency of the Civil Service, they would not hesitate to accept a motion of this kind and enter into negotiations with the Civil Service organisations with a view to <Col N="1850" /> evolving a mutually-acceptable scheme of arbitration.  The present Minister does not want an acceptable scheme of arbitration.  He wants to be the finance Napoleon of 1938, sitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is fair to the pocket to put the Minister into it&mdash;capable of sitting in the Department of Finance and, from there, issuing decisions and edicts which are in no way related to the merits of the case presented to him.  If the Minister were concerned with the welfare of the Civil Service, he would not take his responsibilities in that manner.  He ought to say that he would make a genuine effort to establish an arbitration tribunal, particularly in view of the fact that it was he who, in 1932, definitely promised to establish such a tribunal.  The scheme which the Minister has offered to the Service has been rejected by all the organisations, and there is no likelihood that any of them will accept it at any future date, notwithstanding the effort of the Minister to weave words around the scheme calculated to mislead them.  It has been rejected, and will never be accepted by any of the staff organisations, and the Minister, therefore, is solely responsible for continuing the present deadlock in respect of arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some knowledge of the Civil Service, spreading back over close on 20 years, and I can say that I never knew a time when there was more discontent in the Civil Service than there is to-day.  The bulk of that discontent has been brought about by the stubborn, reactionary attitude of the Department of Finance, aided and abetted by the Minister's refusal to listen with reason and understanding to the claim of the Civil Service for a genuine scheme of arbitration.  Nobody will suggest that the present Minister for Finance will attain to great heights of statesmanship, but the Government have a responsibility over and above the Minister for Finance, and if statesmanship were to actuate them in this matter, and if they were desirous of promoting the welfare of the Civil Service, they would accept this motion <Col N="1851" /> and make a genuine effort to establish a scheme of arbitration such as was promised by the Minister in 1932, and such as would help to remove, in 1938, and in subsequent years, a good deal of the discontent which has been created by the Minister's unreasonable and truculent attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as <Col N="1852" /> possible.  Deputy Norton read out from some document information he had got to the effect that I had signed a document indicating that at one time I stated that I was in agreement as to arbitration between the Civil Service and the Government.  I always felt that way, and I feel that way now, but I certainly think that Deputy Norton has made a very bad case. Equally, I want to say that I find it very strange that this motion should come from the chief Opposition, who were for ten years a Government and who held a view against this arbitration when they were in office.  I do not think that Deputy O'Sullivan will dispute that fact.  It is only now that they have been converted to arbitration, and it amazes me to see the swopping of interests between Labour and Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton and, I presume, his Party, want everything both ways. Members of the Labour Party say that I want arbitration in industrial disputes. Quite true, I do, and I want Labour to say that they will agree to such arbitration.  Why they do not want arbitration in industrial disputes is clearly indicated by Deputy Norton. He says: &ldquo;In industry, we can withdraw our labour; we can have strikes,&rdquo; but, as he said at the beginning of his speech, the civil servants were not free.  I should like to refer Deputy Norton to this statement of his and, perhaps, when he reads it to-morrow, he will see how he wants to have it both ways.  He says there are 20,000 civil servants seething with discontent, who, for the present, are prepared to continue making written representations, and he implied, if he did not actually say, that if, at the end of writing, they got no satisfaction, we might be faced&mdash;if Deputy Norton could possibly organise it, and I doubt if he could&mdash;with the withdrawal of the entire Civil Service from their service to the State, and we might have a position in which the State would be at a standstill.  So Deputy Norton wants it both ways.  He wants the right to withdraw the Civil Service if they do not get the type of arbitration board which takes from the Minister who is responsible to this Dáil, and from the Government, any power or right after a decision <Col N="1853" /> is come to by it.  He wants to have it all his way.  I understand that this Government is in favour of arbitration in respect of the Civil Service and that the Civil Service should have an arbitration board, but it should be an arbitration board which will be satisfactory to all parties and not, as Deputy Norton wants to have it, a board which will have the right to issue a decision which cannot be upset by this Dáil.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Ministry are not prepared to give any bodies, other than bodies of a consultative and advisory character, the power of decision being in all cases reserved to the Minister. It is true that the Whitley bodies can only arrive at decisions by agreement and the official representatives on the bodies can always prevent a decision by refusing to agree.  But it is not right that Ministers should divest themselves of their powers and responsibilities by leaving it to such bodies to say what salaries will be payable in the Civil Service or not.  What the staff should have, and what the Ministry is prepared to give, is every facility for making known its views on matters affecting the Civil Service, for considering governmental proposals affecting the Civil Service, and giving their views on such proposals before the Government finally confirms a proposal into a decision.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The debate referred to is 17th July, 1924, but this extract is repeated in the official debates of 8th April, 1938, column 1840.  Deputy Cosgrave, who was then President, laid emphasis on the fact that no Government or Minister could allow the regulation of Civil Service salaries to be outside the control of the Ministry and the Government, because, after all, they are responsible for the taxation in order to pay those things. Deputy Norton wants to have that right in the hands of a body over which nobody would have any control afterwards.  I agree with the principle of arbitration.  I agreed with it in 1930 and in 1932, and I still agree with it, but when I say &ldquo;arbitration&rdquo; I mean arbitration.  I do not mean the type of arbitration that Deputy Norton is now speaking about&mdash;a pistol at the head of the Ministry: &ldquo;If you do not give us this type of arbitration we are going to call out our 20,000 civil servants on strike.&rdquo; That is the type of arbitration Deputy Norton wants to see in this country.  I am sure&mdash;at least, I hope&mdash;that Deputy Costello does not agree with that.  I agree that a means should be found whereby grievances can be discussed and adjusted, but I also say that even in private disputes if one side or the other cannot carry out an award, one side or the other goes under or goes out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case the Government cannot go out in that way.  They have got to carry on, and the taxpayer has to foot the bill afterwards. Deputy Norton made a speech which I consider very much beside the point. I cannot deal with all the notes I made here.  I will take an opportunity of doing so on some other occasion, because Deputy Norton will probably introduce a motion of this kind at a later date, worded slightly differently. I should like to know from Deputy Costello what has brought about the change in the opinions that were held <Col N="1857" /> by the Ministers of the Party opposite when they were over here?  I should like to know how far they agree with the Labour Party in this matter, and if they are prepared to deny that arbitration generally in all disputes, including industrial disputes, would be a welcome thing in this country, and that we should all do our best to find a way of setting up some court of arbitration to deal with all disputes, but not as the Labour Party want it&mdash; to apply only to the Civil Service and not to ordinary industrial disputes.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy who has last spoken had taken the trouble to read some of the speeches which I have made in this House on the subject of Civil Service arbitration he would have found the answer to every single one of the questions he has put here to-night.  Within the last 12 months I spoke on a motion by Deputy Norton, not calling upon the Government to set up machinery for arbitration, but calling upon the Government to arrange for a meeting to discuss the matter between representatives of the Civil Service organisations and the Minister for Finance. I thought at that time that that was refused.  The Minister for Finance did not even speak on Deputy Norton's motion at that time.  In the speech that I made in support of Deputy Norton's motion at that time, if Deputy Briscoe is interested, he will find the answer to every single one of the questions he has put here to-night. Time does not permit of my going into each one of them.  I was wondering why it was that Deputy Briscoe was put up to make the observations that he did.  It became perfectly apparent why he was put up.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe challenged the Labour Party as to whether or not they would state here in the House that they are in favour of industrial arbitration, and said that if they were, he would vote for this motion. That struck me as a very peculiar sort of bargain to make if the Deputy has, as he professes to have, any interest in the justice or merits of this motion before the House.  If Deputy Briscoe is, as apparently he pretends to be, in favour of the principle of arbitration in industrial disputes, why not vote for this motion, and give a lead to the settlement of industrial disputes by arbitration or on the principles of arbitration?</P>

      <P>Why not give a lead, if the Deputy is so anxious to do it? Here is a chance to give a lead in the case of the Government&mdash;which is supposed to be a model employer&mdash;dealing with its own servants.  If the Government or Deputy Briscoe or his Party wants to see set up in this country, as many of us would like to see, some sort of machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, why not give a lead here in the case of the model employer and its State servants?  Here you have got an ideal opportunity, if there is any sincerity whatever in the remarks made by Deputy Briscoe, of showing the real virtue of the principles of which the Deputy alleges he is in favour.  He should vote for this motion if there is any sincerity in what he said.  If the Deputy will take a look at some of the remarks I made before, he will see that I put forward this motion and advocated similar motions for that very reason&mdash;that they did give a lead.  The <Col N="1859" /> Deputy now has his chance.  Let him walk into the Division Lobby with us, or be branded as having made an insincere speech for purely political purposes, and for the purpose of getting the Minister for Finance out of some of the difficulties he got himself into in the speech he made in response to this motion and the speakers who supported it.</P>
      <P>I have not time to go through the irrelevancies, the irregularities, the fallacies, and the defamatory innuendoes in the Minister's speech.  The Minister appeared in this House some weeks ago in sackcloth and ashes and made public confession of his sins, and asked those whom he may have offended by certain things he said in the past about them to accept his apology.  I will accept that statement of his as covering some of the things that he said about me and Deputy Lavery in the course of his observations. The Minister, in the course of his speech, adopted a very favourite weapon that he has, a weapon which he uses in a fashion showing that he is willing to wound and yet afraid to strike.</P>
      <P>He put on the records of this House &mdash;and it is merely because it ought not to remain as part of the records of this House unchallenged that I refer to it &mdash;a statement which is capable of bearing an innuendo.  He had not the courage to make the charge fairly and squarely, because he knew it would be untrue and I could challenge it.  But I am not going to let it pass.  He made a statement in the course of his speech, as reported at column 1818 of the Official Report of the 8th April this year, which can bear one interpretation only, and that is, that when I was Attorney-General I gave some advice or opinion to the Government, whose chief legal adviser I then was, different from the legal opinion I offered in the course of the debate on this motion and on Deputy Norton's motion.  The innuendoes contained in the Minister's statement are grossly untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister will look in the records of his own Department, or in the records of the Attorney-General's Department, he will see there a <Col N="1860" /> memorandum prepared by me at great length in which I critically examined the financial clauses of the old Constitution, disclosed their weaknesses, and made certain recommendations.  These statements are entirely in conformity with every opinion I then held, with every opinion I hold now, and I say here categorically that I never gave an opinion to the last Government&mdash;and I have Deputy Cosgrave's authority to say this&mdash;that was in any way at variance with any of the utterances I made in the course of the debate on the motion.</P>

      <P>I gathered from the statement of the Minister here a couple of weeks ago that he was penitent and contrite for his sins, that he impliedly admitted he was in the habit of making defamatory statements about political opponents, statements that he knew were wounding and hurtful and harmful, and he offered full apology.  He may have had contrition, but, apparently, from what he said to-night, he lacked one essential of true contrition&mdash;a firm purpose of amendment.  He is going on with his old game again, if we are to draw any conclusions from his attitude. But there are more serious matters than my own personal position involved in this matter.  My reputation can take care of itself.  It is not a thing to be damaged by any of the things the Minister for Finance said about me.  The Minister was challenged by me and Deputy Lavery to produce any legal opinion contrary to the legal opinions we produced on the constitutionality of the proposals that we made on behalf of the civil servants.  He has not produced a single opinion to contradict either Deputy Lavery's opinion or mine.</P>
      <P>I deduced from his statement, when speaking here on this motion on Wednesday, 6th April of this year, that he sought for these opinions and had failed to get them.  I do not know what his observation means when he says, as reported at column 1621 of the Official Report of that debate:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The more I have endeavoured to get to the root of this arbitration question, the more I despair of getting any definite light or leading from lawyers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I gathered from that that he sought further opinions from lawyers contradicting the opinions which Deputy Lavery and I had given.</P>

      <P>He has not produced any opinion to contradict any of the opinions we have given here on the constitutionality of these proposals. Furthermore, I criticised the Brennan Commission on the arguments that they produced, and I am going to deal with <Col N="1862" /> the Minister's observations about my comments on them in a moment.  I criticised that report, based as it was on the alleged unconstitutionality of the arbitration proposals.  I dissected and analysed their statements and arguments, and showed the fallacies in them, and showed that they really had no real appreciation of the constitutional position.  There is not a single phrase from start to finish in the Minister's speech that he has any authority for, or that he now stands over or tries to stand over the proposition that setting up an arbitration board of this kind would be contrary to the provisions of either the old or new Constitution.  That is definitely and finally abandoned in the Minister's speech.  That was the basis of the argument of the Brennan Commission's interim report.  That was why I criticised the findings and the arguments in that report.  When I criticised that report in this House I had not the faintest idea of who the members of that commission were, and I was not interested in who they were.  What I was interested in was their arguments, their opinions, and the reasons for their opinions.  Any person's opinion is only worth the value of the reasons he offers for his opinion.  I criticised these opinions, and the reasons and the arguments put forward by the Brennan Commission, and not a single one of the arguments I advanced, or the opinions I gave, constitutionally or otherwise, cutting the ground from under every single line of the arguments in that report has been answered in the speech of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <P>What does he do?  He alleges that I made a personal attack on the members of the Commission.  That was a foul method of trying to deal with the reasoned argument I made.  I repeat every single word of the argument I made last April 12 months.  I criticised that Brennan Commission, and I stand over every word I said, and I repeat it here, and would go through it again if I had time.  I made no attack on the personnel of that Commission.  I did not even know who they were, and did not care.  But, what I was interested in was their reasons and opinions.  I took their opinions and <Col N="1863" /> reasons and I argued from their reasons and showed their reasons to be fallacies and their conclusions untenable, and, therefore, unsound.  Not a single one of the arguments I put forward at that time was subsequently answered in the speech of the Minister. Is there any greater justification for the criticisms I have levelled at the Brennan Commission report than the Minister's own speech and the omissions from that speech?  That is my justification for the speech I made, the criticisms I made then, and which I repeat here now with emphasis and with still greater conviction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe, and even the Minister, in the course of his speech, endeavoured to create the atmosphere that the civil servants, in making demands that they were making for an arbitration board, were asking for something beyond what the British civil servants have got from their Government and which they enjoy at the present time.  I made it clear last April 12 months, and in the opening statement on this motion, that the claims and demands of the Irish civil servants could be met by some concession similar to that granted to British civil servants.  Give us the same type of arbitration for our civil servants as British civil servants have under the British Treasury and we shall be perfectly content.</P>
    <P>We recognised, as can be verified from the two speeches I made, that it is the duty of the Minister to guard the taxpayers' money and to prevent increased taxation.  Above all, it is the duty, not alone of the Minister, but of every Deputy in this House, no matter to what Party he belongs, to preserve the paramount right of the Dáil over finance and to keep the control of the purse.  It is not the Minister who has the control of the purse or who has imposed upon him the statutory duty of safeguarding the public purse. It is the people's representatives, in the people's Parliament, who have that duty and that right.  That is the constitutional right that the Minister wants to take from them.  He wants to take that right from the people's control and put it in control of the <Col N="1864" /> Minister for Finance and, through the Minister for Finance, under the control of permanent civil servants.</P>
    <P>Civil servants in seeking this arbitration machinery have consistently stated that their claims are subject to that paramount right of control of the Dáil.  They have made it clear on every occasion.  I made it clear, speaking in favour of this motion and on every occasion on which I have advocated their claims.  I said that if there was anything wrong in the arbitration machinery suggested by the civil servants, if there was anything wrong in putting their proposals into operation, then there must be something constitutionally wrong with the British scheme and there was something wrong in the operation of that machinery in England.  But, as we know, the arbitration machinery in England has been operated for many years to the great satisfaction of the Civil Service there, of the Ministry in England, and the British taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Deputy Briscoe getting up here in the last few minutes, asking us are we going to increase taxation.  The Deputy and his Party have increased taxation to the extent of nearly £750,000 during the time they have been in office, by the recruitment of civil servants rendered necessary by the policy which they were operating.  It ill becomes Deputy Briscoe or Deputy Corry to taunt this Party about increased taxation.  It was because of the conservative finance of the last Government and their safeguarding of public finances during the ten years they were responsible for the government of this country, that the present Government could for the last six years, pursue an uninterrupted rake's progress in dissipating the resources built up by Deputy Cosgrave and his Ministers when they were in control.  It is because of the sound financial condition of the nation's finances when Deputy Cosgrave left office that we can now emerge successfully as a solvent State from that orgy of spending to negotiate with the British Government.  It ill becomes the Minister for Finance, or any of his back-benchers, to cast charges of that  against Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="1865" /> anybody else on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked me if I could reconcile my attitude with the attitude of Deputy Cosgrave.  If Deputy Briscoe will read the speech which I made last April 12 months, he will see the answer there.  I have not the time, nor the desire, to repeat it now but I anticipated then what the Minister would say.  The Minister had shown no desire then to get on his legs to answer any of the arguments or to take part in the debate at all, and I had to anticipate some of the arguments which would be advanced if he did speak.  I anticipated that he would have a rap at the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  The Minister forgot, in speaking, to have that rap at the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and he put up Deputy Briscoe to have that rap to-night.  The answer is there, given by me on the 28th April, 1937.  We had, during that period of ten years when Deputy Cosgrave was President of the Executive Council, to stand up to a campaign of vilification and slander the like of which was never known in the history of any democratic State, a campaign led by the Minister himself with the support of Deputies like Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Corry.  It is a pity that Deputy Corry is now deprived of the opportunity of filling a rôle that well becomes him, the rôle of a sort of Walt Disney hobgoblin, dancing round the cross-roads with his placard showing the salaries of the judges from the Chief Justice down&mdash;the same salaries, by the way, which are still being paid, but only to a greater number of judges&mdash;the salaries that are paid to Ministers, which are again at the same figure as when Deputy Cosgrave was in office&mdash; salaries all of which are voted by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Corry.  I <Col N="1866" /> do not want, however, to go into these matters.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement I said that I put this motion down immediately after the last general election, so that this thing could be taken out of party politics, once and for all.  I want to get no votes, as has been alleged, out of this motion.  We want to get no party advantage from this motion.  If there is to be any question of party advantage or party disadvantage from voting on this motion, can you imagine the farmers who are members of this Party gaining any party advantage from voting for, or supporting, a motion of this kind? But they have the courage to do it. The Minister had not that courage although he must have been persuaded by the speeches made in this debate of the justice of this claim.  It is because they are convinced of its justice, of its correctness and rectitude, but, above all things, because of the fact that in supporting a motion of this kind they believe they are doing something for the best interests of the general community, that members of this Party will vote for the motion.</P>
