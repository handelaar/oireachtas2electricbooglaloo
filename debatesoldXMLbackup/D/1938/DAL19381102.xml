    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he has had under consideration the position of Irish citizens covered in respect of nationality by the Citizenship and Nationality Act, and who are permanently resident in Great Britain, regarding liability for military service in that country in the event of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have had under consideration the question as to whether Irish citizens permanently, or ordinarily, resident in Great Britain would be liable for military service in that country in the event of war.  Irish citizens permanently, or ordinarily, resident in Great Britain would not, as such, be liable to military service in that country in the event referred to.</P>
      <P>No comprehensive code of nationality law existed in this country until the year 1935.  In that year two statutes were enacted to clarify the constitutional and international position in the matter of Irish nationality, namely (1) the twenty-sixth amendment of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann whereby the territorial limitation of the citizenship created by that Constitution was removed; and (2) the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935, which defined Irish citizenship for all purposes, national and international, and set up legal machinery for its regulation. There is now no law in force in this country whereby any person possesses or can acquire any nationality other than Irish nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be borne in mind, however, <Col N="182" /> that, prior to the enactment of the Constitution of 1922, Irish-born persons and the children born abroad of Irish-born fathers acquired British nationality at birth under the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Acts, which were part of the law of the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  The British law to which I have referred has not been altered in this connection in Great Britain since the coming into operation of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann.  That law is not consistent with the present international status of Ireland or with the international character of the relations now existing between the two countries. So long as this anomaly continues, it is obvious that, in the event of war, there is a danger of a conflict of view with regard to the question of the liability for military service in Great Britain of certain Irish citizens permanently or ordinarily resident there, those, namely, who are claimed as possessing British nationality under British law.</P>
    <P>The position under Irish law is quite definite.  Every person who acquired Irish citizenship by virtue of the Constitution of 1922, or who has acquired or acquires Irish citizenship by or under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935, possesses Irish nationality only, and should not be liable to military service in Great Britain in the event of war, whether temporarily or permanently resident in that country.  Our statute law is in conformity with the Hague Convention of 1930 on certain questions relating to the conflict of nationality laws, and with the principles internationally recognised as applicable to nationality laws.  The Government are advised that a law enacted in any other country under which the Government of that country would now or in the future claim to impose military service on all persons permanently or ordinarily resident there, on the ground that such persons were born in Ireland or were born of Irish parentage, would not be consistent with that convention or with those principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether, apart from the reply he has now read, it has been intimated to the <Col N="183" /> British Government that we regard citizens of Ireland, either under the Constitution or under the Citizenship and Nationality Act, immune from liability to conscription if resident in Great Britain at the time of the enactment of a conscription code there?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been, so far as I am aware, no definite intimation of that sort given.  It seemed to us to follow from our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider the matter of such vital importance to many Irish residents in Britain that it is desirable that it should be emphasised to the British Government, so as to make our position clear long before a crisis arises in which these people may be conscripted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite all right, but the question is: Are you going to get agreement?  It is obvious that you must get agreement if you are not going to have a conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking that the British Government should agree, because it does not seem to me to be important that they should, once we emphasise the fact that we regard our people as being immune from the conscription laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Does the Minister then say that we regard our people as being immune from a conscription code in Great Britain?</P>

Regard has been had to the fact that the laundry staff will be disemployed and the question of the payment of gratuities is under consideration.</P>

      <P>Immigration officers, appointed under the Aliens Order, 1935, examine all persons coming to this country from places outside this country other than Great Britain and Northern Ireland. These officers have discretion to refuse leave to land to aliens and to impose restrictions on the activities of aliens whom they allow to land.  Aliens coming to take up employment are not allowed to land unless they are in possession of employment permits issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>There is no passport barrier between this country and Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and aliens who have been given permission to reside in Great Britain or Northern Ireland are entitled to come here during the period for which permission has been granted to them.  The Minister for Justice, however, may require such aliens to leave.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has power to vary the conditions on which an alien was allowed to land by an immigration officer, and to add new conditions at any time.  He has, further, power to order the deportation of an alien.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aliens who have resided here for more than three months are required <Col N="188" /> to register with the police.  Their activities are kept under review continually and they are not allowed to engage in any trade, profession, or employment without the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Citizens, subjects and nationals of the following countries are exempted by the Aliens (Exemption) Order, 1935, from the restrictive provisions of the Aliens Act and Orders:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Dominion of Canada.</P>

    <P>The Union of South Africa.</P>
    <P>Newfoundland.</P>
    <P>India.</P>
    <P>There is no restriction on the immigration of these persons, but, in regard to engaging in manufacturing industries, they are, of course, subject to the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Acts, 1932-34.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that, arising out of the British penal duties on agricultural produce from this country, the Irish Railway Clearing House published in February, 1938, a scale of customs clearance charges dealing with dutiable and non-dutiable goods; and if, in view of the alteration in the tariffs since the settlement of the economic war, and the detrimental effect that these charges are having, particularly on the poultry industry, he will direct the attention of the Irish Railway Clearing House to the desirability of reviewing the customs clearance charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scale of customs clearance charges published in February, 1938, varied only in minor respects from that previously in operation.  Since the coming into operation of the recent Trade Agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom, the carrying companies have applied the scale of clearance charges for non-dutiable commodities to those exported from this country which for the purposes of free entry into the United Kingdom do not require to be accompanied by a certificate of origin.  In the case of poultry and other commodities requiring the certificate of origin to secure free entry into the United Kingdom, the carrying companies maintain that the work of clearance involved has not materially diminished, and have continued to charge for customs clearance at the rate applicable to dutiable commodities. My Department has been investigating the possibilities of securing a modification of these charges, and would be assisted towards that end if exporters would carefully follow the advice given in the recent Departmental circulars as to the need for exercising greater care in the preparation of certificates of origin so as to ensure that all necessary information is correctly given therein in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that those customs clearance charges had a disastrous effect on a certain <Col N="206" /> type of poultry trade which existed before the penal tariffs came into operation? The type of trade to which I refer is the small weekly order from retail traders on the other side, which was a much stronger business in the poultry trade than we have to-day. The trade we have to-day is practically 100 per cent. with big wholesalers on the other side.  The Minister must realise that the regular weekly order from the retailer on the other side was more valuable altogether. That has gone as a result of those customs clearance charges.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the length of net allowed for salmon fishing from Youghal Bridge to Ardmore is not sufficient to allow reasonable opportunity to fishermen to earn a living and maintain their families, and whether he will have an early inquiry set up to report on the matter before next season so that he will be in a position to make an order permitting the use of a net of a length sufficient to meet reasonably the fishermen's needs at Youghal and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>My attention has previously been drawn by Deputy Little to the dissatisfaction of local netsmen with regard to the length of net permitted for use in salmon fishing in the estuary of the Blackwater river under the existing by-law.  I am not empowered under the provisions of the fisheries code to modify that by-law unless it can be shown that any such modifications would be likely to result in benefit to the fisheries of the river as a whole.  If the netsmen concerned will furnish me with a written statement showing, <i>prima facie,</i> that a case exists for investigation of the matter on that basis, I will arrange to have a public inquiry held.</P>

      <P>Well, the position is that the Minister has the authority to make the order.  For the moment, I am not concerned so much with the general welfare as with the opportunities of the fishermen in that river, and I would ask the Minister to see that an inquiry is set up.  Bad as the conditions were last year, the fishing of that portion of the river will end altogether unless those men get the extension which they demand.  I do not wish to make a speech on the matter, but I am sure it is not the Minister's wish that those men should be deprived of their way of living?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As the long title shows, this is a Bill &ldquo;to make further and better provision in relation to the purchase and sale (including export) of eggs by way of trade, whether wholesale or retail, and for the registration and control of persons engaged by way of trade in purchasing, selling, exporting, preserving, or otherwise dealing in eggs.&rdquo;  This Bill continues the provisions <Col N="236" /> of the 1924 and 1930 Acts and extends those provisions in many respects.  The Bill is set out in five parts, and it is intended that all five parts shall be brought into operation at the same time.  When this Bill comes into operation, the provisions of the 1924 and 1930 Acts will be repealed.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the contents of this Bill, I think it would be well to give a review of the working of the 1924 and 1930 Acts.  The 1924 Act, which is the first of this code, dealt entirely with exports.  It dealt with the export of eggs and in particular with the persons engaged in the export trade.  Under that Act, these exporters were registered.  They were required to have suitable premises and were bound to test, grade and pack eggs in conformity with the regulations.  It was provided that there would be inspection of these premises and also inspection of eggs at the point of export, whether they were being exported by sea or over the land frontier. It was provided, also under the 1924 Act, that if a consignment were found to be defective under the regulations, a package or packages could be forfeited. It was further provided that an exporter with a bad record for forfeitures would eventually lose his licence.  In practice many exporters who lost their licences had them restored after some time.  During the time that these exporters were off the register, having had their licences cancelled, they could not export eggs, but they could sell on the home market. That is one of the troubles that have arisen from the 1924-30 legislation of which we must take account.  The producers were altogether out of the Act of 1924, and so were the dealers, but both producer and dealer could be prosecuted for selling bad or dirty eggs In addition, dealers might have a package forfeited if it were examined on the premises and if eggs below the standard which had been laid down were found in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The theory of the 1924 Act was that if pressure could be exerted on the exporters so that they would not be permitted to export eggs unless they <Col N="237" /> were of good quality, they in turn would not take eggs from procedures unless the eggs were up to the standard that they required, that that pressure would go back to the producer, and that the producer eventually would have to market his eggs in good condition, otherwise they would not be taken from him.  It was thought at that time that by dealing in this way with the exporters the desired result would be achieved the whole way back to the producer. Naturally it was expected also that if the quality of eggs for export were greatly improved the quality of eggs for consumption on the home market would also be improved and that we would get an all-round improvement in the egg trade in this country. These hopes, however, did not materialise.  There is no doubt that there were many exporters who were quite willing and anxious to co-operate with the Department in improving the quality of the eggs, and when the Act was first passed many exporters refused to take eggs unless they were fresh and of good quality.  These exporters found, however, after some time that if they did not take them other exporters would take them. The exporters who were willing to take all eggs offered to them, whatever kind they might be, were favoured by the collectors of eggs throughout the country and those exporters who set out to co-operate with the Department to improve our eggs found that their trade was going from them and eventually they also had to take all eggs as they were offered to them.</P>
    <P>The collectors had the same story to tell.  The collector who went round the country to collect eggs from producers may have made an attempt in the beginning to refuse such eggs as were not up to required standard, but he found from experience that other collectors were willing to take them. He found that he was losing his connections and his trade, and eventually he had to do as others did and take all eggs as they came to him, with the result that the improvement which was expected from the passing of the <Col N="238" /> 1924 Act was of short duration. After a very short time the number of forfeitures began to increase and there was no marked improvement in the quality of the eggs presented at the ports.  As I have said already, where an exporter had a bad record, and where a number of forfeitures were made, the Minister for Agriculture at the time, whether my predecessor or myself, removed the name of the exporter from the register, but he could still continue in trade.  He could continue to collect eggs from his customers and put those eggs on the home market.  There was no regulation with regard to the sale of eggs on the home market and the result was that worse eggs were being put on the home market than those which were being exported.  I am afraid that, in consequence, a number of consumers in this country, both in the City of Dublin and in other towns, were turned against eggs for a long time to come.  It will take a long time before a person who is given a bad egg to eat can face another one.</P>
    <P>In 1930 another Act was passed.  It was considered at that time very carefully by the Minister and by officials of the Department whether they should not extend the provisions of the legislation so as to control the producer and the collector.  After long consideration, they came to the conclusion that by tightening up the provisions that were already in the 1924 Act, by filling some of the gaps that were left in that Act, and by giving inspectors more powers under that Act, there might be still some hope of improving the quality of our eggs, by concentrating on the exports and by leaving the producer and the collector as they were.  They did not like at that time to go ahead with the full provisions outlined here and they gave the regulation of exports a further trial.  There was one important amendment made by the 1930 Act and that was that no person would be permitted to test and grade eggs unless he was a qualified person, but even so, I think it will be admitted now that the 1930 Act did not improve matters very much more than they had been improved by the <Col N="239" /> 1924 Act.  At that time too, and since then, every opportunity was taken to stress the view that if wholesalers were to take concerted action and refuse to take all eggs below export standard, the quality and price of eggs on the home market and the export market would be greatly improved.  As I have said already, many of the wholesalers agreed with this, but so long as there were any exporters who were prepared to take a risk and try to get by the inspectors with stale eggs, nothing could be done to improve matters.  At any rate, the improvement which we hoped to achieve from the legislation passed in 1924 and 1930 fell very far short of being realised.</P>
    <P>The old position remained after the 1930 Act was passed, and that is that the collectors found that, if they wanted to remain in business, they had to take all eggs presented to them.  The wholesalers found the same.  Numerous prosecutions were instituted against dealers throughout the country, after the 1930 Act was passed, for buying or selling or for having in their possession dirty eggs or eggs not fit for human consumption. It was found that the penalties inflicted were not nearly drastic enough to prevent the abuses that were being carried on.  There was a tendency, as a matter of fact, to regard the sale or purchase of dirty eggs as a minor offence, whereas the truth, as I think everybody will admit who goes into this trade deeply, is as regards a very large proportion of the stale eggs which reach the consumer, that the cause of that is the marketing, in the first instance, of dirty eggs by the producer.  Perhaps we may say that producers have not fully realised their own position and responsibility in this matter: that they have continued to carry on presenting dirty eggs for sale in spite of all the propaganda and all the appeals and so on that have been made to them in their own interests.</P>
    <P>Now another, and perhaps one of the biggest troubles that we have in the egg trade, one which we have failed to solve so far by legislation, is <Col N="240" /> the stale egg&mdash;the egg that becomes stale because it is held too long from the time it is laid until it reaches the consumer.  The previous Acts did not directly penalise the person who had stale eggs except in so far as it was necessary to mark them second quality when they were consigned for export; but in spite of that provision it was found that a large quantity of stale eggs continued to reach the export market&mdash;eggs which were not marked stale according to the regulation. Then, of course, the home market, to which this provision did not apply, received quite a lot of stale eggs which were not marked at all, or which perhaps were exposed for sale as fresh eggs or newly-laid eggs.</P>
    <P>The big trouble appears to be, especially in times of rising prices, that everybody along the line from the producer to the retailer holds the eggs too long.  The producer of the eggs finds that the price is going up perhaps slightly week by week, and he does not see any great inducement to hurry his eggs out to the market.  He keeps them too long, and when they are taken by the collector they are already&mdash;well, somewhat overdue.  The collector, again, finds that there is a rising market, and there is nothing to induce him to send on the eggs to the wholesaler or the exporter, as he is described now, and he holds them too long.  The exporter holds them longer than he should, and eventually they are either exported or sold to a retailer to be put on the home market, but the position is that they have been held too long.</P>
    <P>That is one of the matters that we want to remedy, if we can, under this present legislation.  The stale egg, I think, may be described as the central problem of our egg trade, and it must be dealt with as provided for in the Bill if we are to put the trade on a secure foundation.  There is even more necessity for that now than ever before because in our export trade we are, year after year, up against keener competition.  Every year it is more difficult to hold our position, such as it is, on the export market. Under these circumstances, I think the Dáil will agree that a drastic extension  <Col N="241" /> of the partial measures of State control embodied in the existing Acts is not only desirable but essential if we are to retain, not to speak of advancing, our position on the export market, and, what is perhaps more important in present circumstances, to increase the demand for eggs on the home market.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, contains provisions providing for the acceleration of the movement of eggs from the time they are laid until they reach the consumer both on the part of the producer through the collector and through the wholesaler and on to the retailer, whether that retailer is living at home or somewhere else, and is receiving our eggs as exported eggs.  Under this new legislation, therefore, we are making new provisions.  One of them is that dealers&mdash;so far they have not been controlled&mdash;who now acquire eggs for transmission to wholesalers must be registered.  They will be required to have suitable premises, and power is being taken to make regulations compelling them to dispose of their eggs within a specified period after acquisition.  They cannot in future, according to the Bill before the House now, hold these eggs longer than the prescribed time.  They must pack the eggs at the time of acquisition in packages of standard design, bearing a prescribed number, and put with each lot of eggs a docket bearing the name and address of the producer, so that when the eggs are afterwards examined, tested and so on it will be possible to find out who is the owner of the stale or bad eggs as the case may be.  A registered dealer can acquire eggs only from a producer unless he has a special licence to get eggs from another dealer.  He can dispose of his eggs only through a registered wholesaler unless he has a special licence to sell by retail.  He must keep records of all his acquisitions and of all his disposals, and these records must be entered within a prescribed time.  He will not be allowed to carry on business unless on registered premises.  He can be prosecuted for buying dirty eggs from producers, or for having dirty or bad eggs in his possession after the prescribed time for the disposal of those eggs, or for <Col N="242" /> selling dirty eggs which had been obtained from producers.</P>
    <P>He may be provisionally registered on application.  We do not want to come down suddenly on those people who have been in the egg trade for a long time&mdash;dealers and collectors.  We do not want to come down on them suddenly and tell them that their premises are not fit to carry on business in, and put them out of business. We are prepared to register them provisionally, to give them some little time to get their premises in order, but we must insist that they will get their premises in order as quickly as possible.  A dealer's registration may be cancelled for contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or of any of the regulations.  He will have to pay registration fee of £1, and also an annual fee of £1.  Those who are now registered as exporters will automatically become registered as wholesalers. They will no longer be called exporters but will be known as wholesalers. Pending the examination of premises they must, of course, get them into order before they get definite registration afterwards.  Registration will be either confirmed or withheld when the premises are examined.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, there is a fee collected from wholesalers at the moment, according to the amount of eggs dealt with for export, and that will continue.  There will be a fee collected from wholesalers, according to the amount of eggs which pass through their hands.  It will not be necessary, however, to pay fees on the same consignment of eggs twice.  If one wholesaler buys from another it is not intended to collect the fee from more than one wholesaler for that transaction.  If a wholesaler acquires eggs directly from producers he will be subject to the same regulations that I have already mentioned as the collector or dealer.  He must pack the eggs in standard boxes with a docket of identification showing what producer they came from.  He must test, grade and pack the eggs and mark them according to the regulations, but we may make different regulations for <Col N="243" /> the export and for the home trade. We may also make regulations compelling the wholesaler to stamp each individual egg with a code mark, indicating the time the egg was packed on his premises.  To those who are not closely identified with the egg trade that may seem a bit drastic, but the necessity for it is this: Deputies who may not be acquainted with the tricks of the trade may say that the date on the boxes, as is already the case, ought to be sufficient.  It is not because&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;there are wholesalers on the export markets who are quite capable of taking the board with the date off the box and putting a new board with another date on.  The only way to deal with the matter is to code date each egg, because they will not go to the trouble of taking a mark off an egg and putting another in its place.</P>
    <P>The wholesaler must have his eggs tested, graded and packed before they are consigned from his premises and, just like a dealer, he is forbidden to carry on trade except on registered premises.  He must test the eggs within the prescribed time and dispose of them within a prescribed period. These regulations run through the various people dealing with eggs, because the big object of the Bill is to see that the eggs travel as fast as possible from one party to another. Registration can be cancelled for contravention of the Act, for breach of contract in the purchase or sale of eggs, or for altering the marks on packages of eggs either exported or used at home, or for acting in any way that is calculated to injure the reputation of Irish eggs.  It will be an offence for a wholesaler to sell dirty eggs or eggs unfit for human consumption, or to purchase dirty eggs and have them on his premises after a prescribed time unless they are put aside and so marked.  The Bill provides that eggs that do not reach the prescribed standard must be marked to show that they are second-quality eggs.  It will be an offence for a wholesaler or a retailer to offer, consign, or sell any second-quality eggs not so marked, and for the purposes <Col N="244" /> of the Bill all eggs that do not reach the standard of second-quality eggs will be deemed unfit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>The powers conferred on the inspectors are somewhat similar to the powers they have under existing legislation. There is one other power added, and that is that eggs intended for export shall be presented for examination at a particular place and time. The inspector may alter that if he finds it necessary that they should be presented for examination at a particular place and time.  Deputies may think that that is interfering with legitimate trade in a drastic manner, but the reason is this: Under the old legislation it was not an uncommon practice for exporters to present a large amount of eggs for examination half an hour before a boat was due to sail. Naturally, of course, they urged the inspectors to hurry up the examination so that they would not miss the boat, and the owners of the boat also urged the inspectors to hurry, with the result that the inspectors could not do the business properly.  There is a suspicion that these eggs could have been presented for examination three or four hours before the boat was due to sail, just as well as half an hour before it sailed, and so the necessity arises of making a regulation of this kind, that eggs must be presented for examination at a given time and at a given place, as the case may be, so that there will be reasonable time for examination. The conditions with regard to preservers are similar to those in the existing Acts.  There is also power in the Bill to require retailers to register. That is put in for a reason.  As I state, wholesalers in future will have to pay certain fees both on eggs exported and on eggs sold on the home market.  They are very small. A big retailer would have the slight advantage in purchasing eggs directly from producers of not having to pay that fee, and in such a case we may serve notice on such retailers that we will require them to registers in the register of retailers.  We can then collect the required fee for any eggs that they may purchase from producers. It is not intended that the provision should apply to retailers in <Col N="245" /> general.  It is only intended to apply to very big retailers who might have an unfair advantage over wholesalers compared with the present position.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to say that the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Consultative Council, on which body there are representatives of wholesalers, of dealers, and purchasers, have agreed in general with the provisions of this Bill.  I believe the Bill is essential to the well-being of the egg industry as a whole, and it has been designed with the object of placing the industry in the position which it should occupy, having regard to the natural advantages of this country for egg production.  At this stage I do not want to go into the point as to our relative position with regard to prices on the foreign market.  No doubt Deputies will quote figures, but we think it necessary to bring in this legislation, because we believe we can get a better price for our eggs on the foreign market than we have been getting.  We believe that by getting a reputation for Irish eggs as fresh eggs we can, therefore, get a much better price than we are getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>I want to warn Deputies, however, against this because I think some time ago I might have made the mistake myself, that you cannot compare the price of, say, North of Ireland eggs with eggs produced in this part of the country because the standards are not the same.  In other words, you would get a bigger weight of North of Ireland eggs in the standard that corresponds to ours.  As far as I can find out, taking weight for weight, fresh eggs against fresh eggs, the North of Ireland eggs are getting about 1½d. a dozen more than ours at the moment. In addition to that, remember we are paying a bounty.  So that there is a good margin for us to make up.  If we got the reputation of Irish eggs on the British market that they should have if they were fresh we should get, say, 1½d. or perhaps even more per dozen for our eggs than we are getting at the moment.  There is one thing the <Col N="246" /> North of Ireland eggs have that we cannot get, that is, North of Ireland eggs are not marked; in other words, they are home produced eggs to the British purchaser.  Our eggs are marked.  As I said here before in this House it is, if you like, one of the penalties we have to pay for being separated from the United Kingdom. But we can come near, I am quite sure, the price of the United Kingdom egg if we get a reputation for having a good egg.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I want to say before I sit down and that is that in the Department of Agriculture, I think, both in the time of my predecessor and my own time, we have been rather strict in the administration of these Egg Acts.  Whenever we found that there were, say, three or four forfeitures in a year from any particular exporter we came and cancelled the licences.  I can assure the House that if this Bill goes through both Houses and becomes law, I have no intention of relaxing in that way. In fact, I think it would be well to be even more strict than we have been in the past.  We want to be fair, of course, and I think that egg exporters will admit that they are never taken too shortly; they generally get very good notice; they are warned and so on before their licences are cancelled. As I say, I think there will be no relaxation in the future in administering this Act if it is passed and, if anything, I think we should be a bit more strict and see if we can at all get the standard of Irish eggs improved whether for the foreign market or for home consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions I would like to ask the Minister before the discussion starts.  One is with regard to retailers:  Can a keeper of a poultry farm, not being registered as a retailer, supply eggs direct to customers?  The second question is with regard to premises.  Does that cut out the buying on the roadside by way of lorries or cars?  Are they to be regarded as premises or can eggs not be bought on the roadside in future?</P>

      <P>With regard to collecting eggs, dealers can collect as usual except that they must register and there will be stricter provision with regard to the containers and so on in which they collect the eggs.</P>

      <P>I was sorry to hear the Minister say there would have to be drastic extension of Government control in this matter because I am afraid the experience we have in this country, and practically every other country, of Government control of any industry of any type or even portion of an industry has not been very satisfactory, and I think if there could be some other way besides an extension of drastic Government control it would probably be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>But we have to consider this new Act in all its implications. We are here legislating, or supposed to be legislating, for the betterment of the egg trade and poultry industry generally.  I wonder if we are. Are we satisfied that we are?  I entirely agree with the Minister that any steps that are necessary to be taken to see that we get a better price for our eggs ought to be taken.  I entirely agree with that.  But I wonder if all the regulations which we have laid down in this very comprehensive and very far-reaching Bill will have the desired effect.  The Minister, after all, has not told us, in introducing this Bill, what were the losses which we suffered <Col N="248" /> as the result of inadequate marking of eggs or anything else.  He has told us there were certain forfeitures, that certain people lost their licences but, on the whole, we do not know whether the country generally has lost very much by the laxity, if you like, of the law.</P>
      <P>Reading over this Bill, and particularly after listening to the Minister, we find that there are a lot of clauses in this Bill which are imposing new costs upon the people who are in the egg trade.  I am not speaking for the egg trade at all, but I do presume that what will happen is that the cost will be handed down, and that the producer will in fact get a worse price for his eggs than he did before the Bill was introduced at all.  We have registered premises, we have registration fees, we have retailers' fees, we have annual fees, and we have eggs acquisition fees.  In addition to that, the Minister told us that there will have to be certain records taken and kept which appear to me to be all-embracing. Those records will require a clerk of some kind always in attendance to see that they are kept.  It may be necessary.  If it is necessary, it is very unfortunate, but, as I said, our object is to try and get a better price for eggs.  Are we going to get it that way?  Our object also ought to be to get more production of eggs.  Are we going to get it this way?  That will be the test of whether we are doing good or ill.  One would imagine that we were legislating for a thriving industry. We are not, as a matter of fact.  We are legislating for an industry that, very unfortunately, has shown a considerable drop for the last five or six years.  In 1931, the price of our exported eggs was £2,181,000.  In 1937, it was £857,000.  That is taken from the figures published by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That being so, we ought to concentrate all our efforts on the production of more eggs, and, by all means, better eggs, and, by all means, in better condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am uneasy about is that the restrictions which this Bill carries with it, and the implications of the various <Col N="249" /> clauses in it will not bring us better prices, and will not hold out any inducements to people to produce more eggs, or to produce more poultry. Those are the things I would like to see being done at the present time.  I would like to see the Minister and the Government, and every person interested in this question, going into the matter fully and endeavouring to find out what was at the root of the failure of the egg industry.  Why is it there?  If it has got to the position in which it is now because of the laxity of regulations, then let us tighten things up.  I am afraid that is not being done; I am afraid the rot has come from some other cause, and we ought to try to eliminate that cause. I do not think we are doing it here.</P>
    <P>If we consider this Bill we will find &mdash;at least to my mind this is the position&mdash;that there are some things in it that are not convincing; there are some things in it that require more explanation than the Minister has given.  Section 3 sets out that the Minister is entitled to give a certificate for efficiency.  I should like to know from the Minister in what way are people going to become efficient in this connection.  How do they become efficient? Is there to be a school at which certificates will be issued, or will the Minister grant a certificate on the word of somebody who possibly has not much knowledge of the matter?  Will the granting of the certificate in this matter require possibly the attendance of a T.D. of the right or the wrong colour, or any colour, or will a letter have to be sent to the Minister saying, &ldquo;Please give a certificate to so-and-so?&rdquo;  I do not know how the Minister is to certify a person to be fit and efficient in testing, grading and packing eggs.  How does the Minister propose to do it?  If it is going to be done at all, it ought to be done in the right manner.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the registration of premises.  Section 12 sets out that the Minister shall cause to be kept a register to be known as the register of wholesalers, a register to be known as the register of dealers, a register of <Col N="250" /> retailers, and a register of preservers. In sub-section 3 of that section it is stated that premises registered in any one of the registers shall not while so registered be capable of being registered in any other of the said registers. I would like to know how that will affect wholesalers who might also be retailers.  Can they not be both?  I think in country towns they are for the most part wholesalers and retailers. They are people who buy eggs and are wholesalers and exporters and they also are the people from whom the public in the locality buy eggs&mdash;the people in the towns buy their eggs from them.  I would like to know how this section is going to operate in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have under Sections 13, 14 and 15 fixed fees to be paid by the various people who are registered.  The Minister informed me in reply to a question just now that he may not demand that certain people should be registered at all.  If that is so, I do not see where is the purpose of having registration under this Bill.  If the Minister thinks we ought to have drastic Government control he ought not to be letting people out by the back door.  If he thinks it is necessary to have registration, then we ought to have it.</P>
    <P>I would like to put one point to the Minister.  It is a point that was put to me very forcibly, and there may be a good deal to be said in favour of it. If I were to consult my own convenience, or the convenience of my neighbours, possibly I might not make the suggestion.  Very likely the Minister knows that eggs in Denmark must be sold in the open market, sold to registered dealers in the open market, and the person engaged in the wholesale purchase of eggs cannot engage in any other business.  A case was put up to me, and the person who men tioned it said there was a good deal in favour of it, and a great deal in it that was quite reasonable.  The point was that the purchase of eggs on the roadside and in shops other than those belonging to egg dealers, has led largely to the abandonment of the small towns.  I think that is quite true.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> I think that if eggs had to be sold in the small towns in the open market, and not in shops that do other business; if they had to be sold in premises which are used only for the egg trade, you would have the people still supporting the small towns.</P>
    <P>That point was put to me with a great deal of force, and I think there is a great deal of truth in it.  We know that the small towns are becoming down and out, and if we have an opportunity of doing something for them, we should take every advantage of it.  If we could succeed in bringing the people into the towns in order to support the towns, and if we could succeed in having the eggs bought in the towns only, then it might be a good day's work.  It might be said that I am there speaking possibly against my own interests, but I maintain that the interests of the small towns in different parts of the country come before individual interests.  I think it is a point worth considering.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he ever has had any complaints with regard to the transport companies in the matter of eggs.  I have heard a good deal of complaints about transport companies, and particularly shipping companies, complaints with regard to delays and other matters of a similar nature.  As a matter of fact, it was alleged on one occasion&mdash;I do not know what truth is in this&mdash;that the delay in delivering certain packages of eggs which were declared to be stale when they arrived at their destination, was due to the shipping companies.  Is the Minister satisfied with regard to transport facilities?  If there are any difficulties in that connection, we ought to try to meet them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be in any hurry with the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I regard this as a very important Bill.  There is no other industry which I could regard as of so much importance to the small farmers, no industry which means so much in connection with the contentment of the people and of the country generally. After all, the contentment of a family generally lies with the housewife.  The money derived from this industry, in <Col N="252" /> the past at any rate, was the money on which the country people traded; it was the money which gave them any little comforts they had.  I declare that the drop in that line during the last five years has been responsible for a lot of the discontent that has been observed in this country.  I ask the Minister again not to hurry with the Committee Stage, because the Bill is very important.  All the information that can possibly be got from any persons interested in this industry ought to be got before we devise this machinery.  We must make an effort to meet all points and have an eye all the time on this particular aspect, that we want more eggs and that we want more money for the eggs.  These are the main essentials.  Unless we are going to attain that standard, the Bill is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, I like this Bill and I do not quite appreciate the number of objections that Deputy Brennan has to it.  I do not like his suggestion about the selling of eggs in the open market, even for the purpose of maintaining our small country towns.  In my judgment, it would cut across the whole purpose of the Bill; it would cut across the whole purpose of improving the quality of the eggs, and in my opinion that is the vital thing.  Deputy Brennan said he wanted to see more eggs produced.  I agree with that, but I would regret that more eggs were being produced in this country if they were not of the proper quality.  I want more eggs, but I want eggs of better quality.  Not only that, but I want the very best quality eggs.  The question for the House and for the country to consider is how to attain that object&mdash;more eggs and eggs of better quality.  If the quality is right, then the price will improve and the quantity will improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion any suggestion of <Col N="253" /> incorporating in this Bill a clause with regard to the selling of eggs in the open market&mdash;the open market being any market in a country town where markets are held&mdash;is not useful. That is to say to have the housewife or the husband going into market once a week marketing the eggs for the upkeep of the town and bringing back goods with them.  I think that suggestion will be fatal to this Bill. These matters should be discussed in a frank and open way and the opinion of the House should be got as to the general betterment of this egg and poultry industry.  Deputy Brennan referred to the background of this Bill which is also fatal to its usefulness. This Bill is going to impose fresh burdens with regard to the egg industry.  You may improve the prices but any benefit given that way you take away by licensing fees and levies on the eggs sold.  In this you are doing one thing that is certain to destroy the whole purpose of the Bill and you will bring no advantage to the people engaged in the industry.  I am not at all objecting to its rigidity or even to the harshness in the machinery of the measure.  Unfortunately I am afraid these things are all required.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told the House about the two preceding Bills introduced here to deal with this industry and while he maintains these brought about an improvement in the egg trade, I regret to say that they did not fulfil the purpose for which they were intended.  We are a very peculiar people.  It is better to be quite frank and I do not mind being unpopular for saying this.  We are a people who once we get into a rut dislike being told we are in that rut.  We do not like anybody to suggest to us a way of getting out of the rut.  I know it is not easy to get out of a rut.  I want to see the rigidity that is in the Bill maintained.  But I tell the Minister now that the Bill is quite useless unless he goes further and takes up the question of the background to which Deputy Brennan referred.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should have an examination as to why there is a decline in the production of eggs. <Col N="254" /> I should think that such an inquiry would not take a very long time.  The Minister himself is quite well aware of the cause of that decline.  I have stated in this House and elsewhere in the course of the last five or six years that I was convinced that the people on the land are as hard-working and as industrious as they ever were.  Yet there is a decline in this branch of our agricultural industry.  If there is a decline and the figures speak eloquently for themselves, the decline is not due to the mothers and daughters, the wives and sisters of the farmers of this State.  The cause lies elsewhere.  I suggest that it is no use making the regulations set out in this Bill unless the Minister takes his courage in his hand and goes further in an examination of the background. These levies now proposed are bound to depress the price of eggs.  That is so unless the levies are imposed on a much larger national production.  The overhead charges are too much for the industry and must be reduced.  The House has the figures of production in the egg industry for 1932 as compared with 1937.  I think it is true that there is an improvement in the hen population of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is. But the Minister knows why there has been a decline in 1937 as compared with 1932.  That is because the cost of the feeding of poultry has risen so much in the last six years that housewives have ceased to keep poultry. That increase in the cost of feeding stuffs was a tragic and fatal thing to the industry.  The Minister will probably say &ldquo;that is now all over, the economic war has been settled, and you can begin to take up the business now.&rdquo;  The Minister should remember that you cannot repair in a day or in a year the energetic efforts of six years towards destroying the industry.  The breeding stocks were injured and many people went out of poultry keeping.  Government action got them soured.  The people engaged in the industry more or less gave it up Something will now have to be given them, some inducements offered them <Col N="255" /> so as to bring them back again into production.  I fear that when the terms of this Bill are divulged to the people they will say: &ldquo;Yes, the Minister in the last six years killed the industry because of the cost of feeding stuffs, and he is now going to give it the knock-out blow by these harsh, rigid and penal regulations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister should bring in a Bill that would give an assurance to the producers of eggs&mdash;the mothers and daughters of the agricultural community of this country&mdash;that every effort will be made to give them feeding stuffs at a price as cheap as they can be got elsewhere in relation to the market in which the eggs are sold.  The Minister dealt rather extensively with this Bill. When replying I would like him to go more fully into the question with regard to the cost of this measure.  It may be quite all right to give £1 annually for a licence plus so much of the value of the eggs exported if a man is doing an enormous trade.  A big turnover would enormously reduce the effect of the levy on the big man. But take the case of the smaller man, and there will be smaller men engaged in the industry in this country.  It would be a bad thing to make this a big monopolistic industry.  There will always be small men in the trade. These impositions will press heavily on the small man, who will have to pay so much for licence and so much annual levies on the eggs he exports. These things will fall much heavier on him than on the big man.  These impositions should be on a graded scale.  I do not see why this annual charge should be imposed at all.  There is a charge of £1 for a licence and the man should be allowed to hold that licence without any further charge until he forfeits it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, will agree that over and above his charges, other charges are implied.  There will be the registration of the premises, and there will have to be skilled persons as testers.  I suppose it will be quite simple with regard to the qualifications of the testers.  I expect that the testers will have to go for training to <Col N="256" /> some station beforehand, and that there they will have to undergo an examination before they will get a certificate as competent testers.  Then there will be the question of bookkeeping. Certain books will have to be kept.  That will mean increased office work, and this will add to the charges on the eggs.  The necessity of reducing the charges as much as possible should be obvious to the Minister.  This is an industry that has suffered from very keen world competition. While enacting legislation to improve the quality of eggs, because quality is everything, this House should not, conjointly with that, impose such terms as will injure the industry in its output, and all these charges&mdash;charges here, there and everywhere&mdash;are going to affect adversely an increase in production.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be sympathetic, particularly when we come to Committee Stage, towards suggestions for the cutting out of all charges that can be avoided in respect of the administration of the Bill.  He will see that with regard to testing, and the keeping of registers, certain costs will be involved, because the tester will not be the man who will keep the books.  He will be quite busy enough, and some other clerical staff will be required for such work as taking the dates of the eggs when marked, the dates when they are sent out, and other such matters.  The clerical part will be quite complicated in itself, and it will involve a considerable imposition on the industry, and I think the House should address itself on Committee Stage to reducing as far as possible any impositions on the industry arising out of machinery of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, and I regret to have to say that the people did not take full advantage of the two former Bills which, although they were regarded as drastic, were enacted for the benefit of the people concerned, and their benefit only.  This is a matter on which no legislation of any kind should be required.  The people themselves should see the urgent necessity for quality, quality and quality in this industry.  It is a regrettable fact that when you go out and buy a dozen eggs <Col N="257" /> and use them over two or three days, you can never say that you got one absolutely fresh egg out of the dozen. That is a very regrettable thing to have to say.  As I say, I like this Bill, but I do not like all the impositions that are in it, and I think the State would be wise to make some contribution out of general taxes towards the costs that are involved in it, so as to ensure that the benefit given with one hand will not be almost taken away with the other.  That would be very bad because, as I say, the industry wants a fillip and a pretty strong tonic at the moment.  I think the costs involved in the Bill will not tend towards that end, and I think the House should address itself to mitigating all those costs because this should be a very important branch of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>We have heard figures quoted by Deputy Brennan.  They speak for themselves and they are regrettable. The only fear that I have with regard to this Bill is that if we put all these impositions into force, in view of the psychological state of the people engaged in the production side of the industry, the industry will be further handicapped.  Those engaged in it will resent them and go further out of production. We should rather devote ourselves to giving them an incentive at this stage.  It may be unfortunate that this Bill has to be introduced at this stage when they are rather in the dumps after what has happened in the last five or six years, because they may consider it a further blow at them, another impertinence and another interference with their liberties.  I think the Bill should be accepted as quickly as possible so that the producers may secure the benefit of it. I am not concerned with the wholesalers or the exporters&mdash;they are merely the channels through which the business passes.  The only thing I am concerned with is the industry proper &mdash;the production of eggs, more eggs, and the best quality of eggs.</P>

      <P>The people have, rightly or wrongly, and I presume the majority of the people are right, given an expression of opinion upon the incidents of the past six years, and I think we should start off on the assumption that they are right and approach the consideration of such measures as this absolutely on their merits, without any reference to the quotation of figures which have no relation to such measures.  Deputy Brennan, for instance, quoted from what I presume are Parliamentary records the value of the eggs exported in 1931 compared with the value of the exports in 1937.  That kind of quotation is not going to help any Deputy interested in a measure like this to come to a considered conclusion on its merits.  This Bill, in my opinion, is introduced for the purpose of helping the egg producer to get a better cash price for what he is going to produce in the future.  I am in favour of any measure introduced by a Minister or a member of this House that will make the producer of eggs, butter, bacon, or any other commodity free from the activities of the pawnbroker. I want to see the people who produce eggs selling them, not at a pawnbroker's price, but at a fair competitive price.  I want to see, and I am sure the Bill will help, the producer getting a better price for his eggs in future, because the price of everything depends on the law of supply and demand.  If we are going to get a better demand from our principal market for eggs in the future we shall have to produce eggs of a better quality than we have produced in the past, and we shall have to give more expeditous delivery to the people who are prepared to buy them from us.  In that way we are going to get a bigger demand and a better price.  Does Deputy McMenamin deny that the price in the future will depend, and, in the past, depended, on the demand in the home market as well as in the foreign market?</P>

      <P>We will not get an increased demand from people who want good eggs and who can get them from other countries if we are not able to produce and sell eggs to the people prepared to buy a better quality of eggs than what we have been producing and selling in the past.  I believe the intention of the Minister in introducing this measure is to provide a better market and, consequently and automatically, a better price.  It is regrettable, as Deputy McMenamin says, that legislation of this kind has to be introduced, but I suppose that if there were no Parliament we would have no export trade, or probably a good deal less than we have at present.  Things would be a little different, and Deputy McMenamin, if he were an ordinary citizen and not subject to the laws of this Assembly, would be worse off than he is to-day, or has been for the last six years.  It would be possible to argue that kind of thing in the usual debating society style for the next five or six years and get nowhere.  I regret as much as Deputy McMenamin that people have to be tied up by rules and regulations, but speaking from some knowledge and experience of the egg business, and particularly the export side of that business, I think this measure generally is needed if we are going to have a better market and a better price for our producers of eggs.  With that object in view, I have no hesitation whatever and no reservation of any kind in encouraging the Minister to go ahead with the Bill. I do agree with Deputy Brennan that a reasonable time should be given between the date of the passing of the Second Stage and Committee Stage in order to give those who are interested in making the measure better than it is a reasonable opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The egg and poultry industry in this country has always been a very valuable industry, particularly to the smallholder and the cottier throughout the country.  I absolutely disagree with Deputy Davin when he says that we should not make any <Col N="260" /> reference to statistics and figures when we are speaking about this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, whether they are the statistics of the economic war or not, such figures must give us some indication of the flow of trade from this country to Great Britain and from other countries, who are our chief competitors, engaged in this line of industry.  Now, in 1930 this country exported to Great Britain 4,735,000 great hundreds of eggs, and in 1937 that export had dropped to 2,458,000 great hundreds.  On the other hand, Denmark, our chief competitor on the British market, exported to Great Britain 6,564,000 great hundreds of eggs, and in three years, in 1937, increased that figure to 9,993,000 great hundreds.  Take the case, even, of Holland.  In 1934 Holland's export of eggs to Great Britain was as low as 944,000 great hundreds, whereas the return of their trade last year, 1937, had increased enormously to the figure of 4,310,000 great hundreds of eggs. Now, these are very impressive figures, and they show you that our chief competitors, such as Denmark and Holland, have practically ousted us out of that important market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Because their trade has gone up in one case, by 500 per cent., and in another case by 200 per cent., while ours has dropped by more than 50 per cent.  As I have said, this has seriously affected the people in the country&mdash;the people on the hillside, such as the small cottier or small farmer throughout the country, and the places, generally, where you had thrift in the home.  That has practically gone, and as far as I am concerned, I can say that any Bill that is going to help to improve and promote the value of this industry will get my whole-hearted support.  I hold, and I think we must all admit, that eggs are produced in this country, in the majority of cases, under very bad <Col N="261" /> conditions, due to want of cleanliness and proper housing of our poultry. Very often, eggs are marketed here in a very dirty and poor condition, and there is undoubtedly an attempt being made by a lot of people to preserve eggs from the period of the year when eggs are plentiful to another period of the year when eggs are scarce and consequently dear.  Hence you have the danger of a big percentage of our eggs being marketed at a particular time of the year when they are stale and going across to the other side, thus giving a bad name to Irish eggs. Now, we do not want that, and anybody who is interested in this industry must welcome any attempt made by the Government or by the Minister to clear the good name of Irish eggs and to prevent that kind of thing happening in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Brennan and Deputy McMenamin in pointing out that there may be a danger of this measure being a bit too drastic, and that the imposition of licence fees and all that sort of thing may make overhead charges a bit too high, with the result that there may be a danger of putting certain people out of the trade, thereby doing away with a certain amount of necessary competition in the small towns and villages.  I hold that we should preserve competition with a view to seeing that the producer gets the best possible price.  One sub-section of Section 28 of the Bill says that a registered wholesaler or a registered dealer shall not, without the consent of the Minister, carry on in his or any of his registered premises any business other than the business in respect of which such premises are registered.  Now, most of the people dealing in eggs in this country only deal in them more or less as a sideline, and I hope the Minister does not mean to put these people out of trade and thus kill the competition of people who deal in eggs simply as a sideline.  That would be disastrous, and I think the Minister ought to reconsider that section at any rate.  Of course, he puts in a condition &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo; but I think he might drop that and leave it some such thing as &ldquo;provided that the premises are <Col N="262" /> otherwise suitable.&rdquo;  I think that the Bill ought not to prevent dealers carrying on any other line of business.</P>
    <P>To my mind, there are other causes, outside the marketing of eggs altogether, that have affected this industry so seriously.  One of these causes, I think, we could find a remedy for, and the responsibility rests to some extent with the Minister's Department.  I know that a good deal has been done down through the country to encourage the right breed of poultry, but I think, and I believe, that the people are very ignorant as to the right period of the year to breed pullets so that they will commence to lay at the proper time of the year.  In other words, we are selling our eggs to people on the other side who want regular quantities of good eggs all the year round, and we are in a somewhat similar position to that of the butter trade in that respect &mdash;that we produce a big quantity of eggs at one time of the year and a very small quantity at another time of the year.  Now, the people against whom we have to go into competition in the British market are people who are catering for a regular market and who are supplying that demand all the year round.  That is a point that ought not to be forgotten by the Minister if he and his Department are going to throw their full weight into an effort to improve this important industry in this country.  It is a point that should be attended to.  I know that it is outside the scope of this Bill, but I simply mention it because I believe that a Bill of this kind is of very little use if you do not get down to the root of the matter, to the real problem and the real canker that is eating away and rotting this industry.  As I have said before, I am glad that this effort is being made, and the only danger that I see about the Bill is that it may tend to increase overhead charges to such an extent that competition may be killed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, we can all agree that this Bill is necessary, and we will be prepared to co-operate with the Minister for Agriculture in putting the Bill into effect, and in taking any <Col N="263" /> steps he may consider necessary to develop the egg industry in this country.  There is no doubt that egg production here has declined during the past few years.  It does not really matter now what were the causes of that decline.  What really matters is that active and effective steps must be taken to put production on the upgrade once more.  I think the Minister will appreciate the fact that the people who are engaged in egg production in this country are mainly, perhaps, the poorest section of the community; that is, the agricultural workers and small farmers.  Any measures that he may think necessary to adopt must be guided by a realisation of the impoverished condition of that section of the community. Therefore, if it is necessary under this Act to impose certain restrictions in regard to marketing, and certain overhead charges, I think that there should be some definite provision accompanying this Act to give a fillip to the industry.  To my mind, the most effective fillip to the egg-producing industry at the present time would be to provide, by State aid, for the production of young pullets at certain periods of the year when they are required.  There is no doubt, as Deputy Hughes has pointed out, that there are certain seasons of the year when it is desirable that production or incubation of poultry should be carried on extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps for the past 20 or 30 years the Department of Agriculture and their lecturers and instructresses throughout the country have been advocating increased production at those particular periods, but apparently without any particular success.  If, instead of lecturing, a really effective step were taken, that is to provide, either free of cost or at a very reduced price, eggs for hatching at the particular periods when they are required to be hatched, I think it would go a long way towards solving the problem of the irregular supplies of eggs in this country.  I think it should not be outside the power of the Minister to devise some scheme by which either eggs or young chicks would be distributed at a certain period of the year.  In that <Col N="264" /> way regular supplies would be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I am making this plea because, as I have said before, the people engaged in the egg-producing industry are not big industrialists or big capitalists who can go into the facts and figures.  They are people who are struggling to eke out a living, and, of course, the tendency with them is to dispose of their eggs when they are fetching a good price, and to use them for hatching purposes when they are cheap.  That is absolutely to the detriment of the industry, and I think the Minister should take effective measures to cope with that problem on the lines which I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Brennan that the collection of eggs should be restricted or prohibited in any way, or that farmers should be compelled to take their eggs into the towns to dispose of them.  I think that would be only an additional expense and an additional hardship on the producers.  I think that if the egg dealers or collectors provided a regular service by which eggs would be collected regularly each week or at definite periods it would help considerably towards preventing the appearance of such a large percentage of stale eggs on the market.  I think also that there should be careful consideration of the fact that the people engaged in the industry have not sufficient capital to set their production on proper lines.  In most cases the people engaged in the production of eggs have not the necessary capital to provide themselves with proper poultry houses and the other equipment which is required for the proper production of eggs and in this regard also the Department of Agriculture could help the producer.  It could give them some encouragement to extend production on the lines which I have suggested by supplying them either with eggs or chicks at a certain period of the year when they are required, and also by assisting them with either loans or grants to provide proper houses for their poultry.  In that way the Department would be encouraging the producer to get back once more into production.  They <Col N="265" /> would be helping him to recover from that feeling of acute depression under which the poultry keeping industry is labouring and to regain a certain amount of confidence in the future. It is only by inspiring the people who are engaged in production, or the people who are likely to engage in production, with a feeling of confidence and a feeling that the Government of this country and the officials of the Government are doing their utmost to co-operate with them and to help them to get a proper price for their produce that you can promote the development of the egg producing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amused at Deputy Davin bringing in the economic war.  The only way in which he could bring it in was by accusing someone else of having done so.  He was the only person who referred to it from start to finish in this debate.  There were certain figures quoted here, and they were quoted for a certain purpose&mdash;to show what I believe the Minister would be the first to acknowledge, that a certain problem does exist, to suggest that the problem should be faced, and that this Bill was only one of the methods by which that problem could be faced, namely, the decline in our egg and poultry trade, especially in our export trade.  It was suggested, for instance, by speakers from these benches that one of the causes of that was something which is not connected with the economic war, the price of feeding stuffs.  Deputy Cogan referred to the causes of this decline.  We need not go into them unless the causes continue; I think he suggested that they were continuing. Other suggestions were made about the production of a more regular supply of eggs.  Everybody who has read the drastic provisions of this Bill will realise that it only goes a certain distance to solve the problem which the Minister has to face.  I rose merely for one particular purpose, and that is to pass on to the Minister for his consideration a suggestion which has been made to me.  It was made by a man who is interested perhaps more in those who were employed in connection with the shipping of eggs than on behalf <Col N="266" /> of the shippers themselves.  You have had rather drastic legislation up to the present.  You have more drastic legislation now.  Is it not just possible that because the legislation is so drastic you cannot drastically use it; that there will be a tendency to let off, as far as you can, the people who commit offences?  Very often a man who has committed an offence may be warned. Take the shipper who ships dirty eggs or selected eggs.  He may be warned by the Department that they will have to take steps against him and withdraw his licence.  His employees may not know anything about that.  He possibly employs five to 20 men.  The suggestion has been made to me that the Minister would be able to enforce a piece of legislation more regularly and perhaps more efficiently if the actual provision were somewhat less drastic; if, for instance, in this respect you followed the analogy, say, of the case of a licensed premises, and, on the first offence, have the man brought before the court, fined, and his licence endorsed, with the proviso that on repetition, just as in the case of a licence for a public-house, the licence be withdrawn.  That puts both the shipper and his employees on the watch, and you will not have, as I understand may occur at present, a great number of people suddenly thrown out without any warning.  It will act as a tonic, so to speak&mdash;so it has been put to me&mdash; on the shipper on the one hand and his employees on the other.  I merely pass that on to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

I have often seen eggs handled by shipping companies and I am not at all satisfied that sufficient care is taken in the handling of them.  I have in <Col N="267" /> mind that eggs which have been inspected and properly handled could be very badly abused by being carelessly handled in shipping.  While these eggs might not be very badly damaged they might still have a very bad effect on the other side when they are handled there.  I am inclined to think that there should be some restriction also on the handling of eggs by shipping companies and I should like the Minister to deal with that matter in his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points with regard to this matter of eggs which ought to be referred to here.  First of all, I should like to apologise to Deputy Davin if I may appear to come near the economic war situation, because it is very hard to keep away from it, although, happily, in connection with eggs it is possible to get away from it and talk about a very serious aspect of things which arose during the last year.  Deputy Hughes referred to the position we are in in the British market in relation to Denmark and Holland, and when we are making drastic regulations for improving, if you like, the production and the marketing of our eggs, it would be well to get some indication from the Minister as to what exactly has been happening during the last 12 months, because so far from our difficulties arising out of the economic war situation during the year 1937 increasing, they were, in fact, getting less.  We had made two or three agreements with Great Britain and we were gradually realising the importance of holding our position to the greatest possible extent in the British market. Nevertheless, our exports of eggs to Great Britain in 1937 compared very unfavourably with our exports in 1936; whereas in the case of Denmark and Holland it was quite the reverse.  In 1936, we exported to the British market 2,500,000 great hundreds of eggs, but we fell by 614,000 in our exports in 1937.  That is, that in the year 1937 our export of eggs to the British market fell by about a quarter of what it was the previous year.  On the other hand, in 1937 Denmark succeeded in getting 2,000,000 more great <Col N="268" /> hundreds of eggs into the British market and Holland 500,000; so that whereas we declined by 500,000 great hundreds of eggs last year, Denmark and Holland between them increased by a little more than 2,500,000.  It may be the effect of the economic war or it may be an accumulation of difficulties for the producers which came to a difficult point in 1937, but if we are going to introduce regulations that may have an immediate restrictive effect on the production of eggs, particularly by the small producers, who are so important and numerous, it would be well to understand what hapened as between our eggs and the Dutch and Danish eggs in the British market last year, because it is remarkable that we should fall by as much as more than 500,000, while they went up by something more than 2,500,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of the mixture scheme and the cost of feeding. The Minister has indicated that the cost of feeding is likely to continue rather high during the current year; that is, that he is not going to relax the restriction with regard to the mixture until the end of the current cereal year in about 12 months' time.  I would ask the Minister if his attention has been drawn to the report on dairy produce supplies in 1937 issued by the Department of Agriculture in Great Britain, where it is stated that in 1937</P>
      <P>&ldquo;there was a considerable reduction in the output of butter, cheese, eggs and pigs, a movement that was, no doubt, due in part to the high price of feeding stuffs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the position has been that in Great Britain the high price of feeding stuffs injured the production of eggs last year, we can easily understand that the production of eggs in this country has been much more interfered with. It was not entirely the fall in the production of eggs in Great Britain that gave rise to the increase from Denmark and Holland.  Nevertheless, it is reported that there was a reduction in production there and that in part it was due to the high cost of feeding stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that the present Bill is likely to have a restrictive <Col N="269" /> influence on the smaller producer. Coming on top of the restrictive influence which the cost of feeding stuffs has been at a time when he wants to recover the position we held in that British market for eggs, and particularly when, in view of the increased quantities that went from Holland and Denmark last year, he has to fight serious rivals who are gradually strengthening themselves in the British market, I think the discussion on this measure should not conclude without the Minister saying whether he is contemplating in any way helping the poultry producer by doing something to reduce the cost of feeding stuffs.  It should be possible to get rid of whatever surplus oats and barley there will be in the country this year in some other way than by having the price of these hanging round the poultry production situation and the recovery of egg production in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we should discuss the situation here without consideration of the position with regard to Germany and the eggs we are sending there.  I think the difficulty that some Deputies see in the increased restrictions here ought to be lightened by the Minister telling us, say, the latest funny story from the Department of Agriculture.  The Minister has been sending eggs to Germany for the past three years, and no doubt the departmental accountant was faced recently with the job of putting the accounts together.  The accounts over a short period up to 31st March, 1935, showed that after spending £190 in administration and £31 10s, sending telegrams he exported £67,900 worth of eggs to Germany and on the transaction the Minister lost £595.  In the following year, the year ending 31st March, 1936, after spending £1,350 on administrative expenses and £140 14s. 11d. in sending of telegrams, the Minister exported £121,010 worth of eggs to Germany and made £1,435 6s. 4d. on the transaction.  In the third year of his experience he spent £1,559 on administrative expenses, including perhaps the sending of telegrams, because they are not separately accounted for, and succeeded during the year in sending <Col N="270" /> £140,626 worth of eggs to Germany at a net loss of £8,542.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about people who had a bad record as exporters. Probably he did not want to have the Ministry classed in the category of exporters with a bad record, and when he looked at the loss of £8,542 on last year's transaction, a bright thought came into his mind, while he was sucking the tail-end of his pen, and he said, &ldquo;If we got the £38,147 in bounties such as ordinary exporters would get, we would have made £29,604 on the transaction.&rdquo;  On three years' trading in eggs with Germany amounting to £329,554, we are supposed to raise our hats at the thought that if there had been paid to the Minister for Agriculture on these transactions by the Minister for Finance, or whoever is responsible for the payment of bounties, a sum of £77,351, we would have made a profit of £69,581.  We are told that at the present time we are discussing trade arrangements with Germany.  I should like to know if the restrictions, the extra supervision and extra penalties that are to be imposed on our egg producers and wholesalers, are intended to help or to speed up this valuable trade with Germany.  We should like also to know whether the discussions that are going on at present with the German representatives deal in any way with eggs because I personally think that if we cannot do anything better with our eggs than to export them to Germany under these conditions, we might consider other means of disposing of them.  We might consider particularly the situation that would arise if there was an outbreak of war between Germany and any other country and the price of eggs went up in other countries.  If in that situation we withdrew our egg shipments from Germany, we might be regarded as being no longer friendly, or even neutral.  That might easily-be one of those troublesome developments which might later on lead to our being engaged in a war with Germany.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough if the public accounts do show these losses, but the side-light on the whole bounty situation that the balance sheet gives us, <Col N="271" /> by showing that if bounties were paid we would have made a profit in this particular way, raises the whole question of the value to the nation of an export trade that has to be supported by bounties.  Nevertheless, the position is that we are paying bounties on the export of eggs.  Danish and Dutch eggs are subject to a tax of 1/- to 1/9 to which our eggs are not subjected on the British market, so that there is every possibility of improving our position in the British market.  There is every possibility that we would not have eggs to export to Germany in the way that we have been exporting them, if we could take real advantage of the situation and understand what has been happening as between our eggs and Danish and Dutch eggs on the British market last year.  If we examine carefully the position in regard to feeding stuffs, the Minister must know that there are hundreds of small poultry keepers who were formerly engaged in the production of eggs who are no longer able to carry on even though they might have a fairly good market at their doors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not find it possible to supply Deputy Brennan with the figures which he requires, namely, the losses suffered by not bringing this legislation forward two or three years ago, that is, the loss arising from inadequate marking or allowing the sale of stale eggs to go on.  One might, however, get some idea of what we expect to gain by this legislation if, as a result of getting a better egg on the export market, we improve the price of our eggs by 1d. a dozen.  That still leaves a margin between Irish eggs and British eggs. If we succeed in improving the price of our eggs by 1d. per dozen, it would mean an increase in the income from our egg exports of £150,000.  It is to be presumed that, in that case, the price of eggs on the home market would increase by 1d. per dozen also, so that the producer would get more than £150,000.  There has been some talk of the cost of the administration of this scheme.  The cost of administration of the present scheme is not, I believe, excessive.  The levy that was spoken <Col N="272" /> of here is very small.  The levy taken from exporters is 1d. per case of 30 dozen.  That is the levy that is taken from eggs that pass through their hands for export and it is not very much.  As a result of this new legislation and the more stringent inspection that will be enforced, it is possible that we may have to increase that levy, but I am sure that 2d. per case of 30 dozen on all eggs acquired will be sufficient.  That is not a whole lot and it is not going to make a lot of difference to the producer.  If Deputies look at the Estimates, they will see that we get a certain Appropriation-in-Aid from these various fees from exporters and we spend then a certain amount on the administration of the Eggs Act.  The amount now voted by the State is about £6,000, and I think that a levy of 2d., instead of 1d., will cover any increase in the cost of administration that may be occasioned by an increased number of inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question asked by Deputy Brennan was a very big one&mdash;what was the root of the failure of the industry, if you like to put it down as a failure. A number of Deputies discussed that problem.  Deputy O'Sullivan accused Deputy Davin of accusing somebody else of starting it with the economic war.  Perhaps the Deputy would not believe me if I said that I wished it had started with the economic war because the economic war is now over. If it had started with the economic war, we would have been well over our troubles before now.  The decline of the industry really started in 1929. There was a very big decline between 1929 and 1931, a decline of over still further in 1932 and it might be stated that, as the economic war started in 1932, a portion of the decline in that year was due to the economic war.  The decline, however, first started in 1929 and went on down to 1937.  This year there was a turn in that tendency.  First of all the number of poultry in the country began to go up for the first time in June.  The number of poultry returned for June this year was higher than the number for June of the previous year and our export trade for <Col N="273" /> the first nine months of this year was greater than for the corresponding nine months of last year.  The price is also better, so that all three things in connection with the poultry trade are improving for the first time, and that, I suppose, is somewhat hopeful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the improvement in price in the last nine months.  I do not think that we have been furnished with the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this information was only circulated yesterday, and I do not know if it has reached the Deputies yet.  As regards the quantity of eggs exported for the nine months of this year there was an increase, as compared with last year, from 2,391,000 to 2,616,000 great hundreds; while the money received increased from £818,000 to £1,095,000. If we look at the matter from the point of view of the producer, we have to add to that the amount of the bounty paid.  We can ignore it for the present because it does not make a lot of difference to our argument at the moment.  To come back to the cost of feeding-stuffs, I do not know if that will explain the decline.  I do not want to misrepresent the position in any way.  If you take the ration that is made up for a pig or for a chicken and add up the price of bran, of oatmeal and of the maize meal mixtures as against pure maize, there is not a great difference between the two, because certain feeding-stuffs have been cheaper here all the time.  The maize meal mixture was admittedly dearer than the pure maize on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In England production has gone down terribly.  They had an inquiry there to find out what was the root cause of the decline in the industry.  The inquiry was held about this time last year, and the committee reported, I think, in February of this year on the decline in the poultry industry in Great Britain.  The committee got all the evidence they could and reported eventually.  It would appear from this report that the production of eggs in the United King dom increased greatly from 1924 to 1934.  Production reached 39.7 million <Col N="274" /> great hundreds in 1934, but then it began to decline, and in 1937 the figure was 36.7.  Therefore, you had the same decline in Great Britain as you had here commencing in 1934 and coming down to the present time.  It more or less corresponds with the decline here. The latter may be accounted for by the increased cost of feeding stuffs, which commenced to operate in 1934.  Deputy McMenamin seems to think that the decline here is due to the increased cost of feeding stuffs.  If one relies on that, then some other explanation has to be found for the decline in production in Great Britain.  I do not know what the production in Great Britain is this year, but the imports of eggs there have been higher than they were for the same period last year.  If eggs are dearer than they were last year, that would seem to indicate that the production is somewhat lower because if production is the same this year as last year, then, with considerably higher imports, one would imagine that the price of eggs there would be lower than last year, but as a matter of fact it is higher.  I have no proof of that, except the present price of eggs and the amount of imports.</P>
    <P>I am pointing out these matters to show what a frightfully difficult matter this is.  What we are aiming at in this Bill is to remedy the situation &mdash;to improve the quality, and if we do that then our eggs should fetch an improved price in the foreign market.  If we succeed in getting an improved price in the foreign market, then the price of our eggs will go up at home so that if our producers get improved prices that should be followed by increased production.  In theory all that looks very good.  I do not know whether it will work out in practice or not.  It is hard to know what is at the root cause of the whole thing, but I think it is well worth trying what we propose to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked how the certificate of efficiency is to be given. There is mentioned in the Bill the person who takes charge of an egg packing station.  It is set out that he must satisfy the Minister with regard to his efficiency.  That is not new.  That has been there since 1930.  The position is <Col N="275" /> that we do not want to be too hard on people who have been carrying on business.  What we say is, that we cannot very well put these people out of business.  But we say in the Bill that where a new person is to be appointed, that person must be qualified. Classes are held under the auspices of the Department so that any person who wants to become an egg packer can attend them, submit himself for the examinations held by the inspectors of the Department, and obtain a certificate in that way.  No new egg packer can be admitted unless he becomes qualified in that particular way.  Perhaps Deputy Brennan would not press the point of having all eggs sold in the market if he considered the matter further, especially in regard to certain regions in the West of Ireland that are better known to him than they are to me&mdash;regions where a market town is not within very easy reach of producers.  It is surely more convenient for producers who live long distances from market towns to have a collector call at regular intervals to purchase their eggs.  They will be collected regularly, perhaps twice a week.  A producer might not be inclined to market his eggs twice a week if he had to travel a long distance to a market town, so that what we proposed here has an advantage in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey raised a question about transport companies.  I do not think we have had any complaints to the effect that the transport companies have been too slow in dealing with the eggs delivered to them.  We have had complaints that they are a bit rough in their handling of them, and that eggs get broken.  Even as regards that, the complaints have not been persistent, but I can assure the Deputy that I will inquire further into it if it is a serious matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to the regulation requiring the delivery of eggs at a port three hours before a boat leaves, how does the Minister think that will affect the trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not affect the transport people at all.  Everyone <Col N="276" /> knows, for instance, that a boat is going to leave the port of Sligo at a certain time.  The exporters know it very well.  The inspector is waiting there to examine the eggs before they are exported.  An exporter comes along 20 minutes before a boat is due to leave with a quantity of eggs.  The inspector has no time to examine them, and the exporter says to him that surely he is not going to delay by examining the consignment and thereby have it held up for a week.  The most that the inspector can do is to make a cursory examination of the consignment.  What we are proposing in the Bill is to compel the exporters to have the eggs there in good time so that the inspector will have an opportunity of examining them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a rigid enforcement of the regulation, how will it affect the quality of the eggs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are not up to quality we will destroy them, and the exporter will suffer.  What I mean is, that if they are bad enough we will destroy them.  I agree with Deputy Davin that we should try to approach this matter with an open mind, and not try to blame the economic war or anything else.  Our aim should be to try and get at the root cause of the whole thing.  The trouble is that it is not easy to do that.</P>
      <P>I should have said that when the British inquiry was held, the conclusion, roughly, amounted to this: that they should improve the egg industry and control disease in order to improve the price.  We can congratulate ourselves here that we are comparatively free from disease.  We are very free from disease, compared with other countries.  We are trying to maintain that position if we possibly can by disease control regulations.  Our ultimate object is, by improving the quality to improve the price.  Really, we are aiming at the same thing that was recommended by the British Commission. I think any commission set up would be likely to recommend the same thing, to try to improve the price, and, of course, control disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are doing a little from year to <Col N="277" /> year on the lines suggested by Deputy Cogan, and that is to encourage the production of early pullets, and to produce stocks for breeding.  We are doing that through the county committees. I do not know if we can do any more.  Perhaps we can.  If it is practical to do more I prefer to look into it to see if it could be done.  A very interesting point was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan and it is certainly one I must consider.  There is no doubt that if a law is too drastic the danger is that it will not be administered, because one is always afraid to go the full length of the law in case the results may be too drastic.  There is the danger of not getting the same effect if law is made too drastic.  In this case if we forfeited a package or two probably we would not take a man off the register unless there was some other cause.  I have never known it done for one case.  Perhaps if we had to take notice one week and again in a week or two we would warn him that if he was caught again, in addition to the eggs being forfeited, he would be liable to be removed from the register.  Usually that is done two or three times before notice goes out that a man is going to be removed from the register.  There is the fear, too, that the employees may not get to hear of that and that therefore they are not alive to the terrible danger that may arise.  I do not know any way of getting over that, but it is a point that I will have to consider. I imagine that in such a case the proprietor would go straight to his employees and warn them that if they were not more careful the concern might be put off the register.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Everett's point, the producer is not registered.  A retailer is not registered unless he does a very big business in eggs bought by him from producers.  The cottier or small farmer who produces eggs and sells to a retailer is not required to register at all.  I do not know what point Deputy Mulcahy wanted to make about the German trade.  In carrying on trade with Germany the circumstances were such that instead of losing we saved the State £70,000 by not having to pay a certain amount of bounty that would have had to be paid <Col N="278" /> if the eggs went to Great Britain.  If we saved the Exchequer by State trading £70,000 on that trade with Germany I do not see why anyone should find fault.  I can imagine what an attack there would be if we neglected that opportunity.  Such neglect would be pointed out to the Dáil as an opportunity that was missed of saving the State a certain amount of money by sending the eggs to Germany rather than to Great Britain.  We are still paying bounty on exports.  If the bounty is paid to the exporter, as the State was the exporter, I cannot see very well how we could act otherwise than we did. I do not see how the Minister could pay bounty to the Minister for Agriculture. We thought the best thing was to present the accounts and to show what the loss was.  I gave that direction as I thought that was the only way it should be done.</P>
    <P>If the present trade negotiations with Germany result in carrying on the egg trade, and if the Department pays the full bounty on eggs, if we make a little profit on the business, surely we ought to do so.  If we lose a little on our business with Germany, but not as much as by paying the bounty in Great Britain, surely that is only a matter of accounting.  If we can save the State a certain sum of money why not do so by continuing to send eggs to Germany?  I do not think there is much in the argument that if Germany went to war with some other country we might be compelled to cease exporting eggs owing to a variation in prices.  We would carry out our contract naturally.</P>

It is true, as Deputy Davin mentioned, that the Danes and the Dutch are sending eggs to Great Britain and are paying the duty.  On the other hand, we are <Col N="279" /> sending eggs there and paying the bounty, so that our producers have a double advantage over the Danish and Dutch producers.  We wish them luck in that and hope that production here will be increased.</P>

I believe that if we could increase prices, by improving quality, we would get increased production.  That is what this Bill aims at.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as the House is aware, is an <Col N="281" /> annual Bill and it requires to be enacted before the end of the present calendar year.  It proposes to continue for another year the same statutes which appear in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Expiring Laws Act, 1937.  I would say in regard to these measures that permanent legislation is in draft to deal with the poor law matters in the State outside Dublin City and County and when enacted will make unnecessary the provisions for the annual renewal of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1923.  The Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, of 1929, must be continued for the present.  A permanent measure to amend the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, of 1925, is also in draft form.  I may say also to the House that consideration has been given to the desirability of enacting legislation to give permanence to the Acts hitherto continued by means of an annual Expiring Laws Act.  It is not, however, considered necessary to introduce legislation to make permanent any of the Acts in the Schedule to the Bill, with the exception of the Acts to which I have referred.  As regards these latter measures, the necessary legislation will not be ready for some time so it is accordingly necessary to continue them for a further period by means of the machinery of the Expiring Laws Act.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been rendered necessary by the emergence of certain questions regarding the position of public servants who, by virtue of the Constitution, became servants of the Government of Éire.  In the case of certain civil servants transferred from the service of the British Government with special rights in regard to tenure and conditions of service it has been held by the board set up under the <Col N="282" /> Act of 1929 that while the officers in question had not been discharged from their employment, their translation from the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann to the Civil Service of the Government of Éire operated to effect their discharge from the service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann, which Government ceased to exist upon the coming into operation of the Constitution.  In fact, the board held that there had been a complete break in the constitutional <i>régime</i> and that the Government, as I have said, of Saorstát Eireann had ceased to exist.  But this discharge was a purely technical one: it had no effect upon the employment of the officers who went to the board, for their employment was continued, nor had it any effect upon their tenure, conditions of service, remuneration, security or privileges which were, in fact, continued and secured to them under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The decision of the board, though it related only to transferred officers, might apply equally to all those public servants who were not transferred officers and it might on occasion give rise to difficulties&mdash;as, for example, if it were held that there had been a legal break in the continuity of service when the claims or rights of these officers to pensions came up for review or for determination.  The Bill now before the House provides that if it should be held in future that a public servant was discharged from the service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann, this purely legalistic and notional discharge shall not be held to imply or to constitute an actual discharge from employment.  It has, therefore, been provided in Section 2, paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Bill that every public servant who was in office prior to the 29th December, 1937, shall be deemed to have received an appointment on the same terms, conditions and tenure and in all respects indentical with that held by him in the service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  It has further been provided in Section 2, paragraph (c), that such legal discharge followed by appointment as I have mentioned shall not constitute a break in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Paragraph (d) of Section 2 and Section 3 of the Bill deal with the special case of officers transferred to the service of this country from the service of Great Britain.  These officers, as the House is aware, were secured in certain rights in relation to terms and conditions of employment. If they are discharged or if the conditions of their employment are altered to their detriment they are entitled to receive compensation which takes the form of retiring allowances at enhanced rates.  The decision of the Article X Board that the change of employer which took place on the coming into operation of the Constitution effected a discharge of these officers would render the Government liable to pay compensation on demand to everyone of the transferred officers of which there are about 9,000 in the Civil Service. Now, no actual discharge of these officers, as I have already said, has been effected.  Their remuneration, tenure, and conditions of employment remain unchanged and, indeed, in relation to their continuity of service, they will be given, I think, further security by this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The Government feels, therefore, that it should not be called upon to pay compensation to persons who in effect have suffered no material loss or damage.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that it is not intended to deprive transferred officers of any of their rights to compensation in the event of actual discharge from their employment or any detrimental alteration of their conditions of service, but it is intended and, I think, quite justifiably intended, to protect the taxpayers from a heavy burden of compensation in respect of any purely legal and theoretical discharge or alteration of conditions consequent upon the coming into operation of the Constitution.  As a corollary to all I have said, it is necessary to provide in this Bill that nothing in the Bill itself shall be construed as effecting any detrimental change in the conditions of service of the transferred officers, and that point has been covered in Section 4.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> It is intended that the measure, if enacted, will become effective as from the date of its introduction in this House, that is, as from the 26th October last.  It will be remembered that on the 18th August last the Government intimated that it would not be prepared to pay compensation in respect of any claim for discharge for worsened conditions arising out of the coming into operation of the Constitution unless such claim had been submitted within six months of that date.  The intention in fixing the limiting date was to enable payment to be made in the test case on which a decision had been given that the coming into operation of the Constitution had effected this legalistic discharge; while the Government at the same time intimated that it had under consideration the promotion of such measures as might be necessary to give effect to its decision not to pay further compensation for merely theoretical discharge.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, in our view, the proper method of implementing the Government's policy in that regard.  The terms of the Bill have been communicated to the Government of the United Kingdom, because that Government was a party to the agreement which is enshrined in the 1929 Act, and the Government of the United Kingdom has intimated that it has no observations to offer on the terms of the Bill. Owing to the fact that the Dáil was in recess, it was not possible to give immediate effect to the Government's policy in regard to the decision which has created the difficulty with which this Bill is intended to deal.</P>
    <P>The Government has already complied with its legal obligations in regard to the original or test case, and it proposes to deal with the second case, in regard to which the board issued a determination, in exactly the same way as it has dealt with the first case.  But it is not our intention to go any further in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Shortly, then the position which the Bill is intended to create is to provide that no further compensation shall be paid to any person on the ground of technical discharge or worsening of <Col N="285" /> conditions consequent on the coming into operation of the Constitution.  It does not interfere with any right transferred officers had under the Act of 1929.  This Bill is designed merely to ensure that, due to a constitutional change in this country, transferred officers will not be entitled to claim Article X rights upon a ground which was never contemplated, which was not enshrined in the original agreement and was never contemplated by the parties to the agreement, that is, upon the ground of merely theoretical discharge which meant no cessor of employment and was not accompanied by any actual worsening in the conditions of service.</P>

      <P>It would have been useful, and might have been appropriate if the Minister, when introducing the Bill, as well as giving the civil servants some assurance that they might even have further security for continuity of service under this Bill, would give them an assurance that they were going to be treated in an understanding way and recognised for what they are, as one of the most important national institutions we have, and also given an assurance that, under the Christian terms of the Constitution, they might be spared the tongues of Ministers and Party followers from election platforms.</P>
      <P>I intervene in this debate just to take the opportunity of stressing two things.  One is that the Civil Service is not liable to the charge which the Minister has implied against it, that it is unnational, that certain sections of it are unnational and that they will not accept the new Constitution.  What is responsible for any attempted run out of the Civil Service is the miserable way in which the Government have treated the Civil Service.  I put down questions to-day dealing with three periods.  The first was the period when Fianna Fáil made its appearance as the Government of the country.  Next came the period between the introduction of the Public Economics Act, of 1933, and the passing of the draft Constitution here, and then there was the period from the passing of the draft Constitution until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> So free from politics was the Civil Service at the time the Fianna Fáil Party took over the Government, that there were only five persons who applied to get out of the Civil Service between March, 1932, when Fianna Fáil took over office, and March, 1933, when the Public Economies Act came on the horizon.  They included one postmaster, one shorthand typist, two warders and one asylum attendant. These were the only people with pre-Treaty rights who were anxious to get out of the Civil Service at the time. Only one person got out.  In 1933 the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act was introduced.  Just as the Minister says now that he is going to protect the taxpayer against anything that may happen as a result of people trying to clear out of the Civil Service after the passing of the Constitution, so also the Minister was concerned with the taxpayer in 1933, when he and other Ministers told the House then that they were going to save £57,000. They pointed out then that the economic well-being of the State required of the Civil Service to have a £57,000 reduction made in the payments to it from the State.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question which I put to-day, the Minister indicated that the actual saving to the State as a result of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act was £49,177.  The information given in that reply to-day showed that between the period of the introduction of the Act and the passing of the draft Constitution 132 persons applied for discharge from the Civil Service and 109 received that discharge and, instead of saving £49,000, the taxpayer had to pay out a lump sum in gratuities on discharge of £48,675 and they had to arrange for the payment annually of pensions amounting to £29,645 a year.</P>
    <P>The Public Services (Temporary Provisions) Bill drove civil servants with pre-Treaty rights out of the Civil Service to the tune that the economies that were made in the year that it was in operation were £49,000 but against that additional payments or gratuities were to be paid out.  They were £48,675.  The effect of the Bill was to saddle the taxpayers of the country with an annual Bill for £29,600 for <Col N="287" /> pensions.  We now come to the position created by the passing of the Draft Constitution.  Since the Draft Constitution was passed 40 persons have applied to leave the Civil Service. It is interesting to realise that of these people, four were of the higher executive class; four of the junior executive class; four are staff officers, one a Deputy accountant; one a second class officer and one an assistant inspector.  All the others are officers occupying minor positions. Out of the 40, 13 are clerical officers, two are writing assistants, two are shorthand typists, one a sub-postmaster, and two are post office clerks.  The fact is that any disturbance worth talking about in the Civil Service was a disturbance caused by the attitude of the Government towards civil servants.  When the Government put the Public Services (Temporary) Economies Act into operation, that was one of its results.  There might not be so much running out of the Civil Service or attempting to run out of the Civil Service on the part of officers applying for discharge from the Civil Service if these officers had not in their minds the unjust treatment of prominent civil servants in the course of the last few years; and if they had not themselves in mind for the last four or five years the political partisanship that has been to a large extent operating in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy knows anything about the Civil Service, I should say that no person is so gifted as he is for showing the hidden hand and he ought to know something about it.  It is for these reasons that I think the Minister's tone in introducing the Bill might have been softened a bit and he might have addressed himself to the Civil Service as a national institution so that it should be outside Party and outside politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I ought to say with regard to the introduction of this measure here, that the people trying to get out of the Civil Service are doing so, on <Col N="288" /> the grounds of the unrest caused in the minds of civil servants by the policy of the Government.  I think it was a brazen act on the part of the Minister after what the Public Economies Act has cost the taxpayer to say that it is to protect the taxpayer now that he is bringing in this measure.  The Minister would save the taxpayer very much money if he took up a different attitude with regard to the civil servants.  A properly attuned Civil Service would feel that it was a national institution.  If the attitude of the Minister towards the Civil Service had been different, he would have saved the country many thousands of pounds.  His present attitude is likely to cost the taxpayer something in addition to the losses they have borne under the Public Economies Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one section of this Bill to which I wish to draw attention.  Section 5 says:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall apply to or affect any transferred officer who made, within six months after the coming into operation of the Constitution, a claim for compensation in consequence of the coming into operation of the Constitution, or any transferred officer who made at any time a claim for such compensation which was heard and determined by the Board before the 26th day of October, 1938.</P>
      <P>As the Minister indicated, when the decision in what was known as the Hegarty case was promulgated by the Civil Service Compensation Board, a declaration of policy was issued by the Government: that indicated that the Government proposed, with the approval of the British Government, to introduce legislation the effect of which would be to prevent any person retiring under the new Constitution where his application was submitted within six months of the 18th August last.  While it now reaffirms that, it says that other persons will be let out on the grounds in the Hegarty case provided they submitted an application before the 26th of October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that between the date of the Hegarty decision and the 26th <Col N="289" /> of October, a number of persons submitted applications for compensation, grounded on the same facts as those submitted by Mr. Hegarty in support of his application.  I understand that of those who submitted such applications only one case was heard and determined by the Board before the 26th of October, although, from my inquiries in the matter, I am assured that a number of persons who did submit such applications did so before the date on which the officer whose case was heard actually submitted his application.</P>
    <P>Since the Hegarty decision was made known, one civil servant named Hughes submitted an application on the same grounds as Mr. Hegarty submitted his.  I understand that a number of other persons also submitted applications, but that the Hughes application is the only one dealt with before the 26th of October, and that on and before the 26th of October the Minister for Finance had in his possession&mdash;certainly they were in official custody&mdash;applications from other persons variously estimated to run between 25 and 40, and that these applications were held up and not referred to the Board.  This date&mdash;the 26th of October&mdash;was put in in order to catch these people in the net.  I want to know on what grounds he referred one application to the Board to deal with before the 26th of October, and held up the others that had been received before the 26th of October.</P>
    <P>In this Bill it seems to me there is revealed a curious inconsistency in Governmental procedure.  One suspects there was a good deal of tortuous manipulation behind the framing of this Bill when a situation of that kind is allowed to arise.  How many applications were received by the Minister's Department after the decision in the Hegarty case was announced by the Compensation Board?  How many of these cases were referred to the Board?  On what date were these applications received from the various applicants?  Did any of the applicants submit an application prior to the application submitted by Mr. Hughes, and if they did, why was Mr. Hughes' application allowed to go to the Board while other applications were held <Col N="290" /> back sufficiently long to make them nugatory under the provisions of this Bill?  That is information which, I think, we ought to have when being asked to consider a Bill in the terms of Section 5 of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which the Minister gave to-day to Deputy General Mulcahy makes it perfectly clear that the problem that is intended to be dealt with by this Bill is of very small proportions indeed from the point of view of the taxpayer.  So far from the Government being presented with a very serious financial embarrassment, as a result of the decision of the Civil Service Compensation Board in the Hegarty case, it is quite apparent that very few civil servants had made up their minds to take advantage of the decision in that case.  Only 40 people, I understand, have, in fact, made application to take advantage of that decision.  Those 40 people made their application before the introduction of this Bill, and I should like to deal with the position they find themselves in now, as a result of the introduction of the Bill, following the lines adumbrated by Deputy Norton a few moments ago, when I come to make a few closing remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with that specific problem and the justice that should be meted out to those people, I should like to express a certain amount of amused astonishment at the expressions used by the Minister in connection with the effect of the Constitution. He repeated with the delight with which he always repeats a phrase to which he becomes attached, that this was a purely legalistic and notional discharge.  That phrase rolled trippingly off the Minister's tongue, and he obviously delighted in that expression.  It gave me a certain measure of delight, too, but of quite a different character&mdash;not quite a phonetic delight, or even a rhetorical delight.  I got a certain amount of amusement in considering the dilemma in which the Government find themselves owing to the Hegarty decision and the operation of the Constitution. If this discharge that was effected by the Constitution is a purely notional discharge, there has been in fact really <Col N="291" /> no change of employer at all, again to use the expression made use of by the Minister.  He said that there had been a change of employer, but only a notional discharge.  If we still live, so to speak, under the same old régime as that under which we lived before the Constitution, the discharge is notional, but if something fundamental, as we were told and as the people were told, was to be effected by this great Constitution, there has been, in truth and in fact and in law, a change of employer.  But if the Minister is right in his expression that it is a purely notional discharge, that it is only a purely notional change of employer and the State which was in existence before this great Constitution came into being is practically identically the same as the State which came into being as a result of this Constitution, I wonder would the Minister and his followers down the country have said that it was merely a notional discharge, or change of employer, if this Constitution which came into operation some months ago declared a republic and brought about a republican form of government? Would Article 10 then have operated, and would there have been merely a notional and legalistic discharge in that set of facts?</P>
    <P>I think nobody would contend for a moment that there had not been a fundamental change of employer and a real discharge from the Government of Saorstát Eireann, even though the Republic of Ireland had re-employed the people; but, merely because we have the Government of Éire employing these civil servants, it is merely a notional change of employment.  Consequently, I take a considerable amount of, shall we say, legalistic delight in seeing the dilemma in which the Government find themselves in arguing this case.  Arguing the Hegarty case, as I was privileged to do, I did take a considerable amount of delight in seeing the very considerable difficulties in which the very learned and efficient senior counsel who appeared for the Minister before the Board found themselves in arguing the case.  We found ourselves in an <Col N="292" /> anomalous position as counsel.  I found myself in the position, as advocate, of arguing that a great change had taken place by virtue of the Constitution, and the Minister's advisers were forced to make the case, in order to win the Hegarty decision, that really no change had taken place at all, so that the Minister will forgive me if I got a certain amount of amusement out of the Hegarty case and out of his speech here to-night.</P>
    <P>We do not intend to oppose this Bill, provided we get the measure of justice for those people who have made their applications, if I may use an incorrect expression, prior to the introduction of this Bill.  I personally had in mind a second condition for support of this Bill, that the Minister would give an undertaking that the privileges and rights which transferred officers and civil servants enjoy by virtue of Article 10 of the Treaty and the Act of 1929 should not be interfered with by this Bill or by the Constitution.  The Minister has, I think, in effect, given that assurance.  The Prime Minister was warned by me and others who spoke during the Constitution debate of what the effect of the Constitution was going to be on the rights of transferred officers under Article 10 of the Treaty and the Act of 1929.  We were told, not in that connection but in another connection which, I suppose, will have been applied to us already, that we did not know what we were talking about when we warned the Prime Minister, then the President of the Executive Council, that he was going to be faced with claims under Article 10 of the Treaty.  He was quite satisfied that everything in the garden was lovely, and then he found that his legal information on that point was not quite correct, and now he decides to bring in a Bill to change that law.  So long as the law suits the Minister and the Government, it is all right, but if it does not suit them, we must change it.  I do not think the Minister for Finance, on this occasion, at all events, whatever he might have done last June and July, will be in a position to accuse Deputy Norton and myself and those whom we represent and those who are associated with us <Col N="293" /> of endeavouring to make political capital out of our advocacy of the rights of civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry need not talk, or I shall tell him a few home truths.  The Minister for Finance accused us of making political capital out of the Civil Service on the last occasion.  I reiterate here that the attitude I have taken in reference to the Civil Service in past years is precisely the same as that which I am taking on this Bill.  I am merely asking for justice, equity and fair play for them and I ask on this Bill for justice, equity and fair play for the Civil Service.  A suitable period, nearly 12 months, has now elapsed since Mr. Hegarty made his application to retire under Article 10.  I think it is very nearly 12 months since he made up his mind to clear out under the provisions of the Constitution which had then not become law. If it did become law, he intended to go.  Forty people only have intimated their intention of going and of those 40, only two are being allowed out, one who gave his name to the decision, Mr. Hegarty, and the other, the gentleman referred to by Deputy Norton, Mr. Hughes.  Numbers of these applications, I understand, were in fact with the Minister before the case was actually heard by the Compensation Board in the case of Mr. Hughes, and, in fact, before Mr. Hughes intimated his intention of taking advantage of the decision in Hegarty's case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just as well that the public should know that Mr. Hughes' original application to retire was not following the decision in the Hegarty case, but on the ground of worsened conditions entirely apart from the Hegarty case. He made application subsequently to have referred to the Compensation Board his claim to retire following the decision in the Hegarty case, and the board, of course, had no option in that set of facts&mdash;when the Minister did refer that further claim to the board&mdash; but to follow their previous decision. Mr. Hughes' application to take advantage of the Hegarty case was made long subsequent to the majority, or certainly a number of the people <Col N="294" /> who wished to retire, having regard to the decision of the board in the Hegarty case.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister and his advisers or legal representatives were actually threatened with <i>mandamus</i> proceedings on behalf of some of the people calling upon him to refer their claims to the board.  The fact that <i>mandamus</i> proceedings were not taken&mdash;and there would have been no answer to these <i>mandamus</i> proceedings in court had they been taken&mdash; was due merely to the fact that both the civil servants involved and their legal advisers were unwilling to drag this matter into the courts, in the belief that they might get the very barest measure of justice from the Minister to which they were entitled, namely, a very early reference of their case to the board.  The <i>mandamus</i> proceedings, as I have said, would have been unanswerable.  There would have been no answer to them had they been brought up by these people, but now they find themselves committed by this Bill to the deprivation of what were, in fact, vested rights.  I spoke already of making application to retire, but legally and really that is incorrect because these people, in effect, were discharged once the new Government came into being, and it only remained for the board to assess the amount of compensation to which these people were entitled, if that were a matter in dispute, as it probably would not be in the case of these 40 people concerned.  The Minister, however, apparently did not take the view that these people had a right to go straightway, but what he did was to conform to the unvarying traditions of the Ministry of Finance, and that was to delay and postpone the matter. Evidently, they sat upon the question until the last possible moment, and then this Bill was introduced in order to deprive these people of their rights.</P>
    <P>Now, there is a further category of those people who have actually applied.  Many of the 40 people concerned were in the position where their cases were actually referred to the board for decision, and it was only a question of the convenience of the board which prevented their cases <Col N="295" /> being heard before this Bill was introduced, and having their position copper-fastened in the same way as in the case of Mr. Hughes.  We would be prepared to give this Bill to the Minister if he will accede to the request that those people, whose applications had been made already to have their cases transferred to the board, or who otherwise intimated their intention of taking the benefit of the Hegarty decision, should get the benefit of that decision and not be deprived, by reason of this Bill of their actual rights.  That is what we ask, and I think it is the barest justice. I think that equity would require that the transferred officers concerned should be entitled to a reasonable time within which to make up their minds as to whether or not they would take advantage of the Hegarty decision. However, I do not say that we want even that, but I do say that the minimum that should be granted is that those people, who had intimated their intention to retire in consequence of the Hegarty case, should be given their rights which, undoubtedly, they had before this Bill was introduced, and that the scope of Section 4 of the Bill should be amended accordingly. If the Minister gives an assurance to that effect, and that he will introduce an amendment on the Committee Stage of the Bill to deal with the matter, we shall be prepared to give him the Bill; but if not, I have to tell the Minister that we shall be disposed to take all the steps we can take in order to oppose this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. McEntee Mr. McEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, Sir, I should begin by dealing with the more contentious elements in this debate, and accordingly I shall take, firstly, the first speaker on the Opposition side of the House.  If ever there was an example of a mountain being made out of a molehill, we had it in Deputy Mulcahy's speech to-night.  With an exaggerated emphasis upon my misdemeanours with regard to the civil servants and my attitude, generally, towards them, in that connection, he painted the blackest picture possible of the alleged doleful circumstances that afflicted civil servants in this <Col N="296" /> country.  He said, in effect, that, due to the persecution, as I might almost say of the Civil Service by this Government, the civil servants of this country were in such a state that the moment they saw a chance to get out of the Service they rushed, like a herd in a panic, to get through the gate.</P>
      <P>Now, what does it all amount to? Out of 9,000 civil servants in the employment of this Government, 40 individuals who, either one way or the other, may have other interests to serve, have tried to avail of the loophole which was opened to them by the passing of the new Constitution, to get out of the Civil Service under enhanced terms and conditions of pension&mdash;40 out of 9,000.  It is upon that slender and, I might almost say, illusive fact that Deputy Mulcahy based his indictment here to-night of the Government in general and the Minister for Finance in particular with regard to this matter of the Civil Service. I think that, from the figures that the Deputy himself cited, it can be shown that the overwhelming mass of the civil servants or public servants of this country are well satisfied with the treatment they have got under this Government, that all of them are satisfied that they get justice and that, so far from political partisanship being the passport to promotion, as Deputy Mulcahy says, what does secure promotion in the Civil Service is zeal in the public service and capacity in that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy made the wide and sweeping statement that political partisanship is the passport to promotion in the Civil Service to-day.  Since we came into office we have made very many important appointments to all classes of posts in the Civil Service, and I should like the Deputy to be just, and to support the very serious charge he has made, by citing any cases in which he would allege that political partisanship, and not ability and capacity, has been the determining factor in those appointments or promotions. Again, in order to show how false and misleading the Deputy's statements have been, I have only got to refer to the information with which I supplied him to-day.  According to <Col N="297" /> him there was not anybody above the rank of a higher executive officer who tried to get out of the Service upon the basis of the Hegarty decision.  I think he said that there were three higher executive officers&mdash;and that is the class which, with the grades above it, might be affected if there were political favouritism in the public service&mdash;who were anxious to leave the Service.  In other words, out of all that very large and very important class there are only three officers, according to the figures I gave to the Deputy and according to the statement he made here in this House, who are anxious to leave the Service.  I do not want to go into individual cases, but almost all of these men are men who are still in middle life, still with opportunities of employment offering outside the Civil Service &mdash;some of them might have remained no doubt&mdash;but here they saw a chance of going out upon enhanced terms, with ten years' added service, with enhanced pensions, with increased lump sum allowances, and with the possibility, as we have seen here only the other day in the case of one of the men who actually did retire, of getting lucrative positions elsewhere.  I should have said that it was more self-interest, merely a desire to advance their own interests in a way in which they could not be advanced in the Civil Service because, after all, the opportunities for promotion in the Civil Service are limited, particularly at the top; it was, as I say, more likely, a desire to improve their own position, to serve their own interests that caused those men to leave the Service, than being driven out by any vindictive action on the part of the Government.  I resent very much the allegation which the Deputy levelled against us, because I think that if he himself would survey the appointments which have been made by this Government he could not say that in any particular instance political partisanship was the avenue to promotion. Men who served our predecessors have been promoted under this Government.  There is no person who served the preceeding Government who has not been fairly considered for promotion when that promotion opened to him.  I do not want to particularise, <Col N="298" /> but the Deputy must know of cases of people about whom, for one reason or another, it might have been thought&mdash; perhaps because of the way in which they were closely identified and associated with events prior to 1923, and that sort of thing&mdash;by some people outside that they would not receive fair play or justice at our hands.  I defy the Deputy to produce a single instance in which any person has been victimised because he served our predecessors loyally.  All that we have looked for from any civil servant is that he serve the Government of the day loyally and with his whole heart. Wherever that has been done, the person who has shown that zeal in the public service, has shown that he is capable of filling the vacancy when a chance of promotion offers, has been treated fairly and justly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton mentioned the matter of Mr. Hughes.  I think that Deputy Costello has dealt with that case.  The position was this:  that Mr. Hughes had applied to retire upon other grounds than those of discharge from the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  I think that the date had been appointed for the hearing of his application to retire on those grounds when he came along with his subsequent application to retire upon the grounds of discharge. Apparently the Article X Tribunal had been assembled to hear the first case, and naturally when one part of his claim to retire had gone to the board the other part of the claim automatically went to the board also.  When the case came before the Article X Board, Mr. Hughes did not press any of the grounds upon which he had originally applied to be permitted to retire, but relied solely upon the Hegarty case, and the decision was given accordingly in his favour upon the same grounds as it was given in the Hegarty case.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister allow me to ask him a question?  Is it not true that Mr. Hughes' second application had to be referred to the board by the Minister?  Did the Minister refer the second application to the board, and did he do so while he had other applications in his possession <Col N="299" /> and did not refer the other applications?</P>

      <P>I did, in the case of Mr. Hughes.  I did it because I was advised that the second application might be made before the Board, and that it was as well to let the application as a whole go to the Board.  I accepted that point of view and I allowed the application to go as a whole to the board and not to have it tried in parts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to go so far as to say that Mr. Hughes, when he applied, had in mind the particular position which he subsequently secured, but I am merely instancing this fact that immediately after he had retired Mr. Hughes secured this position, and that I would be simply foolish if I did not think that before Mr. Hughes applied to retire he had some such position in his mind's eye.  I do not like discussing Mr. Hughes here in this way, but since the matter has been raised I think the Deputy will remember that there was a very brief interval between the decision in Mr. Hughes' case and the appearance in the Press of the statement that he had been appointed to a particular position in the service of a Civil Service organisation in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot expect me to agree to that, because I do not know what was in Mr. Hughes' mind at any time in regard to this.  I have merely instanced this fact here, that within a few days after the determination of his claim to retire by Article X one of the transferred officers received what I presume, and what I hope, is a lucrative <Col N="300" /> appointment in the service of a Civil Service organisation in Great Britain I merely instanced that fact to show that, after all, we could not assume that every one of the 40 persons who were retiring were retiring simply because they had been ill-treated by the Minister for Finance; that some of them had perhaps other axes to grind, and if they had&mdash;well, it is only ordinary normal human nature, and I for one, would not blame them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello, in the opening part of his speech, I think rather tried to ring the changes upon a phrase which I used.  Of course, I would say that in order that one should ring the changes successfully, there has to be a certain sleight of mind, quickness of mind and ambiguity of metaphor.  I said that there had been legalistic and notional discharge from the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  I said that there had been a change of employer, but that there had been no actual discharge from employment.  From that Deputy Costello proceeded to argue here in the House that I had said there had only been a notional change of employer.  On the contrary, there had been both a notional and an actual change:  the notion had been realised, as a concrete fact.  The notion of a change of employer had been realised in fact when Saorstát Eireann ceased to exist and the new State of Éire took its place.  That is what the Article X Tribunal found.  It found that upon the coming into operation of the Constitution of Éire, the Government of Saorstát Eireann ceased to exist, but it also found that, though the Government of Saorstát Eireann as employer had ceased to exist, Mr. Hegarty was not thereby discharged from his office as Assistant Inspector of National Health Insurance.  There had been a change of employer, and I presume it was argued that since the employer had ceased to exist, the deceased employer must have discharged the employee, but there was no actual discharge from his employment. It does not follow, because there has been no actual discharge from employment, that, as Deputy Costello tried to argue, there has been no change of employer.  In fact, all <Col N="301" /> of us know that there may be a change of employer but no discharge from employment. Not merely may there be a change of employer, but there may be a change of job, and yet a man may not cease to be employed.  When a firm changes hands, and a person who is in the employment continues at work and is paid for it, although perhaps not doing the same thing as he did under the old firm and under the old management, well, obviously there has been a change of employer and there may have been a change of employment, but the man has not lost his job.  He continues as an employee. His employment has been continuous. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that, because, as I stated, there has been only a legalistic and notional discharge, that there has not been a change of employer.  There was, in fact.  That is what the Article X Board found&mdash;that the Government of Saorstát Eireann had been superseded, had been replaced, had been ousted, if you like, by the Government of Éire; that a new State had come into being, and that the former constitutional régime had ceased completely.  That is what the court found, and, mind you, that is what Deputy Costello was arguing before the Article X Tribunal.  As I said, he found himself in this position, that he was arguing that a great and fundamental change had taken place in the employer, and the Article X Board agreed with Deputy Costello, as many intelligent people would no doubt, in regard to many questions agree with Deputy Costello when Deputy Costello was arguing as a lawyer or as a competent layman, and not as a politician in opposition.</P>
    <P>The position in which we find ourselves then is that when Deputy Costello is looking at the law and the Constitution outside this House, and is looking at it in the interests of his clients, he agrees with the Government and takes the view of the Constitution which the Government takes in this House and outside this House. In fact, we have Deputy Costello as a dual personality.  He comes in here and, as a politician in opposition, argues that there has been no change, that the Constitution has made no <Col N="302" /> change, but when he comes before a judicial tribunal, and has to argue the case, he takes the Government point of view and agrees that there has been a great and fundamental change in the employer.  He agrees with us that Saorstát Eireann as we knew it has ceased to exist and that the new State of Éire has taken its place. Having got Deputy Costello to agree on that, we hope that the Government and every Party in this House will be at one in their attitude towards the Constitution and in agreement on the great and fundamental change which has taken place in the constitutional position in this country.</P>

      <P>Article X was designed to protect those officers who were transferred from the British service to the service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann against victimisation, against wrongful discharge, against deliberate alteration, to their detriment, of their conditions of service.  This Article X Tribunal has found that there was no discharge; that Mr. Hegarty was not thereby discharged from his office as assistant inspector of National Health Insurance, and there has been no alteration to their detriment in the conditions of service of any civil servant, neither Mr. Hegarty nor Mr. Hughes, nor any one of the other 38 people who have applied on this constitutional ground.</P>

      <P>Their conditions of service remain unaltered.  Their actual employment has been continuous. Why, therefore, should we ask the taxpayers of this country to pay, because such payment is not going to <Col N="303" /> come out of the pocket of the Minister for Finance, I can assure the Deputy, nor out of the pockets of the members of the Government collectively, nor out of the pockets of the members of the Dáil or of the Seanad or the whole three estates of the realm combined?  We are not going to pay the enhanced pensions which are going to be paid if we allow 40 people to walk out with ten added years of pensionable service, and with, as I have said, increased lump sum allowances.  It is going to have to be paid by the taxpayers of this country, and therefore, as the Deputy has said quite correctly, I bauk at the idea of asking the country to pay that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mind you, I am prepared to take into consideration the fact that this constitutional door was opened.  The courts have decided in favour of two men.  There are 38 others whose cases are probably on all fours.  There are ten others whose cases, I think, were in before Mr. Hughes' case; there may be more.  I will confess that because I have been anxious to do justice meticulously to the transferred officers, and to deal with them fairly, I have been very worried as to what my attitude should be in regard to those applications.  After a great deal of consideration I put down this date, the 26th day of October.  If the House feels, as I am quite prepared to admit, that there may be some hardship, and that it is invidious to make distinctions between the thirty-eight applications which were in and which were not heard and the two which were in and had the good fortune, if you like, to be heard, if the House feels that on grounds of broad equity as between each of those individuals and the two others whose applications have been allowed, it would be invidious to make a distinction, I am quite prepared to accept the decision and the wishes of the House; but, as I say, I do baulk at it, and it has been one of the difficulties which I have had in dealing with this Bill, because, as I say none of them has been worsened so far as actual conditions of service go.  I do know that there is something to be said for not coercing into service men <Col N="304" /> who are anxious to get out at the present time.  As I say, it is a matter for the House.  If I thought that the House could give me all the stages of this Bill next week so that I might dispose of it quickly, I would be quite prepared&mdash;if that is the general feeling&mdash;in order to clear up all this matter, to introduce an amendment which would meet the views that have been expressed by the Opposition and, I think, by the Leader of the Labour Party.  However, as I say, I am in the hands of the House in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The total additional sum required in this Estimate is £7,400, made up as to £5,000 under sub-head A, which relates to bounties on sugar made from home-grown beet, and as to £2,400 in respect of tobacco grown in Ireland after 1st January, 1934, allocated to a manufacturer, and subsequently destroyed.  It will be remembered that in the Budget speech I indicated that it was our intention to make a drawback in respect of home-grown tobacco allocated to a manufacturer and subsequently destroyed, and provision was made in Section 23 of the Finance Act this year to enable that to be done.  A sum of £2,400 is required to give effect to that decision and to the statutory provision. The remaining supplementary sum of £5,000 is required because it has been ascertained that a large manufacturing and exporting concern will require a larger amount of home-manufactured sugar than was originally contracted <Col N="306" /> for and was contemplated when the original Estimate was prepared.  It is probable that almost 3,000 tons of home-manufactured sugar will rank for payment of bounty in the current financial year, and to enable this bounty to be paid an additional sum of £5,000 is required.  I suppose the House understands that this bounty is paid on the export of manufactured goods in which home-manufactured sugar has been used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making some observations on this motion when the Dáil adjourned on last Wednesday evening.  Beyond dealing with a few points raised by Deputy Brennan, for one, in regard to the maize meal mixture scheme, I have not very much more to say.  It is true that I did give notice to the farmers that at the end of this cereal year, that is at the end of August, 1939, I thought it probable that the maize meal mixture regulations would not be continued.  I gave as the reason for that that, first of all, it could no longer be claimed that wheat growing was in an experimental stage, that it was possible for any farmer who wanted to grow a cash crop to turn to wheat or oats, and that those who were growing barley for feeding, apart from farmers who were growing barley for malting, could turn to wheat if they wanted to grow a cash crop.  I also pointed out that for the last two years we had not found it necessary to raise the percentage beyond 10 or 15 per cent. in order to absorb all the surplus grain available for sale. Taking all these things into consideration, we thought that the advantages which accrued to growers from the maize meal mixture scheme were more than counterbalanced by the disadvantage to the feeders.  On that account it was decided that we might drop the maize meal mixture scheme at the end of the present year.  I should not like, however, to accept Deputy Brennan's contention that the fact that we dropped the scheme proves that it was a mistake or a failure.  I think Deputies who remember the conditions that prevailed when the scheme was first brought into operation in 1934 and 1935 will admit that some such scheme was required in order to absorb the barley and oats that were then on hands. <Col N="309" /> At that time farmers who were growing a cash crop were largely engaged in barley-growing but now a number of farmers have turned to wheat and the same necessity does not hold.</P>
      <P>There were a few other points made in regard to the motion but I do not think they need any further comment from me.  I want to come to the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Dillon and moved by Deputy Brennan.  Deputy Dillon, in effect, asks for a commission to inquire into the agricultural industry.  That is a suggestion that has been made from various quarters in the last three or four years.  In fact there was a motion before the Seanad some time in the beginning of the summer to the same effect, namely, that a commission should be set up.  For a long time I was opposed to such a course, at first on general grounds, that to inquire into agriculture was such a very big task.  You might as well ask a commission to inquire into what is wrong with the world or if there is anything wrong with it.  It is a very big subject and it is almost impossible to expect any commission to report on it in a reasonable time.  I thought that if we were going to agree to this at all it would be better perhaps to take some phase of agriculture, such as production, which is mentioned here, the improvement of the bacon industry or of the egg industry.  It would be better to take the question piecemeal in that way and have, if you like, a commission to inquire into one or other of these questions rather than have them go into the big general question of what is wrong with agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly, I might have been very much more opposed to this two or three years ago than I am now because it is quite obvious that, if a commission were set up before the economic war was finished, a number of witnesses would give as their evidence that what was wrong with agriculture was the economic war, whilst other witnesses might say something else.  It would have developed into a trial by jury of the merits or demerits of the economic war.  Conditions have now changed and I do not now see the same objections <Col N="310" /> as I did then to the setting up of a commission.  Although I am, perhaps, not as optimistic as Deputy Dillon or Deputy Brennan may be about the results of a commission, I cannot see that we can oppose it very strongly, and if there is a desire from any Party here or from the House in general that a commission be set up to inquire into agriculture, or all phases of the agricultural industry, all I can say is: Let us go ahead and set it up.</P>
    <P>The amendment opens with the statement that it is essential &ldquo;to increase the production and profitable sale of agricultural produce and to that end a loan should be made available to agriculturists at a rate of interest not exceeding 3 per cent.&rdquo;  Then the terms of reference are to be &ldquo;to recommend proposals for increasing the volume and value of agricultural production in all its branches and that, pending a report of the commission of inquiry, the rates on agricultural land as and from 1st April next be met out of the National Exchequer.&rdquo;  I should like very much to agree to that <i>in toto</i> but I do not see that we can.  It is all very well to inquire into the matter that is referred to there, that is, to inquire into proposals for increasing the volume and value of agricultural production.  That is a question that I think might very well form the subject of inquiry.  Perhaps we might get some very valuable information as a result of hearing the evidence of people who are prepared to give evidence, and as a result of the deliberations of the commission we might get some useful recommendations.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, see that we could, without due consideration, agree to the latter part of the amendment&mdash;that rates on agricultural land should be met out of the National Exchequer. That would mean providing a sum of £1,500,000, roughly, for that purpose. If I were to favour that course and recommend it to the Government, naturally the Government would ask me, &ldquo;How is this money to be got in another way?&rdquo;  I do not know how it could be got.  However it might be got, the farmers would have to pay their due share of it in whatever type of <Col N="311" /> taxation might be levied.  I have expressed the view here already, and I should like to express it again, that if we had money available for the benefit of agriculture I am not so sure at all that the best way to spend that money would be on derating.  I think if we had money available and if we could spend it for increasing production it would be very much better. Therefore I do not want to have the whole position prejudiced by having rates remitted or dropped while this commission is sitting.  As I say, I do not think the Government could agree to that.  I have not asked them to agree and I do not think they could agree to the motion in full.  I am prepared to agree, however, to the setting up of a commission to consider and make recommendations as to the measures to be taken to increase the volume and value of agricultural production.  Of course it will be understood, naturally, that the methods should be practicable or feasible methods, measures not only to increase and promote agricultural production but also to maintain agricultural production.</P>
    <P>All these things have to be considered, so that I think we could set up a commission more or less on the lines of the terms of reference set out here&mdash;that is wide terms of reference, a commission that would be empowered to enquire into anything practically. Naturally, if a commission is asked to consider the method of increasing agricultural production, well it is quite free to consider derating because the commission could say: &ldquo;It is within our terms of reference to say whether derating is or is not against agricultural production.&rdquo;  Give them wide terms of reference and let them consider all these matters as best they can.</P>
    <P>With regard to the personnel, I do not know if what is set out here on the order paper is the best method of approaching that.  As a matter of fact, I think that Deputy Brennan said, when speaking, that his Party was not tied to the method laid down in the amendment as regards the personnel, and that as far as they were concerned they were quite willing to leave it to the Government to set up the commission and select the personnel in the <Col N="312" /> ordinary way.  I think myself that is much better.  I think, if you were setting up a commission, it would not be wise to go to one body for one nominee, and to another body for another nominee.  If you were to do that, you might not get the sort of balanced commission that one would like to get.  On a commission of this sort I would like to have, first of all, a number of farmers.  You would want farmers on it.  Every Deputy knows that farming is such a very big industry that there is no farmer who could claim to speak for all phases of agriculture. You would want at least four or five farmers to deal with the different phases of agriculture&mdash;live stock, tillage poultry, eggs, pigs and so on.  Then you have another very big body of farmers, the smaller and the poorer farmers living in the mountain districts.  They would have to be represented, so that to start off with you would probably want to have at least five farmers on the commission. Other interests, of course, would also have to be represented such as agricultural labour, people with the financial view and economists, if possible&mdash;that is theoretical economists&mdash;so that when you had given representation to all these interests you would have a commission consisting of 11, 13 or 15 people.</P>
    <P>I think it is much better that the whole commission should be nominated in that way rather than on the lines set out here.  You will get a better balanced commission.  On the other hand, if you were to ask different bodies to nominate representatives you might not get the balance that you required.  That means that the Government would be prepared to set up a commission roughly on the terms of reference set out&mdash;that is very wide terms of reference&mdash;nominating the personnel on the Government's own responsibility so as to try and balance the commission as well as possible, taking into account all the different interests that should be represented.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I have anything more to say.  I do not think there should be a long delay about setting up the commission.  Deputies understand, of course, that we will have to think about the personnel.  People will <Col N="313" /> have to be written to and asked if they are prepared to sit on the commission, but taking everything into account it may be two or three weeks before the personnel of the commission is announced.  After that, the members will be called together and asked to go on with their business.</P>
    <P>I had thought of another matter, and perhaps I had better mention it now, and that is of having a tribunal instead of a commission.  I do not know if Deputies are familiar with the difference between a tribunal and a commission.  I confess that I was not until I went into the matter.  A tribunal is a more expert body: in other words, you appoint a body which will take evidence and report on the evidence without giving their own views at all.  That might be a very useful thing, but under our legislation we would have to set up that tribunal to inquire into a matter of urgent public importance: into a particular matter. This is not a particular matter: it is a very general matter.  I suppose we might say that it is urgent and public, but on the other hand those who criticise us would say, I suppose, that it was just as urgent and public five years ago as it is now.  On the whole, I think it is better to have a commission than a tribunal.  A tribunal would be a smaller and a more expert body. The members of it would be more impersonal.  They would hear the evidence and report on the evidence.  On a commission you usually put people who know more about a subject and who give their own views, perhaps. On the whole, I would be in favour of a commission in our present circumstances, taking into account the subject and the wide range of material the members will have to go through.  We will keep the numbers on the commission as low as we can, and set it up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Government is prepared to accede to this part of the resolution, I do not think there would be very much use in my talking about the other parts of the resolution, because anything that I or anybody else might have to say had better perhaps be put to the commission rather than to this House.</P>

      <P>We are extremely grateful to the Minister and the Government for accepting at least the broad outline of a commission to inquire into the things contained in the resolution, including the question of derating.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are grateful for that.  The next matter is the constitution of the commission.  This Party is not wedded to the particular type of commission set out in the resolution. These were suggestions thrown out with a view to broadening the basis of the commission: to ensure that, as far as possible all the bigger classes will be represented on it.  The Minister apparently has reason for thinking that some other type of commission might meet the situation better.  Might I ask if the Minister would be prepared to make it possible to secure agreement on the broad constitution of the commission which he proposes to establish &mdash;not on the personnel, because that is a matter for the Government?</P>
      <P>The Minister was not quite clear on one point.  He said that, without due consideration, the Government would not be prepared to make a grant in lieu of rates pending the working of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister is building up the commission, or taking decisions as to its constitution, and communicating with various people as to whether they would be willing to act or not, if appointed, could not the time be employed giving due consideration to the recommendations made here?  If the position is, as outlined by the Minister, that due consideration has not yet been given to that question, I <Col N="315" /> suggest that it is of sufficient importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It will have a great number of questions to inquire into, and, presumably, will have to collect an immense volume of evidence, statistics, etc.  Apparently, it is the type of commission that would sit for years.</P>

      <P>If it sits for years, or if years intervene between the appointment and the time for consideration of its report, the situation, at least, with regard to a considerable number of farmers may in the meantime have become so very desperate that no suggestions made as a result to the report of the commission, will be in time to save them.  I urge the Minister very strongly, as the representative of agriculture in the Executive Council, to use every bit of influence he has in endeavouring to get the Government to agree to the very reasonable suggestions made here, namely, that while the commission is sitting a grant equal to the agricultural rates would be made to the various councils, so that the work of the commission would not be either hurried or embarrassed by the fact that many people in the industry into which they are inquiring, are being very seriously bent or broken by the overhead pressure of rates, as well as other charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to intervene again to prevent this discussion going on the lines Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned. I should like to allay any feelings that the Deputy had in mind.  As Deputies know, it is usual when a commission is set up for the Minister to meet the members and to give them an idea of its work.  He could say: &ldquo;If you think there is anything urgent I would be very glad if you reported.&rdquo;  I quite agree with Deputy O'Higgins that the commission should sit probably for three or four years in order to <Col N="316" /> examine everything.  That does not mean that it need not report in the meantime on anything that is urgent. As to derating, I have said that I thought it was not the best way to help agriculture.  If the commission comes to the conclusion that it is the best way, and says so in an interim report, I suppose the Government will have to face it.  Anyway we will have to face the report.  I think it is better to let the commission examine the position, including derating, and if they wish let them issue an interim report.  I intend to say to the commission that if they think there is anything urgent they could issue an interim report, whether on derating or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the announcement made by the Minister, that the Government have agreed to set up this commission, is very pleasant news, indeed, to those who represent the agricultural community.  On this side of the House, when we considered the motion proposed by Deputy Cogan, we felt that, while its terms might be beneficial as a temporary measure of relief, they were not in themselves a solution of the many problems affecting agriculture. For that reason, by the amendment we recommended the Government to set up a commission, because we felt that a new set of circumstances exist here as a result of the settlement of the economic war, the report of the Banking Commission, and the disappearance from the horizon of a war that was imminent in Europe for the last few months.  Now is the time for a careful examination and a complete orientation of the real position of agriculture. That is why we suggested that this commission should be composed of practical, and of expert minds, to determine what is the real position of the industry, and then to bend themselves to the task of finding a solution of the many problems that affect agriculture, problems that are, undoubtedly, preventing this country taking its rightful place amongst the best food-producing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has acceded to that part of the amendment, but I am sorry that the Government have <Col N="317" /> not seen their way to accede to the latter portion, that is, the relief of rates on agricultural land.  The Minister has admitted that, if the work is to be properly done, this is a very big problem for a commission.  This good news will have a tremendous psychological effect on farmers when they read their newspapers to-morrow morning.  They will say: &ldquo;Thank God something is going to be done for agriculture at last.&rdquo;  While an examination is going to be made to ascertain the real position of agriculture, in the meantime are people on whom falls 80 per cent. or 85 per cent. of the burden of local taxation to be expected to carry these burdens?  What are these burdens?  They have to pay for services from which they get no benefit.  They have to pay for all services and institutions established under the Medical Charities Act. They pay for home help, at least to the extent of 85 per cent, in towns and villages, and they have to pay the difference between the economic rent and the actual rent charged for cottages built under the Labourers Acts.  They have also to pay for water and sewerage schemes for towns and villages, for services under the Slaughter of Animals Act, the inspection of eggs as well as the inspection of shops under the Conditions of Employment Act.  It is an amazing state of affairs, that the agricultural community should be asked to pay for the inspection of shops under the Conditions of Employment Act in towns, as in the ordinary course of events they have no responsibility for that service.</P>
    <P>From what the Taoiseach said last week we could infer that there may be further charges on local authorities under the A.R.P. scheme.  I should point out that in the case of relief grants, any money made available to county councils is conditional on the local authorities putting up 50 per cent. of the cost.  I do not think it is the responsibility of the agricultural community to bear such burdens.  In this case we are not asking for any concessions.  I think the Minister pointed out that if money were made available it could be put to better use for other purposes.</P>
    <P>I submit, Sir, that it is not a matter <Col N="318" /> at all of how this sum of money might be spent.  It is a matter of simple justice and equity.  It is a matter of protesting against any particular section of the community paying for those services.  A citizen in a well-ordered State must make his fair contribution to the Government for the establishment of good social conditions and decent society in the country.  The agricultural community are quite prepared to bear their portion of that responsibility. The agricultural community are quite prepared to contribute their fair portion but why should the agricultural community be asked to bear 85 per cent. of that charge? Why should not certain types of people like professional people, civil servants, superintendents and commissioners of the Gárda Síochána, men in the commercial life of the country, men earning big salaries, living in houses with small valuations, men carrying on big businesses in the commercial life of the country in houses with small valuations which bear no relation whatever to a farmer's valuation and their income bearing absolutely no relation to the income or the earning capacity of a farmer&mdash;why should they not bear their portion? In other words, I submit that a man's valuation is no indication whatever of his earning capacity and that the citizen should contribute to poor law services and to social services and the cost of local administration according to his earning capacity.  That is our case for derating.  We are not coming here whining or begging for relief or for any concession.  We are simply demanding simple justice and equity for one section of the people.  It is not a question, as I said before, whether this money could be spent to a better purpose or not.  I may say I do not believe it could be spent for any better purpose, but, whether it could or not, it is not a question of how it could be spent but is a matter of doing justice and I think the Government in their decision ought to take that aspect of the case into account. We all realise that this commission, if it is going to do its job well and right, is tackling a very big problem. To survey the wide aspects of agriculture to-day in all its ramifications is <Col N="319" /> a big job and it will take time.  We want it well done and done right and we do not want it rushed but, in the meantime, for the unfortunate people that are suffering and that have borne all the burdens for the last few years, I think it is up to the Government to see that this temporary measure of relief is introduced at all events and, if you like, let the commission decide afterwards.  That is what we have asked in our amendment&mdash;that that relief should be given immediately pending the decision or the report of the commission which the Minister has agreed to set up.</P>
    <P>The actual position as far as the agricultural community is concerned is that our industry here, after emerging from the turmoil and the burdens of the economic war, found itself in a very distressed condition and, on top of that condition, as I say, through local taxation, the Government have been piling on ever increasing burdens and side by side with those difficulties, we have had, as a result of an intense drive for industrial development, a great many monopolies created in this country, with the inevitable result that the cost of production has increased so much to the farmer that it has seriously retarded and reduced agricultural output.  That, to my mind, is one of the real problems in this case. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has often talked about the necessity of a balanced economy in this country but we find to-day that there is no balance whatever and no relation whatever between the cost of goods manufactured here and the price we receive for agricultural produce. In a word, to my mind the real cause of our trouble here is not that we are getting bad prices for our agricultural produce but because the cost of production is so great and overhead charges so high that the margin of profit has seriously diminished and, in some cases, actually disappeared, with the inevitable result that, through loss of a fair margin of profit and, in some cases, through capital losses, the farmers are completely discouraged and the industry is suffering from a state of stagnation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> We suggest that many things could be done.  Deputy Brennan has pointed out that the fertility of the soil here has been seriously reduced and that not sufficient attention has been paid to soil condition.  That is a matter that must be examined because it is the very basis of our economy.  The success of agriculture and not only of agriculture but of any secondary industry that may be started in this country depends absolutely on the fertility and productivity of the soil. If that is seriously retarded in any way then every industrial activity in this country is going to suffer.  That question needs to be examined.  I think that it ought to be examined immediately. It ought to be one of the first phases this commission ought to examine.  As a matter of fact, I think a certain amount of research work ought to be done right away to examine the soil condition here in this country.  There is keen competition to-day among the food producing countries of the world, and transport facilities have increased so much and transport costs have been reduced so much that it has brought those countries, so to speak, much closer together, with the result that the countries competing for that great market, the British market, have made prices so keen that this country, if we want to hold our market there, must be on our toes about it.  We have not been.  We have been doing our business here in a haphazard, slipshod manner.  We want better methods, more scientific methods of farming, a new technique, if you like, with regard to our methods of agriculture.</P>
    <P>We must first of all tackle this problem of fertility.  In that lie vast possibilities.  We must make our land carry more stock and produce more food.  There is occurring in this country a tremendous loss through the wastage of live stock over the winter period.  Our live stock emerge in the spring time in very poor condition.  I suppose we are about the only country in the world to allow a big percentage of our stock to go back in condition during the winter period.  That is a matter that requires close attention.  It is only by producing better fodder, <Col N="321" /> more nutritious grass and hay, that live stock can be carried over the winter without losing condition.  There arises then the question of concentrated foods.  I think concentrated foods have cost the farmer too much, and there is no inducement to him to invest money in that direction, with the result that in a great many cases he allows his stock to lose condition. That is an aspect which must be examined.</P>
    <P>Now we turn to the question of tillage.  The Minister taunted this Party on Wednesday night last.  He told us we were converted to his way of thinking, that we were now supporting wheat growing.  Our attitude on wheat growing is this, that you cannot have violent changes in agricultural policy every time you have a change of Government here, that there must be some continuity of policy.  For the last few years a new set of circumstances was developed as far as the tillage farmer was concerned.  For instance, in regard to oats, you had in the past a home market available for oats, a pretty big market, too.  A large quantity of oats was consumed by cart horses in the towns and cities.  That consumption has practically disappeared because in the towns and cities the horses are practically gone, being replaced by lorries and other petrol-driven vehicles.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue growing cereals here, we must turn our minds to something other than oats.  There must be some continuity of policy and, as the Minister has introduced the wheat scheme, we propose to continue that wheat scheme.  I may say that I have had some experience of growing wheat and I certainly do not agree with the Minister or his Department in encouraging farmers in this country to grow wheat indiscriminately on every type of land, with a complete disregard for a proper rotation of crops on the farm. That is what we have been doing, and that is what the farmers are still being encouraged to do.  Land has been broken up and three or four crops of wheat have been taken from it, the grower relying on the vegetable matter in the soil to produce the three or four crops.  A lot of that land has been put <Col N="322" /> back to grass again without any farmyard manure being placed upon it, and the result is that the land is in a low state of fertility.  The Minister should not encourage wheat growing on every type of land, irrespective of the suitability of the soil and without any regard for crop rotation.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of wheat growing that we should not lose sight of if we are anxious to continue growing wheat.  The Minister is definitely encouraging early winter wheat growing. As a farmer with a fair amount of experience in wheat growing, I disagree with the Minister and his Department in that connection.  This country grew wheat extensively in the past, when wheat was a good price. We grew a considerable quantity up to the Franco-Prussian War; we contined to grow it up to the early eighties of the last century.  The country went out of wheat production at a time when it was relatively a much better price than it is to-day. We went out of wheat growing for the simple reason that winter wheat growing fouled the land and reduced the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <P>The conditions of the soil here are such that there is a tendency to grow quite a quantity of grass and weeds. That is due to the humidity of our climate, to our peculiar temperature. The weather conditions here are so mild that there is a natural tendency for the land to produce weeds in large quantities.  Winter wheat growing has had that effect.  Many people think wheat is heavy on land.  I believe it is not too heavy on land; I believe that the amount of weeds and scutch and other foul stuff produced by allowing the land to lie over a long winter period under a winter crop are more responsible than the crop itself for the reduction of the fertility of the soil.  If the Minister and his Department are interested in wheat growing in this country, they ought to turn their minds to the possibility of finding a suitable spring or very late winter variety of wheat.  That will solve the problem and avoid leaving the land under a crop which tends to produce weeds and scutch for eight or nine <Col N="323" /> months of the year.  That is what has really reduced the fertility of a lot of land put under wheat.  It is not that the crop takes so much more than any other cereal crop out of the land, but because the land is so exposed that it becomes foul over a long period.  I disagree with the Minister and his Department on that particular aspect of wheat growing.</P>
    <P>Other countries are experimenting in order to find a wheat suitable for late winter or early spring sowing.  Russia has been devoting some attention to that for the last five years, and I think our Department should do something of that sort, too.  There is then the question of live stock.  Can we improve our live stock?  First of all, there is the question of improving the fertility of the soil.  There ought to be some research work in that connection. There has to be considered the important question of keeping our live stock from wasting during the winter period, of keeping our live stock going all the time.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to the question of our dairy herds.  Our dairy herds are suffering seriously all over the country from abortion, sterility, and menstruitis.  We are losing some of our best cows.  The average yield in milk production here is much lower than in any other country in the world.  For instance, the yield of milk in Holland is 700 to 800 gallons.  Our average milk yield is only 400 to 500 gallons. These are matters that require close examination.  Then there is the marketing of our live stock.  No attention is being paid to marketing and none to grading.  There are too many people living too easily on the produce of the farm.  The live stock pass through too many hands before they reach the consumer on the other side.  These matters have all to be attended to.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of poultry, I put down to-day a question for the Minister about customs clearance charges.  He gave a reply but he did not reply to my supplementary question.  I now take this opportunity of discussing this matter.  We devoted a good deal of time to an important <Col N="324" /> Bill here to-day.  That was the Agricultural (Produce) Eggs Bill.  I think the time was well spent.  That is an important Bill.  There are other aspects of the case completely neglected.  In regard to the question of clearance of customs charges, I want to point out that the scale is, to my mind, one of the things seriously affecting our poultry industry.  Prior to the imposition of penal duties here, I am informed by some big traders, the type of poultry trade that we were doing with the people on the other side, or a major portion of that trade at all events, was composed of small weekly orders from retail traders in the big cities in Great Britain.  These orders were regular weekly orders.  The weights would be 2 cwt. to 3 cwt. of fresh poultry in good condition.  The result was that these fetched a good price, indeed a better price than the type the traders in England could buy in the open market there.</P>
    <P>When the penal tariffs came into operation the imposition of the customs clearance charges absolutely killed that type of trade.  The result is that the poultry merchant here must send large consignments.  I have here a list of the charges paid to the carrying companies last February.  The charge for a 2 cwt. consignment is 3/6.  When the company is asked why is there a customs clearance charge at all now since the economic war has been settled, or what is the necessity for such a charge when no duty is imposed on our agricultural produce, we are told, as we were to-day by the Minister, that the carrying companies have to put in certain documents as regards the country of origin.  They have to prove that the poultry is non-dutiable. For doing that the carrying companies charge 3/6 for a 2 cwt. consignment; for a 3 cwt. consignment the charge is 4/-; for 10 cwt. ? and for 15 cwt. 6/-, which is the maximum charge, irrespective of weight.  In other words, a trader shipping a five-ton lot of poultry pays a customs clearance charge of 6/- on the whole lot.</P>
    <P>The salesmen at the other side cannot anticipate what the landings will be.  The landings are irregular and <Col N="325" /> sometimes there is a glut of poultry goods on the market.  Very often because of the glut the poultry has to be sold at a sacrifice.  The result is that the price fluctuates considerably. The people who came to me about this matter pointed out that if they could get back their old trade it would have this effect, that first of all they would have a regular weekly trade and regular weekly orders, and the people at the other side would receive the consignments of poultry in good and fresh condition.  To get back their old trade is the difficulty.  To-day, a merchant ships to a salesman a five-ton lot of poultry and pays on the five tons a customs clearance charge of 6/-.  If he were to break that lot up into lots of 2 cwt., he would have 50 lots and on each of these he would have to pay 3/6.</P>
    <P>In other words, in the one case the customs clearance charges would reach £8 15s. whereas if he sends the bulk together it costs him entirely only 6/-. That charge of £8 15s. on 50 lots as against 6/- on one lot is operating against the poultry industry and it is operating against getting back to a sounder and a better trade which will give better and higher returns to the producer in this country than the type of trade we have at present.  I am well aware that representations were made to the Minister and his Department on this matter but very little has been done.  There has been no change in these charges.  That is a matter on which I suggest pressure should be brought to bear on the carrying companies because it is a vital importance to the poultry industry.  I do not suppose that there is any use in going into the various aspects of the case as it concerns our Party here.</P>
    <P>As far as the setting-up of this commission is concerned, I am glad that the Minister has consented to its setting-up. That consent will certainly be good news to-morrow for the farming community and it will have a good psychological effect.  People will feel that something is going to be done to help to find a solution for their difficulties. That commission will have a big job to do and to do it properly will take considerable time.  What we are asking for should be considered by the <Col N="326" /> Minister.  It is really not a relief nor a concession.  Neither is it a question as to whether the money to be spent is for the most useful purpose or not.  It is simply a matter of justice because our section of the community has borne these burdens for a great many years, indeed long before the present Government came into office.  But because of that it does not necessarily follow that those burdens are just, fair or equitable. They are most unjust burdens and most unfair charges, and our people ought to be relieved of them right away.  It would be a really sincere gesture by the Government and an indication that they mean to do something immediately, side by side with this commission.</P>

      <P>I am glad to note the change in the Minister's attitude and to hear him say that it was not on one side or the other that the sole desire to help the farmers existed.  I am quite prepared to give him credit for his good intentions.  I never questioned the Minister's intentions and indeed he has worked as hard as any Minister ever worked to implement those intentions.  It is, however, unfortunate, I suppose, that sometimes people work very hard and with the very best possible intentions, and still do not achieve their ends.  This has happened very often, as I am sure the Minister will admit, in respect of his own efforts and I am glad to hear now that he is prepared to inquire into the best methods to be adopted.  It is the only consistent course he could adopt. At one time, there was a motion before the House based upon the assumption that the Department was an expert body and was able to demonstrate what the Minister claimed was right, namely, that agriculture was a paying proposition.  The Minister turned down that motion and perhaps he was right, but he is quite right now in adopting the alternative course of trying to get further information as to better methods of carrying on the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that we can all cooperate to this end, because not only are the people engaged in agriculture suffering, but if present conditions continued much longer, they would be <Col N="327" /> bound to affect every section of the nation.  If we look at the symptoms of the difficulties of agriculture it is very clear that they are bound, sooner or later, to lead to national ruin, to the migration of the people from the land, a reduction in the value of our agricultural production, a decrease in the value of our exports, lower averages in the schools, a reduction in the number of marriages and activity by the sheriffs.  These are some of the symptoms, and there is no use referring to them all, because the Minister and everybody else knows them, but it is a hopeful sign of the time when all Parties have agreed that there is something wrong with the agricultural industry, and that it should be inquired into.  I have no doubt that is why Deputy Dillon put down the amendment.  The motion was a good motion, and nobody objected to any part of it, but it did not go far enough. The amendment proposed the setting up of a commission to inquire into the finding of still further remedies and methods of improvement for agriculture besides relieving agriculture of the unjust burdens which it has been carrying up to the present, and making provision for these down-and-outs who want loans.</P>
    <P>With regard to loans, there is no question that a great number of farmers cannot make any progress without being put on their feet first by a loan; but, at the same time, it is questionable whether it is wise to lend money to farmers in their present condition. It would be only throwing money away unless the farmers are put in a position in which there would be reasonable prospect of the loans being repaid.  I am glad to see that the Minister is prepared to do something. There will then be a benefit to be got from lending money to the farmers.  With regard to the work of the commission, I do not see why they should require to sit for years, although I have a great suspicion that when a commission is set up in this country, it will sit too long.  With so many witnesses to examine and so many aspects of agriculture to deal with, they cannot get through in a very <Col N="328" /> short time, but the Minister need not wait for the findings of the commission to carry out some of the proposals in the motion, and I strongly urge him, as a start, to grant the farmers complete derating of agricultural land.  It is not necessary for a commission to sit to tell him that that is due to the farmers as a matter of right.  It is less, and a great deal less, than what the farmers will have to get in the way of relief if they are to be able to carry on their industry.</P>
    <P>It will not take a commission to find out that agricultural prices for the last seven or eight years are 10 or 15 per cent. below pre-war, while the cost of production was at least double the pre-war cost.  That is something which any farmer Deputy on the other side will agree is correct, and the Minister himself knows that it is correct.  This question of costings is at the root of the whole trouble.  The farmers are not the only people whose costs have been increased.  Every producer in this country, no matter what line of production he is engaged in, finds that his costs have increased.  Take, for instance, the case of a mowing machine.  In 1913-14 a mowing machine would be bought for £10; to-day, it costs £22 10s., an increase of 125 per cent.  That is one of a number of articles which a farmer must provide himself with.  He must also provide suits of clothes for himself and his family.  A suit of clothes could be bought for 50/- pre-war, and to-day it costs £6, an increase of 140 per cent. A pair of shoes bought for 8/- pre-war now costs £1, an increase of 150 per cent.  Is it not obvious to everybody &mdash;it does not require a commission to find it out&mdash;that agricultural costs are at least double?  Rates have been trebled since pre-war times, and if you go down the whole line you will find that it is a conservative estimate to say that the costs of agriculture are round about double, or represent an increase of 100 per cent.  The remedy for the farmer, if it were in his power, would be to increase the price, just as the manufacturers of the mowing machine, the suits or the shoes, increased their prices to cover the cost of production, but the position <Col N="329" /> of the farmer is different, and he must take whatever he can get on the market.</P>
    <P>Let us compare the figures of pre-war prices with present prices.  They are about the same&mdash;the difference is not worth mentioning.  So that, in these circumstances, it is easy to see that, if we produce £50,000,000 worth of agricultural produce annually&mdash;I do not know whether we have any figures as to the cost of production; I do not think we could get them, but it is easy for us to assume a certain figure, and it does not really matter if we are a couple of millions out&mdash;but let us assume that in 1914 the cost of producing our agricultural output was about £25,000,000, what would be the position to-day?  It would cost about £50,000,000, and that would mean there would be no profit in production.  Now, that would be a loss to the farming community, as compared with the pre-war period, of £25,000,000.  I am not standing over that exact figure.  As I have said, there might be a difference of a couple of million pounds, but I hold that the case is sufficiently clear to show that the loss to the agricultural community is very serious.  As a matter of fact, in that case it would be about £25,000,000.</P>
    <P>Then there are set-offs.  What is the set-off?  The set-off is the relief from the passing of the two Land Purchase Acts of 1923 and 1933.  The benefit to the agricultural community from these Acts would be about £6,250,000.  As compared with pre-war prices, however, if we deduct this £6,250,000 from the £25,000,000 of a loss in the increased cost of production, we find that we have about £19,000,000 by which the farmers are worse off.  Now, I do not think that anybody on any side of the House will say that the farmers were too well off in pre-war times.  I am not now referring to the war times, because they were abnormal times, and perhaps the farmers were better off during that abnormal period of war time.  I am referring to the position of the farmers prior to the war and since the war.  I think the position should be quite obvious to anybody. No other section of the community in this country is in the same position as the farmers.  All other classes of <Col N="330" /> people in the community have increased the prices of their produce, and even the people dealing in these products have increased their own profits, by putting on an extra price.  Professional people have increased their fees, and the standard of living for every other class of the community has been improved, whereas the standard of living for the farmer has been lowered. That is the explanation for the young people fleeing the country, being afraid to get married, going into the cities and emigrating to other countries.  That is the reason for the countryside being overgrown with weeds and overflowing with water, and why the people are fleeing the country in order to try to get a living somewhere else.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not wait for the setting up of a commission or an inquiry in order to do something for the relief of the farmers.  What is needed is plain enough to anybody. Something must be done to relieve the farmers of this huge burden of rates. As the proposer of this motion, and as Deputy Hughes pointed out, it is only a matter of justice.  The farmers are not craving for favours at all.  They only want justice in the matter of taxation. What are rates, really, so far as they apply to agricultural land?  As applied to agricultural land, they are a particular form of income tax that is based upon an estimated income out of land.  That is all it means&mdash;no more and no less.  Now, that valuation on land may represent actual income or it may not.  In some cases it represents more, and in other cases it represents less than the real income; but in any case it has relation to supposed income, because, if you have a farm of land of a good quality, it is valued higher, and inferior land would be valued lower.  I do not think that anybody can contest my statement in that regard.  Therefore, I submit that no other class in the community is taxed in the same way as that in which the farmer is taxed.  Other people in this country are paying income tax upon their real income, as we know, but they have certain allowances, such as £125 or £250, and up to £500, and they get these allowances according to the family or the number of dependants <Col N="331" /> that they have.  It varies from £125 to £500, or more; but there is no allowance for the farmer.  He has got to pay on that estimated income, from the first pound, whether he is making the income or not.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Hughes said, it does not matter whether this money could be put to better use or not; the money belongs in justice and equity to the people who have been paying this unjust burden too long.  It must be remembered that things do not acquire sanctity from age.  This system of rates on agricultural land was commenced over 300 years ago.  It was started by the British Government.  At first it was something like a penny or a few pence in the pound, and up to the beginning of the present century it only amounted to something like a shilling in the pound.  That was not very serious, but it was growing gradually.  Besides, in those days the amount of wealth that the land represented was much greater than it is to-day in relation to other forms of wealth.  Now, although, under the Act of 1898, the agricultural community were relieved of half the rates by the agricultural grant and have received other grants since, yet rates are about five times higher to-day than they were then.  It is a very elastic system.  It yields in all cases to expansion but never to contraction.  I hold, therefore, that there is only one form of relief in this connection, and that is the complete derating of agricultural land. Let the Minister not deceive himself. No matter what commission or inquiry may be set up, the farmers will not be content to be treated as outcasts of the State and to carry burdens that do not apply to any other section of the community.  No matter what commission may be set up and no matter what its terms of reference may be, the Minister might as well make up his mind&mdash;or anybody else who may occupy such a position in the future&mdash; that the farmers must get justice or that something will turn up.  They will not always continue to be tame slaves; they have been tame slaves long enough.</P>
    <P>Now that a commission is to be appointed, the terms of reference <Col N="332" /> should provide that they should inquire into the equity of the farmers' claim in this matter.  There have been a lot of objections and arguments against it. These are prejudiced or dishonest, because the arguments could be applied just as well to any other form of taxation.  People say that the big farmer will get more of the benefit; of course he will.  The big income-tax payer gets more benefit when the income-tax is reduced.  When we can afford to have income-tax in this country ? less than across the Border or in Great Britain, the wealthy people get the benefit of that.  It would be a crime to give the unfortunate farmer justice if he happens to have an income of £100 or £200.  But we can afford to be generous to people who have ten times that income and it is not a crime. The man who owns 50 or 100 'buses gains more from a reduction in the price of petrol or in the motor tax and yet it is not a crime to relieve that man although he is a big man.  But it would be a crime to relieve the big farmer of an injustice.  Ninety or 95 per cent. of the ordinary farmers are carrying this unjust burden in order to penalise the other 5 or 10 per cent. That is the position.</P>
    <P>There are different people who do not touch politics at all and who take a very keen interest in this matter.  All these people who are opposed to it have one policy in opposing it and that is to divide and rob.  They try to make the small farmers oppose the big farmers. They divide them into two sections in order that they may be both robbed.  This has been going on, but the farmers are beginning to be wide awake and they will not continue to be robbed.  They will all stand together soon I hope.  I am the representative of a county of small farmers&mdash;County Cavan&mdash;and they are the best payers of rates in the country.  Although they are practically all small farmers, County Cavan was the first county to demand this on principle.  The farmers demanded it because it is their right, not because they would secure any extra benefit.  They wanted to get justice&mdash;nothing more nor less.  It is because it means justice to the farmers that we demand it.  But much more must be given to them, because, as I <Col N="333" /> pointed out, this would only mean something like £1,500,000, or less than £2,000,000, and the position of the farmers now as compared with the pre-War period is that they are something like £19,000,000 worse off.  This will only mean £1,500,000 off that sum, so that the farmers must get a great deal more if it can be at all provided to make their industry pay.  While other sections of the community are being put in a better position, the farmer is certainly entitled to some improvement on his present position because he cannot go on as he is going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the question of contagious abortion and sterility in cattle.  Something will have to be done about that.  When that disease gets into a district it ruins the dairy cattle in that district and the farmers have no calves, no milk, and no means of making a shilling.  I am sorry to say that the recommendations made by the Department in reference to this have not been effective.  They have not been attended with the success that we all would wish to see.  They are too difficult, in fact impossible, to carry out.  Unless some better remedies are found, I am afraid the Department must desist from the licensing of bulls for a time or suspend the licensing altogether, and give the farmers the right to keep as many bulls as they wish, which is one way of remedying the evil.</P>
    <P>These pedigree bulls, especially the Aberdeen Angus, are not so fruitful or able to get so many calves as the ordinary cross-bred shorthorn.  Besides, when the cows begin to miss the number of services which these bulls have to perform are multiplied five times in some cases, with the result that they become absolutely unfruitful in the end and the herds of a whole district are affected.  Some research work should be carried out by the Department to discover some simple and effective remedy for this disease.  Until that is done, the licensing of bulls should be discontinued in certain districts.  Where a county committee of agriculture certifies that a district is suffering from this disease, it would be a good thing if the Minister would either supply an extra number of bulls or suspend the <Col N="334" /> licensing of bulls altogether.  That might mean an amendment of the Act, but something will have to be done about it.  I ask the Minister to take a special note of this, because in districts in Cavan and Leitrim there will be very few calves next year and the farmers are being robbed.  There are a number of other things I should like to refer to, but I shall not detain the House any longer.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised that this motion was brought on, because, judging by the arguments of Opposition Deputies for the past four or five years, everything was going to be all right when they got back their markets.  They have their markets back now, and apparently they are worse than ever.  The usual Government cure for people when they get contrary is to set up a commission. I do not think a commission is going to cure this; at least a commission on the lines which have been proposed. The cure that Deputies opposite found for us when they set up a commission, the majority of whom were individuals who either knew nothing about agriculture or else were fattening on the agriculturists of this country, is not going to be the cure.</P>
      <P>I do not see how Deputy Hughes or Deputy McGovern, who spent days here complaining about the inefficiency of the Irish industrialists who are producing agricultural machinery and everything else, could agree to this amendment put down in Deputy Dillon's name and which apparently, they are sponsoring.</P>

      <P>How, in the name of Heaven, could Deputy Hughes or Deputy McGovern agree to an &ldquo;agriculturist&rdquo; out of the Federation of Irish Industries?  How, in the name of goodness, can these Deputies who are complaining about the banks and about the interest on loans agree to an &ldquo;agriculturist&rdquo; from the Banks' Standing Committee?  These are the fellows who are going to find out what is wrong with the farmers, not forgetting the fellow from the High Court who is going to be chairman of this commission.  One would think that Deputies, when they come to consider a matter of this kind seriously, or even when they come in here and pretend to be serious on a matter of this kind, would at least take the trouble of examining a motion before they sign their names to it.  They come in here and propose a gentleman from the Federation of Irish Industries and gentlemen from these other organisations I have mentioned, as members of a commission, with a High Court judge as chairman, to find out what is wrong with farming.  Apparently they have no faith in their own ability to find out for themselves what is wrong with the agricultural industry&mdash;not, indeed, from what I have seen here, that I would care to put three members of the Dáil appointed by the committee of selection on that commission.  That is the kind of cure that Deputies opposite propose for the farmers' ills.  That is the personnel in which they place their faith to find out what is wrong with the farming community and to provide a cure for their ills.  I would say: &ldquo;God help the farmer who is depending on them!&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, if the commission is set up, it should find out what is the maximum amount the agricultural community can afford to pay for central and social services.  When the commission has found that out let us come in here and send Article X of the Treaty after the rest of the Articles. It is surprising sometimes to see the attitude of Deputies who call themselves farmers on these questions.  I <Col N="336" /> came in here for a few minutes this evening, and I heard Deputies on both sides bewailing the position of civil servants.</P>

      <P>Columbcille went back 300 years but I do not want to go so far back as that.  I am making what I consider an honest suggestion here, what I consider a proper suggestion, that we should get down to bed-rock on this question.  I suggest that if 85 per cent. of production in this country comes from the agricultural community, then we should consider what is the maximum amount that can be borne by that community both for central and social services and let us cut down to that.  Let us cut our Civil <Col N="337" /> Service, our High Court and our legal profession down to that.  When we have done that, we will have some basis to work on with regard to the agricultural community.  You are not going to cure their ills by coming in here looking for a grant of £100,000, £200,000 or even £500,000 for the agricultural community and then, in the heel of the evening, clapping several thousand pounds on them to provide for extra inspectors and extra civil servants.  The sooner Deputies here get down to bedrock and cut down overhead charges, the better it will be for everybody concerned.  Overhead charges in regard to rates have gone up enormously in the last few years.  They have gone up justly, I would say, in part but unjustly in regard to other expenditure.  They have increased justly in regard to social services, such as housing, that were completely neglected here for ten or 12 years, social services that had to be undertaken by the present Government when it came into office. On the other hand, they have gone up unjustly in regard to the enormous amount spent on roads to make them fit for modern traffic.  That is a burden the agricultural community should not be asked to bear.  There is no use in talking about pinpricks or in talking about the floor of a house when the roof is falling in.  You have got to get at the roof first and I suggest that the roof in this case is the cost of government and the cost of the Civil Service in this country.</P>

      <P>That has been the position here.  There is no use in setting up a commission to inquire into the question of how to increase agricultural production.  We all know how to increase it.  Even Deputy Brasier, who is like St. Paul&mdash;all things to all men&mdash;told us how to increase agricultural production.  The Deputy has a different tune every day for the different fiddles he plays.  He told us that the non-agriculturists are eating dearer bread so that the farmer may get a price for his wheat; that they are consuming dearer sugar so that the farmer may get an economic price for his beet, but in a few moments, when he gets up to speak, he will be telling us about the unfortunate farmer who cannot pay his way.  At the same time he complains about the price that the farmer is getting for his produce.  The truth is that the farmer will produce if he is paid for what he produces. There is one good thing at any rate to our credit: the guaranteed markets that we have provided here for the farmer for certain things that he produces. We have given him a guaranteed price for his wheat and his beet. We have made these two markets at least available to him so that before he sets his crops he knows what he is going to get for them.  That is one good thing we have done for the farmer.  You cannot do that with the British market.  Over a considerable period we pointed that out to the Party opposite, and now they have come to realise the truth of it because they are getting less for their cattle now than in March when the tariff was on.  That is one lesson we brought home to them, that as far as the British market is concerned they have to be satisfied by selling their surplus produce in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have Deputies spending evenings here talking about the plight of the farmers, and bringing before the House <Col N="339" /> ridiculous motions and amendments such as we have on the Order Paper to-day to set up a commission composed of officials from the banks, from the I.A.O.S. and from the Federation of Irish Industries to find out what is wrong with the farmer.  I am surprised to see farmer Deputies, who should have better sense, supporting motions of the kind.  I do not think that a motion of the kind should ever have been put down.  I understand that the Minister for Agriculture has agreed to set up a commission to inquire into the question of increasing agricultural production.  There is no need, in my opinion, to set up a commission to do that.  Deputies opposite tried to diminish our agricultural production. They went out on a definite campaign against the growing of wheat.  That went on for a number of years.  I knew very well that the campaign would be useless, because so long as the farmer is paid for any crop he will grow it. So long as he has a guaranteed price for his wheat he will grow it.  If we were able to give a guaranteed price for a cwt. of beef, you would soon have the country full of beef.  You can increase agricultural production any day by giving the cost of production plus a profit to the farmer.  That is all he looks for, and you do not need a commission to be told that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan attacked the admixture scheme.  How many of the Deputies opposite are going to agree with him?  I challenge Deputy Hughes, or any other farmer Deputy opposite, to stand up and say he agrees with Deputy Brennan in his remarks on the admixture scheme.  Does Deputy Cogan or Deputy Brasier agree with him?  Of course not.  They know what the position of the farmers in this country was in 1932 in regard to barley and oats.  It would be a very serious matter for any Government to consider driving the farmers of this country back into that position again.  What was their position at that time?  They had to take their barley in to the maltster and ask him for heaven's sake to take it, and tell them in three months what he was going to give them for it.  That was their position in 1932 <Col N="340" /> and at the time that the admixture scheme was brought in.  I fear that we will go back to that position again.  If we agriculturists are to pay for artificial manures and agricultural machinery produced in this country, then I say we are entitled to a market here for what we can produce as well as an economic price for it.</P>
    <P>If a commission is to be set up, I suggest that its job should be to find out what is the maximum amount that the agricultural community can bear both for Central Government services and for social services.  When that is found out, let us come in here with the axe and cut off what we do not want.  Unfortunately, the Civil Service system we have here is an inherited one.  We started building our house on a par with an industrial country like Great Britain.  This country cannot afford it, and it is ridiculous to have 85 per cent. of the population of this country paying exorbitant salaries to the other 15 per cent.  That is what is happening. You have the professional classes organised. You have the doctors and officials of local bodies through the country looking for increases of salaries.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister for Agriculture must have been very pleased when he found Deputy Dillon coming to his rescue with the amendment that he tabled to Deputy Cogan's motion.  It enabled the Minister to avoid the issues raised in the motion. Instead of having a discussion on the issues raised in the motion, such, for instance, as the depression in agriculture and the granting of long term loans to farmers free of interest, Deputy Dillon with his amendment came to the rescue of the Minister with his proposal to set up a commission on lines somewhat similar to the Banking Commission that reported recently.  This commission, I suppose, like the others, will come along in three years' time or so with its report; but in the meantime it will have found no solution for giving immediate relief to the farmers of the country.  While we agree with the Minister and with the Opposition in having this commission, we believe it is only prolonging the agony by appealing for derating of all agricultural land.  Deputy McGovern and Deputy Hughes asked for derating. The former Deputy said that as a representative of the small farmers in County Cavan he could say they were unanimously in favour of derating, which I consider would give concessions only to large ranches who do not employ anyone.  What concession will the small farmers get from derating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be very sympathetic towards Deputy McGovern's Party if the question is raised in the meantime, by pointing out that, as a commission has been appointed, he cannot anticipate its findings.  Deputy Corry pointed to the position in the <Col N="342" /> rural areas.  It is not so much one affecting local services, but rather the bigger concessions that are necessary. Speaking for the constituency I represent, I say that the roads should be a national service, the hospitals should be a national service, and the State should take over the relief of the poor. In that way the burden of rates will be removed from the farmers, because they would not then be paying for trunk roads that some of them never use, as well as for hospital services, and for home assistance.  Such relief would give greater assistance to the agricultural community than derating. I believe that derating land would put the burden on the farmers' out-offices and buildings.</P>

      <P>It is not that these people are unwilling to pay, but are really unable to pay.  I can speak on this question as one who knows the facts.  I give every credit to the Land Commission for its endeavour to meet them in every way, and to accept payment by instalments.  The Land Commission is not out to crush them.  I do not agree with Deputies who suggest that the Land Commission are tyrants.  I went to the Land Commission on behalf of these people, and I can say that small farmers, who were unable to pay their annuities, received every consideration.  We say that appointing a commission, the findings of which will not be available for some time, will not give immediate relief. Long-term loans will have to be given to these farmers.  Deputy McGovern asked what was the use of giving farmers something that they might not be able to repay.  Are honest farmers who, through no fault of their own, have no capital to be refused loans to enable them to restock their land?</P>

I am concerned about what is happening in my constituency. We have honest men there, and, as a Labour Party, we are interested in the prosperity of the agricultural community, because their prosperity means prosperity for rural workers. I fought farmers many a time&mdash;and, please God, when prosperity returns, I will fight them again&mdash;in order to get a living wage for the workers.  If the farmers are prosperous the agricultural workers will be properous, and for that reason we demand that loans should be given free of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the giving of other concessions to people in the rural areas loans should be given.  The rates have been increased from 2/- to 3/- in the £ because agricultural grants have been withheld owing to the non-payment of land annuities.  As <Col N="344" /> a result the general public have to make up the amount of grants withheld. Without anticipating the findings of the commission, to the setting-up of which the two Parties have agreed, all the agricultural grants that were withheld should be made available to the public bodies affected. In that way the rates could be reduced and the farming community would get immediate relief.  Why should the general public, small farmers and labourers, have to make good by the payment of increased rates the amount of unpaid land annuities?  The Government are losing nothing, because they are holding on to grants that should be given to public bodies.  I appeal to the Minister to give immediate relief to the rural community, without waiting for the findings of this commission, by giving public bodies the grants that have been withheld for the past few years.  The services I mentioned should be State services, and the rural community should not be asked to maintain roads and hospitals, or to pay for home assistance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan has asked that the payment of outstanding land annuities should be spread over a number of years.  There is nothing wrong in that.  The House has already committed itself to that procedure.  A Land Act was passed some years ago funding the arrears.  Why not do so now?  If the House thinks that the appointment of a commission is going to bring happiness and prosperity to the farming community we do not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose we will vote against the motion, but we believe it is only giving the Government the excuse they are looking for.  They have no agricultural policy.  No debate concerning depression in agriculture will be possible for the next two or three years, as we will be told that we must wait for this pet commission to bring in its findings which will, probably, be something like the Banking Commission. Nothing will be done, and, in the meantime, we will have the flying squads and the turmoil we have at present. As Deputy Cogan put his cards on the table, the Fine Gael Party have side-tracked the issue, by giving the Government the opportunity not to do <Col N="345" /> any of the things for the agricultural community that the Deputy asked for. I say that certain farmers in the Fine Gael Party had to agree that loans are necessary for farmers who have been unable to pay their annuities for three or four years, and that repayment should be spread over a period if they were to get on their feet.  While we are waiting for the report of this commission we will have the flying squads out as the annuities will not be paid, and, as a result, the burden on people who are in a position to pay their rates will be increased by other burdens that will be imposed upon them.  They will have to bear the burden of the people who are unable to pay their rates at the present time and, therefore, you are going to make the burden heavier on a smaller section of the community.  For that reason I oppose the setting up of the commission because I believe it is only an excuse for the Government not to do what Deputy Cogan has asked them to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement that he is going to set up a commission meeting the terms of the amendment, the discussion boils down really to the question of whether, in the meantime, the collection of rates should not be discontinued, pending that report, and the question of the provision of credit, but the debate has since taken such a wide scope, going in more or less to the merits of the matter that this commission is supposed to decide and whether a case should be put up there instead of here, that one can scarcely let pass some of the comments without referring to them.  Deputy Everett has referred to the large rancher and Deputy Everett is not alone in that.  I have heard men here of a high standard of intelligence, some of them in official capacities discharging very onerous State functions, who talked also about the rancher and, in discussing this question of derating, they all agreed that they would give it heartily in the morning were it not for the presence in Ireland of the rancher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the rancher does exist in any county in Ireland, he exists because of the apathy and slowness of this Government and the previous Government, <Col N="346" /> in dealing with the rancher, in dealing with the man with the dog, because in the 1923 Act provision was made to deal with him, and if they have failed to reach a few of them it is because of the slowness in which the previous Government and this Government have utilised the machinery at their disposal.  We have been told here by members of the Government Party and members of the Executive Council that they never had to alter a line of the 1923 Act dealing with the rancher in finding land for congested and uneconomic holdings. That is true.  We all accept that. They did not need to.  The machinery was provided to deal with him.  But where is the rancher to-day?  The rancher was there ten or fifteen years ago.  He is gone, or nearly gone, and if there are a few specimens left that the operation of the 1923 Act has not reached, it is only a matter of time until he will be reached.  But to use it as an argument, either by members of this Dáil or people outside, is merely doing a thing that should not be done &mdash;using an argument that has no application and no relation to the facts. The man and the dog, if he exists to-day, exists by the slowness with which this Government and the previous Government acted in dealing with him, and why this State should be made bear an unjust burden because of a few individuals who may be still left is more than I can understand.</P>
    <P>I made a speech here in regard to derating before, and I do not want to repeat a word of what I said then.  I showed, as far as I knew how, where equity and justice were denied to a vast section of the people here.  There can be no question of that.  I also pointed out in that speech, or in another one, the amount of loss that was sustained by the people in this country who bore the brunt of the economic war.  I think we may pass over Deputy Corry's speech as raising no question that need be answered.</P>
    <P>I have also heard it said, and quite seriously, even by members of this House, that the reason rating should be continued was that it kept the local bodies in existence, and that only for <Col N="347" /> the local district councils and county councils we would have nobody qualified to come into this House: that it was a school for training public men to fit them to come into this House.  But, remember, derating in this country of agricultural land means about £1,500,000.  We could keep I do not know how many thousand men at Oxford or the universities here for the £500,000 we could spare of the £1,500,000, and it would be cheap at the price, and would fit them better than having them down at the county councils and district councils doing their local spouting.  I think the price of training our public men at £1,500,000 is too dear, even if it does fit them to come into this House.</P>
    <P>The real kernel of the question is whether the Government will accede to the terms of the amendment, that is, to discontinue the collection of rates and make available to agriculturists a loan at a rate of interest not exceeding 3 per cent.  Deputy Everett talks about a loan without interest. A loan without interest, to my mind, is a grant.  If the State is able to find a loan without interest it will please me all the better but, if it cannot find a loan at less than 3 per cent. interest, then I am very much concerned that the benefit of that should reach the people in the country who fought the economic war and who need it in the country.  It has been suggested that they should go to, perhaps, the Credit Corporation or the banks, but none of those institutions has been able to lend money at 3 per cent.  Even if they got money at 3 per cent., it would be 4½ or 5 per cent. before it would reach the unfortunate people in the country.  I suggest another method: the Land Commission is collecting the annuities and I do not think I need ask the question whether it was easier to collect the full annuity before the economic war or to collect half the annuity since.  I think nobody need ask the question. Everybody knows the answer.  Nobody, banker or otherwise, in this State is in a better position to know the credit-worthy than the Land Commission. After 20 or 30 years' experience <Col N="348" /> in the Land Commission, nobody is a better judge of the people who should get a loan, or who should get an advance. Your funded arrears of annuities have increased the halved annuity by the amount funded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>If this loan at 3 per cent. is available and handed to the Land Commission to distribute they can do it without any additional expense and give it at 3 per cent. to the people and, to a good many people, may justify the existence of the Land Commission in its present strength.  The Land Commission is costing the people of this country a considerable amount of money.  There are huge staffs and the method I am suggesting might justify their existence in the minds of a good many people.  It would only mean that you would have to multiply the figures, collecting 40 where you are at present collecting 20, but it would do the thing I am concerned with and that I want, that is, it would mean that the people could get the money at the cheapest possible rate.</P>
      <P>I am not interested in directors or corporations, credit corporations, banks or anyone else.  What I am interested in is the people it is proposed to serve and not directors or prospective directors.  I suggest, Sir, to you and to the country, and even to this commission when it comes along, that this angle of the question is at least well worthy of consideration. The main object of this Dáil is that the people should get the assistance of money at the lowest possible point.  So much for credit.</P>
      <P>With regard to derating, nobody knows the country better than I do&mdash; at least, my own county.  There is scarcely a home in Kilkenny that I have not been in and nobody knows better than I do the condition of the people there.  I have been in nine or ten campaigns during the last 16 years in Kilkenny and there is not a home in the county that I have not visited.  Nobody knows it better than I do.  My county is not an exception. I say that derating was never more needed than it is to-day.  Some immediate relief is most essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> Many a man to-day has no bank credit, no creamery or shop credit, or any other credit.  Very few of them have bank credit, and as regards the few who have, their lives are not worth living with the worry they are getting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry talks about the admixture scheme and the harm it would do. Feeders tell me it did harm, when it was 50 per cent. and 35 per cent., but with the 7 per cent. at the present time I do not see that it can do any great harm.  But experts have told me that it did harm and I am quite prepared to admit, to a certain extent, although I do not know what the percentage was, that the pig and fowl population have been reduced.  This much I am prepared to assert, that the major reason why the pig and fowl population have decreased was because a considerable number of the producers had neither the means nor the credit to buy feeding stuffs in order to feed the pigs and the fowl.  A scheme was embarked upon by the Pigs Marketing Board of sending out I do not know how many thousand sows.  Where are they now, and they are only out a couple of months?  How many are now available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>They either ate them or sold them.  I suppose 70 per cent. of them are gone.  It is easy to get a sow, a young pig; one would cost about 30/- or £2, whatever the amount may be.  To get one is within the reach of most people, but what is outside the reach of most is the credit to feed the litter and to fatten them.  That is what people had not and that is one of the things which proves the great urgency of a derating scheme.  The Government cannot afford to ignore it.  Nobody has better proof of the need for it than they have.  They have ample proof through the Land Commission, through the sheriffs, through the Pigs Marketing Board, and in 20 different directions. They have proof through the banks of Ireland and they have confidential information that there can be no doubt about.  Nobody knows the position better than they do and they cannot afford to ignore the urgency of <Col N="350" /> this call.  As regards the equity and the justice part, I dealt with that before and I am not now going to go into it.  This is not the tribunal that is going to decide it.</P>
      <P>The marriage rate here has been instanced as an indication of the position in the country.  The figures of the marriage rate for the Twenty-Six counties are not illuminating.  You are given the total, but I would like to go very much further and I should like to see the distinction between the urban and the rural areas.  I make the assertion that it is infinitely more marked in the rural than in the urban areas.  I hear of no marriages in the rural areas in my county.  There are many cases of three or four members of a family growing old together, no sign of a marriage, no sign of a young family.  The school attendance figures in the rural areas will give you further evidence of the condition of things.</P>
      <P>Anyone who wants to be honest, and who is not subsidised like Deputy Corry, cannot afford to grin and laugh at the position in the country.  Deputy Corry has been subsidised in relation to everything he has produced in the last four or five years.  Take wheat and beet as an example.  Nobody knows how to fight his corner better than Deputy Corry, and I admire him when he is fighting it.  But the people who produce wheat and beet form only a small section of the community. There are bigger sections outside who are subsidising Deputy Corry, extending charity to him to enable him to carry out his agricultural operations as he is carrying them out.  There is no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seven Deputies from County Kerry and they can tell you that there is very little wheat or beet grown there.  Still the people in that county are subsidising big men like Deputy Corry, living on the best land in Ireland.  What wheat or beet is grown in Leitrim or in Wicklow or in most other counties in Ireland?  What are the conditions in the poorest counties?  Notwithstanding all that we have opposition from Deputy Corry on this question of derating. He talks about the capacity of people to pay.  Why should we pay?  Why <Col N="351" /> should anybody in the State pay more than any other citizen in the State? Why should not all citizens have a common burden?</P>

      <P>Come down to mine. Now on this question of derating we cannot lose sight here of the English farmer's position and the position of the North of Ireland farmer.  These farmers have got a market at their doors.  They have got derating on their land and on their agricultural buildings.  They have only to pay tax on their habitations.  When it comes to the question of income tax, he pays income tax on the basis according to whether he is married or whether he has children or not.  If it is justice to give derating to the Englishman and the North of Ireland man who have a market at their doors, how much more so is it justice to give derating here?  I did promise that I would not go any <Col N="353" /> farther into this question and so I will leave it, but the point was raised by interruptions and that is why I referred to it.  On the question of the personnel of the commission I confess I have some sympathy with the ideas put forward by Deputies Corry and Everett. My opinion is that anybody who is to act as a judge and jury on agricultural matters should have an intimate knowledge of agricultural matters and should have put in at least 12 months' work on an agricultural farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 12 years is better. Let them be in a position to compare generally the position of the agricultural community and their uncertainty with that of other classes.  It is all very well for a man to go into a shop or business and have a certain turnover and a certain profit.  He has the shelter of a house, and it is a fine day always with him.  It is very different with the farmer outside on his land, who has to meet all the extremes of weather.  Very often the entire work that a man has done for three or four years is knocked on the head in one season.  He has to put up with it.  He has to be silent and he has to build it up again.  That does not happen in the case of the business man.  Therefore I say that the business man who has purely a business training alone is not fitted to be a judge on what the agriculturist has to face.  That is why I say I have a good deal of sympathy with what Deputy Corry said about the personnel of this commission.  We have been taunted that we stepped in to save the Government on the question of derating some years ago.  We had an assurance from the Minister that there would be an interim report. We were told that derating should form the basis of the interim report, and that other matters could wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got the Executive Council into its present frame of mind, I think we must be satisfied that the Minister has met us in a reasonable and fair way.  The Minister has said: &ldquo;If I had money I could find a better way of spending it.&rdquo;  It is easy to spend other people's money.  It is easy to <Col N="354" /> take money off people by force and to spend it.  The question of justice did not enter into his mind at all; neither did the question of whether he was taking the money off some people unjustly, and spending it on others.  It seems to me that the Minister was unjust, as his predecessors have been unjust for 90 years.  Deputy McGovern said 300 years.  I do not know as to that, but I know definitely that for 90 years the agricultural community have been treated unjustly.  It began with 3d. in the £1.  Then the unfortunate people had no option in this country because the garrison, the English monopolists, had everything as grand jurors.  They ruled the country.  You to-day are the heritors of that English position, those slave conditions.  That is in force to-day because we are continuing it in force.</P>
    <P>To my mind a very objectionable position has arisen with regard to the agricultural grant.  We know how that grant has been manipulated during the last three or four years.  There is no question about it that the present Government Party bought public support from the section of the community with the biggest vote.  The man with a valuation of £10 and under got away without paying any rates. The man with a valuation of £20 was allowed 6/- in the £.  At all events that is the allowance in my county.  In County Cork it is 6/2.  The Government got his vote and they paid for it with the man's own money.  He paid 4/9 and he gave you his vote, because of the juggling you are able to do with regard to the agricultural grant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> There is another question and it is a very big one.  Last year and this year an Agricultural Wages Board is set up.  The farmer in the country has to pay a minimum wage to his workers. That is now to be the agricultural wage.  Is it not the farmers with 50, 60, 100 acres or more who are paying the wages to the agricultural labourers?  My sons and I have ten men working with us.  If you are going to have an agricultural wage enforced by law you must take cognisance of the fact that it is the large farmer in the country who has got to pay this wage.  The Government has been making it a question of the large farmer against the small farmer.  I do not know how many labourers' cottages have been built in the country, but the Minister can give us the figures.  These cottages have been built to meet the needs of agricultural workers.  These workers and their families must be added to those who have to be supported out of the land.  Now, on this question of the big farmers against the small farmers, to my mind it is only a question of whether the Government is going to do away with the agricultural workers and turn them all into small farmers.  But where you have agricultural workers, employment on the land must be found for them and that employment will be found by the large farmer.  That is a point that must be taken into consideration.  It is a well-known fact that the large farms, worked as they are, are carrying more people than these same farms carry when they are broken up and divided.  More is got out of the land worked by large farmers than out of the land in the hands of small farmers. There are, as anyone will find, numbers of agricultural workers in the country who do not want land and who will not accept it.  These men must go for employment to the large farmers.  An opportunity must be given to the large farmers to give these men employment.  I want to impress on the House that in 99 cases out of 100 the agricultural labourer working on a large farm is better off than is the man who gets this land when it is broken up and divided.  I say again <Col N="356" /> that more people are supported out of a farm of 150 acres than can be supported out of the same land when it is broken up and divided.  Remember this&mdash;the agricultural labourers of the country who live in labourers' cottages have to look for employment entirely to the large farmers.</P>
    <P>Anybody passing along the railways or the roads can see the condition of the land.  He can travel down to Cork or to Kilkenny and it is there for him to see.  There is infinitely better use made of it when in the hands of the bigger men who employ labour, and all these factors must be taken into consideration by a commission or by a Government which has charge of the country.</P>

I rise to take part in this debate surprised that the Government have agreed to accept the amendment.  I understand that they have agreed to accept it and to refer to a commission to be set up the matters referred to both in the motion and in the amendment.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, the Government are not accepting the amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are presumably referring to a commission for consideration <Col N="357" /> and report in a year, two years, three years, four years or five years, matters which are of urgent importance to the farming community and which, if the Government has an agricultural policy, could be immediately dealt with and decided without any reference to a long-term commission of this type.  The leaders of every Party in this House, and the members of every Party, are agreed that some kind of relief must be provided in the immediate future for the farming community, if for no other purpose than to give them the assistance they are entitled to, after the financial sufferings they have borne during the last five or six years.  Although not a farmer, I have the responsibility of being an executor for relatives and I am responsible for the running of farms in my own part of the country.  In that way, I know a good deal more than some of my abusers are prepared to give me credit for knowing about the condition of the farmers.  I am in close and constant personal touch with my own family relatives since I left the county 30 years ago.  I am the eldest son of a family of ten who could not all find a home on a farm of £45 valuation. Some of them had to go away and I, being the eldest, went away, but I have not lost contact with my relatives, and I hope so long as I live&mdash; and whether a member of this House or not&mdash;to maintain contact with those relatives who are all engaged in the farming business.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees that some kind of relief is immediately required for the farmers, and the question for the House of decide, under the terms of the motion, is: what is to be the form of relief, apart from the matters which do not require immediate attention and which perhaps ought to be, and could be, reasonably referred to a commission. Deputy Cogan in his motion asks the Government to provide special long-term loans for farmers on easy terms.  He does not indicate as clearly as Deputy Dillon does the rate of interest which he is prepared to agree to for these loans.  The last speaker referred to the question of loans free of interest, and apparently thinks that that is a proposal without precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> The provision of loans free of interest is tantamount to giving a subsidy to the farmers, and I should prefer to see the taxpayers as a whole providing free loans to farmers rather than paying bounties which do not get back to the agricultural producers.  Millions of pounds have been thrown away during the past few years by way of bounties which found their way into the pockets of the middlemen and not into the pockets of the producers for whom they were intended.  Before the dissolution this House agreed to the raising of £10,000,000 to pay off a debt to John Bull which was said not to be due.  What is the repayment of that loan costing the taxpayers?  I understand that the repayment of that £10,000,000 is costing them roughly £450,000 a year.  I am not a financial expert, and I have had no access to private information, but I should like to know from Deputy Corry, or from the Minister for Education, if I am overstating the case when I say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be asked probably before the Christmas adjournment to put up an additional amount for the defence of the country against an unknown enemy, and I dare say the Deputies on the Government Benches will march, with their clear majority, into the Lobby in favour of any such proposal and thereby impose increased taxation upon the community. They were willing to raise £10,000,000 to pay off this illegal debt, this debt which was neither legally nor morally due, and to place that burden on the community.  If we are prepared to find another £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 for the purpose of defending the country against this unknown and hidden enemy, surely we ought to be able to agree to find a specified sum, either free of interest or at a very low rate of interest, for the immediate provision <Col N="359" /> of loans to farmers to enable them to stock their lands, to purchase machinery and seeds and to work the land to the best possible advantage. The farmer, whether he is large or small, whose farm is only half stocked, who has not got the necessary machinery to work his farm, is in the same position as a shopkeeper with a lot of assistants who has no stock to sell.  If a farmer has his land fully stocked and the necessary capital or credit to buy machinery and seeds, he can pay his rates and annuities far better than he can pay them if his land is only half stocked and he has no capital or credit to work it to full advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am aware, the majority of farmers to-day, as a result of the last five or six years, are in the position that they have neither credit nor capital to work their land to full advantage. That is not an issue to be referred to a commission, one of the members of which is to be a representative of the Royal Dublin Society, nor is it an issue to be referred to a commission, one of the members of which is to be a member of the Banks' Standing Committee, when we know that it has been the policy of the Banks' Standing Committee for a long period of years to refuse to give any loans to farmers on the security of their land, or to give loans on any consideration, except on the security of a person who has a deposit in the bank and whose deposit is marked off against whatever loan may be given.  These are the types of people it is suggested should be put on the commission which the Minister for Agriculture proposes to set up.  The people responsible for this amendment will give representation to the Banks' Standing Committee, the Royal Dublin Society and the Federation of Irish Industries, but they will give no representation whatever to the organised Trade Union movement of this country, numbering from 225,000 to 250,000.  That shows the mentality of the mover of the amendment and of the Minister who, apparently, is prepared to accept the amendment in principle. I am prepared to say that an amendment has been drafted and lodged in the Clerk's office as a result of the <Col N="360" /> fairly long consideration our Party has given to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, you could, but the members of that Party have not been so often in the House as to enable them to give that careful consideration to the matter that one would expect. However, if this discussion does not collapse before 10.30 to night it will not be a secret, and I am adding my voice to the discussion in order to see that it does not collapse, within the time at my disposal.  I seriously suggest, however, that if a commission is to be set up to consider matters that can be put on the long finger for a long period that commission will not be on the lines suggested in this motion which stands in the name of Deputy Dillon.  It has been suggested and strongly urged&mdash;and that policy has been adopted for a considerable period by the people now in opposition&mdash;that, pending the report of the commission, the Minister should agree to the complete derating of agricultural land as from the 1st April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Party is opposed, in principle, to the complete derating of agricultural land.  Our policy in regard to derating is that the cost of the main and trunk roads of this country, which is an increasing charge on the ratepayers as the years go by, should be made a central charge; that this burden should be taken from the people and that the construction of the main roads of this country should be under a central authority such as the Department of Local Government and Public Health, thus cutting out the waste of the money that is being allocated to-day for that purpose.  We also say&mdash;and we have said so before on many occasions&mdash;that <Col N="361" /> the cost of the mental hospitals should be made a national charge and taken from the agricultural community, in that way cutting down the rates of the whole community as well as of the agricultural community.  Then there is a number of people who are in receipt of home assistance.  This Government had a plan for the cutting down of unemployment and destitution.  If that plan had been put into operation and work provided as promised by this Government under the plan they had prepared previous to 1932, there would be no charge on the ratepaying community for home assistance except for those who might be physically unfit. Our policy is to reduce rates gradually by carrying out a policy of that kind.</P>
    <P>If the agricultural community are going to get complete derating of their agricultural land, I can see&mdash;and I say it now from these benches&mdash;a far better case being made for the unemployed worker who lives in a house owned by a local authority than for the farmer who has a farm and who is able to feed his family.  That policy would get the support of people who live in houses owned by a local authority, and I say that the unemployed worker, trying to keep his family on 9s. or 10s. a week, would have a far better case to put forward than the farmer who was making a claim for the complete derating of his agricultural land.  At any rate, if more money has to be raised by the whole of the community for the purpose of carrying out this policy of either partial or total derating, it has to be raised by way of increased taxation, presumably on the necessaries of life.  That is a policy which this Party, whether it be small or large in the future, is not prepared to support, and I hope that the Opposition will remember that there are other people than the farmers entitled to relief and that the farmers are not the only people entitled to concessions by way of derating or assistance from the taxpaying community.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the commission which it is proposed to set up would deal with questions affecting the acquisition and distribution of land, but if we are to have a member of the Banks' Standing Committee on any commission which is set up to deal <Col N="362" /> with the distribution of land, we all know what attitude that gentleman would be likely to adopt and what policy he is likely to support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably, the terms of reference of this commission will include the question of whether or not there should be a speeding up or a slowing down of the acquisition and distribution of land in this country. In that connection, I may say that I voted with pleasure for the passing of the many Bills through this House that were introduced for the purpose of encouraging the speedy acquisition and distribution of land, and I am prepared to encourage and support any Government, whether of to-day or tomorrow, to go ahead as quickly as possible with that policy until all the ranches of this country are divided up and a greater number of homes provided for the landless men and uneconomic holders of this country.  In that connection, I want to say that a considerable number of very deserving landless men, such as herds and agricultural labourers, who were formerely employed by landlords, have been given land by the last Government as well as the present Government, and I am sorry to say about these people&mdash;I can speak with actual knowledge of cases in my own constituency&mdash;that they have been unable to work the land which was given to them because of lack of capital to enable them to work the land.  I want to urge on this Government, as I have previously urged both this Government and the previous Government in this House, that in dividing land and giving it to good, landless men in the future they should provide these people with the necessary capital or with loans at nominal rates of interest. They will have to do that if they expect these people to work the land in the future.  I am sorry to say that good men have got land and have had to let the land out to graziers simply because they could not get money from the banks or the Agricultural Credit Corporation or, indeed, from any other source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> What I want to see is that these people should be given land under proper conditions, and that some assistance should be given to them to enable them to work the land.  For instance, we already have the case of the people who were brought into County Meath and who were given land, supplied with implements and so on, and also given a weekly income.  Why should these people get preferential treatment over any other section of landless men in any other part of the country?  If the policy of the Government in assisting landless men is in accordance with the procedure adopted towards the people in County Meath, then the other landless men in other parts of the country should get some assistance by way of grants or by way of loans at nominal rates of interest in order to enable them to work their land.  I hope that the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues will go ahead as speedily as possible with the acquisition or division of land, and that policy should be pursued no matter what commission might be set up to deal with that or any of the rural problems of the day. That is a matter upon which the Government ought to have a definite policy, and they ought to pursue that policy without any reference to the opinions of the members of any commission such as the Minister has proposed to set up in this case.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the commission are: &ldquo;To recommend proposals for increasing the volume and value of agricultural production in all its branches.&rdquo;  That indicates to me a sort of desire on the part of the people responsible for that proposal to get on the commission economic experts from our universities.  Now I would say, although I am not a farmer, that I would have as good a knowledge of the requirements of the practical farmer as a theoretical individual who might be selected from the universities under cover of wording of that kind.  This is, apparently, the type of people who are being asked to frame a progressive agricultural policy by the members of the Opposition.  I take that to be the meaning of that section of the amendment <Col N="364" /> standing in the name of Deputy Dillon.</P>

I would point out to the Minister, who was absent when I was referring to the matter, that it is a striking thing that although the Opposition are asking him to put on the commission a member of the Royal Dublin Society, a member of the Banks' Standing Committee, a member of the Federation of Irish Industries, and presumably a number of Professors from the University Colleges, they are of the opinion that the organised workers of this country, who number from 225,000 to 250,000, should not have any representation on the commission.  There is to be representation for all classes on this commission, except the representatives of the organised workers, who, presumably, could not possibly find a man with as much commonsense on this kind of question as anybody else who might be proposed as representing any other body.  This motion also demands that a moratorium be granted on the payment of land annuities.  I am sorry I did not hear the Minister when he was concluding; I did not hear whether or not he promised to do anything in regard to that.  This is a means by which immediate relief might be given to a section of the community.  It is a matter, at any rate, which I think should not be left to the Commission of Inquiry if the commission is not going to be limited in the period of its work.  Of course, there are many farmers in the country who would not get any benefit under the terms of that section of Deputy Hogan's motion, <Col N="365" /> and I am sure he realises that.  I am sure that applies to the farmers of County Wicklow as well as elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I should be interested, however, to hear what the Minister has to say to that, or whether that is one of the questions which the Government will take on itself to decide, and not refer for consideration to this proposed commission.  The motion also says: &ldquo;...and that the payment of arrears outstanding be spread over a number of years, in order to promote the recovery and expansion of the agricultural industry.&rdquo;  That is a matter which the Government might take on themselves to decide also.  The Government went to the country a few months ago and asked for a clear majority, for a majority to clear out people like the members of the Labour Party from preventing them, as they alleged at the time, from carrying out their clear-cut and well-defined policy, and from putting into operation their plan for finding work for every able-bodied citizen of this State.  Nobody was more delighted than I was that they got their clear majority, and the Minister for Agriculture knows it.  I will tell you why.  During the past five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We were in the way when they did not want to do things, and we had to be cleared out of the way.  Now we are out of the way.  They have their clear-cut majority; they have their responsibility, and it is a heavy one.  As an individual Deputy of this House I am prepared to co-operate with this or <Col N="366" /> any other Government which will face up to its responsibilities.  In my opinion this country is never going to be prosperous until we put on a prosperous footing the people who have to make their living out of the land.  I am strongly of opinion that that cannot be done until the farming community are provided with the necessary capital and credit to enable them to work their land to the best possible advantage.  That is not going to be done by leaving the matter to a long-winded commission which is going to sit for two or three or four years.  The Government, with its clear majority, has a mandate from the people to do those things without reference to a commission.  When we ask why a drainage scheme is not being carried out we are told that this question of drainage has been referred to a commission, too numerous to mention, and while that commission is sitting and talking, the land drainage problem of this country will have to wait.  When that drainage commission reports, the Government&mdash;as in the case of the Banking Commission&mdash;will look for a considerable amount of time to consider that report.  Now, we were told that that Government had a clear-cut policy in regard to agriculture, and for every problem that had to be solved in this country.  But they are going to evade taking the responsibility on their own shoulders.  They are going to evade coming before this House, with their own clear-cut majority, and putting their policy before the members of the House and carrying it with their own clear-cut majority.  They are putting it on the long finger.  They are leaving over for further consideration the providing of loans free of interest or at a nominal rate of interest.  I challenge them, now that they are here with their clear-cut policy, to get up in this House before this commission is set up, and define the terms of reference of that proposed commission.</P>

I hope also, if and when the commission is set up, that the subject-matters to be referred to it will be ones which can wait over for a period; will be matters which are not calling for urgent decision.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate at all, but in view of the Minister's statement this evening, and the last contribution which we have heard just now, I think it well to put before the House some considerations which occurred to us in connection with this motion.  If we were to take the last contribution, to which we have just listened, as a sample of what might be expected in a Parliament of the people, we would be very disappointed indeed.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy was considering exclusively political propaganda or political support, but he certainly was very far away from the real purpose of the amendment.  He did not mention it even once.  The real purpose of the amendment is to find means to increase the value and the volume of agricultural production in this country.  If it were possible to do that, most of the things of which he complains would be solved for us very easily indeed, and it might be possible for those engaged in agriculture to bear a very much heavier burden of rates or taxation than they are bearing at present and bear it much more easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those proposal have been present to our minds for many years and it is more than disappointing, it is disheartening, to hear the sort of speech to which we have just listened.  The motion was handed in on the 14th of July and the amendment was handed in on the 19th of July, and we were promised to-night, if the discussion on the motion lasts long enough, an amendment from the Labour Party. This motion was not put down for a political purpose; it was put down for an economic purpose.  The personnel of the suggested commission was selected because of their experience and the contribution they could bring to bear on a solution of the problem which is going to engage the attention of whatever political Party is in power <Col N="369" /> in this country for the future.  There is no institution in this State that has such a long association with agriculture as the Royal Dublin Society.  There is no institution more closely in touch with agricultural loans than the banks, because they have lent some £12,000,000 to persons engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are there whether we all know them or not.  They were discovered for us recently by a commission set up by the Government itself, and if we are going to see in what respect credit is to be available the information at the disposal of the banks ought to be of incalculable benefit.  The motion deals with agriculture and its problems.  The amendment deals with increasing the volume and value of our agricultural production. This evening Deputy Mulcahy read out from a report what has happened during the last twelve months in connection with the sale of eggs from continental countries in the British market.  Their sales have increased by 25 per cent., while our export of eggs to that market was down by 24 per cent.  That is a matter that ought to concern everybody.  What is operating against the expansion of agricultural production and value in this country must concern everybody engaged in industry, commerce and banking, and those selected from the other activities and walks of life are expected to bring towards a solution of the problem something that will be of value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to know in what way the soil of the country can produce more, how the climate affects production, why with the soil we have got we should not be the best cattle producing country in the world.  At present Scotch producers can get practically ten times the price we get for pedigree stock.  Similarly with regard to horses.  There is no country in the world that has the advantage we have, with our soil and climate, to produce the best racehorses, the best steeple-chasers, the best hunters, and the best working horses.  No single class can <Col N="370" /> be excluded from the potentialities of this country if we can only secure the means and adopt the plans that will produce the results.  Similarly with regard to sheep, pigs and poultry, Pigs and poultry lend themselves to more rapid expansion than any of the others.  We should have a veterinary research department here far beyond that in any other country and professional men capable of giving advice with regard to eliminating those infirmities or diseases which are rare in this country but which it should be the object of our agricultural policy to eradicate at all cost.</P>
    <P>For one reason or another we have three or four different classes in agricultural production at present.  We have the well-to-do; we have those whom we might call border-line cases; and we have those who are financially embarrassed.  The purpose of the amendment is not to gain the support, political or otherwise, of those who are financially embarrassed; but, in considering the country as a whole, to ensure that they will not be a drag upon themselves and upon the rest of the community.  If by means of money or credit some way can be found of putting them into an economic position that should be the object of the commission and we hope as a result of a commission with a personnel of the character outlined that every effort will be made to find a way by which that can be done.  If for a time it should happen that money has to be expended or that it might entail a loss, its use by these people would be of such advantage to the State that after some years a profit would accrue to our national economy which would more than recompense for the loss that would be sustained by the State's meeting a proportion of or all the interest charges in respect of that money.</P>
    <P>We are not wedded, as I said on another occasion, to derating, but if the position of the farming community is such that the payment of rates is interfering with the production of the farms and lessens that production, and in consequence is a drag on the national economy of the State, then it might be a very cheap way of <Col N="371" /> spending £1,500,000 to enable them to put that money into profitable production and thus increase the traffic on our railways, increase employment on the land and provide an attraction towards rural life which has almost vanished during the last ten or 15 years.  If the proposal we have heard from the last speaker is supported by his Party, that the rates should be reduced by the cost of the roads and the mental hospitals, it would be well that we should have some clarification of thought or expression in connection with that proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the intention to take the cost of the main and trunk roads and the mental hospitals, it represents more than £1,500,000 if there is no allowance made in respect of the sums provided from the agricultural grant.  But if we are going to take them all, it could be done for less than £1,500,000.  That is not the issue here.  The issue here is: in what way can we manage to do what other countries have succeeded in doing.  The aim of this commission should be to see that agricultural production is increased in this country by 100 per cent. within the next 20 years; that the quality of the output should be far above that of any other country; and that we should command the highest price for every article of agricultural production.  If it should happen after examination that certain productions we are engaged in are found not to be profitable, we should hear about it. Let us make up our minds whether or not it is advisable to engage in them even at that cost.  The question of the personnel of this commission is of some importance, because I am looking at it, not so much from the viewpoint of the support that it is going to get from particular classes engaged in agriculture, as from the viewpoint of the report that we are going to get from the commission.  Unless the intention behind the commission is to increase, almost limitlessly increase, our whole agricultural production, the commission is going to be of no use.  If they turn their minds towards that, the <Col N="372" /> mere halting contribution that is at present capable of being made by certain of those engaged in agriculture is a special subject to be examined specially by itself.</P>
      <P>It is said that the proposal we have made in connection with derating is one that is made in the interests of the larger holders.  It may be, but it so happens that these larger holders employ 90 per cent. of the people engaged in agriculture.  That is the Minister's own statement, and if anybody is in doubt about it, he will find it in the report of the Derating Commission. If the numbers engaged in agriculture are to be maintained, obviously those who are giving employment must be in a position to continue that employment.</P>
      <P>If they require to be helped in that connection, it is much better to do it perhaps by way of derating than by some of the other methods adopted during the last few years to assist agriculture.  It would, I believe, be the wish of all Parties in this House to see twice the number of people engaged in agriculture in this country than there are at the present moment. If it is felt that a nominee from the trade union movement could contribute anything towards improving agricultural production, towards making the industry more profitable or improving the quality of the production, then by all means let us have such a nominee on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection whatever to him.  I am anxious to get people who will bend their energies towards the one purpose we have in mind, namely, increasing the volume and the value of agricultural production in this country, believing, as we do, that quite a number of other problems which are engaging the attention of the Minister, and which are perhaps wasting his time and the time of other Departments, can be solved in this way.  If the Minister can select a commission which will be competent to achieve these objects, then I do not care what nominees are put on it or what interests are represented, but <Col N="373" /> it is no use saying that the problem can be solved by five men from the industry itself.  Five men from the industry might be far more suitably employed in dealing with their own particular problems than in finding solutions for the troubles that are agitating all phases of agriculture at present.  That is why we have suggested people from such different bodies as the I.A.O.S. and the Banks' Standing Committee.  If the Minister is prepared to meet us on that question I do not think there will be a lot of difference between us.  I should like to remind Deputy Davin that he supported that Government when they were giving £80,000 a year less for the relief of agricultural rates than their predecessors did.  However, we can forget these things now, if we are all agreed on the principle that the value and the volume of the agricultural production in this country should be increased and its quality raised to a standard second to none in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the note of approval that has been given to the Minister's acceptance of the principle of the amendment. There is no question that, considering the fact that the farmers of this country have had to go through a nightmare it is a move in the right direction.  The Minister has mentioned the fact that rates plus half an annuity in this country would be as good as the whole annuity without rates in Northern Ireland.  He has, however, overlooked one very important factor, and that is that the rates of this country are increasing, ever-increasing. They have reached a figure out of all proportion to what they were some years ago or what they were at the time to which Deputy Gorey referred, when the Grand Jury system was in operation here.  The rates at that time did not bear heavily upon the agricultural community. They had an unlimited market, a market that was there for them at all times and it absorbed the surplus produce of the land of this country.  There can be no question that that market was available for the farmer and it provided him with the means of paying his way.  Now, when we have the <Col N="374" /> rates constantly increasing and when they are being added to by the various schemes of the Government, I feel that the farmer is entitled to get the relief which is claimed for him here, considering the terrible trials which he has gone through.  The point I wish to emphasise is that the motion proposed by Deputy Cogan is a popular motion. We have asked for derating.  I, myself, had a motion asking that loans be given to farmers at low rates of interest and that is a motion which is incorporated in Deputy Cogan's motion.  The proposal to remit land annuities and arrears of land annuities is one with which we must all have a certain sympathy for the reason that these arrears accumulated during a period when the farmer was deprived of his market, during a period when from the price of every beast sent over from this country to Britain, there was deducted a penal tariff equal to about £5 per head.  Such sums were deducted as enabled the British Government to collect from the farmers of the country £26,000,000.  On top of that they had to pay a sum of £17,000,000 to the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Finally the Irish Government came to a settlement for a sum of £10,000,000.  Is the Government now willing to give that sum of £10,000,000, or the results accruing from its payment, to the farmer, or else give him derating?  If he is not given relief, then arrears of rates can only accumulate to a greater degree.  Reference has been made to ranchers in this country, but those are the very men who are unable to meet the ever-rising tide of rates, whether for roads, mental hospitals, or in whatever direction that tide is rising.  A book issued by the Cork County Council shows that one man owed as much as £700 for rates.  These men are unable to meet the demands for rates and the demands for half annuities as well.  Unless relief be given, I say very definitely the Government cannot continue imposing taxation on the present scale upon the agricultural community.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
