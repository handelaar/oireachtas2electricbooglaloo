      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is in a position to state (1) the total amount of money advanced by the Dublin Corporation under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts from the year 1932, to date; (2) the number of cases in which the Dublin Corporation was forced to realise houses owing to the default of the purchasers; and (3) the total estimated loss to the ratepayers occasioned by defaults of house purchasers.</P>

      <P>1. Loans amounting to £1,157,357 in the aggregate have been advanced by the Dublin Corporation to borrowers under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts during the period 1932 to date.  2. The corporation were forced to realise in seven cases during this period owing to the default of borrowers, and negotiations for sale are pending in one further case.  3. The actual loss incurred in connection with the seven houses referred to amounted to £740, approximately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public <Col N="952" /> Health if he will take immediate action to enforce the Compulsory Purchase Order submitted by the County Dublin Board of Health and confirmed by his Department on the 5th October, 1935, for the erection of 40 cottages on 16 acres 19 perches which have been paid for at Tolka, Finglas; also, if he is aware that the purchase of additional land for cottages has been abandoned by the board of health, due to the action of the Dublin Corporation Town Planning Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the board of health deferred proceeding with the erection of cottages on the lands compulsorily acquired pending final consideration of a proposal to acquire certain adjoining lands for the purpose of providing a greater number of cottages.  So far as I am aware, the board have not decided to abandon the acquisition of the adjoining lands. The only action I could take to enforce the Compulsory Purchase Order would be to appoint a person to discharge the powers and duties of the board of health under the Labourers Acts.  I do not think in present circumstances such a course would be warranted. The control of development in this area is important both from the point of view of the city and county, and I understand that this matter is being carefully considered at present by the two local bodies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state when he proposes to hold the necessary public inquiry with a view to sanctioning the Cottage Agreement Scheme submitted to his Department over two months ago for the provision of 400 cottages for workers throughout County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy refers to the inquiry which will be held into the application of the board for a loan to finance the scheme. In the case of an agreed scheme no inquiry is necessary into the proposal to acquire the lands.  The various sites selected have been inspected. The Deputy may rest assured that the proposals of the board are being considered with the least possible delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes (for Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the amount of relief grants allocated to each local authority in each of the financial years from 1928 to 1938 and the amount which each local authority was required to contribute in each of these years as a condition of receiving the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The grants allocated through my Department to local authorities from the former Relief Schemes Vote from 1928 to 1936 (including grants under the Unemployment Relief Act 1931) and from the Employment Schemes Vote since 1936, are set out in the Department's Annual Reports for each year up to and including the year ended the 31st March, 1937.  The Report for the year ended 31st March, 1938, has not yet been completed.  A statement of the grants for that year is being prepared and will be sent to the Deputy.  As regards the amounts contributed by local bodies to relief works, full statistics of this nature have not been compiled for the period.  The annual returns of local taxation published by the Department show the receipts and expenditure of local authorities under various heads, but without reference to the amount of expenditure incurred for the relief of unemployment.  The time and labour involved in segregating expenditure on employment schemes from other expenditure of local authorities would not be justified.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention was directed to the dismissal by a company of a traveller transferred to their employment from a tannery company; whether he is aware that it is being an established practice for firms of this kind in the enjoyment of a monopoly to dispense with the services of travellers; and whether, in view of the number of men with long service in this branch of employment whose livelihood is threatened, he is in a position to indicate if measures will be taken to prevent the general dismissal of commercial travellers by firms enjoying monopoly conditions.</P>

The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.

The principal infringement was the supplying of goods other than beef of the kind and quality prescribed, i.e., beef obtained from a first quality bullock or maiden heifer not more than four years old.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is the fifth Telephone Capital Bill since the transfer of services in 1922.  Funds for the development of the telephone service, that is, for extension of the system as distinct from its operation and maintenance, are provided by Telephone Capital Acts.  These Acts authorise the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund such sums, not exceeding a stipulated amount, as may be required for development of the telephone service in accordance with Estimates approved by the Minister for Finance.  Moneys so provided are raised by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 20 years.  Funds provided by Telephone Capital Acts represent an investment by the State in the Telephone Service.  The security to the State for the capital investment is represented by the assets of the service consisting of plant, apparatus and property generally forming the telephone system.  The annual capital charges in the way of interest and <Col N="981" /> depreciation are a charge against the earnings of the service.</P>
      <P>The present Bill provides for a sum not exceeding £1,000,000 which amount will, it is anticipated, suffice for requirements for a period of about five years.  This provision together with the moneys provided under the four previous Acts&mdash;£1,750,000&mdash;will bring the total amount provided by the State for telephone development since the transfer of services to two and three-quarter million pounds.  It was anticipated that the amount of £500,000 provided by the Act of 1936 would cover expenditure for four or five years, but the increased rate of development following on the reductions of charges in July, 1936, necessitated unprecedentedly heavy outlay for additional plant and apparatus.  During the five years previous to the reductions of rates, the average yearly expenditure on Capital Works amounted to about £52,000.  The capital expenditure in the year 1936-37 rose to £117,438; in the year 1937-38, to £268,000, and the programme of works for the current financial year will involve about £300,000.  The amount provided by the Act of 1936 will be shortly exhausted and the present Bill is therefore necessary in order to provide further funds.</P>
      <P>The following figures indicate the growth in telephone subscribers, traffic, etc., during the past two years: Number of subscribers, on 30th June, 1936, 23,400; on 30th June, 1938, 26,400&mdash;an increase of 3,000, number of telephones in use on 30th June, 1936, 36,700; on 30th June, 1938, 40,500&mdash;an increase of 3,800; number of exchanges on 30th June, 1936, 755; on 30th June, 1938, 793&mdash;an increase of 38; number of local telephone calls for twelve months ended 30th June, 1936, 26,000,000; for twelve months ended 30th June, 1938, 29,400,000&mdash;an increase of 3,400,000; number of trunk telephone calls for twelve months ended 30th June, 1936, 2,400,000; for twelve months ended 30th June, 1938, 3,200,000&mdash;an increase of 800,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following represent the main heads of capital expenditure during the corresponding period and the <Col N="982" /> approximate outlay under each head: Extension of automatic system in the Dublin area, £81,500; provision of new subscribers' circuits, £107,000; extension of inland trunk system, £82,500; laying of new cross-Channel cable, £27,500; underground cabling in city and town areas, £48,500; additional equipment in manual exchanges, £4,000; buildings, extensions and alterations, £6,000.</P>
    <P>The extension of the automatic system in Dublin covered the installation of new automatic exchanges in Crown Alley and Clontarf, also the closing of the Drumcondra and the Dundrum manual exchanges and the transfer of the subscribers' circuits served from them to the Crown Alley and Terenure automatic exchanges respectively.  During the financial years 1924-25 to 1935-36, inclusive, the average annual expenditure on the provision of subscribers' circuits was £24,600 approximately.  For the two years ended the 31st March last the average figure was £53,500 and it will probably reach £65,000 for the current year.  The extension of the free mileage area from one to three miles has added materially to the cost of new subscribers' circuits in rural districts.</P>
    <P>To cope with the growth in inland trunk traffic it has been necessary to provide a large number of additional trunk circuits.  The increase in circuit accommodation and the introduction of the up to date &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; system on the main trunk routes has materially improved the standard of the service both as regards expedition and quality of transmission.  There has also been a considerable increase in cross-Channel traffic particularly after 7 p.m. when the low night rates operate, and to provide for this it has been necessary to lay a new submarine cable of the most modern type between Howth and Nevin, North Wales, and to arrange for the provision of a second similar cable, the laying of which is about to commence. When these cables are fully functioning, 16 cross-Channel telephone circuits will be available for public use and a first-class service will be ensured.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the telephone service is shown by the annual <Col N="983" /> commercial accounts.  A profit was made for the first time in the year 1931-32.  This profit increased yearly to 1935-36 when it reached £105,702, but following the reduction in tariffs, it fell in the year 1936-37 to £73,833, and it is expected that the accounts for the year 1937-38 will show a further fall.  The financial position, however, is regarded as satisfactory.  Although expenditure is growing by reason of extensions of equipment, increased staff costs, etc., revenue on the other hand is increasing steadily.  The revenue position is in fact much more favourable than was expected when the rate reductions of July, 1936, were decided on.  Revenue will continue to grow, but as capital expenditure must, in order to meet growing public needs, continue on a high level for some years to come, with increasing annual charges for interest and depreciation, the profit on the service is not likely to show any upward tendency in the near future.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the sum of £1,000,000 now budgeted for is expected to meet requirements for a period of about five years.  With the degree of development which will by then have been reached, it is hoped that unless something unforeseen occurs it will be possible subsequently to effect a very material reduction in the rate of capital outlay.  For the five year period, however, it is not likely to be possible to keep expenditure below an average of £200,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The heads of major expenditure contemplated for the five year period and the approximate allocations are:&mdash;£230,000 for automatic exchanges&mdash;this includes the provision of additional equipment in the existing automatic exchanges in Dublin&mdash;provision of a new automatic exchange in Dun Laoghaire to serve the present Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Foxrock and Dalkey areas; new automatic exchanges in Cork and Dundalk, and possibly also in Waterford, Galway and Sligo; £50,000 for a new central trunk exchange in Dublin&mdash;this will be necessary to replace the present Crown Alley trunk exchange which is <Col N="984" /> reaching the end of its useful life and is not capable of extension&mdash;£220,000 for new subscribers' circuits; £45,000 for new overhead trunk circuits; £53,000 for new cross-Channel cables; £200,000 for underground cabling of certain main trunk routes on which overhead lines are overloaded; £60,000 for extensions of equipment in manual exchanges and installation of additional &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; circuits on main trunk routes; £80,000 for underground work in city and town areas; £15,000 for buildings, including extensions and alterations.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the Erris Peninsula, County Mayo, an area which is at present under special consideration, no important or extensive locality throughout the country is now unprovided with telephone service.  As regards the smaller and more remote villages still unserved by reason of the cost which would be involved and the negligible traffic which would arise, the solution of the problem of providing service economically may ultimately be found in some form of rural automatic equipment.  This type of apparatus, which is about to be tried experimentally in a group of small exchanges in the vicinity of Dublin, may also enable continuous service to be afforded at the smaller exchanges throughout the country where from considerations of cost the hours are now necessarily restricted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Money Resolution, I think the Minister ought to take the opportunity&mdash;at least we would be glad if the Minister would take the opportunity&mdash;to give us as far as he possibly can a complete picture of what is involved financially in this measure, and as far as he possibly can some idea as to what this measure is intended to do.  Deputy Cosgrave asked the Minister on the Second Reading of this Bill if he would tell him what exactly the establishment and the development of the industrial alcohol industry to the extent contemplated by this Bill was intended to do for the country. Deputy Cosgrave said he could understand it if he were told explicitly it was for the purpose of giving employment to 250 men even for a period of a year; that he could understand it if he were told it was for the purpose of increasing the income of agriculturists; that he could understand it if he were told it was for the purpose of putting ourselves in the position that in case of the outbreak of war we would not be entirely dependent upon outside sources of supply for petrol; that he could understand something about the measure if he were told it was for the purpose of manufacturing munitions in the country.  I cannot trace in any of the statements made by the Minister since Deputy Cosgrave asked those questions that the Minister <Col N="988" /> has indicated what exactly is the purpose of the industry.  When in 1934 it was indicated to the House that it was desired to carry on experiments to see the extent to which industrial alcohol could be efficiently produced in the country, the emphasis which seemed to be laid on the necessity for carrying that out was that in nearly every country in Europe something like it had been done.  In so far as the matter was brought home to us here, it was indicated that we might hope to bring into cultivation a large area of land with resulting benefits to the farming community in direct cash payments and in by-products for feeding stock.  I am reading from the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of September, 1935.  It was indicated that it would increase employment and that it would to some extent reduce the dependence of this country on foreign supplies of petrol.  At that time the position was that the experiment was going to be carried out.  Now, without having made it clear as to what exactly this industry is going to do in the country, and without really giving us any idea of what the cost to the country in the long run is going to be, the Minister's statement on this Bill when it was last before the House indicated that an industry was being set up here which was going to produce industrial alcohol to an extent which was set out in that official statement in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of September, 1935, as the maximum amount of alcohol capable of blending without introducing difficulty, that is 25 per cent.  All that the Minister has said in the House seems to indicate that we are embarking on financial expenditure in setting up a fabric of production here that is going to put us in the position of producing, as far as volume is concerned, at any rate, 25 per cent. of the amount of petrol used here, that is the extent to which it was thought at that particular time it could be used without creating difficulty.  I think the Minister has indicated in the statement he has made here that he has now come to the conclusion that 15 per cent. is the most suitable percentage to use, at any rate, for motor fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> However, that is one reason why I ask that the House should be told what purpose this is for.  Apart from the money sunk in the experiment, and apart from the false ideas that the Minister came before the House with when dealing with the question at first, looking at some aspects of the situation we find that in this industry, which was going to assist farmers by paying them for an increased acreage of potatoes, a considerable sum of money has been sunk since 1935.  In fact, at the end of March, 1937, £183,251 had been sunk in connection with the development of industrial alcohol.  The estimate was that £80,000 would have come back to the Department to the end of March, 1938, as a result of the sale of industrial alcohol.  While £183,251 has been spent, of the £80,000 that it was estimated would come back to the Department, not one penny has come back.  It was estimated last year that £166,000 would have come back, but we have no information from the Minister as to what amount has come back.  The position is that never in the history of this country was a smaller acreage of potatoes grown than in 1937.  After what was spent in developing the idea, that industrial alcohol was going to be the medium of additional potatoes being taken from farmers, and a certain amount of money put into their pockets, never was there a smaller acreage grown than in 1937.  For the information of Deputies, I may say that the acreage in the year 1931 was 346,073 acres; in 1934, when we were getting into this scheme, 342,918 acres, and every year since the acreage has been going down. In 1935 the acreage was 335,000 acres, and in 1936, 326,000.  Between 1933 and 1934 there was a drop of 14,000 acres, but a scheme was put before us that, we were told, was going to increase the amount of money to be put into farmers' pockets, as a result of the increased purchase of potatoes for the development of this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is faced already with the fact that the use of this alcohol to replace some of the motor spirit brought in is going to reduce the income of the Central Fund, by having less money coming from the imports of petrol.  The Minister has not committed <Col N="990" /> himself by saying what the price of petrol is going to be increased by as a result of the mixture of industrial alcohol with imported petrol.  The fact is that, at the price the Minister is charging suppliers of petrol for industrial alcohol, every gallon of petrol is going to be increased by 2½d. for the 10 per cent. mixture, as ordered. That is going to cost road users £37,500 yearly, and the replacement of imported petrol by 10 per cent. of industrial alcohol is going to cost the Exchequer £13,000.  The 10 per cent. mixture of industrial alcohol with petrol, that is made compulsory on motor users, is going to cost the taxpayers, who have to keep the Exchequer refilled, £13,000, and it is going to cost motor users £37,500.  That is £50,000.  That money alone would pay approximately £4 a week to 250 employees for the whole 12 months of the year, but they are not going to be employed for the whole 12 months.</P>
    <P>Then again, the amount of money the Minister is liable for under the scheme, commits the State to £1,000,000 and we are told nothing of the three or four years' experiments; nothing of the real objects of the Bill, and nothing of the real financial effects.  The only thing we do know about the Minister's outlook on the financial side of the measure is the change that has taken place in his whole outlook, as shown by the price now being charged petrol distributors for this stuff.  The Minister dealt with the matter in February and May, 1934, and in answer to criticisms as regards the suggested price at which industrial alcohol was going to be sold, said on the 25th February, according to the Parliamentary Debates, column 2146:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The price at which we contemplate that industrial alcohol will be available, allowing for potatoes, labour, coal and barley will not, in our opinion, exceed 1/9 and 1/10.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On May 29th, at column 1997, the subject of the Minister's estimate of 1/10 was again under discussion, and the Minister is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I was listening to Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dockrell trying to prove that this alcohol was going to cost anything up to 3/- a gallon, <Col N="991" /> it just occurred to me that, possibly, when they were going to school mathematics was an optional subject. They did not succeed in proving anything like what they set out to prove.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, by way of example to prove that he was right, gave a roundabout sum like what appears in the Christmas numbers of some weekly journals.  We get an answer now, and the answer is that the Minister is charging 3/- a gallon for industrial alcohol produced in these factories to the people to whom he is selling it. That is the only thing we know.  That is the real kick.  There is not much of a definite kick in it for any section of the people, as never before had we a smaller acreage of potatoes than we have now.  There is not much of a kick coming to any particular person when he does not know exactly where this policy is leading.  The motorists, even if they were paying the £37,000 a year additional, and the taxpayers, if they were paying only £30,000 additional, would not feel the kick so very much as the person who is made to feel it directly now, and that is the person who is the supplier of petrol and who has to pay 3/- a gallon for the stuff the Minister said he was going to produce at 1/9 and 1/10.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he was going to have an export market for the wash.  In his Estimates for the year 1936-37 he told the Dáil that he was going to put into the Exchequer by the sale by him at that time of industrial alcohol and wash, £80,000.  The Appropriation Accounts now available for the last couple of months indicate that nil came in.  From the Estimates which were put before us last year it appeared £166,840 was going to be received by the Department of Industry and Commerce for the sale of industrial alcohol and wash.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I would like to point out that this Bill merely provides for the transfer of the existing undertaking from the Department to a company to be established.  I submit that the question of whether or not this <Col N="992" /> industry was to be established was determined when the Act of 1934 was passed and a Second Reading debate is out of order on the Financial Resolution.</P>

      <P>The matter for discussion on a Money Resolution is the purpose to which this money is to be devoted.  That purpose under this particular Bill relates to two matters, the formation of a company, the guaranteeing of debenture shares and a few other minor matters.  That the industry should be established was decided by the Oireachtas in the Act of 1934, which has not been repealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I decline to assist in any way to vote money enabling the Minister to go deeper into the mire or send the State deeper into this particular mire.  The Minister is asking for power to guarantee debentures in this company.  The Money Resolution, I take it, covers that.  I say that this House should not spend a halfpenny to give the Minister any power to put the State deeper financially into this position until the knowledge that he has, as to where this industry is bringing the country, is, to the fullest possible extent, placed before the country.  The Minister, as I say, has told us that £166,000 was going to go into the Exchequer out of the sale of alcohol and wash last year and £168,000 was going into the Exchequer this year. Is that so?  Surely if this industry is so important that £500,000 worth of capital and power to commit the credit of the State to another £500,000 is desired, the Minister should give us that information.  Is there any person looking for £50 or £100 to start a huckster's shop who would give less information to the person from whom he was asking a loan than the Minister has given to the House on this subject? The Minister threw ridicule and sarcasm on the arithmetic that enabled members of the Opposition five years ago to figure out that he would charge and would have to charge 3/- a gallon for industrial alcohol.  That wisdom has been borne out, and the whole obscurantist attitude of the Minister at that particular time and the glib, gay array of minor figures that he had <Col N="993" /> to produce the figures of 1/9 and 1/10 has gone by the board.  It does not need a person with a blackboard to prove that the whole of the Minister's basis at that particular time was wrong.  The people who are distributing petrol in this country to-day know it when they get the bill for 3/- a gallon from the factories.  Surely, if the Minister has a case to make about that he may make it in a small or a big way but the big case that has to be made is that the Minister has put in another £500,000 or guaranteed another £500,000 in debentures.  Perhaps when we have reached the point at which we will be producing 25 per cent. mixture and when motorists will be paying double the amount that I mentioned here and the taxpayer will be paying double the amount that I mentioned here, the Minister will tell us what financial or other benefits he expects this State to have.</P>

We are debarred from discussing the merits of the original measure, but might I suggest to the House that the inducements that the Minister offered to the Deputies of this House to support the original measure have been largely falsified?

      <P>We had several warry words across the House about particular figures but the Minister stuck to his figure and it largely induced particular Deputies on his own benches to support him in his desire to set up alcohol factories in this country.  We did not believe it on this side but, nevertheless, it carried the day for the Minister.  It has largely, in fact it has absolutely, been proved to be a false figure.  The amount is about double and, while it may have been a reasonable proposition to Fianna Fáil Deputies to <Col N="995" /> induce them to support the measure at 1/8 there is a great chance they may change their minds at 3/-.  We were told that there were to be certain appropriations-in-aid, if we may call them so, in the way of alcohol wash or eyewash or some wash to recoup the people for the expenditure of this money, but the main inducement offered was that this was going to be of great benefit to the agricultural community, that it was going to induce the farmers of this country to go in largely for potato cultivation.  That idea of the Minister has also been proved to be false by the figures given by Deputy Mulcahy, and, mind you, on this particular point, I am taking his figures as correct because I believe them to be correct.  His figures show that the acreage under potatoes has been greatly reduced instead of being increased.  If there were any one argument that could have induced the country Deputies at least, and the majority in this House are country Deputies, to support the measure it would be the fact that it was going to be of great benefit to the agricultural community.  It has not proved to be so.  It certainly has not been a benefit to any other section of the community that I can possibly see.  The Minister has not ever in this House advanced the argument that it would be of any great benefit to any other section of the community.  Apparently it is not going to be of benefit to the Exchequer. It is a loss to the Exchequer of some £30,000, I believe, was the figure.  It is a loss to the trade; it is a loss to the motor users; it is a loss to every other section as far as I can see.  There may be other inducements.  One of the inducements the Minister offered was that in a period of national crisis in this country we may be able to supplement our petrol supply.  The Minister has never seriously suggested to the House that in the case of our petrol supply being cut off we could use the alcohol produced solely in this country by his factories.  I believe this is the most indefensible proposition ever put before the House.  I believe the House originally approved of it under a misapprehension of its possible <Col N="996" /> effects and in the belief that the Minister's inducements to support the measure would prove to be correct. They have not been so proved.  So far as I can learn from people in my own constituency, and anywhere else, there is an intense opposition to this measure and I, for one, could not be a party, by my vote, to the passing of this Money Resolution.</P>

      <P>The Bill before the House, to which this Money Resolution relates, has for its sole purpose the transfer of the existing industrial alcohol undertaking from the Department of Industry and Commerce to a company to be established in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. It is the opinion of the Government, an opinion which, I think, is shared by many persons independent of the Administration, and an opinion that is justified by our experience, that the successful operation of a commercial concern by a Government Department is very difficult and that the type of organisation more usually found in business life is better suited to the purpose.  It is true that in the initial stages of this undertaking, when contracts of various kinds had to be made and a great deal of experimental work done, the most suitable method of operation was through the Department of Industry and Commerce.  But, now that the factories are established and about to commence production, we consider that it is better to transfer them to a public company to be set up.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies are also aware of the fact that this Bill has been before the House already.  It was discussed at great length on the occasion of the Second Reading.  It was discussed at still greater length upon a Money Resolution similar to this one, and it was discussed even in Committee. Because of a technicality, because of the dissolution of the Dáil prior to the election, that necessitated a reintroduction of the measure and we have to go through the same procedure all over again.</P>

Here is an enterprise set up by an Act of the Dáil.  There were many definite reasons why it was worth while carrying out experiments such as this enterprise represents.  It is an experiment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This type of industry was never previously established in this country and it was not known definitely what success or otherwise would attend its establishment here. I may say that it has been reasonably successful.  Certain difficulties arose which were not anticipated; but, on the other hand, certain advantages <Col N="998" /> appeared which we did not anticipate, either.  It is easy to quote the figures given in 1934.  In the circumstances of 1934 these figures were substantially correct.  If we could purchase potatoes at 25/- a ton; if we could purchase coal or barley at the prices that ruled in 1934, a much lower price could be quoted for the industrial alcohol produced. Instead of the prices we contemplated then, we are paying 40/- a ton for potatoes, the price of coal has almost doubled, and barley has also been increased and, consequently, there has been an increase in the price which must be quoted for the alcohol which must be sold.</P>
      <P>This price provides for every contingency; it provides the interest on the capital investment in the undertaking, with a margin over and above that interest; it provides for a recovery of all the loss on production.  It could in fact be reduced, even on our present anticipation, and will possibly be reduced in the future when we get more experience.  It is easy enough to say these factories are of no benefit to the farmers of Limerick, as Deputy Bennett says.  They were not intended to be a benefit to the Limerick farmers.  I should like Deputies to ask the farmers of the areas where the factories are located whether they are a benefit or not.  We did not establish these factories in order to increase the production of potatoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason undoubtedly was to secure benefits for the agricultural community in a period when the prices of potatoes were abnormally low.  We felt there was a need for the operation of some scheme, whether it was to manufacture industrial alcohol or starch or glucose or any other produce that could be made from potatoes.  It was worth while instituting it, if we could fix a limit below which the price of potatoes could not fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister base the calculation on the prevailing price of 24/- a ton?</P>

    <Col N="999" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not base it on that.  We contemplated raising that price.  Deputies have frequently talked about £2 a ton and they have declared that that does not pay the farmers. When they say that, they are misunderstanding or misrepresenting the position.  The average farmer will relate the price that is offered to what is offered in the market for graded potatoes.  This is not for graded potatoes, but for the whole of the product of the land and the farmers of Cooley, Monaghan and Donegal find that that pays them much better than perhaps £3 or £3 10s. that they may be offered in the open market.  They sell their potatoes to the factories. They do not have to sell them there; there is no compulsion; the Civic Guards do not march them to the factories and force them to sell.  They are selling the potatoes voluntarily because they regard that price as better than the prevailing market price.  It is true that the price of potatoes fluctuates.  It has been quite high last year and this year.  When this experiment was begun the price of potatoes was never lower.  It had reached rock-bottom.  The farmers in Donegal were at that time selling potatoes at less than 20/- a ton.  That was in 1934.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any calculation of the cost in 1934 or since was specifically stated.  It was based on certain assumptions in regard to the price paid for potatoes, for labour, for coal and barley.  These are the four items that go to make industrial alcohol and no figure has any significance unless it is related to certain assumed costs.  If we are now paying 40/- a ton for potatoes instead of 30/-; if we are paying 26/- for coal instead of 15/-, or a higher price for barley than was contemplated, then it is obvious that the price of the article is going to be higher.  If these prices go down, the price of alcohol will go down.  The price of one must conform to the price of the other&mdash;that is obvious.</P>

      <Col N="1000" /> Deputies opposite reached a certain stage of madness when we proceeded with the experimental establishment of this industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House, time and again, the reason.  I do not propose to go over all that again.  The Deputy can ask me where are the receipts.  We cannot have receipts until we have made sales, until we have sold the alcohol.  These factories were experiments and they were started towards the end of the last season. One ran for only a couple of months and one for only a month or even a shorter period.  They will not commence a full year's activity until September this year and it is only in relation to a full year's working that there will be receipts of any magnitude.  These receipts will not merely be sufficient to repay the cost of manufacturing but they will enable us to pay 5 per cent to the Minister for Finance on the moneys advanced and also allow for a certain margin towards contingencies. I have said all this before, within the <Col N="1001" /> past couple of months.  I gave the Dáil all this information when this Bill was last before the House.  The Bill provides for a capital of £500,000.  The Minister for Finance will be issued shares to the value of the assets transferred to the company which are valued up to £266,000.  In addition, another £60,000 will have to be paid before that formal business is completed.  That will leave the company with fixed assets to carry on the business but without working capital.  In addition to that amount of money certain working capital will be required and some other comparatively small items of capital expenditure will have to be undertaken. That is why the capital was fixed at £500,000.  It probably will not be necessary to incur capital expenditure to that amount.  But the capital expenditure is represented by that figure.  There is a capital expenditure of £266,000 which will have to be undertaken immediately and another £60,000, amounting to a total of £326,000, the total of the value of the assets to be transferred.</P>

There is the bulk sum payable to the Dutch firm who are our technical advisers in this matter in consideration of their services in supervising the construction and equipment of these factories. Furthermore, there was certain expenditure upon salaries of staff in connection with the enterprise before the factories were constructed.  These items of expenditure are being carried on the Department's Vote in the ordinary way.  Apart from these items, the Minister for Finance will get shares for the balance, that is £156,000; £97,000 upon plant and equipment; £9,000 upon rolling stock; £4,000 miscellaneous. That makes the £266,000 to which I have referred.  In addition the following items will also arise before this is transferred&mdash;interest upon the amount borrowed in respect of the current year.  That comes to £13,000. There is another £13,000 which represents the excess cost of production during the past season.  As Deputies understand, the price at which alcohol is sold is calculated upon the cost of production during a normal working year.  During the past season there was only part of a working year.  The excess costs of production this last year have been capitalised.  That is the normal operation of industrial companies. There are royalties which are payable upon the output of the distillery, payable over a period of time.  The capital value comes to £30,000.</P>

      <P>I refuse to answer yes or no.  I was explaining that there are two royalties involved&mdash;the royalty due to the owners of the processes which have been operated in these factories.  That is not the royalty to <Col N="1003" /> which I am referring.  I am referring to the royalty to the technical advisers to the Government who are responsible for the conduct of the factories.  The remuneration for their services is being calculated by a royalty which will have direct relation to the amount of the alcohol produced.  That royalty will vary from 2d. to 1d. a gallon over a period of four or five years.  The capital value of the total amount is £30,000.  Then there are some small items of capital expenditure.  All these items represent the total expenditure. That will be the value of the shares issued forthwith to the Minister for Finance.  Over and above that the new company will require capital for working purposes.</P>

      <P>Before we pass this Money Resolution, Sir, I should like to say a few words.  I followed the debate as closely as I could, but not being a member of the House when the original Bill was going through, I am not very familiar with it.  What I want is that everybody should know now that you are going to charge 3/- a gallon for the petrol which you manufacture and that, if that does not pay the 5 per cent. dividend which has been talked about here, it is likely that you can charge more than the 3/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Now, only this day week you had a strike here in this city of the drivers of motor taxis. Whether they were justified or not, they had that strike because the running cost or the upkeep of their vehicles had been increased.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I understood a moment ago that production had hardly started at all yet.  Is not that true?  Is not that the impression that was left on members of the House? Yet we are told that the motor industry through the country is paying the increased cost at the moment.  I do not understand this.  However, what I want to elucidate is this: that you are going to sell petrol at 3/- a gallon, and if it is necessary, you will <Col N="1008" /> get 4/- for it in order to pay that dividend. I only want to make that clear in connection with the whole matter. I think there is sufficient overhead taxation in the motor industry already without adding to it by means of this matter of industrial alcohol.</P>

      <P>I do not expect that a subsidy will be called for, but it is considered desirable that this section should be inserted.  It may happen some year, say, if there was a complete failure of the potato crop, or some other circumstance, which would upset the whole working of the company, that it might involve the payment, temporarily, of some subsidy to carry over that period.  In the ordinary course no subsidy is contemplated.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows quite well that a measure of this kind, if pro perly drafted, would provide for every possible contingency that might arise. We have always endeavoured to produce a complete Bill so that subsequent amendment would not be necessary. That is why there are a couple of provisions in the Bill to meet a number of contingencies that might, but probably never will, arise.  When I mentioned a possibility, I merely did so as an illustration, as in the course of time, as this factory will, no doubt, go on for many years, circumstances might arise which necessitated such a course.  It is desirable to have a legal provision, so that amending legislation would not be required, but no money will be available without coming before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Minister's idea of making complete arrangements for a company like this one, that is to bring a great many benefits to the country, is that these legislative arrangements would not be complete without this section, even after a time during which the State has put a couple of hundred thousand pounds into it that we are not going to get back.  We are told this legislation will not be complete unless the Minister for Finance has power to subsidise the company.  It is being set on its feet as a business concern, and the prospect is held out, after the Minister for Industry and Commerce has <Col N="1011" /> spent a couple of hundred thousand pounds carrying out experiments supervised by his Department, that the company set up will be asked to do this work in an armchair manner, and, when he considers that the circumstances arise, it will get a sudsidy.</P>

      <P>We had the word &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo; in the original draft, but an amendment was moved in the last Dáil to delete it, because I was informed that the Land Clauses Acts affected the legal description of these measures.  I may say that when the Bill was before the Dáil previously a point concerning the phraseology of it was raised by Deputy Costello and I undertook to consult the law officers of the Government about it.  As I have done so, I would not like the section to pass without informing the House. Deputy Costello queried the necessity for sub-section 4, but I am advised that without that sub-section the legal operations would remain indefinite, and that the sub-section has not the effect of preventing a court of law from inquiring into the orders that may be made under that section.  That question has already been debated in Great Britain and there has been a decision of the House of Lords given on that matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Before the section to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> (1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, it shall not be lawful for the company or any officer of the company to disclose to any person other than another officer of the company the contents or any part of the contents of a return made by a distributor under the immediately preceding section.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any person acts in contravention of this section such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section the expression &ldquo;officer of the company&rdquo; includes any director of the company.</P>
    <P>(4)  Nothing in sub-section (1) of this section shall apply to any disclosure for the purposes of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  sub-section (6) of the immediately preceding section, or</P>
    <P>(b)  legal proceedings taken or proposed to be taken under the said immediately preceding section.</P>
    <P>I would like, first of all, to refer to the alteration in the second and third lines of sub-section (1), which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section, it shall not be lawful for the company or any officer of the company to disclose to any person other than another officer of the company the contents or any part of the contents of a return made by a distributor under the immediately preceding section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section is being inserted at the request of the petrol distributors. Under present circumstances, of course, they are protected against the disclosure of these returns by the law governing Government Departments but they expressed the fear that the same law would not apply in the case of this company and, therefore, it is necessary to make in the case of the company the provision that any of these returns shall be kept confidential by the officers of the company.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if it is the intention in any way to attempt to control the <Col N="1013" /> quantitative distribution of the mixture by any distributor or is he concerned simply to see that the percentage of industrial alcohol will be mixed into whatever quantity is distributed by any distributor?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The total quantity of alcohol will be given to these distributors in proportion to their clearances from bond, so that they will each get a corresponding similar amount.  The Minister may prescribe that whatever quantity of industrial alcohol each distributor gets must be mixed with a fixed quantity of petrol so that there will be a spirit which will have industrial alcohol and petrol in a fixed proportion and that is the spirit which that company must sell under a name which may be fixed.</P>

      <P>Arising on the amendment, I would like to be satisfied that this is not an attempt to establish an Official Secrets Act&mdash;a new Official Secrets Act&mdash;relating to industry. I am perturbed about this because, notwithstanding the assurance the Minister has given us that there will be no necessity for subsidies or anything like that at any particular time or that it will be only in very unique circumstances that that will arise, I am afraid that this particular amendment will be used not for the purpose that is stated here but for other purposes; to prevent public representatives even getting information as to the actions of the company. You could have the position, as in Great Britain at the moment, if a Deputy gets information as to the activities of the company and he wants to make his case, that he may be brought before the House or before some tribunal to show cause as to why he would not be prosecuted for an offence under this section.  I think this is an attempt by the Minister to bring the Official Secrets Act into industry and that it will cover, to a certain extent at any rate, if not to a great extent, inefficiency and improper working.  It will mean that this company can sit down in their armchairs and do as little or as much as they desire.  I would like the Minister to assure us that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Deputy reads the amendment in relation to Section 42, to which it obviously refers, he will see there are no grounds for his fears.  Section 42 requires every distributor to make a return stating the quantity of mineral hydrocarbon light oils cleared by him during the period commencing on the first day of July, 1936, and ending immediately before the commencement of the appointed month.  There is provision for subsequent returns by distributors as to their clearances from bond.  That is information concerning the business of those distributors <Col N="1015" /> which they would not wish to get into the hands of their competitors. They are protected when they give that information to the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Official Secrets Act and the ordinary practice of the Department prevent that information being disclosed to anybody, but they expressed the fear that they had not got the same protection when they gave that information to officers of the company.  The officers of the company must have that information to operate this portion of the Act, but there was nothing which definitely prohibited them from disclosing that information to anybody else.  Therefore, this sub-section is inserted to make it clear that any information obtained as a result of a return of that kind made by a private company concerning its own business will not be disclosed. That is the sole purpose of the sub-section. It relates only to such returns.</P>

That means that when we are using 1,000,000 gallons under an order issued by the Minister, motor users in the country will pay £33,330 a year more than they were paying.  That is one side of the question.  On the revenue side of the question the Minister loses 1,000,000 eightpences.

      <P>I am working only on the increased cost per gallon to the user.  If you take 40,000,000 gallons and you take your 1,000,000 gallons of alcohol and mix it with either 30,000,000 gallons or 20,000,000 gallons or spread it over the whole it does not matter.  The increased cost will have to be borne by the consumer. It is related to the whole cost.  So that between the £33,000 to be paid immediately between the car owners and the distributors and the loss of £84,000 for revenue you have £117,000.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy says is not correct.  As I understand it, the alcohol would be mixed with petrol at not lower than 15 per cent.  When the factories go to the general public they will find the same reception for the alcohol as the producers found in Great Britain.  There the consumption went from 1,000,000 in one year to 9,000,000 gallons.</P>

I want to say that the company, in my opinion, should pay fair wages.  On that, the Deputy and I are completely at one, but on the question of making it a statutory obligation, which means, I take it, that the whole matter can be raised here when any dispute arises, I am going to resist to the limit.  I think it would be unfair to the company to put them in a position that an ordinary privately-owned company would not be in&mdash;in other words, they should be able to make their contracts freely and without political pressure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>By a statutory obligation I mean an obligation which charges the company to recognise certain factors in fixing wages.  There is no obligation in this Bill to do that.

I think that a company of this kind should be left free to make its contracts in the ordinary way, and it is particularly in regard to the strike experience of this undertaking that I say that.  For instance, there was a strike in the factory at Ballina because the local transport workers' leader said that the carting of sand and so on should be done by horse and cart <Col N="1026" /> instead of by motor lorry, and things like that, which we could not tolerate, as the Deputy knows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion standing in my name and that of Deputy Keyes:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> That the Unemployment Assistance (Second Employment Period) Order, 1938, presented to Dáil Eireann, pursuant to Section 7 (3) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, on the 30th day of June, 1938, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to explain at any length the origin of the order which has been tabled by the Minister. Under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, the Minister is empowered periodically to issue what are described as employment period orders, and the purpose of these orders is to exclude certain persons from participation in benefits under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933; but I think it is necessary at the outset to protest against the manner in which the Department perfunctorily interprets its responsibility under the Act.  An employment period order was issued and was current from the 1st June, 1938, but the order itself was, in fact, not laid on the Table of the House until the 30th June, 1938. Consequently, the Dáil is put in the position that an order becomes actually effective before it is laid on the Table of the House.  We had occasion on a previous motion of this kind to protest against the Dáil being treated in that manner, and Government Departments, and Ministers in particular, ought to endeavour to arrange their business and their orders in such a way that the House would have an opportunity of repealing an order with a minimum of delay, and not have an order current for a month before it is actually laid on the Table of the House and thus open to the members of the House to repeal it.  This year, under the Act, the Minister has issued two orders.  The first order was operative from the beginning of March and applied to small holders with a valuation of £4 and over.  These small holders were excluded from benefit under the order, because it provided that, as from the date of the operation of the order and during its currency, unemployment assistance benefit would not be paid to any small holder whose valuation exceeded £4.  That order was issued in March with effect from March, and is <Col N="1028" /> still current.  In June of this year the Minister issued a second employment period order and under that second order, which applied to rural areas, every unmarried man without dependents, and every widower without dependents, was automatically deprived of unemployment assistance benefit.  It should not be thought, of course, that rural areas for the purpose of this order are merely rural areas.  The order applies to a whole variety of small towns in this country which have not the standing of urban areas and in which town commissioners do not function under the Town Commissioners Act; so that we find that, while the order is supposed to apply to rural areas, it applies, in fact, to a considerable number of towns with a population of 2,000 and 3,000 and this order is applied to them in such a manner as to deprive single persons without dependents and widowers without dependents of any unemployment assistance benefit during the period of the order, which runs from June to approximately the end of October.  It is quite clear that the purpose of the order is not so much to assume that the persons concerned can obtain employment; and, of course, the Minister must know perfectly well that they do not, in fact, obtain employment merely because an order of this kind is issued.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to ascertain the effect of the second employment period order.  Under the first order close on 3,000 persons were deprived of unemployment assistance benefit. That figure is obtained by judging approximately the number of persons in receipt of benefit prior to the operation of the order, and the number in receipt of benefit immediately after the order became effective. Under the second employment period order a very much larger number of persons were deprived of benefit.  The order, as I said, became effective from 1st June, 1938.  In the week ended 30th May, 1938, that is the day before the order became effective, there were 97,000 persons registered at the employment exchanges.  By June 13th that number had fallen to 73,000.  It is quite a reasonable assumption that the 24,000 persons who left the register <Col N="1029" /> between 30th May and 13th June, a period of 14 days, in fact left the register because they were cut off unemployment assistance benefit owing to the operation of the order.  The Minister may try to pretend that a large number of those who were deprived of benefit in that way in fact had means, but, again, according to his own statistics, of the 24,000 persons who lost unemployment assistance between the dates in question 5,000 were persons who were described as being without means.  Mind you, under the Unemployment Assistance Act, a person is deemed to have means if he has an income of 1/1 per week.  If he has 1/- per week income he is deemed not to have means, because the first 1/- is excluded, but if by working on an annual calculation it can be said that he has an income of 1/1 per week that person is classified under the Act as a person having means.  Five thousand persons, in fact, lost unemployment assistance benefit between the dates I have just mentioned, and those 5,000 persons were certified in the Minister's own returns to be without any means whatever.  The effect of the two orders, that is the one which became operative in March and the one which became operative in June, has been to deprive approximately 26,000 persons of unemployment assistance benefit under the Act.</P>
    <P>The serious part of the making of those orders is the fact that there is no inquiry whatever instituted by the Minister's Department as to whether work is available in the areas affected by the orders.  The Minister's Department makes no inquiry whatever to ascertain whether there is employment available as from the date of the operation of the order, and whether it will be available during the currency of the order.  There is no assurance by the Minister or his Department to those affected by the order that no difficulty will be experienced by them in obtaining employment following the operation of the order.  The order is simply a blanketing order, and the deliberate purpose of it is to deprive a substantial number of persons of unemployment assistance benefit during the period for which the order operates.  The <Col N="1030" /> greatest evidence one can produce to show that no work is available is the fact that the Minister finds it necessary to make the order.  If work were available there would be no necessity to make an order of this kind, because those who are depending on unemployment assistance benefit would be only too glad to accept work, even in agriculture, lowly paid though it is, rather than try to exist on the low standards of benefit paid under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  There is not a sane man who would prefer to draw unemployment assistance benefit at the low rates which obtain to-day than to work for a reasonable wage in any industry.  If the work were available, and the Minister's Department were convinced of that fact, they could quite easily deal with this problem by saying to those who were registered as unemployed at the exchanges &ldquo;Work is available at such and such a farm, or in such and such an industry&rdquo; and send the unemployed men to accept that work.  In that way, work would be provided, and there would be a diminution of the number of persons on the register.  There would then be no necessity for issuing an order of this kind.  But the Minister knows that work is not available, that it is not possible to say to the unemployed people: &ldquo;Go to such and such a farm or to such and such an industry or to such and such a service and you will get work there.&rdquo;  It is because the Minister cannot do that, but at the same time wants to get 25,000 or 26,000 persons off the unemployment register, that he finds it necessary to resort to issuing an order of this kind taking no cognisance whatever of the availability of work or of the distressing conditions applicable in a particular area.</P>
    <P>Those orders are described as employment period orders, but it is quite clear, both from the absence of any inquiry into the availability of work in any area, and from the blanketing manner in which those orders are issued, that while they are described as employment period orders, they are really economy orders, and that the overriding consideration in the mind of the Minister is to issue an order the effect of which will be to save the <Col N="1031" /> expenditure of money on unemployment assistance benefit for a substantial period during the year.  I think it is a most unfair order which can operate in that decisive way, depriving persons of benefit, cutting them off automatically, irrespective of the circumstances in the area, and irrespective of whether or not work is available.  As I said, if work were available, the unemployed would prefer to accept that work.  It is because it is not available; it is because they cannot get work, and must, therefore, rely on the exchanges as the sole means of getting even a fragmentary income, that the Minister thinks it necessary to make an order of this kind.  What happens is that, while the Minister may save money on the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act, the local authorities throughout the country find it necessary to pay home assistance to unemployed persons who are unable to draw benefit because of the operation of an order of this kind.  Many of those unemployed people find it extremely difficult to get home assistance if they have been drawing, or are again likely to be able to claim at some later date, unemployment assistance benefit.  If the boards of health throughout the country were to do the duty imposed on them under the Act, they would find it necessary to grant some assistance to those who are deprived of benefit by the operation of orders of this kind.</P>
    <P>When you have a situation of that kind in the country, that 25,000 or 26,000 men are put off benefit for a period of five months, is it any wonder that you have the large-scale emigration which is taking place to-day?  Is there any inducement for able-bodied young men in this country who are anxious to get work here, who cannot get work here, and who must perforce try to obtain unemployment assistance benefit until they can get even the casual type of work which is such an evil feature of the conditions in this country, to remain here?  Is it any wonder that large numbers of them emigrate to Britain, to try to find there the employment which they cannot get at home? I think the price which the State pays for the issuing of an order of this kind <Col N="1032" />&mdash;the price in the form of reduction in the physique of the nation, in emigration from the nation, and in the sufferings of those who are the victims of those orders&mdash;is a price unduly high, having regard to the sum of money which is saved to the central authority.</P>
    <P>I think the issue of the order displayed cynical disregard of what really happens to the unemployed once it has been made, as there is no disposition on the part of the Government or the Department concerned to make any reasonable provision in the way of granting unemployment assistance benefit in cases where, after the issue of the order, a man can prove that he is still unable to obtain work. If there was any consideration in the administration of the order there should be provision by which a man, even if he was cut off benefit, could go to the employment exchange or to a Court of Referees and say: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the operation of the order and the assumption that work is available, I cannot get work.&rdquo;  If he was able to prove that he was unable to get work he ought to be entitled to have his case considered with retrospective effect under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Not only is he deprived of benefit, but even after that, if he can show, notwithstanding his diligent effort to obtain work, that he cannot get it, he cannot appeal against the operation of the order, and cannot get any machinery to enable him to do so.  I think the order is unfair, and that its application, in such circumstances, is particularly harsh.  I feel that the Dáil ought not to allow the order to pass so long as there is legislative means of asking to have it repealed.  I moved this motion to give the Dáil an opportunity to exercise its legislative rights in the matter, and to give Deputies an opportunity of discussing the effects of an order made in such an ill-considered way without any regard to the final consequences and the amount of suffering caused by its operation.</P>

      <P>It will not be necessary for me, in seconding this motion, to deal with this question at any great length.  I consider that Deputy Norton has made the case quite clear, <Col N="1033" /> as the facts in favour of it were stated on previous occasions from this side of the House.  We feel that there is no justification for the application of this employment period order.  To my mind, the question boils down to this, whether or not the machinery for dealing with unemployment assistance is effective.  I suggest that all the machinery required to protect the Central Fund from abuse is vested in the Department in the ordinary machinery of the Unemployment Acts.  Notwithstanding the appeals that were made from this side of the House, certain provisions that were in the original Act have been preserved in the amending legislation. In view of all the machinery that is at the disposal of the Department, including investigation officers, Civic Guards and anonymous letter writers, how can anyone get unemployment benefit if in employment?  I contend that there is ample machinery to protect State funds and to prevent any abuse where a person is working.  It is assumed that the employment available is in the farmers' fields.  The rural areas to which the order applies embrace many large towns.  The borough boundary in my constituency embraces a considerable urban population and many of these people come under the ambit of the employment period order as much as if they lived a distance of 40 miles.  They are supposed to look for employment with farmers in the fields in competition with labourers who are unemployed in the rural areas.  Obviously that is not intended, because if work is available in the rural areas the persons I refer to are painters, porters and others who would not know how to handle a scythe.  Any respectable farmer would set his dogs on them if these men went to him to look for that class of work. Yet people of that class are struck off benefit from June to October because of this order.  Is it because the Minister feels that his machinery is not capable of detecting abuses of the Act or that there may be cases of false pretences that he issued this order? When citizens have been given the benefit of legislation of a social character which entitles them to unemployment assistance it is a highhanded <Col N="1034" /> and an arbitrary action to take it from them without attempting to trace the effects of the order, regardless of any hardship that may be inflicted.  Deputy Norton mentioned on a previous occasion that we asked that statistics should be made available showing how many people were unemployed.  At the time the Minister said he had not got them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the fact is that this year 24,000 people, so far as we have means of ascertaining, are affected.  As Deputy Norton stated we are taking the figures before the order was issued and the figures immediately after its issue.  A very big drop is shown of persons affected by this order as compared with earlier orders.  The reason for the drop is simple.  These people have gone across the Channel to get employment.  In that way unemployment figures here have been reduced considerably.  Those period orders have been one of the causes of driving these people out of this country because they have been definitely deprived of the few shillings a week on which they subsisted.  I have an appeal to-day from a man who lives in a labourer's cottage, saying that owing to the operation of the order he has no means of paying his rent, and that the board of health would probably take steps to evict him.  That man cannot get work.  He was a victim last year also and could not get any benefit because of these ruthless orders.  As Deputy Norton stated the order is not sufficiently flexible to enable a man to appeal to some body where he could prove that work is not available.  Some provision should be made, if work is not available, under which a man would <Col N="1035" /> be entitled to get the benefit of the Act.  Does the Minister feel that he is justified in making an order of this kind without having regard to the hardship inflicted on the rural population and on the working-class people? I come into close contact with unemployed people and I am opposed to this order.  I feel that I am honestly justified in my determination to oppose it from the experience I have had of its operation previously.  I wonder if the Minister has taken steps to see what the effects of the order have been, and ascertained how many people really got employment after being deprived of benefit.  My recollection was that previously he said he did not know.  I may be wrong.  I hope the Minister will now tell us how many people, who were struck off benefit last year, got employment.  He might also say if he is going to proceed with the order, or make it sufficiently flexible, so that there will be some appeal, and not drive people to the verge of starvation, because of the operation of an order of this kind.</P>

      <P>I do not think it was quite fair of Deputy Norton in his opening remarks to attempt to prejudice the Dáil, in reference to an order which came into effect on the 1st June not being laid on the table until the 30th June.  Deputy Norton may have forgotten the fact that there was a general election, but other Deputies in this House have reason to remember it.  The order was in fact sent for submission to the Dáil by my Department on the 16th May and would have been laid upon the table of the Dáil if there had been a Dáil with a table to lay it upon but there was no Dáil and it was not until the 30th June, when the Dáil reassembled, that the order could be laid upon the table and on that date the order was, in fact, submitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of May. Anyway, the only thing I can testify to is that the order was sent to the Clerk of the Dáil by the Department of <Col N="1036" /> Industry and Commerce on the 16th day of May and the only reason why it did not appear on the table of the House before the 30th June was because it was not until the 30th June that there was a Dáil in existence with a table upon which the order could be laid.  We have had many discussions of this kind in the course of the past two years because orders of this character have been made in every year since the Unemployment Assistance Act came into operation.  It is, of course, easy to find fault with the effect of such orders upon individuals.  It is inevitable that a scheme of this kind cannot be adapted to meet the circumstances of individual cases.  Any arrangements for the administration of an unemployment assistance scheme must endeavour to deal with the people in classes and not as individuals.  If you want to have a scheme of assistance which will provide for the consideration of individual cases then it must be such a scheme as the Home Assistance Scheme, one which involves domiciliary visits by officers with a considerable amount of discretion who can, in fact, determine whether or not assistance is required and assistance can be given.  We do not operate a scheme of that kind.  We operate a scheme which sets out certain statutory requirements which must be met by any person claiming assistance and certain statutory barriers to the receipt of assistance, which give power to make orders which can deal with sections of the community as a whole and not with individual members of it. It is, however, well known to Deputies that the big difficulty in devising the unemployment assistance scheme originally was the circumstances existing in rural areas.  Deputies know that I am sure.  Even Deputy Norton and Deputy Keyes are very familiar with the problems that had to be solved in connection with the operation of an unemployment assistance scheme in rural areas before that scheme could be embodied in an Act.  The problem in rural areas has not been touched upon by them at all in their speeches.  That problem is in regard to the sons of farmers who live with their fathers upon their fathers' farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The average unemployed person who works for wages, who has no property to sell except his labour, who is dependent entirely upon what he earns is in a different category. They do not constitute a problem at all.  If all the people whom the unemployment scheme touches in rural areas were of that character there would be no difficulty.  It is because there are some 48,000 people in this country qualified to receive unemployment assistance who are living in rural areas and who are not of that character that there is a problem.  That is the problem of the single man who lives with his father or some other relative upon a farm owned by the father or that other relative.  It is impossible to say whether this person is employed or unemployed. It is quite an individual case.  Then take the case of a farm upon which there is a father and two sons.  The farm might quite properly be worked by the father and one son.  That does not say there is no work for the second son if he cares to do it.  It does not enable you to determine which of the two sons is to be regarded as unemployed. It is that feature of life in the rural areas that created the major problem in devising the unemployment assistance scheme and which very nearly determined the Government to exclude the rural areas from the scope of the unemployment scheme altogether, just as agricultural workers had to be excluded entirely from the scope of the unemployment insurance scheme. We did not exclude them but, in order to deal with that problem partially, it was decided to give power to make these exclusion orders, orders which could be used to exclude from the right to receive unemployment assistance persons living in rural areas at the times of the year when they might reasonably be expected to be employed on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realised then and we realise now that here and there there would be individuals in respect of whom it could be said that their exclusion from the right to receive unemployment assistance would constitute a hardship, just as I am quite sure there are people receiving unemployment assistance <Col N="1038" /> who all Deputies would agree should not get it because they are not the type of person for whom this scheme was devised.  These difficulties will occur and some other machinery must be created to deal with them.  There is at least the machinery of the Home Assistance Acts.  But let us consider the adminisstration of the unemployment assistance. We made an order much less restricted in its scope than we contemplated before the Bill was introduced here.  When we were framing the Bill, when we took that power to exclude from the right to receive unemployment assistance, certain classes of persons at certain periods of the year, we had in mind the exclusion of all persons in rural areas during the busy seasons on the land.  We have never used the power to that extent. We have only excluded two classes of persons, one the actual owners of land, the poor law valuation of which exceeds £4 per year, and secondly, single men without dependents.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the scope of these orders extends beyond purely rural districts.  There are certain classes of towns which have no local government, no known boundaries, which are small towns in rural areas and, for purely administrative reasons, it was found impossible to distinguish in the order between these towns and rural areas surrounding them.  I do not know if any Deputy has any practical suggestion to make as to how that administrative problem could be solved.  To deal with the situation as a whole, there is, I submit, unquestionable justification for the making of these exclusion orders in respect of rural areas during the June to October period of the year.  That is what we have done.  We are now in the position to determine with some degree of accuracy as to whether the orders which were made last year and the previous year and the year previous to that did in fact cause hardship.  I would say that if Deputies could come here and prove conclusively that a considerable number of cases of hardship resulted from the making of the order then there would be grounds for not making the order in future, even though we knew that not making it <Col N="1039" /> was going to mean that unemployment assistance, at the taxpayer's expense, was going to be paid out to a large number of persons who could be at work or should be at work upon the land.  Even though we knew that and had to face the cost of providing unemployment assistance to people who were not entitled to it and whom the Dáil intended should not get it, nevertheless, we would be justified in doing it if there was evidence of any considerable hardship resulting from the order.  I submit there is no such evidence. The number of persons who were disallowed unemployment assistance in consequence of the Second Employment Period Order last year was 23,907, approximately 24,000.  Bear in mind that a very high proportion of those came within the description that I have given&mdash;they are the sons of farmers living with their fathers on their fathers' land, and if they got employment during the period for which the exclusion order operated they got it in the main upon their fathers' farms.</P>
    <P>In so far as they did, we have no record of it.  There is no record in the Department of the work done by such people in that way.  We do know that some substantial allowance must be made for the employment of these people in that way.  These are single men without dependents, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that a very high proportion of them were, in fact, occupied during the whole of that employment period working upon the land on which they ordinarily resided. In addition to these being occupied in that way, 68 per cent. of them got spells of work for wages, according to the information which they furnished to the Department when the Employment Period Order expired.  That information may not be 100 per cent. reliable. Deputies do not need to be told that unemployed persons often get odd ideas as to what it is in their interest to tell officials at the employment exchanges. At any rate, according to the information which they gave, 68 per cent. of them got spells of work which varied in duration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no means test as far as these people are concerned. The people who own the land were excluded by the First Employment Period Order.  We are dealing here with single men without dependents affected by the Second Employment Period Order. Most of them might reasonably be expected to get work on their fathers' land, but 68 per cent. of them got some spell of work for wages.  A substantial number got more than one spell.  Some of them got work for the whole of the period of the Employment Period Order. A good number of them got spells of <Col N="1041" /> work varying from 14 to 28 or 60 days. There is a provision in the regulations relating to this matter which says that any person disallowed unemployment assistance by reason of the making of such an order, must nevertheless get preference over other applicants for any work available, financed in whole or in part out of Central Funds.  As Deputies are aware, there is a substantial amount of work available throughout the country during the summer months to which that regulation applies and upon that work these persons excluded from the receipt of unemployment assistance by the order nevertheless get the same preference as if they had been receiving unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the same preference as they would have got if they continued drawing unemployment assistance. The only thing these people would have to do in order to qualify for that work, if the work became available, was to maintain their registration at the exchange.  They did not do it. Of the 24,000 people who were disallowed on the 1st June, 1937, approximately only 1,200 maintained their registration.  The number of persons not receiving unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance who were registered at the exchanges in the country on the last Monday in May, 1937, was 3,490 and on the last Monday in June, 5,687.  I submit that that figure is an indication that a large number of these people were not available for work at that period because they were engaged in the manner I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that you dismissed the staff in some exchanges on the assumption that these people were not coming back to sign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely stated that in order to maintain their registration very little trouble was involved for a large number of these people and by maintaining registration they got their right to employment on public works.  I submit that if there was this widespread hardship which Deputy Norton refers to, they would have done it.  Deputy <Col N="1042" /> Norton says that the local authority had to make good the unemployment assistance stopped from these persons, and relieve hardship.  To what extent had the local authorities to step in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The local assistance scheme is there.  If there was hardship, if, as a result of the orders, people were, in fact, left destitute and unable to provide for themselves in any way, one would expect to find some reflection in the home assistance figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some will not give them assistance even though they are cut off at this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any home assistance authority which fails to relieve destitution in its area is failing in its duty. That is the duty of the local authority, and the purpose of the home assistance scheme is to provide against destitution, and to provide assistance in that intimate, personal way which is possible when you have inspectors with discretionary powers.  There is no evidence of any increase in the number of able-bodied persons receiving home assistance during the period these orders were in operation.  The number of persons receiving home assistance on the last Saturday of January was 4,200, and on the last Saturday of May, 4,300.  The order came into operation on the 1st June.  On the last Saturday of June the number was 4,400; in July, 4,400; August, 4,900; October, 4,400, and November, 4,500.  There is no evidence there of widespread destitution or considerable hardship occasioning appeals to the home assistance authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary consideration in the making of these orders is not economy. Deputy Norton says the orders are made for the purpose of reducing the cost to the unemployment assistance scheme.  I am not saying it would not be justified if it were clear that the need for the assistance did not exist amongst persons cut off, but that was not, in fact, the primary consideration. It would be almost impossible <Col N="1043" /> for anyone to say how much, in fact, was saved by the making of these orders.  Of course, one would have to know not merely the number of persons cut off but also whether these persons would have got work and, if so, how much work during the period of the order.  Whatever the total saving is it is a bagatelle compared with the total cost of the unemployment scheme, and certainly it is not as Deputy Norton said, the primary consideration.  The primary consideration is to give effect to what was the original intention in 1933.  As Deputies know quite well, we had in the initial period during which the unemployment period order was not in operation complaints from all parts of the country of the inability of land owners to get workers.  These complaints were expressed here in the Dáil and Seanad by people from certain parts of the country.  We were told that people found it difficult to get workers for agricultural purposes at certain periods of the year when workers were required before these orders were made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister find out whether these complaints were justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There may have been grounds for the complaints&mdash;I do not know.  These complaints appeared in the local papers and they were voiced in the Dáil and Seanad.  It is necessary to provide that that situation will not exist in the future, and that if there is work to be done, whether it is work to be got at wages or work by farmers' sons on the farmers' holdings, these men should be doing that work rather than getting unemployment assistance.  I admit that this is a scheme that does not allow much variation in individual cases.  We have worked upon broad lines and without regard at all to the finer shades of difference between one section of people and another.  It was impossible to provide a scheme on any other basis except you set up local authorities who will bring all the applicants before them and afterwards decide the merits from the evidence they have had and from the information they <Col N="1044" /> have had.  But we cannot work on these lines; we have to make fixed rules and we have to conform to these fixed rules.  No other possible base of working has been suggested.  I do not think it necessary to say more.</P>
      <P>My order was fully justified by the experience of the working of similar orders last year and the previous year. We have had very little to indicate that any undue hardship resulted from that and, in fact, very little at all except in one or two places in Donegal where it is true that exceptional conditions operated.  It is difficult to make a distinction between one part of the country and another.  We thought one time last year to differentiate between those parts of the country where there is employment for agricultural labourers and those parts of the country where agricultural labourers do not exist, where the holdings are worked by the members of the families living on them. We thought it might be possible to make different conditions for one area as compared with another.  But the practical difficulty of doing so proved so great that the very best scheme towards that end could not be considered at all and had to be condemned.  One order was made for the whole country.  That was the result of our efforts.  It may be that some solution of this problem may be found along those lines.  If so, I am prepared to consider any suggestion made by Deputies.  I would be prepared to consider any effective method of adjusting the difficulties in different areas if this can be found possible.  There is always the problem of a border.  There is a border between one townland and another, one county and another, one province and another. We have had these orders in operation for a number of years.  There is no reason why they should not be continued. It is our intention to continue, if not for the period covered by the present order, then for some period.  There is, in effect, no other alternative than the exclusion of the rural areas from the scope of the scheme.</P>

      <P>There was a very intelligent anticipation on the part of those who knew what would happen. They also knew that that body would not meet for another month.  That was followed up on Monday last by a very touching application that came before the meeting.  A case of the most astounding degree of neglect was brought to the notice of the board, not by a labour agitator or by any politician, but by members of the Gárda Síochána in the district where this thing occurred.  I quote from the <i>Cork Evening Echo</i> of July 19th, 1938.  It is from a report of the proceedings of the West Cork Board of Health and Public Assistance.  In that report the following occurs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Inspector M. Cunningham, Gárda Síochána, Skibbereen, sent in the following report for the consideration of the board:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;On the 13th inst.  Timothy Fitzgerald, Derryconnell, Ballydehob, reported to the Gárda at Ballydehob that he and his brother, Daniel Fitzgerald, of the same address, had no proper food for ten days previous and had no money to procure it.  He stated that their only means of subsistence were potatoes unearthed from neighbours' gardens.  He further stated he had applied to the local H.A.O. on various occasions during the past month for home <Col N="1046" /> assistance, but had been refused on all occasions.  Both men are unemployed and were up to a short time ago in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Sergt. Patk. Flynn, of Ballydehob, visited the house of the two men at 4.30 on the evening of the report.  The men were present. Daniel would appear as if he was under-nourished for some time.  His brother, Timothy, was not so bad looking, but also showed signs of under-nourishment.  The sergeant could find no signs of any food in the place.  He supplied them with 5/- worth of food at his own expense, after being informed that a further application for assistance had been refused.  He notified the H.A.O. of the case and was informed by the latter that he already knew of the case and that he could not manage to give them personal assistance.  In view of the circumstances, as disclosed, the facts are sent you for your information, with a view to having the matter investigated.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The board of health proposed to deal with the official who for some reason yet undisclosed failed to afford provision in that case.  That aspect of the case does not come in for discussion here.  The aspect of the case that comes into discussion here is that you have two men starving in a remote district, deprived of the means of existence by the operation of this order.  Cases of this kind may not be general, but there can be no doubt about the fact that a very considerable degree of hardship has been imposed on people affected by this order.  There can be no defence for it. The Minister showed in the course of his statement that he had a very bad case to defend.  I intervene only to bring up an example that I have quoted to the notice of the House.  In view of the fact that we heard from the Minister himself and from members of this Party a good deal of condemnation in the matter of a certain notable case that occurred in West Cork some years ago, I think the Minister should be made aware of this case, and that he should be aware of the fact that in the operation of this order there is danger of cases, of a kind similar to the one I have referred <Col N="1047" /> to, taking place.  I sincerely hope the Minister will go very much further than merely contemplating some local adjustment of the regulation in particular areas.  The only adjustment that the regulation is capable of is the adjustment that this House or the Minister himself could make in having the order withdrawn and some measure of consideration afforded to the people who are the victims of the injustice which the order imposes in its present form.</P>

      <P>There is one question I should like to ask.  The Minister stated a while ago that there were 5,000 registering at the labour exchanges since the order came into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 5,000 not entitled to unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That would indicate that these men were cut off without any consideration whatever.  I am a member of a board of assistance, and we have these cases also.  In many cases the boards concerned will not help these men without dependents, because the argument is that the State considered these cases as being not worthy of unemployment assistance, and therefore they look upon them as not being entitled to local assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any such argument would be completely without foundation in the case of these individuals. These people in question are not entitled to unemployment assistance because the law has been temporarily changed.  That is all.  Obviously, there has been no question of the consideration of individual cases.  The whole point of my speech was to show that such individual consideration could not be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>But these people will not get home assistance because of the fact that they have been knocked off the unemployment assistance by the State.  That is not always the case, of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to one particular area in my constituency where there is no industry at present.  There was an industry, but it has been closed down, and over 100 men in that area are registered as unemployed, 60 of whom were single or widowers and who are now deprived of any assistance whatsoever.  There is no work available in that area.  It is an area of which the Minister may be aware.  I refer to Avoca.  There was an industry there that gave employment to a large number of men some years ago, and what I am asking the Minister is that he should give consideration to this exceptional case. It is not a question of individuals, because there are over 40 men who are unable to get home assistance owing to the position in County Wicklow. The small amount that is available for distribution is a heavy drain on the board of health there.  If the board of health had the money they would not take the attitude that, because a man was not in receipt of State benefits, he would not be entitled to home assistance.  That is peculiar to a certain type of politician.  In this locality, they tried to meet all cases, but this is an exceptional case and I hold that, before the Government would make an order striking off all single men, they should satisfy themselves that work was available or that there were reasonable prospects of obtaining work in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Minister may say: &ldquo;Is it not the harvesting time, and could not these men get work in that connection?&rdquo; In this area, however, they are all small farmers and there is very little tillage.  Therefore, there is no such case to be put up as that there would be work available.  I want to know from the Minister whether anything can be done, either by a relief grant or a continuing of the order, to help these people out, because this is an exceptional case where a large number of men is concerned, or are these men to have to wait till next October? Otherwise, we do not see any prospect of getting any relief whatever for them.  The board have sent deputations to various Departments, and they have put forward big schemes for consideration, <Col N="1049" /> but up to the present these schemes have not been sanctioned and, as I say, there is no prospect of absorbing into employment those 40 unemployed men in the district.  It is questionable if any relief can be given in the way of home assistance.  I do not know what can be done in this case. There are no minor relief schemes in the area, no industry there, and there seems to be no prospect of employment. As I say, the case is exceptional, and the Minister should use his power in such a case to do something for these men who will not receive anything till next October.</P>

      <P>In opening what Deputy Murphy correctly described as a very weak defence to this motion, the Minister said that it was not correct to say that this order was only laid on the Table of the House on the 30th June.  It was only laid on the Table of the House on the 30th June.  The Minister says that it was sent to the Dáil on the 16th May.  I do not know who is responsible, but the Dáil was not dissolved until the 27th May.  In fact, it sat on the 25th May.  If the order was sent on the 16th May there is no reason why it should not have been laid on the Table of the House on the 17th or on any day that the Dáil sat between the 16th and the 25th May.  Steps could have been taken to ensure that the order was laid on the Table of the House, in view of the fact that the Minister's own Employment Period Order became current on the 1st June, and the House should get an opportunity of repealing the order, if it so desired, before the consequences of the order were inflicted on its victims.  I think the Minister's defence was particularly weak.  He admits that the order was prepared on the 16th May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister proposed to do a certain thing.  Under the Act, he is obliged to lay a copy of the order on the Table of the House.  The order was prepared on the 16th May, and the <Col N="1050" /> Minister knows that it was his job to ensure that the order was laid on the Table of the House in order to discharge his statutory obligation; because the obligation is on the Minister, and not on somebody else, to see that it is put in train for laying on the Table of the House.  However, this is not the first occasion that that has happened in connection with these orders.  It is the same story that had to be told on a previous occasion where an order was not laid on the Table of the House for a long time after the order became effective&mdash;and on that occasion there was no general election to explain the delay in doing so, and the Minister knows that.  However, to come down to the case which the Minister sought to make in resisting this motion.  He tells us that it is necessary to make these orders effective so as to deprive a large number of persons in the rural areas of benefit under these orders, during certain periods of the year, because of his view that there is work or that there should be work available there and, in any case, because they may be the sons of farmers and should work on their own land.  That, however, is ignoring completely the economic conditions of agriculture in this country.  Take the case of a man who has a few acres of land and two or three sons.  Those few acres of land are not capable of sustaining the farmer and certainly not capable of absorbing all the efforts of himself and his sons.  He is deprived of benefit because he has the land, and the sons, who are single and cannot get married because of the economic conditions, are drawing unemployment assistance benefit.  They are deprived of benefit under this order because they are single.  Does the Minister suggest that the farmer and his two sons ought to spend their time trekking around the few acres trying to find some work of a profitable character that they can do to sustain them in lieu of the assistance of which they are deprived by the application of this order?  That is the kind of case you can make in theory on paper, but if you are to relate it to the actual facts in rural areas, it will not hold water for a moment, and the Minister must know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> In any case, we got an admission from the Minister that last year 24,000 persons were deprived of unemployment assistance owing to the operation of this order, and he told us that 68 per cent. of them got spells of work during the five months over which they were deprived of benefit.  Of course, a statement of that kind is valueless unless you know what a spell of work means.  If it means one day, if it means one week, we ought to know. But it does not really matter whether it means a day or a week or a fortnight. It is quite conceivable, of course, that almost 100 per cent. of them could get a spell of work if a spell is a day or a week, but is it any solution to say that 68 per cent. of the 24,000 people got a spell of work?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister appreciate that talking about spells, which might be a day or five months, is quite worthless unless we know what exactly is the period of a spell?  If the whole 100 per cent. of the 24,000 got ten spells of work, and a spell was a day, it would only mean that they worked ten days in five months.  Who could be satisfied with a situation of <Col N="1052" /> that kind?  Yet the Minister supplies worthless statistics of that kind to the House as a supposed reason for resisting a reasonable motion of this kind. Then we had the further remarkable argument by the Minister that there was a certain, benefit in those 24,000 going back to register at the exchange because, he said, they would get preference even though they were cut off. Now, what are the facts of the situation? Before the Second Employment Period Order was made, that is in the week ended 30th May last, there were 97,000 persons registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges and seeking work there.  Of those 24,000 fell under the Second Employment Period Order.  That meant that 73,000 still survived with claims current at the exchange.  By reason of that fact the bulk of those 73,000 people were in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit, and consequently, under Government instructions, entitled to preference on any schemes of public works which were in operation locally.  What is the Minister suggesting to the 24,000 who fell?  Here it is: &ldquo;Go back and register, and even though there are another 73,000 people registered at the exchanges, you will get a preference.&rdquo;</P>

In order to get the number of men to do the job, the people concerned have to go over too wide an area.  That is the commonest complaint in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

I think any Deputy who represents a rural area in particular knows that in rural areas it is harder than ever to get work.  The statistics of the number of persons employed in agriculture between 1931 and 1937 show, in fact, that the number employed in agriculture was approximately 6,000 less in 1937 than in 1931.</P>

      <P>Let us get back to the point on which the Minister interrupted. He knows there were those 73,000 persons registered as unemployed, and to those persons cut off by this Order he says: &ldquo;Go back and register, even though you are deprived of benefit.&rdquo; He tells them that, even though he is saying to them: &ldquo;In fact, you can only get preference when every other man at the exchange who is drawing unemployment assistance benefit is provided for under the relief schemes.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows an unemployed man does not go back to register when he is deprived of benefit.  The unemployed man knows perfectly well from the everyday experience of life in those areas&mdash;our rural people have pretty rugged commonsense in those matters&mdash;that there is no use in going back to register at the exchange because he knows that there is no hope whatever of getting any employment at the exchange until such time as those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit are first provided for, and it very rarely happens that all those registered at the exchange and drawing benefit are ever provided for.  It is only when there is a famine of workers after those have been provided for that the man cut-off under this Order has ever a chance of getting placed on a relief scheme.  In any case, we know that during the summer periods there are very few relief schemes in operation, because the Board of Works keeps all its relief schemes to commence in October, November and during the winter months when there is no Employment Period Order current.  One of the reasons, a rather novel one, given by the Minister for making this Order applicable to rural areas was that a lot of those persons could work on their land or on their father's land.  The Minister acknowledged that those Orders applied to towns as well as to rural areas. What is the use, for example, in telling a single man in Kildare town or in Tullow&mdash;two substantial towns&mdash;to work on his father's farm?  His father might be dead. There is no farm.  His father might be living in a labourer's cottage.  His father might be a road worker.  To tell a man in Kildare town or in a town like Tullow that for five months <Col N="1055" /> of the year he must work on his father's farm is to ignore completely the facts of life in those places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a great treat for the House if the Minister would sing dumb even for a short time. The Minister is making this Order applicable not only in rural areas but in the small towns, and some of those towns are not so small when we consider the distribution of population in this country.  Towns like Kildare and Tullow are affected by the currency of this Order.  There is no use in telling the workers there to go out and work on the land, because they cannot get work on the land.  If a married man in those towns, in receipt of 12/- or 14/- a week unemployment assistance benefit, could get work on the land he would leave the exchange and get work on the land rather than try to exist on the low rates of unemployment assistance benefit, but that man remains static at the exchange during the currency of this Order in a great many cases.  How then can it be expected that a single man has some method of insinuating himself into employment during those five months when everybody knows that, in places like that, the town workers cannot find work on the land and do not work on <Col N="1056" /> the land?  In many cases they are forced to try to exist from year to year by means of relief schemes, and temporary employment on roads of one kind or another.  The Minister wants a practical suggestion.  I said that I thought it was unfair to issue an Order of this kind, without making inquiries as to whether work was available locally or not.  I suggest that if work was available the employment exchanges throughout the country would be aware of it.  If work is available those claiming benefit could be sent to potential employers, whose needs would be notified to the exchanges, and some of the applicants would be employed. If their services were not required by employers in the area, what is the insuperable difficulty about continuing benefit?  If work is available what is the difficulty about getting employers to notify the Department of the number of men they want?  When the employers' needs are satisfied, if there is a residue of single men, for whom no work is available, unemployment assistance should be continued to them. There is no difficulty in operating a system of that kind.  That is the kind of scheme that operates in towns and cities not affected by the Employment Order.  There is no difficulty about doing the same thing in rural areas. Notwithstanding the Minister's denial that this is an economy Order, I am satisfied that it is; the purpose being to get a large block of workers off unemployment assistance benefit over a substantial period of each year, so as to save money to the Exchequer. That is done without any regard to whether work is available in the areas affected or not.  I said that it was an unfair Order, that it is the cause of hardship and operates most unfairly in the case of single men in rural areas, and in substantial towns which have not urban status, or where town commissioners do not function.  Because I believe the Order is unfair, and not impartial in its operation, I ask the Dáil to pass the motion.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Blind Persons Act of 1920 provided for the payment of pensions to blind persons on attaining the age of 50.  This age qualification was reduced to 30 by Section 6 of the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932.  The 1920 Act, in addition to providing for the payment of pensions to blind persons, also made it compulsory on local authorities to arrange for the welfare of all blind persons ordinarily resident within their respective areas.  The arrangements, which are known as the blind welfare schemes, mainly took the form of monetary allowances to necessitous and unemployable blind persons living in their own homes.  In a minority of cases the allowance is paid by way of augmentation of the wages paid by the authorities of a blind institution to blind persons who perform certain kinds of work in the institution and who live at home.  In every case the allowance is increased if the recipient, as frequently happens, has dependent children.  As the law stands at present, all such allowances must be taken into account in full in calculating the means of a claimant for a pension even though a portion may be intended for the maintenance of his dependent children. The effect is that the welfare schemes cannot be fully utilised for the benefit of blind persons because the amount of pension is reduced in consequence of the children's allowances. Furthermore, there is an undesirable inequality in the treatment of claimants for pension who have children as compared <Col N="1059" /> with those who have not children. The Bill proposes to remedy this matter by providing for the exclusion in the calculation of means of any allowances paid by a local authority under a blind welfare scheme in respect of the dependent child or children.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 22, to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I consider that a salary of £10,000 is altogether excessive, having regard to the resources of this country and having regard to the population of the country.  We have to face the fact that this is a partitioned country and, being divided into two parts, and under two Governments, we have got two figure-heads holding positions somewhat similar and being paid for holding those positions.  We are here proposing to pay in this portion of the country over which our Government have control, a sum of £10,000 to a person to act as the figurehead of the State.  We have also to face the fact that the people in the Six Counties will be paying a somewhat similar sum for another figurehead.  I think this policy of setting up the head of the State who has very few useful functions to perform is an absolutely wrong policy.  To begin with, we have to face the difficulty which the people of this country have to meet in endeavouring to provide for the finances of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated here that the Government have no gold mine at their disposal.  It might be well to point out that neither has the taxpayer, <Col N="1061" /> and, before providing a sum which the average taxpayer will consider excessive, we are entitled to know for what purpose it is required.  We have been told that this very large and generous salary is necessary in order to provide for entertainment, the entertainment, I suppose, of visitors to this country, or distinguished citizens in the country&mdash;I do not know which.  If there is entertainment to be provided at the public expense, we are entitled to know who is to be entertained, why and how.</P>
    <P>A good deal of criticism has been directed against the Government during the past few years for distributing free beef and milk to the idle poor.  If this is a proposal, as it seems to be, to distribute not alone free beef and milk, but also free brandy, whiskey and champagne to the idle rich, it is not one of which I think the people of the country will approve.  It has been said that the distribution of free beef and milk has had a demoralising effect on the poor and the unemployed.  I do not know whether this new proposal will have a similar effect upon the people who will enjoy the benefit of this entertainment, but I leave that matter to the Minister's conscience.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any benefit to be derived from the expenditure of such an enormous sum on entertainment, and I cannot see from what source the plain people of this country can be expected to provide the money that is required. I may be told that this means a reduction of only £5,000 in the Estimate, but I know that in the country districts it requires a considerable amount of energy on the part of the Government and their servants to collect £5,000.  In my, own constituency I know that the flying squad have had to visit quite a large number of holdings in order to collect even £5,000.  They have had to travel over mountains and bogs, and they have visited many homes where they found nothing but poverty and destitution.  Here it is proposed to spend this enormous sum on a purpose which cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>In addition, we know that the provision of this money imposes a heavy burden upon working people, who have had their cost of living increased by taxation.  These people who have to <Col N="1062" /> pay higher prices for the necessaries of life will naturally ask why should we be taxed in order to provide entertainment for people who are regarded either as distinguished citizens or visitors.  I think the policy of the Government should be to exercise the most rigid control over expenditure of this kind, and for that reason I am suggesting that this amount should be reduced.  I think the State should err more on the side of economy than on the side of generosity.  The working people who want to get unemployment assistance or home help have to establish a very strong case, and we know there is very close supervision over the few miserable shillings distributed to the destitute.  There should be greater supervision over any benefits distributed under this measure for the entertainment of distinguished people, important or otherwise.</P>
    <P>We are told that international courtesies demand that visitors to this country should be entertained.  I do not know how far that goes.  I do not know whether it entails maintaining everybody who comes to this country and claim they are distinguished visitors &mdash;keeping them in luxury at the Viceregal Lodge.  I know that some time ago our Minister visited London on important business.  They went over, as we were told afterwards, to whip John Bull.  While they were on that business they stayed in hotels and, from reports in the public Press, they paid their bills when they were leaving.</P>
    <P>So that it does not appear that they were not entertained free of charge while in London.  Therefore, there does not appear to be any very strong case established for providing free entertainment at the Viceregal Lodge either for visitors from abroad or for any section of our own citizens.  Since there does not appear to be such a need for such elaborate entertainment there does not appear any reason why a salary of £10,000 should be provided for the President.  I think that in expressing this view I am expressing the view that was held by the Minister and by members of the present Government up to very recently.  Speaking in the Dáil on the 13th July, 1928, the Taoiseach stated in reference to the <Col N="1063" /> salary of the Governor-General, which was, I think, £10,000:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We think that it is ridiculous that this small country should be spending so much on two figure-heads, one in the north of the country and one in the south.  Between them they have a personal salary of £18,000, £3,000 more than the President of the United States gets.  The United States have about 117,000,000 of the richest people in the world. Their head is not a figure-head.  He is an active President and does his work as actively as any Prime Minister would do it and he is only getting from this huge population £15,000.  Look at this country with less than four and a half millions of people where you are paying two figure-heads the sum of £18,000.  I say it is wrong.  It does not induce the ordinary taxpayer to pay taxes. I put it to the Labour Party.  They will admit if they want social services carried out it will depend on the willingness of the ordinary taxpayer to pay his taxes to the State. Do you think it is going to make for willingness in that respect for them to see £3,000 more than is paid to the President of the United States paid to two figure-heads in this country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position that prevailed in 1928 and that was the way the present head of the Government looked at it.  I think it applies just as well at the present time and will apply as long as this country is divided into two separate States.  Apart from all that there is another aspect of this question which does not seem to have occurred to the members of the Government.  If any individual citizen is called on to provide or if he intends expending money upon any particular branch of his business or upon the improvement of his home or holding or anything of that kind the first thing he will ask is: &ldquo;Is this a permanent business?&rdquo; If a man is going to spend money on improving his house he will ask himself first of all: &ldquo;Am I going to live permanently in this house?&rdquo; The people of this country have a right to ask: &ldquo;Is this position <Col N="1064" /> of Presidency a permanent one?&rdquo; Is it one which is to endure and to continue? If it is not then the case for spending a very large amount of money on its establishment rests upon a very weak foundation.</P>
    <P>Anybody who considers the matter carefully will come to the conclusion that the presidential establishment is not one that is going to last, and it is not going to last for the simple reason that it has not a sound foundation to rest upon.  The President has no ordinary function to perform.  Neither is the system under which he is elected calculated to fit in with the duties he is called upon to perform.  As may be generally acknowledged, the duties and functions of the President in this country are to a large extent similar to the functions of a constitutional monarch in other countries.  There is this essential difference, however, that whereas a constitutional monarch is or may be a person of very little political talent, the person who is going to occupy the position of President in this country will be a person of outstanding political talent, because he has got to contest an all-Ireland election against opponents.  The man who is going to contest an election in this country for the Presidency and to secure election thereto, has got to be an outstanding politician with the vicious tendencies that characterise the politician in this country.  That man is not going to live in idleness when he gets power in his hands.  You will, therefore, have the position created in this country in which a terribly able politician will be placed in the Presidency and an equally able politician occupying the position of Taoiseach.  You will have created a State with two heads, a ship with two captains&mdash;a condition of affairs which cannot last except a short time.  There is certain to be a clash between these two forces because it is absolutely inevitable that the person who occupies the position of Taoiseach and the person who occupies the position of President are bound to clash.  On that account you have not got a position of stability. For that reason I believe that the Presidential establishment will be discontinued. All common sense people <Col N="1065" /> will demand its discontinuance even before there is need for another election for the Presidency.  We know the difficulties that arose and that had to be surmounted in order to avoid an election for the first President.</P>
    <P>Such a position cannot continue. Because it cannot continue, it is foolishness on the part of the people of Ireland to vote a large sum of money for an institution which is bound to collapse simply because it is built upon an unsound foundation. There is only one type of head of this State who is likely to remain permanent and to command the permanent support of the people.  That is the head of the State who is really exercising the functions of government. That is to say, the man who is head of the Executive Government, or, alternatively the person who occupies the position of Chief Justice.  Either of these two positions would be natural for the head of the State to occupy. The position of a limited monarch who has got to face difficulties that no constitutional monarch has got to face, who has to stand before an audience, will be a very different type of personage from any constitutional monarch in any country.  All that means that this position of Presidency cannot last, and because it cannot last it is foolish to vote money in any large sum providing for its establishment.  The case for reducing the amount allowed rests upon two grounds.  First, the inability of the people of this country to pay such a large sum, and in the next place the disadvantage which it would mean to burden the people and the difficulties which it would place in the collection of revenues.  Together with that, there is the amount of discontent it would create amongst the taxpayers generally.</P>
    <P>In addition you have the fact that no useful national advantage will be derived from the expenditure of this money.  It will simply mean providing entertainment for a new type of aristocracy which will be attracted to the Viceregal Lodge.  No benefit will be conferred on the taxpayer, and, in addition, no useful national advantage will be derived, as I have said.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  The speech to which we have just listened, dealing as it did with the functions of the President and the disadvantages of the present system as compared with the advantages of an alternative system, would all be very interesting if it had been delivered 18 months ago in this House; but the fact of the matter is that since then the Constitution has been given effect to, and has been accepted, I think, by all Parties in the State. The only thing for us, therefore, is to implement the provisions of the Constitution and to put into effect the recommendations of the committee which was set up to consider what provision properly should be made for the maintenance of the Presidential office.  Not merely was the Constitution before the people, but the report of the committee dealing with this matter was published, I think, last November, and has been before the people since then.  I think I may venture to say that the recommendations of the committee, at any rate in regard to the office of the Presidency, have met with almost universal acceptance. In view of that fact, I do not see that there is any reason why, in regard to the figures mentioned in this first section of the Bill, we should do anything else but give effect to the recommendations of the committee which are supported, I think, by all Parties in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Cogan supporting his amendment, and I frankly admit that I was anything but convinced.  The mere form in which he presented his case showed a lack of belief in his own amendment. In so far as his speech dealt with the office of President, it dealt with points such as whether we should have or should not have a President, and, if we had a President, whether the duties concerned could not be combined with the duties of Taoiseach or of Chief Justice.  Now, there might or might not be a certain amount in that, but, rightly or wrongly, those points were decided long ago by the Dáil and subsequently met with the approval of the people.  That having being done, <Col N="1067" /> irrespective of what any of our views might have been with regard to the necessity or the desirability of this office, the office has been created; it is the law of the land, and the only reason that has any of us here is to make laws in the hope that, when they are made, they will be respected.  That side of the question does not arise now.  What does arise now is, when the office is legally established, when a head of the State has been legally appointed by the Dáil, by the people, and by the representatives of the people, whether we will then place that individual and his office in a position of high dignity or otherwise.  That is the question.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's case was half an argument against the office, and the other half an argument against giving any money with the office. There would be some justification if his amendment were to the effect that no salary should be paid and no allowances made, but in so far as the case made was against any expenditure in the office, though having subscribed to the expenditure to a degree, then it was inconsistent to start to argue that there should be no expenditure whatsoever in connection with the office.  The Deputy put a question as to what type of entertainment it was designed to carry out. Well, nations, just as individuals, have got to be guided by and have got to learn the lesson and follow the example established by tradition, custom, and precedent.  We may be only a small nation, but we are a mother race and a motherland, and we are in a position to have an influence in this world far and above our strength or our wealth.  This is a spot that attracts visitors from all points of the world and from the greatest countries in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have established&mdash;and I believe deservedly so&mdash;a reputation in the past for courtesy, kindliness, and hospitality. That reputation has been established by the individual in the house or in the hamlet.  It would be acting untruly to our traditions if, as a State, we were to trample on the customs and the traditions built up by the people themselves.  Now, with regard to the <Col N="1068" /> amount of money asked for here, any of us can make a political speech with regard to taxpayers and taxes, but the amount of money asked for to maintain this headship of the State and all the expenses associated with that office to entertain visitors on behalf of the whole lot of us&mdash;the amount of contribution that is required for that would be 3d. per farmer per year, or 1d. per taxpayer per year.  Now, I believe that there is not a taxpayer in the whole of Ireland mean-spirited enough or sufficiently poor-spirited to begrudge a penny per annum in order to uphold the dignity of this old land of ours and in order to ensure that within the world community of nations we would never have to bow our heads as a mean-spirited country in returning the hospitality which we receive from others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, Sir, it is provided that &ldquo;the emoluments and allowances to be received by the President in pursuance of Section 11 of Article 12 of the Constitution shall be at the rate of £10,000 per annum, whereof £5,000 shall be the personal remuneration of the President.&rdquo;  I do not think we had from the Minister for Finance any indication as to what the allowances were intended to cover. This section is somewhat related to Section 2, which provides that &ldquo;it shall be lawful for the Minister for Finance, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to provide and maintain for the President an official residence, to defray the expenses of the office establishment of the secretary to the President, and to provide for the President such facilities and services, and such other things, as the Minister shall from time to time determine to be necessary or proper.&rdquo;  I should like to know what is it intended that the President should provide out of the personal salary of £5,000, and what out of the allowance of £5,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Is it intended that the cost of any personal services, such as wages or salaries of domestic or clerical staffs, should be provided for out of either, and what are the commitments of the State under Section 2?  We ought to know what is the gross total of our expenditure on this office.  If the State were to provide for the President anything like the services formerly provided&mdash;unnecessarily, I think&mdash;for the ex-Governor-General, the total bill would be quite a considerable one.  I want to know whether any portion of the responsibility for meeting expenditure on that former grandiose scale is now going to devolve upon the person who is to get £10,000 under Section 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the sub-section, so far as the element of personal remuneration is concerned, is quite clear.  That would be in the nature of a Presidential salary, a salary which attaches to the office, and which would be subject to income-tax.  The net amount, after deduction of tax, which the President will receive, will be considerably below £4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>About £3,000.  A little more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say exactly how much.  It may depend on other considerations.  The other £5,000 is intended to defray the cost of running what may be described as the domestic and general side of that establishment, including chaplain, housekeeper and all the other staff and domestic servants; maintenance of the President's car; a certain allowance towards entertainment, the sort of entertainment which he would find personally unavoidable because of the fact that he occupies the Presidential office; the cost of dress allowance for the staff; and to provide generally for certain other contingencies that may be expected to arise. That is so far as the £5,000 is concerned. The services which are to be provided under Section 2 are mainly those which were dealt with when the Estimate for what was described as the President's Establishment was before the House, that is to say, the secretariat of the President.  That part of the secretariat which is of a Civil Service nature will be defrayed mainly <Col N="1070" /> out of the moneys to be voted by the Dáil from year to year under Section 2.  As I have said, it is not possible at this stage to give any firm idea as to what they will amount to.  As the Deputy will understand, we have to be guided by experience, but the one thing which we are bound to do under the Constitution is to fix a certain sum which will be regarded as emoluments.  That is dealt with in Section 1.  The variable expenses of the establishment, which, of course, will be determined actually by the part which the President plays in the enactment of legislation and in certain other aspects of our public life, will possibly fall to be met in some part at any rate under Section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the report of the committee which dealt with the matter of Ministerial and other salaries, the type of expenditure which was met out of moneys annually voted by the Oireachtas for the Governor-General's establishment was set out in Appendix 7, page 47.  It was there indicated that a variety of expenses&mdash;such as the salaries of the controller of the household, chaplain, private secretary, clerk to comptroller, typists, telephonists, allowances of two aides-de-camp, and insurance contributions&mdash;amounting in all to £1,825, were met out of a provision made by the State, apart from the personal salary which the Governor-General then received.  Is it intended that the State should bear those services so far as they are necessary under Section 2 of this Bill, or will any portion of this expenditure be met by the President out of the allowance of £5,000?</P>

In addition to that, some part of the cost of dressing certain members of that staff&mdash;whatever the dress allowance may be&mdash;the cost of running the Presidential motor cars and various other contingencies, incidental expenses which are bound to arise, will all be <Col N="1071" /> borne on the £5,000.  The salary of the secretary to the President, that is the Civil Service head of the secretariat, and the Civil Service salaries generally, will be borne out of moneys provided under Section 2 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On Section 2, would the Minister say what is the estimated cost to the State of the provision to be made under this section?  Is it going to bring the total expenditure up to £15,000 a year or £20,000?  Can we get any idea as to the cost?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the exact figure at the moment.  The Deputy will remember that an Estimate of, I think, £4,000, which included £1,200 as a provision for motor cars, was before the Dáil.  That roughly &mdash;plus any additional cost for the maintenance of the grounds and so on, which may be necessitated by the fact that the Presidential residence is now occupied &mdash; represents the total amount which will be provided out of voted moneys.  I have not got the exact figure, but the Deputy will remember that there was an Estimate of £4,000 odd, and from my recollection £1,200 of that was for the purchase of motor cars.  There was a certain other item for official travelling expenses, which was more or less a token, and may not be used at all. Whether it is used will depend on the number of functions which <Col N="1072" /> the President is asked to attend in other parts of the country during the year and to which he may have to travel in a certain amount of state.  That was also included.  If you deduct, roughly, £1,400 to £1,500 from the amount of the last Estimate, you will get the cost of the Presidential secretariat as distinct from the Presidential establishment.  In addition to that, certain extra expenditure will be necessitated by reason of the fact that the residence is now occupied, over and above what is necessary when the residence is not occupied.  The principal expenditure, I may say, is in respect of the grounds and the garden, and that is practically the same irrespective of whether the residence is occupied or unoccupied, because the gardens and all those other things have been maintained and would, I anticipate, continue to be maintained even if the house were completely closed.  There will arise certain items also for the maintenance of the structure, other elements of wear and tear, and lighting and heating, particularly of the State apartments.  I have the Vote now for the Deputy.  The Vote was for £4,048, of which there were incidental expenses, £100, and telegrams and telephones&mdash; all official&mdash;£500.  It is not anticipated that that amount will all be spent, but a large margin has been provided for contingencies.  There is also £1,200 for the purchase of motor cars.  The total cost of the Civil Service secretariat, excluding those items, is £2,148.  As I said, that amount, plus the cost of maintaining the occupied residence, will make up the full total.</P>

      <P>What is the estimated cost of maintaining the residence?  It cost the State a considerable sum when formerly a Governor-General was in residence there.  Appendix VII, page 47 shows that aides-de-camp cost £749; rates, £565; stationery, etc., £120; post office, £65.  The maintenance of premises and gardens, fuel, light, furniture and cleaning cost £9,350. Under that roof alone £10,849 was spent.  Is it intended that the expenses will resemble the previous figures?  Are fuel and light to be paid for out of the President's allowance or salary, or is the State going to pay for them?</P>

      <P>The place will be heated and lighted for him.  I do not know if the provision was actually spent in the financial year.  I believe that in no year, so far as I recall, did the total expenditure for fuel, the gardens and grounds, amount to more than £6,000.  That is my recollection. I know that when the place was unoccupied the cost of maintaining it was £3,000.  Since the last Governor-General was there, certain arrangements have been made with regard to the gardens which will, we hope, reduce the cost of upkeep.  Some of them have been let and it is not the present intention to reverse that policy.  They will continue to be let until we see what the cost may be.  It may be taken that the net cost actually arising of the occupation of the residence will not be much more than £3,500.</P>

      <P>I should like if the Minister for Finance could give us some assurance on this question, apart altogether from the odd few thousand pounds additional that the upkeep of the President's establishment may entail.  It has been suggested that a new residence of a cheaper kind is going to be built for the President.  I ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that nothing like that will be done until after the passage of three or four years, so that we may really see the new office of the President and his establishment in their proper perspective. A very considerable amount of effort, as well as a considerable amount of money, both State money and private money, has been spent, as well as losses to individuals, in order to destroy the authority of democratic institutions that we have here.  This office of President is, as it were, the last improvement, or the last want in the institutions set up here as long ago as 1922, that it was claimed would make them truly democratic.  A great deal may be said for or against that.  But <Col N="1074" /> that case has been made, and when we got the position of President passed by this House and by the country, by putting the key-stone to our democratic institutions in setting up that office, we should not begin to patch, to chip and to chop in a way that is going to prevent us finding out whether the office is going to make for a gracing and strengthening of our democratic institutions. Do not, within the first one, two or three years of the institution of the office of President, demolish that by building a small residence for him within view of the present building, so that we will have our principal State building like a new housing scheme alongside a demolished workhouse. Something has been said about the exorbitant amount of money paid as salary to the President, and the excessive amount of money required to keep the place running.  I do not believe that matters, because most of the money is going to go in employment. When we consider the amount of money spent in all kinds of ways, in the development of a scrap of employment here, and a scrap of employment there, the number of people employed, and the number leaving the country, we may very well afford to have some of them engaged in keeping the Presidential grounds in order, giving an odd coat of paint to some of the windows&mdash;and some of them want it badly&mdash;or papering the walls, which badly want papering after the period during which the premises were unoccupied.  I do not want to develop that side of the matter, but I ask the Minister, in spite of what has been said with regard to the buildings and the premises, to give an assurance that the President is going to be allowed to occupy them for a reasonable number of years, so that we may judge if the residence he is occupying is being kept in a dignified and a stately way.  Deputy Norton cannot have it both ways.  I plead that the grounds should not be divided up and let to an odd market gardener here and an odd market gardener there.  If the President, as an institution, is worth keeping, it is well worth keeping in a dignified and stately way, and it is worth while keeping the gardens by giving employment, if only to bedeck <Col N="1075" /> the place.  If the vegetables increase too much, they can be disposed of by any Government Department, even by marketing, and if a few heads of cabbage, a few potatoes, onions or tomatoes affect the agricultural position, let them be given to some charitable institution, of which we have many.  My main plea is that the residence, which the President occupies, should be kept up in a dignified and an effective way, and that we should not look at what the cost would be, until we had an opportunity of seeing what the value of the Presidential establishment was going to be, politically or otherwise, to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Minister should, at this stage, issue a statement on behalf of the Government, that this residence is going to be used by the occupant of the Presidential office for a reasonable period of years.  The Minister knows that statements have been circulated in the newspapers to the effect that a small residence is to be provided later on. This question has a very important bearing on the answer given to Deputy Norton, on the question of the upkeep of the Presidential establishment, and also, I suggest, has a very important bearing on the figure to be set aside for the personal remuneration of the President.  I notice in the report of the commission that, when dealing with the question of personal remuneration, they say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The amount of the personal salary to be provided for the holder of that office should, in our view, be related to the probable nature of the establishment, and the style of living which the holder will be expected to maintain.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A word on that matter from the Minister would be a useful guide for those of us in the future who would have to defend what is now being done by the terms of this Bill.  I am not grumbling at the amount set aside for allowances, because I assume, and hope, that the amount set aside under that head will be spent in the most useful way possible, but I have a strong personal objection to such a high figure being set aside for personal <Col N="1076" /> remuneration unless it is made very clear by the Minister what kind of establishment is going to be maintained by the President, and that to that extent, at any rate, this Bill will conform to the wishes of a majority of the members of this commission who reported to the Minister on the matter. I, personally, strongly object to even the President of this State getting a higher rate of personal remuneration than, say, the Taoiseach or the Chief Justice.  The Minister has pointed out that the amount of £5,000 is subject to income-tax.  So is the salary of the Taoiseach.  So, I presume, is the salary of the Chief Justice.  I do not think that the President of this country, either now or in the future, no matter who that person may be, will have duties to perform half as onerous as the Taoiseach of the future or the Chief Justice of the future.  Salary, or personal remuneration, as it is described in this case, should have some reference to the service rendered by the individual who is going to be paid by the taxpayers.  That is a personal point of view, but I would strongly urge and press the Minister&mdash;and we are entitled to press the Minister&mdash;at this stage as to whether it is intended that the present occupant of the position of President will reside at the Viceregal Lodge for a reasonable period or whether, as reported and stated elsewhere, it is intended at a later date, less than seven years at any rate, to set up a Presidential establishment on a smaller scale elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I would just like to say that there is no man in this House nor in Ireland less disposed to speak disparagingly of what our President should have than I am; but listening to all the talk, and especially from Deputy O'Higgins, about maintaining the dignity and honour of the country, I want to say that these are trifles light as air if we have not with them at the same time a fair share of comfort, contentment and happiness among the masses of the people.  I am not agreeable that the President should have £5,000 while the Taoiseach has a lesser salary.  We were reminded by the Minister in his opening statements that the Chief Justice had £4,000 a <Col N="1077" /> year.  One thing strikes me in all the speeches&mdash;a lack of that sense of reality about the whole thing.  Do we realise that the country could do without a Chief Justice?  I submit that the country could also do without a President, but you cannot or could not do without those who produce and prepare the food and other necessaries of the nation.  I say there is a great lack of a sense of reality about the whole of this discussion.  I am not agreeable that the President should have £5,000 a year and, furthermore, I am not satisfied that that office is not going to cost more than £15,000 a year, and that we will see further about it later on.</P>

Attacks were repeatedly made against this office in the past and yet it was generally recognised that the President of the State was able to uphold the dignity and exercise that hospitality to representatives of other countries, that such an office demanded. I think it would be very much lowering the dignity of this country were we not to have a President of the State exercising that dignity in his office and extending that hospitality and performing the various functions that are associated with such an office. If we are not to go back to a system of almost savagery, I think we will have to have certain degrees of office and I for one strongly support the proposal.</P>

      <P>I would just like to say that I concur fully with what Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Brooke Brasier have said; and only that I do not wish to occupy the time of the House I would dwell on that possibly a little longer.  With regard to the point Deputy Mulcahy has raised as to the period during which the present residence will be occupied, I desire to <Col N="1078" /> say that, even from the point of view of the occupant, that residence is not altogether an ideal one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was built a long time ago.  The main portion of it was built a long time ago.  Then there were various annexes added and it is not the most convenient residence possible. In addition the fabric itself is not of the soundest.  A great deal of the fabric, I understand, may be due for renewal within the next ten or 15 years. However, I can reassure the Deputy on this point: the present intention is not to pull down the existing building but to do as he has suggested, that is, to allow an experimental period to elapse and then to see whether another structure might not be more suitable. I can assure the Deputy that, as far as I personally am concerned and my colleagues, we are all very anxious to ensure that the official residence which is to be provided under the Constitution will be one which will be worthy of our people.  I take the point of view that a certain amount of symbolism enters into all this thing. People associate a graceful, tasteful residence with certain official positions, and if a person is called to the headship of this State then I think nobody would grudge anything within reason which would befit that office.  I think that we are not unreasonable in any proposals that are now before the House in this Bill.  We have in fact kept the figures.  I personally think, on the low side, the reason being that there is a constitutional bar against any reduction, while on the other hand we do not want to make what may be excessive provision at the outset.  But it may happen that as this office establishes itself in the hearts of the people, and as we all come to rally round it as the keystone of our State and as the central focus of our national life, we may desire to attach a little more ceremony to it.  I think we would be making a great mistake if we believed the Irish people have not a regard for ceremony and pageantry. They have.  You have only to go to some of our football matches and see how it breaks out there as the teams march in procession around the field. We are not that sort of race which does not find anything in nature <Col N="1079" /> to delight the eye or the other senses. We have an artistic temperament and I am perfectly certain, if we left it to the voice of the people and if we were to put it to the vote of the people to say how this residence would be maintained, they would all say that our country and our State should have a symbol which would be worthy of our past.</P>

Under Section 1 we are going to pay £10,000, £5,000 personal salary and £5,000 for allowances.  Now we have a supplementary Estimate of £4,048.  I want to know how much it is going to cost the State to provide for the maintenance of certain services which were formerly provided for a Governor-General, namely, the maintenance of the premises and gardens, furniture, fuel, light and cleaning.  Are all those services going to cost £10,000?</P>

      <P>Most citizens in the country have to find out before hand how much they have to spend in the year and what provision they have to make for their sustenance and the maintenance of their household.  Surely it is not unreasonable for a Legislative House such as this to ask what it is going to cost the general taxpayer to maintain the residence for 12 months, bearing in mind that there is to be a <Col N="1080" /> statutory provision for £10,000.  How much more is it going to cost in order to provide for this establishment?  Are we going to spend another £10,000 under Section 2, or £15,000?  When everybody has finished talking about the tinsel of office, it might be well to get down to hard tacks.  Deputy Brasier talked about going back to savagery unless we spend £10,000 on this building.</P>

The Deputy talks about going back to savagery unless we write cheques every day in the week for the upkeep of this place.  What is the total cost going to be?  We know of £10,000 and another £4,000, but how much more are we going to spend on the maintenance of the establishment, providing furniture, fuel, light, cleaning, etc.?  These are all questions which ought to be answered.  We got that information on other matters and we got estimates of expenditure on other matters.  Why not on this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct to say that the estimate you get, as Deputy Norton knows, with regard to any service or establishment, is rarely contained in a Bill which lays down the rate or the figure for all time or for a number of years.  The estimate you get with regard to any State establishment is a year to year estimate. If any of those estimates were submitted to the Dáil without even a month's working experience, then that estimate would be, to say the least of it, rather misleading.  The points made by Deputy Norton are points that were considered by the commission.  The commission endeavoured to get such evidence as they could on these points. They came to the conclusion that it was unreasonable to expect anything like a cut and dried estimate with regard to the running expenses of an establishment that was not yet in being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that under this particular heading an estimate will be submitted <Col N="1081" /> from year to year and that within nine or ten months we will be through the estimates dealing with the figure or series of figures put up to us.  Criticism or observation with regard to the cost of the establishment could very well wait until we have had nine months' experience of working.  That would be a fairly reasonable standard to accept with regard to the working for future years.</P>
    <P>We were all concerned on this point, but we were convinced&mdash;and I think it is mentioned in some portion of that report&mdash;that this type of expenditure, in the early stages at least, should only be taken in hops from year to year until we saw what would be a reasonable figure for the establishment and then we could deal with it in the ordinary course of events through a yearly estimate.  I think that is referred to in the report, but I am only speaking from memory.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins seems to be anxious and appears to be in a position to make a more convincing case for the passage of the Bill than the Minister has attempted to make. I would respectfully point out to Deputy O'Higgins and the Minister that this report was submitted on the 16th December, 1937, and there must have been a good deal of consideration given to the whole question of the cost of the Presidential establishment between the date the report was received and the present time.  I would again lay particular stress on the section of the report which Deputy O'Higgins, I am sure, is supporting. It says that the amount of the personal salary provided for the holder of the establishment should be related to the probable nature of the establishment and the style of living which the holder will be expected to maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill proposing that certain emoluments and remuneration will be paid to the future and present occupant of the Presidency.  That section of the report must have been carefully considered.  The Minister went a little bit further in his last statement when he said that the occupant of the Presidential post will keep the present establishment for an experimental <Col N="1082" /> period.  He did not even go as far as Deputy O'Higgins went.  He did not say that it would be for nine months or 12 months or for seven years.  Is the present occupant going to occupy the Viceregal Lodge, in view of the cost of its upkeep, during his lifetime, or will provision be made that he will live there for seven years?  Is this experimental period going to last one year or seven years?</P>

If he is going to live there we can all have some idea, from the cost incurred in the past, as to what the future cost will be.  If he is going to live there only for a year or two, and get a smaller establishment, as has been mentioned, the emoluments, allowances and personal remuneration would have to have some relation to the upkeep of the smaller establishment, if there is going to be one.  The Minister should be more precise and give more information, especially in view of the fact that he has the report in his possession since the 16th December.</P>

      <P>I gathered first from Deputy Davin that he was concerned that the present Presidential residence should not be vacated too hurriedly and that he rather took the view of Deputy Mulcahy, that it ought to be kept for a number of years.  I am not so certain that that was Deputy <Col N="1083" /> Norton's view.  I am not certain yet what Deputy Norton's views are in regard to the Bill.  When Deputy Davin spoke last he seemed to take it for granted that the occupation would be only for the period of one year.  I said nothing which would justify him making such an assumption. I did say that I felt that the question of the vacation of the Presidential residence and its replacement by a more modern structure would not arise for some years.</P>
      <P>I think it would take a considerable time, even if it had been decided that the residence would not be vacated for a number of years.  I said that it was neither convenient nor comfortable for the occupant.  Structurally, it is not the soundest, and because of that fact we may be compelled to consider proposals for a new residence altogether. However, that matter is very much in abeyance, and I can assure Deputy Mulcahy that it seems to me as if the present residence is going to be occupied for a number of years.</P>

In recommending the Second Reading of this Bill to the House, the Minister for Finance spent a good deal of time paying a tribute to the care with which the committee dealt with this question of Ministers' salaries and pensions.  He praised the great care they bestowed on the task allotted to them.  The committee who <Col N="1084" /> dealt with that matter with meticulous care and with the scrupulous desire to be fair, recommended, so far as the majority are concerned, that a pension of £1,200 a year should be paid only if the President held office for seven years.  Now we find a Bill presented to us which makes it possible to pay a pension of £1,200 per annum to a President who may not have served in the office of President for a week.  Speaking here on a former occasion, I quoted a case where it was possible for the President to be appointed on Monday, have a row with the Government on Tuesday, resign on Wednesday, and on Thursday make an application for a pension of £1,200 provided here under Section 3.  He would be legally entitled to claim it.  This may appear to be an extraordinary case, but why should we draft a section in such a loose way that it is possible for any person to do this.</P>
    <P>Some of the most eccentric things in history have been done not by workingmen but by holders of high offices.  We might well have a situation developed where a person might be appointed a President and after serving for six months or a year, begin to dislike the task and clear out.  Does the Legislature intend to give a pension of £1,200 under these circumstances? I do not think it should.  We are providing a salary of £5,000 for the President, an allowance of another £5,000, and we are spending £10,000 in maintaining his residence, providing fuel, light and various other things, so as to equip it for him.  I think it is not unreasonable to say to the President that if he is to get a pension of £1,200 a year he ought to stay in office for at least seven years.  He should not expect to resign from office and get a pension of £1,200 for anything less than seven years' service.  Yet that is the minimum which this amendment seeks that the President should serve before being entitled to a pension. As the section is drafted, it is possible for him to get out after a year's or a month's or a day's service. To avoid the possibility of that occurring, the amendment recommends a minimum of seven years.  I think we should close the loophole that is in the Bill by its insertion.</P>

      <P>Providing a pension for this position is really absurd.  Any citizen who has the ability, the intelligence, or the political talent to attain to this position of Presidency is well able to look after himself.  It is possible for a citizen to attain this position at a very early age, and for the remainder of his life, after serving, say, perhaps, seven years, draw this pension.  That is absolutely absurd. This country is developing into an island of politicians and pensioners.  In a very short time there will be nobody in this country who is not in receipt of a pension, and we will have sitting on the benches here almost a complete Party of ex-Presidents, all drawing pensions.  We ought to face up to the fact that the position of President can only be attained through an all-Ireland contested election.  Having regard to the fact that it is only a man of outstanding political ability who can succeed in out-classing and out-distancing all his rivals in getting to the Viceregal Lodge, can we not realise that a man of that type is quite well able, when his term of office expires, to take care of himself?  He is not likely to become destitute.  If he is destitute, notwithstanding his extraordinary talent, it will be shown that it will be through some moral defect in his own character.  A pension of £1,200 a year will not prevent that type of man from being destitute, because it will be possible that he will be the sort of man who does not know how to keep money. This position can only be attained by a man who may be anything from a thimble-rigger to an archangel.  He certainly will not be a fool, and since he will not be a fool he will be quite capable of taking care of himself without inflicting a burden on the people to provide him with a huge pension.</P>

      <P>I hope, even though we have to refer to the Presidential office, that we will keep clearly in mind what the office is.  It represents the headship of this State.  Whoever is called to it will be chosen by the people, whether by agreement, as in the case of the present President, or by election.  At any rate, he will be taken as a person whom the majority of the people of this country <Col N="1086" /> regard as worthy.  The people of this country will not choose a thimble-rigger. There ought to be some sort of bridle upon our tongues when referring to the prospective occupants of this office.  I believe that whoever is chosen will be a worthy man and a worthy citizen.  As to what his position may be when he leaves office, we must remember that he will possibly be chosen for those qualities which do not enable a person to acquire a great deal of worldly goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people who may be called to that office will be called to it because they had devoted more attention to public concerns and to the concerns of the people, of the nation than to their own personal concerns.  Moreover, so long as they are in the Presidency they will not be able to attend to their own personal concerns.  I think, therefore, that it will be found that when they leave that office they will be much more likely to be poorer than when they entered upon the office.  I cannot conceive how anybody will leave that office better off than he was when taking up the office.  I cannot conceive of any honest man leaving such an office better off than when he came into it.  And I certainly think that anybody who has once occupied that office would not be the best fitted to go out again in ordinary industrial and commercial competition to try to secure for himself a competence.  It must be remembered that he will have been in a position in which he will have been divorced from professional or commercial life, from everything pertaining to business life.  While in the office, he will have cut professional ties and will be expected to cut them because, in that office, he has on occasions very great powers.  The Deputy may not be aware of that fact, but under the Constitution the President has almost the power, in certain circumstances, of turning out the Government. It certainly would be very desirable, therefore, from the public point of view, that the person occupying that office should be above all suspicion of acting, in any occasion, in his personal capacity, or that he might be serving a private interest.  Therefore, <Col N="1087" /> as I say, he would have to divorce himself from all his preceding occupations, and having served the State for seven years, or for 14 years, as might be the case, he is likely to go out of office unfitted to take up the threads of ordinary professional or commercial life again.  Surely, then, there is an obligation on us people who take a man up, who lift him up and put him on a pinnacle among us, to see that when his term of office expires his private personal circumstances will not be a matter on which we can reproach ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is because the committee and the Government realise that these are the conditions which are likely to exist that we have decided that, as a right, a person who is once called upon to be President of this State will be safeguarded against what would be the almost inevitable consequences to himself of having occupied that office.  It is only right that, at any rate, when we take him up and make him head of our people, his future will be secured and that he will be able to move among us in fairly easy circumstances, in circumstances which I hope and anticipate will enable him to devote a great deal of attention to public concerns of a non-party nature, and which will enable him to serve the State in the capacity of an elder statesman, in the same way as people elsewhere have been able to avail of the services of men who have held exalted positions and who, in that capacity, have rendered great service indeed to their respective countries in periods when their peoples have been under great stress and strain.  That is the sort of person we want for this office, and that is the sort of position that we want our ex-Presidents to occupy here. I do not for one moment believe that the President's usefulness to this country will cease when he has laid down the office of President.  I feel that, among us, there are many matters to which in other countries persons of means devote their attention, matters to which here, unfortunately, for one reason or another, we do not find people in a position to give attention in a non-party or non-partisan way.  In regard to such matters, as I say, ex-Presidents of this country would be able <Col N="1088" /> to render great service to this nation, and that is one reason, apart from our obligations in the matter, why it would be in the interests of this country to ensure that our ex-Presidents would be able to serve us in the way I have tried to suggest.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the point to which Deputy Norton's amendment relates, we have considered this matter very carefully.  I think that, in regard to the particular implications of this section, we might possibly be in a better position to appreciate them than the majority of the members of the committee.  One thing that is clear is that the President is to have a particular responsibility in regard to the Constitution, and on occasions he may have to take action which would be at variance with the wishes of the Government of the day.  It is, in my view, of the first importance that, in regard to his Presidential functions, the President should be put in a position &mdash; particularly in connection with those functions which put on him the obligation of a personal decision &mdash; of the greatest possible independence, financial and otherwise, and that accordingly, even though it might involve a situation of the sort that a President would be elected by the people and that then, within a comparatively short time, he should feel compelled because of some constitutional position to resign his office, he should be able to do that in the knowledge that, at any rate, he would not have to leave in circumstances which, in view of the fact that he occupied an exalted position, would be comparatively humiliating to him. For that reason, accordingly, I feel that he ought to be in a position where he could exercise his individual judgment in the freest possible way.</P>
    <P>Take the case which Deputy Norton has put before the House.  He has suggested that a President might be elected and, within a comparatively short period, decide to resign office.  I assume that if he had resigned because of some physical or mental incapacity we would all feel that there was an obligation on the State to provide for him.  He would have broken down in our service, and accordingly, so far as the question of his mental or physical incapacity was concerned, I feel that <Col N="1089" /> there could not be much difference of opinion.  I think that the only point on which there might be difference of opinion would be where the President, although in possession of all his faculties and in good health, felt compelled to resign.  Now, what would be the kind of issue that would make a man, who was fitted to be our President, resign?  Remember, underlying the whole Constitution, and underlying the proposals of this Bill, there must always run the assumption that the person who is elected as President is fitted to occupy that office&mdash;fitted by character, fitted by talent, fitted by capacity and fitted, above everything else, in his desire to serve the people. What, then, would be the kind of thing that would make such a man resign his office?  Surely, a person of that type, once he is elected President, will not want to resign or to relinquish that office, and will not relinquish that office, in mere pique?  He will want to continue in an office which reflects " &gt;great dignity on him.  He will want to maintain that office in a dignified way, and I certainly do think that no person who is fit to be head of our State is going to resign that office, as Deputy Norton has suggested, in mere pique, nor do I think that, if the issue is ever put to the people, they are going to choose and to elect as their President a person who is unfit for or unworthy of that office.  I think that is the assumption on which we must proceed in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>Here we have an office filled by a worthy person, and we find that a situation arises in which he is compelled to resign.  What is that situation likely to be?  It is surely going to be a difference of opinion upon a matter of great constitutional moment to the people of this country&mdash;something so grave that he feels that in order that they may have an opportunity of taking a decision on it he must divest himself of the honours which they have placed upon him&mdash;that he must relinquish this high office to which they have called him in order that the Irish people may have an opportunity of pronouncing upon this difference which has arisen between him, on the one hand, as the guardian of the Constitution, and the <Col N="1090" /> Government, on the other hand, as the Executive of the day.</P>
    <P>Surely that is the one thing against which a democratic State ought to put no barrier, surely if there is one thing about which we ought to be concerned to see that the provisions of the Constitution are given the fullest possible effect to, it is an issue of that sort.  Therefore, we should not&mdash;and it is what has really compelled the Government to come to the conclusion which it has embodied in this Bill&mdash;put any deterrent in the way of a President who feels that he must resign upon a constitutional issue of high moment, and allow the people, who under the Constitution are the masters, to decide the issue for themselves. It is for that reason that I, at any rate, would feel very strongly that there should be no qualifying period attached to this pension.  I believe that in practice the position will remain the same; that in practice we shall get a President who will serve the full term of office, because I feel that the Government on the one hand and the President on the other will be concerned to give full effect to the provisions of the Constitution.  But supposing a constitutional conflict should arise between those two powers, the President on the one hand and the Executive of the day on the other, and that it can only be resolved by the people, we should certainly put no barrier in the way of a President who feels that the Government proposes to do something which he regards as so contrary to the Constitution that the people should have a voice in it.  I think that instead of deterring the President from doing his duty to the people we ought to encourage him, and certainly we should not, by putting a qualifying period in the Bill, make it even superficially more difficult for the President to do what he would consider to be right and fair.</P>

      <P>The Minister is trying to work off fairy stories on us in regard to this Bill, and this bogey-man role which he has adopted in this matter is entirely on a par with all the dignity which he is seeking to weave around this office.  We had a committee, to which the Minister paid great tribute <Col N="1091" /> in the beginning, considering this matter.  Finally, the majority of the members of the committee agreed that after holding office for seven years the President should be eligible for a pension of £1,200 a year.  Other members thought he should hold office for 14 years before he got it, and I am not sure that some of them did not think he ought to get none at all.  That committee considered all the matters to which the Minister has just adverted. It was only after they had given the matter very careful consideration that they prescribed that the President should serve a period of seven years before being entitled to a pension.  I know nobody else in this country who can get a pension of £1,200 a year after seven years' service.  Yet, we propose to give the President a pension of £1,200 after probably seven days' service. Why should we do it in connection with the President?  After all, we ought not to elevate the President so high that his conditions of life bear no relation to the conditions of life of our people.  That is what we are doing in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the person who is likely to hold office must be ensured against the possibility of losing financially if there is disagreement with the Government.  That is a case against the appointment of any President having a dual authority and responsibility to the people.  That was one of the fears expressed when discussing the Constitution, and that is one of the fears which arise out of the present crazy method of electing the President.  We give him functions comparable to those of the French President, and we allow him to be elected in the hurly-burly manner in which the American President is elected.  That was a complication which we foresaw when we were discussing the Constitution, but it is not an argument against saying to the President: &ldquo;If you serve seven years you will get a pension of £1,200 per year.&rdquo;  If this office of President is going to give us the type of person who will not exercise his judgment in the manner that his conscience dictates because of fears that he may lose something, then we are opening up dangers <Col N="1092" /> and throwing upon the office much more realistic doubts than were formerly held.  I think it ought to be possible, in the circumstances of this country, to get men who will express their judgment on the rightness or wrongness of an issue without regard to whether or not they suffer consequences. It is quite good for the President, and it is quite good for the Government to know that if there is something wrong at least the feelings of the people cannot be benumbed into smothering it with the knowledge that if they go quietly they will get a pension of £1,200 a year.  We have seen some of those things happen here in recent years.  It is much better, if there is to be a row between the President and the Government, that it should be a public row causing a constitutional crisis, so that the plain people of the country will know what the row is about.  When you make provision for telling the President: &ldquo;Slip out quietly; smother this row; say you are tired or say you are sick and you will get a pension&rdquo;; that is the most dangerous kind of financial chloroform that can be applied to smother any kind of constitutional crisis.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we are only asking the President to serve for seven years. If he serves the nation for that period he will then get a pension of £1,200 a year to enable him to adjust himself to private citizenship.  It is not a terribly onerous task for a man to serve seven years and conduct himself reasonably for seven years, after which he will get a pension of £1,200.  We give nobody else a pension of this magnitude after such a short service, and we ought not to give it to the President unless he serves a minimum period of seven years.  The committee which considered this matter are on my side in the amendment that I have proposed, and I think we ought not to be carried away by this awe-stricken reverence of the Minister for Finance for this office.  We ought to do something in a reasonable way as if we were dealing with an ordinary citizen.  He is not one who is called on to render to the nation services which demand the exercise of any special qualities or attributes, but services which every <Col N="1093" /> patriotic citizen in a less spectacular way is rendering to the nation every day of the week.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment would be that if the ex-President becomes a member of this House he will not be entitled to any pension.  I think that is reasonable, and if I seek no other argument than the argument used by the Minister for Finance when we were discussing the amendment upon which the House was just divided, I think I can find some ground for a convincing case for this amendment.  If the President, having ceased to occupy that position, comes back into the hurly-burly of politics, it is clear that he cannot render that unique service to the nation that the Minister for Finance visualised a few moments ago when he spoke of that kind of great national service that could still be rendered by the ex-President of the State to the State.  It does not seem to me that that idea would fit in with the position of a President who would return to active, perhaps violent, participation in politics and still retain the emoluments that followed from his office when he was in a position of detachment and isolation.  I think there is a very good, sound, commonsense case for deciding that the President, having fulfilled for a certain period the office of President and then having relinquished it for one reason or another, should not be a member of this House and at the same time receive emoluments as ex-President.</P>

      <P>About the purpose which is sought to be achieved by this amendment I have rather sympathetic views.  I certainly think that it is undesirable that the President when <Col N="1097" /> he vacates his office should re-enter politics, but I do not think that this is the appropriate place to try to impose a disqualification upon him.  I will concede that we have in the Bill, as drafted, by making the proviso that where he becomes a member of the Oireachtas, the amount of such pension shall be reduced by the amount of any allowance which any such person may be entitled to under statutory authority by virtue of any such membership, certain disabilities on the Presidency; but that is rather an indication to the President that, in view of the provision which is being made for him, it is at the same time in our view undesirable that he should re-enter politics when he relinquishes office.  It is a sort of gentle hint.  People may differ as to the wisdom of hinting in that way, and might say there ought to be a positive disqualification imposed on the President. There is something to be said for that point of view, but if so, it ought to be done in a Bill in which that particular principle could be discussed at great length and all its implications examined.  To go the distance that Deputy Norton suggests, and virtually to impose a heavy penalty upon the ex-President if he became a member of the Oireachtas, is a matter which, I think, would require a great deal of consideration, much more consideration than, in the particular circumstances under which this Bill is being considered, we are able to give.  Accordingly, for that reason I would not be prepared to agree to the amendment of Deputy Norton.  I think that is a matter that ought to be considered alone and as a separate issue, and not mixed up with this question of pension at all.</P>

      <P>If the amendment is not withdrawn I would like to say too that, while you might sympathise with the idea, to put these words that Deputy Norton's amendment suggests should be put into this Bill reduces the <Col N="1098" /> Bill to a kind of will where a man leaves his money to his wife on condition that she does not marry again and I think that, like the amendments that were agreed to just now, it is really out of keeping with this type of Bill and, as the Minister for Finance says, if objections of this particular kind or disqualifications of this kind are to be put in it ought to be in a separate Bill.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with the Minister for Finance in his conclusions but I think his premises are very poor.  I think if he wants to exclude Deputy Norton's provision on the grounds that he suggested, he should logically take out, I think, the whole of Section 5 or, at any rate, the greater part of it and introduce it as a separate Bill, because, leaving out the question of the Oireachtas, sub-section (3) refers to public funds and the funds of a local authority and so forth and I think, if the Minister's contention is that this Bill is not the proper place to do it, then he should not have to do it.  I would like to suggest the advisability of removing that section and submitting a separate Bill to deal with the matter, preventing an ex-President from either taking up work payable out of public funds or in the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>There is a difference between the case covered by sub-section (2) and the case covered by sub-section (3).  In the case of sub-section (2) a member receives an allowance towards his expenses as a member of the Oireachtas.  In the case of sub-section (3) the ex-President would re-enter public employment in some way and naturally not in a political capacity.  There is underlying the whole pensions code a provision that where a person re-enters public employment his pension normally lapses.  That is a contingency which is covered in sub-section (3).  In connection with sub-section (2) I would say that there is a great deal to be said for the point of view that Deputy Benson has submitted.  That is, that this matter ought to be dealt with in <Col N="1099" /> another Bill.  I am not quite logical in regard to sub-section (2).  It is put in there as a sort of indication that we do not anticipate these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may say there is no difficulty about putting this amendment into the Bill.  There is not, of course; the Deputy can put down the amendment as it is not contrary to the principle of the Bill.  But discussing it this way as a minor matter when, in fact, it imposes a major disqualification on the President&mdash;that raises an issue which ought to be thrashed out very fully, and should not be thrashed out fully on this Bill.  If the Deputy wishes to go all the distance he proposes in his amendment, the thing to do would be to bring in a Bill to disqualify the President from being a member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The object which we seek to secure is that if we are going to pay the President £1,200 as a pension for life, and pay it to him under the provisions of this Bill after he has served for one day, the only case for doing that is to enable the President to rehabilitate himself financially in private citizenship.  The Oireachtas is going to make provision for such financial security as £1,200 will provide for the holder of an office who, during his period of service, has had a personal salary of £5,000, plus allowances. There may be a case for doing something along these lines, even on that generous scale, if the person ceasing to be President is going to be a private citizen or become engaged in work of a social or charitable character.  But there is no case for giving this gentleman a pension of £1,200 if he is going to come back into public life, perhaps lead a party or endeavour to establish a party and enter into the hurly-burly of political life as we know it in this country.  If that gentleman can display, <Col N="1100" /> by his re-entry into public life, a capacity for putting up with the hard knocks of public life in this country, then I think the case for having any tender regard for him when he becomes a member of this House has ceased to exist, and he ought, on becoming a member of the House, just be the same as every other member of the House, and not be entitled to the special provision we are making for him in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is quite undesirable that a person who has been a President should be able to switch over almost immediately from being a President to being a very active politician.  That is possible under our Constitution and the Electoral Act.  We cannot to-day amend the Constitution or the Electoral Act, but we can, by the insertion of this amendment, tell the ex-President or the President who is contemplating re-entry into public life that if he goes into public life and becomes a member of the Oireachtas, it is going to cost him £840 per annum, and he is not going to carry his pension back into the Oireachtas.  If you do that, it will have a very steadying effect on the turbulent political tendencies of a President or ex-President.  If he knows he has to pay that amount of tribute annually for his re-entry into public life, it may have a very steadying effect on him and, until such time as we can impose other limitations on the President electorally, I think at this stage we should impose a financial handicap so as not to encourage those people to come back into public life.</P>
      <P>Unless you do that you will get completely away from the notion of a non-party President, of a President holding the scales evenly as between one party and another, as between the Executive and the citizen.  I want to impose a financial handicap on an ex-President so as to deter him from coming back into public life, and I want to ensure that we do not make provision for a pension for a person of that kind, because there is no case for it.</P>

      <P>Some of Deputy Norton's observations are rather surprising. Normally one would think that a man who represents the Labour <Col N="1101" /> Party would take a more generous or liberal view of this situation.  In seeking to provide for every possible eventuality, it may be that we lost sight of at least one important phase in this case.  There are very few cases of persons having been in the principal position of any country resigning and going into what Deputy Norton calls political warfare, or the turbulence of politics.  Presumably at some time or other we will get rid of this turbulence of politics in this country, particularly having regard to the changed policy which the Government have shown here in the last few years, if we were to go no further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let us examine what has happened in other countries.  There has been one case in my own recollection in recent years on the Continent of a person who occupied even a more important position than that of Uachtarán in this country, and I think there was general satisfaction in his own country when he entered the Parliament.  On one occasion, having been beaten at the polls, he was subsequently persuaded to come in and save the economic and financial situation in that country.  Is it to be the rule in our law that, in the event of having a situation such as that in this country, a man who may happen to have no means of his own is to be prevented, by reason of the very great sacrifice he has been called upon to make, to come in and help the country, apart altogether from the mere question of party politics?  If there is to be any respect or consideration for a person occupying this high office, I think that the first consideration of a legislative assembly should be that we would have it in our code that that respect was to be shown and, in addition to that respect, that we would record it in our law that we would not start off with the suspicion that people going to occupy this office are going to be so politically-minded that we have to take the precaution of preventing them ever again entering into the political arena. It is quite possible that those who will occupy this office in the future, as those who have occupied similar offices in the past, will be elderly men, and elderly people do not, as a rule, ambition turbulent Party politics.  I think we <Col N="1102" /> might take the risk of passing this section in a non-Party fashion, telling the President and his successors that we have sufficient faith in those who will be appointed that they will not abuse the confidence of the people and that they will not take part in turbulent Party politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join very fully in the hope that Deputy Cosgrave has given expression to, that politics in this country in the future will not be as turbulent as in the past.  There has been a suggestion that there is likely to be a change in Party politics in the future, and that there will be less bitterness.  At all events, it is an inspiring sight to see people who have been so bitterly opposed to each other in the past voting together on this Bill.  That leads me to hope that we will henceforth see a better feeling between the people in this country and that the leaders will join together to support the proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I hope that in the future they will all come together in support of proposals for the betterment of the country.  In this particular amendment it is suggested that ex-Presidents should be debarred from pensions if they re-enter politics.  I think that any fair-minded person will agree that that is a sensible proposal. A person who held the office of President is not by the amendment debarred from taking an active part in the public life of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just another point in connection with this section which occurs to me with force.  The generosity which is shown in this Bill in regard to the ex-President as compared with the treatment given to the ex-President's widow or children is very remarkable. No matter what action the ex-President takes he is guaranteed a pension of £1,200 whereas the widow of an ex-President is only assured of a pension of £500.  She will lose this if she commits the offence of getting married again.  Each of her children will also lose.  The fact that there is such <Col N="1103" /> differentiation shown between the treatment meted out to the ex-President and the treatment meted out to his widow and children shows that this Bill has been very carelessly drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the examples that Deputy Cosgrave gave us do not fit the circumstances with which we are dealing in this Bill.  I am sure Deputy Cosgrave is familiar with the activities of a person who occupied very high office in this country, an office calling for impartiality, prudence and care in the discharge of his duty.  When that person left that office he became a very turbulent politician. I am sure if anything could be done to prevent that or a similar thing happening in the future, Deputy Cosgrave would support it and so he should vote for my amendment.</P>
      <P>In this country we have, in the main, three Parties.  These are the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  Now let us suppose that a President was a paragon of virtue, the most impeccable person who could be found in the country, and he seeks after occupying the position of President to become a member of this House.  What are his chances of doing so?  Did we not see that the most cultured person who went up seeking election to the Seanad did not get a single vote?  As a matter of fact, the present President was once defeated as a candidate for the Seanad. That was done by people over 30 years of age who voted in that Seanad election. The most exalted person in the world could not get elected to the Dáil &mdash;there are perhaps a few exceptions &mdash;but the main pass for a Deputy's entry into this House is through membership of a Party and the more turbulent the Deputy is the better is his chance of getting in.  Those are the circumstances of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an ex-President is to seek admission to this House, after retiring from his office as President, he will come back with either a Fianna Fáil, a Fine Gael or a Labour label around his neck.  He is not going to come in and display any great impartiality in the Legislature.  He will come as a supporter <Col N="1104" /> of the Party who are sponsoring him.  He will be committed to a certain social and economic programme. He may not believe in everything in that programme but, generally speaking, he will vote with the Party.  That is the only way in which an ex-President can come back to public life under our elective system.  We are in that situation under these circumstances providing him with a pass.</P>
    <P>Now, if an ex-President is being brought by a political Party into the Dáil as a member, that Party should be prepared to under-write his loss. There is no reason why the State should pay a pension to a person of that character.  We live in Eire 1938 and we ought make sure that we apply our thoughts to that problem in such a way as to fit the circumstances of to-day.  Knowing that the President can only come back to the Dáil as a rabid politician under the electoral system that we have, this amendment should be agreed to.  An ex-President may have excellent qualities but, in the main, he is a Party member if he joins a Party and that is the only way in which he can get back.  If he does get back he must come back as a champion of a political Party.  The political Party should under-write his loss. Certainly the State should not pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I find in debating any matter with Deputy Norton is that one never knows whether he is speaking for or against the proposition.  The speech he has just made is an excellent speech against his own amendment for he has told us how difficult it would be for an ex-President to get into this House.  The Deputy professes to be a democrat.  Yet he would deprive the people of some one constituency or another of the services of an ex-President did they call upon him to serve them.  The Deputy would impose a certain disability on such a constituency. The House, at any rate, has agreed that an ex-President is entitled to a pension as a right for services rendered to the Irish people over a long or short period whatever it may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at it in the abstract <Col N="1105" /> and whatever the dangers which might attend that course might be&mdash;the position in which Deputy Norton would want to put this citizen of Ireland, who has secured a pension, as of right, for services rendered to the nation, is that if he comes into the Dáil he loses his pension.  There is no other person in the State who is put in that position.  If an ex-member of the Gárda Síochána, having earned his pension, enters the House as a Deputy, nobody is going to victimise him and take his pension from him if the electors of a constituency send him here to represent them.  If ex-civil servants or ex-officers of the Army&mdash;all of whom in their own particular professions and in the office to which they have been called have been supposed to serve the people in a non-Party way and in a purely non-partisan fashion&mdash; should enter this House, they would not be called upon to forfeit their pensions during the period they were members of this House.  Therefore, <i>prima facie,</i> it would appear to be unjust to put one who had been the occupant of the highest office in the State in a more unfavourable position than these people would be in.  The Deputy, however, would propose to do that, and to do it by what I regard as a side-wind because, after all, the principle in this matter has not been debated at any great length nor have all its possible implications been explored.</P>
    <P>Let us take a case which might arise, one such as was referred to by Deputy Cosgrave and which is very pertinent to this issue.  Supposing a person, by common consent, had been chosen as President of this State&mdash;as has occurred in fact, and as I believe will be customary in the future &mdash;and that in that office as President of this State he had displayed certain qualities which, when a national emergency arose, indicated to every thinking person that it would be right and desirable, even though he had retired from the Presidency and gone into private life, to ask him to sit in this House.  Supposing that it might be evident to the general mass of the people and to the leaders of the several political Parties that he ought to be asked, in the <Col N="1106" /> special emergency which had arisen, to sit here in this House and possibly to take charge of a Government are we going to penalise him?  Now, that is not an illusory or far-fetched situation to conceive.  Deputy Cosgrave has reminded the House that ex-President Poincaré&mdash;I think that is the person he had in mind&mdash; was called upon to take charge of the Government of France when the economic position of France was very precarious.  There has been even a more recent case, where ex-President Doumergue was called upon to form a Government when political conditions in France had become very dangerous and had become so strained that people were afraid that there might be a civil cataclysm there which would upset the whole State.  At any rate, we only know that in comparatively recent times, in regard to a great nation and a great republic, that position of emergency has arisen where an ex-President has been called upon to take an active part in politics.  If that emergency or some similar emergency ever arose in this country&mdash;and it might; it is not inconceivable&mdash;why should we, simply because we want to prevent what, I readily admit, would be an evil and disadvantageous situation where an ex-President might come down straight from his office and rush immediately into politics again&mdash;really I think to the discredit of the high office he held &mdash;why should we, in order to prevent an unworthy person carrying on in that way, prevent or impose some disability on a worthy person who had been called upon to take his part in a national emergency?  That is what Deputy Norton proposes to do.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, as the law and the Constitution stand at present, an ex-President has the right to go up for election in any constituency and be returned by the people.  If he has that right under the Constitution and under our electoral law, it is not right or just in a Bill of this sort to penalise him&mdash;because that is what it would mean&mdash;if he exercises his rights as a citizen.  If Deputy Norton wants to attain his purpose and to prevent an ex-President from ever sitting in either House of the Oireachtas, <Col N="1107" /> this is not the Bill on which to do it.  It should be done by an amendment of the electoral law or by an amendment of the Constitution. When a proposal of that sort comes before the House it can be fully examined and all the implications of the proposal can be gone into.  Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out some of the implications, which I have tried to reinforce.  If all the implications of a proposal of that sort were examined here and fully discussed, it is just possible&mdash;it may even be probable, but certainly it is just possible&mdash;that the House as a whole would come to the decision that, although the present situation may leave itself open to undesirable developments, nevertheless the remedy may be worse than the disease and it would be better to leave the present position as it is.  If the House comes to that conclusion upon that matter, then obviously, it would be wrong for the House, I say, in a Bill of this sort to penalise an ex-President because he exercised his rights under the Constitution and according to the electoral law.  If you want to penalise him you have got to penalise every other ex-officer or ex-servant of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is no comparison between the high office of President and the office of the other ex-servants of the State to whom the Minister referred.  So far as I remember the discussions on the Constitution and all the glorifications of this office since, the office has been deified into one where the occupant is supposed to have qualities and to enjoy respect which is not pertinent to any other office in this State.  The Minister has talked about inconsistencies in making speeches.  We have listened to two entirely inconsistent lines of argument in the Minister's statement.  He talks about its being wholly undesirable that some person should leave the office of President and come in here as an active politician, while at the same time he has asked us to say that this amendment is entirely unjustified, and he has told us a fairy story about some national emergency which would <Col N="1108" /> be likely to arise here in the future when all the people and all Parties would unite in asking some person to come in here and take the country out of some unhappy situation.  Now, we are not children here and we know that, if such a situation should arise &mdash;and it is very unlikely, and the Minister himself is contributing as much as he can to see that it will never arise&mdash;it will be quite easy for people in this House to make provision for this superman who is going to make the sacrifice of coming in here and leading a Party and a Government.  It is quite clear that the whole purpose of the office of President, with the extraordinarily generous salary and provisions that have been attached to it, and the amazing inconsistency of people who view that office now with so much reverence, after having spent years gibing at the occupant of a similar office in the past and having spent years in pouring all the scorn they could on the salaries and emoluments attached to it&mdash;it is quite clear that the purpose of the office, or what is intended by the office, is that the person occupying it should be entirely above Party politics.</P>
      <P>Having been above Party politics for a certain number of years, we are asked to say that there should be no obstacle to that person becoming a Party politician, becoming a violent partisan in Party politics afterwards.  I think there is a sound case made for the amendment, and I hope the Deputy responsible for it will press it to a division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say one thing.  The Minister tries to make a point about the fact that an ex-civic guard or a soldier or an officer can come into the Dáil even with a pension and serve here as a member of the Oireachtas.  That is true, but he does not come in with a pension of £1,200 a year in his pocket, and he does not get a pension of that dimension for one day's service or a week's service or a year's service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>An ordinary guard has to serve 25 or 35 years before he gets a very small pension.  The same applies to an army officer.  A soldier would want to serve all his life in the army and be in a few campaigns before he got a pension equivalent to what would be paid to an ordinary employee, let us say, of the Dublin Corporation.  Those are not cases at all comparable to the one with which we are dealing.  The President is going to get a pension of £1,200 a year for life, possibly for a month's or a year's service.  He is going to be put in a specially privileged position.  He is going to get a better and softer pension than anybody else in the country. Then we are going to sort-of asphalt the road into the Dáil, so as to give him a pension of £860 a year plus his Dáil allowance.  There is going to be no impediment to his doing that, lest we might remove some of the tinsel from the office.  The attitude of the Labour Party on this matter is perfectly logical.  If the person is to rehabilitate himself in private life, that is one thing.  If he is not, but wants to come back into public life, there is no case at all for giving this generous pension.  Then, again, we had the bogey-man talk on the part of the Minister.  He told us a crisis might develop in this country such as might unite 3,000,000 people, the three Parties in the House, and numerous others outside it, into praying that one man would come into the Dáil and lead the nation out of the land of economic bondage and into the promised land. The Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;Do not do anything in this Bill to prevent that happening,&rdquo; and we are being told that while the guns that were used in the civil war are still smoking. Do we not know perfectly well, if we want to be realists at all, that those things do not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did we not see a civil war in this country which produced a resort to methods of that kind, and did we see it succeed?  We are being asked to provide for something which happens once or twice in the career of a nation and never again.  We are being asked to provide for that one possibility in this country.  We are going to open the way to every person who desires to <Col N="1110" /> vacate the office of President and come in here as a partisan politician with a pension of £860 a year.  There is a case for giving a pension to a person if he is going to retire into private life.  There is no case for giving it if he is going to come back into public life in the only way in which it is possible to come back into public life in this country, namely, by being an active member of some political party.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a crisis that might necessitate this man being brought into the Dáil.  If this country is ever going to be confronted with a crisis which it cannot surmount unless by paying a pension of £860 to a man brought back into the Parliament to serve the nation, then the people have not the capacity for having a Parliament functioning in this country.  If a situation of that kind develops, and a person who is going to be the economic saviour of the country is going to be brought back into the Parliament, surely it is not above the wit of man, as we know it here, to devise an arrangement to meet the situation.  We have been passing Estimates in this Dáil to compensate people who installed totalisators at greyhound courses.  We are going to pass another Estimate in regard to old cows for Roscrea.  Surely we can get over a situation of that kind by giving a similar allowance to such a person, a person who is regarded by all parties in the State as an economic saviour?  The Minister talked all bogey-man talk. There is no case against the amendment except that you want to carpet the road for the ex-President to come back into the Dáil and be a violent Party politician.  If he is going to do that, the State should not be asked to pay for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is rather a mistake in this wording.  We are invited by the two Deputies who are supporting the amendment almost to indulge in the prophecy that we are to have future Presidents here who may occupy office for a short time and then retire and come into politics.  It is most unlikely.  I hope I am not entering into the realm of prophecy when I say that, but it is obvious that <Col N="1111" /> they will not be young men who will be appointed to this office: they will be men fairly advanced in years.  It is my own experience that that type of person is not much use in a turbulent political atmosphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that it were a stop-gap, it does not bear the same character that we heard from Deputy Everett or from Deputy Murphy.  This is not the time or the place to discuss how this office is to be filled, but it so happens that it is filled just now with fairly general agreement, and it ought to be discussed in the absence of the personality of the person.  When we speak of £1,200 a year being a large pension, we must take into account what expenses the person in question is likely to have to meet in filling that office&mdash;and they are considerable, much more than quite a number of people probably think they might be. They are considerable, and they are likely to be so for the future.  During the last few years we have pensioned off one civil servant and one police officer.  In the case of the police officer I think his pension is about £833 6s. 8d., or something like that.  He would be in exactly the same position, <Col N="1112" /> except for £6 a year, so far as coming into the Dáil is concerned.  Deputy Norton's amendment would place the President in a far worse position than either of those two.  It is quite true that the length of service for which the President is asked is only seven years, and may be less.  In very few cases have people who have been heads of State resigned merely for the purpose of taking a pension.  After all, you appoint a person of character, a person with some sense of responsibility, and none of them that anybody ever heard of relinquished his office merely for the purpose of drawing a pension.</P>
      <P>It is an office of great responsibility, one that should command respect, and, I again appeal to Deputy Norton to look at the matter from that angle, and to say that if there are going to be abuses, we are not the people who have a suspicion of abuses, as we confidently expect that those who will hold the honoured position of head of the State, will have sufficient sense of responsibility to appreciate, not only the delicacy of their position, but the general conduct that people would expect from persons holding that office.</P>

      <P>I did not say that I was advised.  I was in charge of the Bill here on the last day and I asked that we should get all stages of the Bill on that last occasion.  The leader of the Opposition very readily agreed then and appealed to the leader of the Labour Party to agree also.  The leader of the Labour Party stated that all he wanted was to have his amendments discussed, and I certainly understood that we would get all stages here to-day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey expressed a desire to raise on the Adjournment matters arising out of question No.8.  I informed the Deputy that the Chair could not accept the notice of a proposal to have this matter discussed on the Adjournment.  The basic question requests the Minister to make available to members of the Dáil copies of reports dealing with the Carrick-on-Suir slate quarries.  The Minister replied that the advice given to him was confidential.  A debate on the Adjournment could not lead to any elucidation of the question.  No further facts could emerge from discussion, and no purpose could be served by raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 21st July.</P>
