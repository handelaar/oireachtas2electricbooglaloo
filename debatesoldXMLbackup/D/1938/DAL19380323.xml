      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that there are more than a dozen families in the village of Carrigrohane living in insanitary houses which have been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and that two or three families in the village of Shanbally Upper are similarly living in houses unfit for human habitation, and whether, in these circumstances, he will state the grounds on which he refused to confirm a Compulsory Purchase Order (Non-Municipal Towns and Villages Compulsory Purchase <Col N="724" /> Labourers and Housing Acts Order, 1937) for the villages of Carrigrohane and Shanbally Upper in the South Cork Board of Health area, and whether he will state what action he intends taking at an early date to remedy the conditions of the people in these two villages who are living under such insanitary conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In a report which was considered by the South Cork County Board of Public Health at a meeting on 15/3/37, the county medical officer of health recommended the provision of 12 new houses for the village of Carrigrohane to replace unhealthy insanitary dwellings and to relieve overcrowding, and also reported that there appeared to be at the most a necessity for two new cottages in the village of Shanbally.  A Compulsory Purchase Order subsequently made by the board provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the acquisition of two sites, one at Carrigrohane and the other at Shanbally Upper, for the erection thereon of twelve and two cottages, respectively. The two sites in question were excluded by me from the Confirming Order dated 15th ultimo for the following reasons:&mdash;Carrigrohane site&mdash;By reason of its unsuitable location at the junction of two main roads.  Shanbally Upper site &mdash; An equally suitable alternative site was offered to and accepted by the board.  I accorded sanction on 28th ultimo to the acquisition of the alternative site.  I have requested the board to take immediate steps for the acquisition of an alternative site at Carrigrohane to that excluded from the Order.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Avoncore Flour Mills, Midleton, County Cork, have been closed down, and if in view of the policy of protective tariffs imposed to foster this industry, he will state what steps he will take to prevent the centralisation of this industry to the danger and detriment of rural flour mills, and which results in the unemployment of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that since the 1st January last the Avoncore Flour Mills at Midleton have been closed periodically, but I am informed that the short time was almost negligible and that the men were paid for practically the whole time during which the mills were closed.  There is no protective tariff in the case of the importation of flour.  The importation of flour is prohibited under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts save under licence issued by my Department.  The measures taken to prevent the centralisation of the industry are embodied in the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1933, under which each licensed mill is given a quota of wheat and the penalties for overmilling are set out in Section 9 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1934.  These measures are fully effective to prevent any development of the nature contemplated in the question, but whether any modification of them is desirable is one of the matters at present under examination relating to the whole flour-milling position.</P>

Orders under that Act prohibiting the removal of shingle or ballast from the area of foreshore, which includes Clonea Strand, are at present in force.  An inter-departmental committee of inquiry into coast erosion which reported in 1931 were of opinion that the Government should not assume any general responsibility for the defence of the coast against erosion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos, 18, 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The directors of the company are Mr. R. Briscoe, T.D.; Mr. C.D. Crowley, Mr. J.D. Crowley and Herr G. Fasenfeld, who is managing director.</P>
      <P>In my reply to a question by Deputy Wall on the 16th February, I dealt with the Government liability under the option agreement and also with the Government liability in respect of expenditure incurred in extending the factory.  Because of the small number of cattle which farmers have offered for delivery to the factory this spring, I gave the company notice last week of my intention not to deliver any more cattle this season after the campletion of the collections now in progress. The compensation payable to the company by reason of determination of cattle supply will be assessed in accordance with the appropriate provision of the option agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> The contract with the factory was, in the ordinary course, referred to and dealt with by the law advisers of the Government before it was signed.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to produce the documents dealing with the alternative schemes which were considered. The following particulars will, however, enable a comparison to be drawn between the various schemes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Alternative proposals were submitted by two firms, which I will call A and B.</P>
    <P>Firm A could deal with only 200 animals per week, which it was proposed to have slaughtered at a public abattoir.  The firm was not disposed to undertake the slaughter of animals.</P>
    <P>Firm B were prepared to deal with 20,000 cows per annum but they required the Government to make themselves responsible for:</P>
    <P>(a)  collection, transport and lairage of the animals;</P>
    <P>(b)  the provision of a sum of from £18,000 to £20,000 for reorganisation and equipment of the firm's plant;</P>
    <P>(c)  the provision of an export bounty on such by-products as might not be absorbed by the home market;</P>
    <P>(d)  an advance to the firm from week to week to cover wages and manufacturing charges until such time as markets were found and the products sold.</P>
    <P>This firm also required remuneration for expenses in running the scheme and proposed to keep a record of such expenses and to place the balance of either profit or loss, after payment of agreed remuneration to them, against the Government's account, and on the termination of the scheme either to return the plant to the Government or to buy it, as might be agreed upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And to give any profit accruing to the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Roscrea meat company's proposals embodied:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  An undertaking to provide buildings and machinery at an estimated cost of £20,000, of which 25 per cent. would be found by the promoters, and to have the factory <Col N="733" /> working within three months of the date of the preliminary agreement with the Government;</P>
    <P>(b)  payment by the company of the freight charges on cattle railed to the factory;</P>
    <P>(c)  provision for dealing with 1,000 cows per week after the first 18 weeks of the working of the factory and for 1,200 cows in any one week in respect of which the Minister had given a fortnight's previous notice.</P>
    <P>The company were in a position to find an external market, not only for their edible products but also for their non-edible products, including such quantity of meat meal as was not absorbed by the home market.  They could, therefore, operate their factory on more favourable terms to the Government than Firm B.  They were also prepared to give the Government the right to withdraw from the scheme within the first, second, third or fourth years of operation on payment of appropriate compensation and, at the end of the fourth year, to give the Government the option of buying them out.</P>
    <P>I may add that the Roscrea company did not seek and have not had a monopoly of the supplies of uneconomic cows.  Such cattle have also been supplied on exactly the same terms and to the extent of their requirements to two other firms who were engaged in similar business prior to the establishment of the Roscrea factory.</P>

These statements show that, after provision was made for income-tax, corporation profits tax, bad or doubtful debts and for debenture redemption reserve but before any allowance was made for depreciation of premises, the profits for those two periods amounted to £6,181 and £27,681 respectively.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been a certain number of failures of wheat crops during the past few years and that in some cases the failure was alleged to be due to the seed supplied not being the variety ordered and not suitable for sowing at the particular time of year.  My attention has been drawn to one case in which certain growers obtained judgment against a trader on the ground that the seed supplied was of a lower yielding variety than that ordered.  To ensure as far as possible that seed wheat imported into this country is of satisfactory quality and true to name, importation permits are issued only in cases where the importer has obtained from the supplier an undertaking that the seed is of the best quality, has been purchased by name and will be invoiced under such name. The importer must also make it a condition of sale that any seed wheat purchased from him shall be resold by a purchasing trader under the name by which it is invoiced to him.  It is impossible to ensure absolutely against failure of wheat or of any other crop. A case of failure of a crop may be due to a variety of causes apart from any defect in the seed sown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made further enquiries in this matter and I find that the work undertaken by the casual labourers employed by the engineering branch was unskilled and that the correct rate for such labour in the Maynooth area is 30/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware of the fact that in the City of Dublin labourers employed by the post office are paid the local builders' rates? That is the practice.  Would he say why, in view of that fact, the builders' rate of wages is not paid in Maynooth, where the rate is 10d., and why the Minister continues to pay only 30/- a week.  Would he say what is the explanation of the difference in practice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been very carefully considered.  The conditions in respect of Dublin do not <Col N="750" /> apply to Maynooth.  The rates of wages there were investigated.  We got into touch with the labour exchange and got information that this was the rate of wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the Minister has answered a question that I did not really ask.  He says that the rates in Maynooth are different from the rates in Dublin.  So are the building trades rates different, being 1/5 an hour in Dublin and 10d. in Maynooth.  When the Minister employs temporary men in Dublin he pays them 1/5 an hour because that is the building trades rate.  Why does he not pay 10d. an hour in Maynooth where the rate is 10d?  He is only paying 30/-, which is below the builders labourers' rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

They are similar to the class employed in Dublin on this work, and they are recruited from the local labour exchange, the same as Dublin.  The Minister pays the builders labourers' rate in Dublin but he will not pay it in Maynooth.  I asked the Minister why, and there is no reasonable answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Fever Hospital Act, 1935, which was passed by the Oireachtas on the 12th December, 1935, made provision for the submission by the Corporation of Cork to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health of a scheme for the establishment of a new fever hospital in or near the City of Cork.  This scheme was required not alone to specify the proposed <Col N="756" /> site of the hospital, but to incorporate plans and specifications of the institution and to state the estimated cost of its establishment.  Section 6 of the Act of 1935 provided that if within two years after the passing of that Act the scheme for the establishment of the institution was approved of by the Minister and a grant made from the Hospitals' Trust Fund of an amount of not less than one-half the cost of the approved scheme, the Minister would be empowered to declare that there would come into operation Part III of the Act, which provides for the immediate transfer to the Corporation of Cork by the Committee of the Cork Fever Hospital and House of Recovery of any unexpended balance of moneys received by the Committee from sweepstake funds, the disposal of such moneys, the erection by the corporation of a new fever hospital, and the subsequent control and management of the hospital.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the passing of the Act the corporation invited offers of land as a site for the new hospital.  Twenty-five offers were received, from which a site was selected and purchased in November, 1936, with the approval of the Department.  Steps were not taken by the corporation for the appointment of an architect for the preparation of plans until a site had been secured.  When the lay-out plans were in preparation it was considered that the site did not lend itself to economic planning.  The lay-out consisted of 19 units.  A building of this nature would occupy a very large space, and considerable under-building appeared to be necessary in several parts.  It was then decided to defer proceeding with the proposal until a complete survey of the entire city and environments had been made, to ascertain if a more suitable site would be available.  This is at present being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The object of the present Bill is to extend the period of two years, fixed by Section 6 of the Act of 1935, to three years and thus enable further time for the corporation to prepare and submit a further scheme for the Minister's approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary give some indication of <Col N="757" /> the actual causes of the hold-up of the preliminary arrangements in connection with this matter?  He told us that a site was purchased in 1936.  From what he stated I inferred that the site then purchased is not the actual site on which the hospital will be built, and that the purpose of this amending Bill is to allow a further year in order to get over the difficulty.  Even with a further year, I suggest that the obstacles which operated for the past three years will still operate, and we have no guarantee in this Bill that the hospital will be got under way within 12 months.</P>
      <P>I should like to get from the Parliamentary Secretary a definite assurance that the hospital will be commenced within that 12 months. We have a very obsolete building in Cork at the present time, the North Fever Hospital.  As well as that building, where patients are being treated, we have a building in the county home, under the Poor Law administration. I understand the idea is that from those two the patients will be drawn for the new fever hospital.  As far as the fever hospital is concerned, as I have said, the building is obsolete, and it is not in very good repair.  The committee felt all the time that expending money on an old building like that, in view of the fact that a new building was to be put up within a very reasonable time, was not a very economical proceeding, and we are still in the position that patients are being housed there, not under the best conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather surprising that the Parliamentary Secretary has given us no indication as to the obstacles which operated against the hospital being commenced within that period.  After all, one would have thought that two years, since the Bill was passed, would have been an ample time to get through those preliminaries.  He did mention incidentally that the corporation were the people who had charge of the purchase of the site and other things in connection with this Act of 1935, but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the corporation has no function whatsoever under this Act.  The city manager has the <Col N="758" /> function.  Very often we hear that public bodies are slow in their deliberations and movements, but here we have the City Manager practically in charge of these preliminaries.  I am not suggesting that the Cork City Manager was in any way remiss with regard to his duties, but at the same time I want to stress the point that unless we are definitely assured that the obstacles which operated against the putting into operation of this Act for two years are to be wiped out, there is very little use in giving another 12 months.  It would be much better to extend the time to two or three or four years, or whatever the Minister thinks would be a reasonable time.  I inferred also from the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks that until Part III of the Act is put into operation no moneys can be paid to the Corporation for the purposes of this hospital, but I am sure he is aware that the purchase money for the site has already been handed over by the North Fever Hospital Committee to the Corporation, and as far as my information goes that site has actually been purchased for some 12 months. That is the reason I rise to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if we are to be in the same position at the end of 12 months as we are now at the end of two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to amplify what my colleague, Deputy Hurley, has said in connection with the speeding up of the preliminaries in connection with the Cork Fever Hospital.  At the present moment I have perhaps more to do with the South Fever Hospital in-as-much as I am on the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.  I may tell the Minister that at the present moment there is a very considerable outbreak of fever amongst the attendants in that hospital, and that the position is much more serious than would on first sight appear.  There is no question at all about the fact that the present fever hospital is obsolete. It is an old hospital, and, because of anticipating the erection of the new one, naturally no money has been spent on improvements.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for speeding up this matter as <Col N="759" /> much as he possibly can.  I am aware that the site was not approved of, but at the same time I would ask that the whole question should be hurried as much as possible.  Naturally, the new fever hospital will do a great deal to militate against anything in the nature of outbreaks.  In the old buildings there are no means of providing isolation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hurley must not have been listening very attentively to my opening remarks, because he wants to know the actual cause of the delay.  Well, I set out as clearly as I could what the cause of the delay has been.  Perhaps Deputy Hurley did not catch some of my remarks.  Anyhow, I will repeat them. The delay was entirely due to the fact that the site was found unsatisfactory when it came to the actual planning of the institution.  As I stated, the lay-out consisted of 19 units, and when the technicians got down to planning the institution they found that there were considerable technical difficulties in fitting an institution requiring such space on to the site that had already been acquired.  It may not be possible to get a better site, but, at any rate, it does seem desirable, I think everybody will agree, that an institution which will probably cost upwards of £200,000 should be placed on the best site available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>To my understanding of the position, that does not complicate matters at all.  If a better site can be found, then the site which has already been purchased must be disposed of. Even if it were disposed of at a loss, it would still be better policy to dispose of it at a loss than to build an institution of that size and importance on an unsuitable site.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I should like to get permission to conclude. The urgency of the position is fully appreciated.  At least two years ago or perhaps longer I went through the institution in Cork and I quite agree with all that Deputy Brooke Brasier has said in regard to it.  It is entirely obsolete and completely unsuitable for its purpose, and I am anxious to have the new institution provided with the least possible delay. At the same time, I do not want to place it on a site that is not suitable if a suitable site can be got.  I do not think any of the Cork Deputies need have any uneasiness as to the probability of a Bill similar to this being introduced after 12th December next.  While undoubtedly this new survey will entail some additional delay, I do not think it is at all likely that the new site, if any, will not be acquired and the plans submitted to and approved by the Minister before 12th December next.  Of course, if that were the position a further amending Bill, further extending the period, would be necessary, but I do not think it is at all likely.  At all events, as far as we are concerned in the Department, we are anxious to do everything possible to facilitate the provision of this institution with the least avoidable delay.</P>

Anyway, I can get the figure, but the money was actually paid, and now the Parliamentary Secretary comes along and asks us to extend the time for 12 months more in order to facilitate the people who made this bungle.</P>

The whole trouble, as far as I can gather, is that somebody bungled the whole thing; the money has been actually paid over, and now we are told that it must be disposed of again to somebody else and new sites looked for.</P>

I do not know the situation in Cork, but assuming that Deputy Hurley is right in saying that this matter of acquiring a site was bungled, he should rejoice that it is being unbungled now, because not only the Chairman of the Roscommon County Council, Deputy O'Rourke, will agree that we were bungled in the matter of a site&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think I have a right to warn the Cork Deputies against that.  They may be astonished that any sane man would put a hospital site beside a graveyard, but I warn them that it has been done, and we have the case of £100,000 being spent in erecting a hospital next door to a graveyard.  It may yet turn out to be a graveyard in view of the circumstances in which it has been erected, but there it is, and not only that, but having proceeded to erect it next door to a graveyard in another part of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not quite clear as to who is to put up with the loss, if there is a loss, in the disposal of the present site&mdash;the one that has actually been acquired under the Act.  I am not quite clear on that, but certainly I am sure that the site will not fetch as much from a private speculator as from a public body. Usually it does not.  The North Fever Hospital Committee have actually paid in cash the purchase price of that site.  That is the reason that I rose on this Bill.  Now, we are quite definite that the hold-up and bungling was with regard to whoever was selecting the site.  We have not got the name of the person or the people who did it, but I am being very careful with regard to what the Department are doing, and I can assure Deputy Dillon that I will watch them, and that as far as graveyards are concerned, we will watch them also.</P>

    <Col N="765" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide machinery for controlling more effectively the importation of cement, but advantage has been taken of its introduction for the purpose of introducing certain clauses which are designed to remedy minor defects which have shown themselves in the Cement Act of 1933.  Some further provision of that kind may also be necessary, which I will try to deal with by amendments on the next Stage.  Under the Cement Act of 1933, a licence was granted to a company, which was called Cement, Limited, authorising that company to manufacture cement.  Two cement factories are now in course of construction, one at Limerick, and one at Drogheda.  It is expected that the factory at Limerick will commence production before the end of the present month, and that the factory at Drogheda will commence production some time later. These two factories, between them, will be capable of producing in a period of 12 months approximately 240,000 tons of cement.  It is estimated that the requirements of the country are about 370,000 tons per year.  It is necessary, therefore, to make provision for the importation of cement, but in order that a market may be reserved for the product of the Irish factories, it is desirable that the quantities of cement to be imported shall not be more than the amount by which the output of the Irish factories falls short of the needs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Part V of the 1933 Act the importation of cement is prohibited, save under licences issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is only, however, in the circumstances which are set out in that Act, that an application for a licence may be refused.  In fact, the Act makes it obligatory on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to issue a licence provided that the application is in correct form, that the applicant is not a person who has been convicted of an offence under the Act, and provided <Col N="766" /> that the existing stocks of cement are not, in the Minister's opinion, excessive.  It is difficult to determine at any given point of time whether or not stocks are excessive and, in practice, the Minister's power to refuse a licence is doubtful so long as the first and second of the conditions I have mentioned are fulfilled. This Bill proposes to repeal that Part of the Act and to give power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to exercise discretion in the selection of persons to whom import licences shall be issued and in the determination of the amount of cement that they shall be authorised to import.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is framed in that form, I can inform the Dáil that it is my intention, should circumstances develop as I anticipate, to give to Cement Limited sole licence to import the quantities of cement by which the output of their factories falls short of the needs of the country. There are many and substantial advantages to be secured by dealing with this purely temporary situation in that way.  I describe it as a temporary situation because, within a very short time, the entire needs of the country in cement will be manufactured here.  The giving of a sole licence will be conditional on Cement Limited proceeding, without delay, to erect a third factory, and subject also to the condition that the output of the three factories will be sufficient to supply all needs so that importations will in future be unnecessary.  One of the advantages in operating by that method is that the disturbances which will be caused to existing channels of trade will be kept at a minimum.</P>
    <P>The views of the persons who are engaged in the business of importing cement at present were taken upon that aspect of the matter and, at a meeting of importers held under the auspices of my Department, a resolution was passed unanimously, recommending that the distribution of imported as well as home-manufactured cement should be left in the hands of Cement Limited.  Furthermore, any quantities of cement that it may be necessary to import will be <Col N="767" /> secured under such arrangement at economical prices.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, the importation of cement into this country is controlled by a Committee of the Cartel of Cement Manufacturers and I am satisfied if we put the Irish Cement Company in a position to make large scale purchases of cement they can secure it from the Cartel at prices which would be substantially lower than the prices which importers are compelled to pay at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended that Cement Limited will make any profit on the distribution of imported cement.  The cement the company will be authorised to import will be sold without profit or, as an alternative arrangement, any profit made will be applied to the reduction of the guaranteed selling price of Irish manufactured cement.  I should say it is unlikely any arrangement of that kind that may be made in relation to the importation of cement will extend beyond Portland and rapid hardening cements.  The importation of other cements, including colour cement, will not be subject to that form of regulation; that is to say, the importation of such cement will not be confined to any one importer.  The provisions of this Bill which, if enacted, will replace the provisions of Part V. of the 1933 Act, prohibiting the importation of cement save under licence, authorise the Minister to issue to such persons as he thinks fit licences authorising the importation of cement within such periods and in such quantities as may be specified in the licence, and authorise the Minister further to attach to the licence such conditions as may be necessary.  Further, they provide for the payment of fees on the <Col N="768" /> issue of import licences at such rates as may be directed.  It is by the arrangement of fees that the difference between the price of imported cement and home-produced cement will be secured for the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a flat rate fee of 5/- per ton.  It will, of course, take some time before the third cement factory can be constructed and brought into operation, but I think it should be possible to do that before the end of next year, so that the arrangements which are contemplated under this Bill will operate only for that comparatively limited period.  I do not think it is necessary at this stage to refer in detail to the other sections of the Bill which are designed to remedy minor defects which experience has shown to exist in the other provisions of the Cement Act of 1933.  If any question relating to these sections should arise, I will deal with the matter when the Bill is before the Dáil in Committee.  It would be easier to deal with that aspect under such circumstances than at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who would ever dream, from the dove-like accents of the Minister, that the cement licence fee represents an annual tax on the people in this country of nearly £100,000?  It is proposed to raise more.  We are importing at the present time, according to the Minister, 370,000 tons of cement and he gets 5/- on each ton, which represents £92,500.  We are going to manufacture forthwith 240,000 tons, and import 130,000 tons, and he is going to levy on those 130,000 tons a sum per ton sufficient to make up the difference between the f.o.b. price of foreign cement delivered at Limerick and the cost of cement manufactured in Limerick.  The Minister did not tell us what he expected that difference would be.  He would probably bring cement at present into Limerick at about 32/- a ton.  Is the Minister in a position to say what price he expects cement will be at the Limerick works when they are <Col N="769" /> operating?  Has the Minister got any figure for that?  If he has, will he give it to me now?</P>

He can say: &ldquo;I am damned if I will tell.&rdquo;  We cannot take the Minister by the throat, but we shall gradually drag the information out of him.  This is the sort of silly conduct which makes it difficult to get business done here.  The later Stages of the Bill may have to be postponed for weeks in order that information which we want shall be dragged out of the Minister, subsequently digested and woven into the argument of which it ought to form part.  We do not know of how much the Minister proposes to plunder the public in respect of this licence to import cement, but we do know that, whatever price he can get Cement Limited to put upon the Irish product, he will get for the Minister for Finance the difference between that price and the import price in the form of indirect taxation.  We have already had a forecast of what indirect taxation will be.  It will represent a sum of about £36,000,000, which will be levied by taxes revealed in the Budget.  By this Cement Bill the Minister, if he chooses, can raise another £250,000 for the Exchequer and, in addition to that, he can raise for Cement Limited or the shareholders <Col N="770" /> of that company, such further sum as he thinks fit.  A lot of people in this House forget that a considerable share of the capital of Cement, Limited, is held by the Government.</P>

      <P>We have no knowledge whatever as to the nature of the levy proposed to be imposed on the people of this country as a result of this licensing fee.  But we have knowledge that it has been the practice of this Government to levy indirect taxation in so far as they can.  We have every reason to apprehend, from our experience of certain other industries that have been established under Government patronage, that if it is possible to profiteer, profiteering will be carried out.  These two facts together leave me to apprehend that there will be a very heavy burden put upon the cement users of this country in the form of an increased price of cement. Deputy Corish or anybody else may say that cement represents an infinitesimal fraction of the rent of the individual cottage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>I have been trying to explain to Deputy Corish that this Bill enables the Minister to put 10/- or 15/-per ton on cement.  Remember that the Minister himself said, when he first put on 5/- a ton, that this was only a preparatory step to accustom the public to an increased price of cement, so that when the Irish factories began producing the jump would not be too great.  To-day the Minister would not tell us what he expects that jump will be.  There is no provision in this measure to restrict the price.  If the excess price turns out to be 10/- or 15/-a ton, then that would be a very substantial burden on the people of this country, a burden that they should not be called upon to bear.  It will mean <Col N="774" /> either of two things: first, that there will have to be a larger subsidy from the rates, or secondly, that the labourers' cottage rents will have to be increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He will, when I shame him into giving it, but it is only when I shame him.  In this proposal he is conferring a monopoly on Cement Ltd. If that is the Government's intention, I challenge the Minister for Industry and Commerce now to tell us what defence can he put up for operating this cement monopoly as a private enterprise?  Why should the profits of this monopoly be put into the pockets of a restricted class of shareholder?  I am a capitalist.  I believe in the capitalist system.  I believe it is the best system and the system which will yield the highest standard of living to the people of this country and to the people of any other country.  But if you are to have that system you ought to operate it according to the rules of that system.  There is no use in having a capitalist system if you are going to tolerate all its evils and have none of its benefits.  If you give a complete monopoly inside an absolutely protected market to a capitalist group in the matter of any commodity which is indispensable to the community where they live, then that capitalist group enjoys all the halfpence and the consuming public all the kicks.  If you are determined to get on with this policy of pursuing the fatal chimera of national self-sufficiency, monopolies of this character ought to be governed. National self-sufficiency means, in the heel of the hunt, either social evils of the Moscow variety or social evils of the Berlin variety.  Any monopoly which is going to yield a profit and a profit which the consuming public are forced to provide ought to be <Col N="775" /> in the hands of the State, so that the taxpayer will derive the benefits of any profits yielded by the operation of these monopolies I think the latter is a fatal policy, because its logical conclusion is either Nazi-ism or Communism. I believe in private enterprise and in moderate competition which maintains a reasonable standard of opposition and not that sort of thing to which this measure is leading.  In that way only can you get a high standard of living and a fair standard of leisure for the individual citizens of the State.</P>
      <P>Let us not make the mistake of falling between two stools, getting the evils of both systems and the benefits of none.  That is what we are doing in this business.  That is what we have already done in the flour and bacon business.  The pursuance of that policy has been utterly disastrous in the flour business.  It has robbed the consuming public of 10/- in each sack of flour, and it has enriched beyond the dreams of avarice a small group of flour millers in this country.  In the bacon business it has robbed the consuming public, and it has enriched beyond the dreams of avarice the bacon curers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cement enterprise, if operated within the terms of this Bill, can be operated for the purpose of securing to the producers of this commodity great riches, and imposing immense hardships on the people.  The Minister will answer that by saying: &ldquo;I mean to watch over it and to see that an excessive price will not be charged.&rdquo; The Minister gave the same undertaking with regard to flour.  Yet at this moment 10/- a sack is being robbed from the Irish people by the flour millers.  The flour consumers are being robbed of £1,500,000 a year by the flour millers as a result of the Minister's action.  And these millers are in the position of saying to the Minister: &ldquo;If you do not let us do that, we will close down the mills.&rdquo; The Minister has himself admitted that there was overcharging going on, and that he had to knuckle under and allow it to go on.  He said he is trying other ways and means to deal with the <Col N="776" /> flour scandal, but that he has not as yet devised a remedy.  There is only one method of dealing with the flour millers, and that is to take over the mills and run them for the benefit of the country, unless you introduce into the flour-milling industry the element of competition.  Otherwise, the public will continue to be robbed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cement business, you have either to take over the cement business and run it as a Government monopoly &mdash; a rotten system which will produce inefficiency and overcharge because there will be bad value and in the long run graft and tyranny.  But it is better to face all that and try to control the industry by the power of Parliament than to leave it in the hands of a group of irresponsible individuals who impose all those evils on us without any power on our part to control them when they want to get away with the swag.  If the business is turned into a Government monopoly, the excess profits will come to the relief of taxation. Bad as socialism is, it is better than a monopoly in the hands of a group of private capitalists.  The best system would be a system which permitted a degree of competition which would secure for the public fair value and which would protect the consumers in this country against any attempt by a foreign combine to wipe them out so that in the long run the foreign combine might control the whole market.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced to-day that under the terms of this amending Bill he has power to let individual cement importers import if he wants to but he has also announced that he is not going to do that, that he is going to concentrate all the importing of cement in the hands of Cement Limited.  That gives rise to a very interesting point in political morality. How far are restricted groups of persons entitled to advance knowledge from the Minister which they can exploit to their own advantage?  In England a Cabinet Minister was driven out of public life for allowing Budget secrets to leak out.  Is it going to be the practice in this country that a privileged few can go <Col N="777" /> into the Minister's office, there discuss with him future Government policy and be calmly informed a fortnight or three weeks before the Dáil hears about it, that there is going to be a monopoly conferred on a certain company, so that if there are any profits to be got, they can purchase the shares of that company before the public hears the news?  I think that is one of the perils of bureaucracy.  It is bound to happen from time to time where you have a universal bureaucracy operating in a country.  Has the Minister adverted to that aspect of the situation?  Is it right that a small group is going to go into consultation with the Minister and ascertain from him that he is going to restrict exports to one company whose shares are on the open market?  These people can then buy the shares, sit tight on them until the Minister announces that imports will be restricted to that company and dispose of them at a handsome profit or having acquired them they can retain them at an enhanced price.  They get in on the ground floor.  I think great precaution should be taken in future to ensure that if the Minister makes up his mind to adopt a course of that kind vitally affecting the future fortunes of a public company, the shares of which are on the Stock Exchange, he should make his intention known publicly the very moment he deems it expedient to communicate his decision to anybody but a trusted civil servant who can be depended upon to maintain strict confidence in a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that Cement Limited will import all cement and therefore they will get it cheaper.  I am convinced that that statement was made with the intention of suggesting that this plan for a monopoly was going greatly to benefit the consumers of cement.  The Minister is an astute debater and when he found himself lassooed, he immediately submitted and admitted that there was no intention of allowing that superior purchasing power in Cement, Limited, to benefit the purchaser at all, that the only body which would benefit was the Exchequer and that any additional <Col N="778" /> benefit that might accrue to the bulk purchaser of cement was going to be collared for the Exchequer through the licence fees which he proposed to fix.  Section 15 is the section under which the licence fee is to be levied and until we hear from the Minister what price he proposes to fix for domestic cement we cannot know how much revenue he intends to extract from that section.  Let the House bear this in mind, that if the Exchequer ever gets into difficulties and wants money, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be pressed by the Minister for Finance to let Cement, Limited profiteer.  Every half-crown Cement Limited puts on the price of cement means 2/6 per ton on the 130,000 tons of cement this country will have to import so if the Minister is short of £30,000 or £40,000 he can get it for the Exchequer and permit Cement Limited to raise the price by 5/-.  Automatically by his licence fee he rakes in a new revenue which he otherwise would have to do without. That seems to me a thoroughly unsound proposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister swept through Part V of the original, Act by saying that it was proposed to make certain minor alterations in that part of the Act and that accordingly he was substituting Part III of this Act for Part V of the original Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. We are repealing Part V.  We are not making any minor alterations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, the Minister is reproducing Part V of the original Act in Part III of the Bill but the Minister desires to mislead the House as to the effect of that.  He reproduces in Part III, Part V of the original Act, but he omits Section 39 contained in that part of the original Act.  I remember Section 39 and the House attached great importance to it.  Section 39 provided that if the Minister gave a licence for the importation of cement, all the conditions would have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Not only the name and address of the licensee but all the conditions attached to the licence would have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, &mdash;the nature <Col N="779" /> and quality of the cement, the country in which such cement was manufactured, the country from which such cement was authorised by such licence to be imported, and the port through which such cement was authorised to be imported, also the quantity of cement authorised by such licence to be imported, and the rate fixed by the Minister for the purpose of the calculation of the fee payable under Part V of the Act in respect of such licence.  All these items of information were to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  All that is being swept away now by the amending Bill and the Minister did not think it necessary to mention that fact to the House at all. He did not even advert to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything, he can get away with without telling, he likes to get away with without telling.  I feel that the discussion of this Bill without the vital information relevant to Section 16, that is, the price of domestic cement, is practically impossible. However, I want to direct the attention of the House, to a proviso in Section 9 of the Bill which I think is a new section altogether and is not in substitution for any section in the original Act that I have been able to trace. Paragraph 5, sub-section I (b) provides that an order made by the Minister in relation to transport works shall specify the manner in which the transport works to which such order relates are to be constructed.  I take it that that means that the Minister may by regulation, determine all the conditions under which the structural work is to be done and the terms of employment fixed.  Does he intend to use these powers to correct such abuses as have been going on in connection with the erection of alcohol factories?  I do not know whether the Minister has similar powers in connection with the alcohol factories or not but I do know that in alcohol factories in the County Monaghan, political supporters of the Minister have gone to the management and caused <Col N="780" /> persons whom they did not like to be dismissed from their work on the construction of the alcohol factory and in the operation of the factory. Does paragraph 5 give the Minister power to interfere in such cases, if they should arise in the cement factory?  If it does, I think those powers should be used, because there is no more disgusting form of tyranny than to rob the working man of his day's wages, because he is not prepared to do what the local political boss wants him to do.  That has actually happened in Monaghan.  It is a very notorious and disgusting abuse. Up to the time I saw this Bill, I was not aware that the Minister could be imagined to have any power in regard to any enterprise of this kind.  This suggests to me that he has some power, and I want to know does he intend to use this power to prevent the corrupt abuse of political influence of the kind I have described, because, if he does, I think it would be almost worth while giving him this power to see if he can use it effectively.</P>
      <P>I very much doubt if this cement experiment is going to be of advantage to anybody in the country.  Cement is the raw material of the building industry. The building industry has employed more men in the last five years than any new industry which has been started under the high tariffs which have been established.  The building industry has provided indirect employment in the form of slate quarries, timber, and a variety of other commodities produced in this country.  If the raw materials of that industry are forced up too high, it must result in a reduction of building. If it does, it will result in a very serious loss to several industries that depend for their existence on the steady maintenance of the present rate of building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great many people think that this cement factory is going to provide immense additional employment.  If you offset the unemployment that will be created by the increased cost of cement, plus the unemployment that will be created at every port and dock in Ireland amongst the dockers who habitually handle cement&mdash;and, mind <Col N="781" /> you, that means a very big thing to a small port like Sligo&mdash;against the number of men who will get the very unpleasant type of work that a cement factory affords, I doubt very much whether there will be an additional man put in a job in this country.  It is going to cost a very large sum, and I say it is going to provide a very questionable class of employment.  It is one of those classes of employment that seriously jeopardise the health of everyone engaged in them, although, of course, adequate protection can be provided by wearing masks and taking precautions of that kind.  I take it that the Minister will see that these precautions are taken.  But, it is by no means one of the most attractive forms of work that a man could earn his living at.</P>
    <P>On the balance, I do not know what advantage we are getting by this experiment. On the balance, I have very little doubt that looking at the thing from the community point of view, it is going to involve the State in a substantial national loss.  The only basis upon which it can be justified is that it makes some contribution towards the realisation of the ideal of national self-sufficiency.  I say that no greater curse ever descended upon a nation than the loathsome delusion that national self-sufficiency was a desirable end towards which one should work. Of all the hateful and abominable doctrines that were ever advanced by any economic heretic in the world that of economic self-sufficiency is the worst.  It is absolutely impossible of realisation, and every step you take towards it involves your people in untold suffering and hastens the dissolution of all civilised inter-relation between States in the world.  This is not a perfect world, and we have got to endure in many cases the lesser of two evils.  Sometimes it may be necessary and right to impose a tariff so as to avert greater evil; but the insane chase after tariffs that has gone on in this country for the last five years, I have no doubt whatever has imposed immense hardship on our people.  This tariff is going to do its share in increasing the burden.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, in the light of <Col N="782" /> knowledge which we will have when the Minister gives us relevant facts, there may be more to be said.  But, in the meantime, I think the proposals here contained should be looked upon with a very critical eye with a view to protecting, so far as we can, under the scheme proposed by the Minister, the legitimate interests of those who consume cement and whose very existence may depend on being able to get it at a reasonable price.  We ought to remember that children who live in rotten houses may very likely die and, therefore, their existence depends upon getting into a decent house. This Bill may operate to keep many such a one out of such a house until it is too late to bring him in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister made certain points quite clear when introducing this Bill.  He said that Cement Limited were not to be allowed to make any profit on the importation of cement, or, if there were profits made, they were to be applied for the benefit of the company or for the reduction of the price of cement. There is a very great difference between these two alternatives, and I should like the Minister, when replying, definitely to select one or the other.  I think there is a great deal to be said for Cement Limited having the licence to import all the cement that is necessary and, probably, the Minister has arrived at a right conclusion in giving them that power.  At the same time, there should be some safeguards, first of all, that the interests, which were not involved in the manufacture of cement, but were engaged in the business of distributing cement, when they are switched over to serve another master, should have some consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the 5/-licence fee which was imposed on the importation of cement was going to be done away with.  But that is not the only duty imposed on cement.  There is a 10 per cent. emergency duty imposed on English cement, which at present comes to another 4/6, bringing the duty on some cements up to 9/6. Is that going to be done away with as well as the 5/- licence duty? Another point that the Minister can <Col N="783" /> readily understand is that cement cannot be just blown about the country. It is a very heavy bulky article and is subject to considerable costs in handling it.</P>
    <P>While there may be a very fair supply in one part of the country another part of the country may be absolutely without supplies.  How does the Minister intend to treat the people who have got in what I will call an adequate stock of cement, because I do not think anybody has got in an enormous stock of it.  It is a perishable commodity, and nobody, I think, has an extraordinary stock in.  At the same time, as between what is the ordinary stock of cement, and the time that people will take to dispose of it, there must be, I suggest, some machinery for give and take.  The Minister simply cannot blow a whistle or sound a gong and say that after that no licence fees will be refunded, and that no cement can be imported.  I take it that some consideration is going to be given to the cement that at the moment is in the course of transit, as well as to people who have 50 tons or a couple of hundred tons of cement in stock at the moment and who think that they will be out of it in a certain time.  If the quantity that they can import is reduced what position will they be in? Can they claim a refund of the duty? I would like the Minister to deal with that fully; to explain the machinery that he proposes for dealing with that situation, because he can quite easily, in his desire to leave to Cement Limited all the orders possible when they get into production, just miss the tide, and leave the building industry without cement for a couple of months. I am sure he does not wish to do that.</P>
    <P>I think I heard him aright when he said that this company, Cement Limited, are going to manufacture cement of B.S.S. quality and also rapid hardening, and are going to neglect the other minor kinds of specialised cement which are at present being imported into this country.  I take it that these will be imported without duty and without <Col N="784" /> reference to Cement Limited.  I would like to suggest what those are: white cement, coloured crete, buff and red, acrocrete or water repellant, coloured cements and cement mixtures, which include cement and sand.  I have nothing but praise for the Minister's Department, because they are at last seeing sense&mdash;not the nonsense that goes on at the present time in connection with things that are not manufactured in this country, and that could not be manufactured here without considerable steps being taken by the manufacturers.  I would like to bring to the Minister's notice what happens in the case of certain other commodities.  Now, this refers to a commodity which is not manufactured in this country and which if it was intended to manufacture it would, for the plant required, involve an expenditure running into six figures.</P>
    <P>Before we get a licence we must obtain an invoice from the manufacfacturer, which takes two or three days, which we have to submit to the local manufacturer, who will give us a letter stating that they cannot supply. This means another two days.  These letters and invoices we then send to the Department of Industry and Commerce. After three or four days we get a letter stating that they have instructed the Revenue Commissioners to send us a licence.  This we get after a further three or four days.  We then have to submit the licence to the shipping company, who will hand it to the Customs officer, who will release the goods after three or four days.  At least 14 days' delay occurs in all these transactions.</P>
    <P>I put it that at least 14 days' delay occurs in all those transactions.  The Ministry of Industry and Commerce takes three or four days.  In some cases it may take five or six.  The local manufacturer, if his liver is out of order, paws your letter and the invoice over, and he says: &ldquo;You want a letter about it; surely the people can take my goods; this is most unreasonable. Cannot they take the products of the country?&rdquo;  Apparently, the Minister's Department now sees that that sort of thing cannot go on.  It is nonsense.  I do not believe it takes <Col N="785" /> place anywhere else on the face of the earth, and it is awful for business.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have nothing but praise for the Minister if he leaves outside the scope of Cement Limited the things that they do not intend to manufacture.  I would like if he would go further, look back and see if he cannot apply some of his newer ideas to some of the old disabilities that we are groaning under.  If he would do that we would feel very much obliged to him.  There is one other matter that I want to deal with, because it is at the bottom of everything where cement is concerned. Cement used to be the cinderella of the building trade.  It has ceased to be that, and now has crept from the foundations to every part of a building. When you get cement B.S.S. you are always talking about price, but if it is not B.S.S., price does not matter.  I hope the Minister is going to be very particular about the quality of the cement sent out.  I know that it is difficult for the Minister's Department to go into complaints about quality or various other matters when complaints are made.  Remember that the attitude taken about some other things at present cannot be taken up in this respect&mdash;a sort of indication &ldquo;we know one of you is lying but we cannot tell which.&rdquo;  If there is going to be anything wrong with the quality of the cement, it will be a sorry day for the building industry.  For that reason I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to quality.  When the quality is right, the talk is all about price, but if the quality is not right, price does not matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in welcoming this Bill, because it clarifies the position of the cement industry in the immediate future.  I think it is recognised by everybody that if the large commercial interests involved, and the group forming Cement Limited, have been so successful in Great Britain, they can be equally successful here.  If they can make cement in Great Britain we can make it here.  I have not heard any mention in the criticisms of the Bill of the terrible vulnerability of the cement industry in this country in time of war, <Col N="786" /> or in case of an upset in the cement markets of the world.  It seems to me that the position of this country is this, that it is either a dumping ground for cement so that importers do not know where they are, and what price they will get, or that the price is fixed so high by the cartel that in the case of any independent organisation in the building trade or concerned with the importation of cement it is impossible to plan ahead.  Everyone who remembers the last war knows the enormous jumps that took place in the price of cement.  Prices became almost prohibitive. If we have a cement industry here operated by a successful group of men associated with Irish directors who know their job, men acknowledged as leading figures in commercial circles, and with clean records, it is quite obvious that this industry is in safe hands and can be made a great success.  If any criticism is offered it would be to ask, why is it that those with influence, and with an inside connection with the cement industry, who are importing cement for their own use, cannot make some inroads into the international cartel and get cement here on the same terms as some of the larger consumers in Great Britain?  If they cannot do so now it is because the new arrangements which have taken place in Éire in the last 18 months were unforeseen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future the cartel which imports 140,000 tons of cement, might be able to make arrangements by which cement would come here on the same terms as to big consumers in Great Britain.  It amazed me to find out that if some of the big exporters here broke the rule that was arranged amongst themselves, and gave the same price per ton for cement as the big importers here, they would be fined 10/- a ton.  That is a position which shows the vulnerability of Éire as far as cement is concerned even in normal times.  It has been proved beyond the shadow of doubt by those who are in a position to know that we can make first-class cement here.  If it can be made in Great Britain we can make it here.  I think cement importers and those engaged in the <Col N="787" /> trade will be very secure in abnormal times and can visualise the home market being made secure by production here.  I welcome the announcement that there is a possibility of a third factory being set up, which will not be in the hands of an irresponsible group, but in the hands of Irishmen who know their job and whose commercial morality is second to none.  I believe that the Irish cement industry is in safe hands, and that the cement produced will be equal to, if not better, than any in the world.  As far as Cement Limited is concerned, if the profits made or the commissions paid as subsidiary agents are criticised, the Minister has power to investigate and has certain power to fix what is a fair profit.  I am sure that if there is a fair guarantee of reciprocity this big industry is going to be a success.</P>
    <P>The Government naturally is watching its interests and has certain powers of control and perhaps certain financial advantages of a limited kind. I cannot juggle with figures or reply to some of the speeches that have been made, but I know that politics and business never mix, and never will. Statistics can be brought forward to riddle any statements that are made. Anything can be proved with figures. I sincerely hope the Minister will in the interim between Cement Limited coming into full production, and the period during which cement will be imported, keep in touch with those who are in the trade and, if necessary, seek their advice.  As Deputy Dockrell mentioned they have their troubles in trying to get quick deliveries and to burst through the reams of tape that are encountered before getting clearances from warehouses and docks. I take this opportunity to suggest to the Minister that possibly the time has arrived when a special office with special advisers should be set up, to give short-cuts and reasonable help, not only in connection with cement but with many other things so as to facilitate the business community in clearing warehouses at the different ports at which they carry on their lawful trade.  I am certain that Deputy Dockrell can bear me out in <Col N="788" /> one thing, that while nothing but courtesy is shown by these officials, they are tied up by slow, cumbersome methods.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister, when he is concluding, going into the details which I am sure he has been waiting for this debate to bring out, and in which the public will be interested.  Not knowing the Bill in its detailed form, it is difficult to debate it here and extract from the Minister the various details which those interested will seek in his reply. We will leave it to the generosity of the Minister himself to be as detailed as possible, as this is a big industry with a big influence on one of the greatest necessities in Éire, namely, housing.  I understand that coloured cement will not be manufactured in this country, and therefore there will be the normal methods of purchase from outside.  In conclusion, whatever the costs may be&mdash;and I am sure there will be control to ensure that in the matter of costs there will be no exploitation of the consumer, whether he is big or small&mdash;I hope that this industry will have a huge success.  I hope it will add to our independence in the event of war, and in the event of abnormal conditions which nobody can foresee one year ahead or even one week ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to say very much on the present Bill before the House, but there are a few remarks I want to make.  On reading through the measure, I came to the conclusion&mdash;and I think it is a right one&mdash;that this present legislation is going to create a monopoly, that is, assuming that Cement Limited are the possessors of the sole manufacturing licence for cement in Éire, and secondly, that they are going to be the possessors of the sole licence for importing cement.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that, if you are going to create a monopoly, that monopoly should at least be in the hands of the Government.  As a result of past experience, the first thing that struck me is that, if we are going to have a monopoly, we are going to pay more for our cement here in Éire than we were paying before the setting up of <Col N="789" /> Cement Limited.  Taking an associated commodity, that is, asbestos slates, I think a factory was started in Athy, and up to a few months ago, at any rate, asbestos slates up to the standard of the slates made in Athy could be sold in this country after paying the duty at a lower price than the actual slates produced here.  Is that going to happen in regard to cement?  If a monopoly is given to Cement Limited, it is logical to assume, judging by past experience, that we are going to pay more for our cement.  I do not know whether we are or not.  I should like to have the Minister's views on that matter when he is concluding.</P>
      <P>Secondly, on looking through the measure, I find that Cement Limited are given practically complete control over cement.  I think that in this Bill, which is supposed to be a Bill to amend the recent cement legislation, the Minister should tighten up his control over those companies which are getting a monopoly in this country.  I know that under previous legislation the Minister has power, before he grants a licence, to demand that the people seeking the licence shall do certain things, that they shall have a certain amount of capital, and so forth. On looking through the list of directors of Cement Limited, I came across a couple of names which certainly do not belong to Cork or Kerry men.  I think at least two of the directors come from Central Europe.  I do not know whether or not facilities were granted to Irish men here to take up that amount of shares and have that much interest in the company; I am seeking for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I think it is only right when a company is given complete control over producing any commodity in this country, and when they are not under any big supervision by a Government Department, that at least every year their books should be inspected by the Auditor-General.  We know they have to make certain returns to the companies office each year, but I do not think they are satisfactory.  I certainly think that the Minister should avail of this present Bill going through the Dáil to ensure that there will be adequate control over people who are <Col N="790" /> given a monopoly, particularly when we have a lot of foreign gentlemen concerned who we know are sound business men who are not in it for the love of it, but for the sake of what they can get out of it.  I suppose we would all be the same, but I think the books of those companies should certainly be subject to inspection each year by the Auditor-General.  From what I can gather there have been manipulations, in view of the fact that some of them happened to be also directors of kindred companies&mdash; manipulations, which if they had come to light, would not have received the sanction of the Minister.  As I say, I think the Minister should definitely avail of this legislation going through Dáil Éireann to tighten up this control over the people to whom he grants a monopoly.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has any say in the question as to where the cement factories are to be started.  I should like to hear what he has to say on that matter.  I do know that for the past ten or twelve years down around Skerries when a child reaches three years of age the mother says: &ldquo;Come on, Johnny, eat plenty of stirabout, because when you grow up you will get a job in the cement factory which is going to be started in Skerries.&rdquo;  That was promised not alone by this Government, but by the last Government.  Quite recently we read in the paper one morning that we were having a cement factory in Limerick and a cement factory in Drogheda.  I do not know whether or not they are afraid to interfere with the crops of early potatoes in Skerries, or whether the eloquence of Deputy Walsh in Drogheda and the eloquence of Deputy Keyes and Deputy Burke in Limerick has been more effective than that of the public representatives in Dublin.  I do not know whether it is that the walls of the Shannon and the Boyne are better than those of the Irish Sea.  It has actually happened, I think, that a company interested in cement about eight years ago purchased a big amount of land in Skerries for the purpose of starting a cement factory, and we were to have it on our breakfast table <Col N="791" /> wrapped up in paper the following morning.  We have not got it yet.  I wonder whether it is contemplated that we are to have in Skerries the third cement factory mentioned by the Minister?  I do not know whether or not he has any control over that, and I simply suggest that he should certainly avail of this legislation to tighten up his control over those companies to which he gives a monopoly, particularly when there are a lot, or certainly a great many foreign gentlemen concerned, who are mixed up in a great many things in the country we now call Éire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not any intention of taking part in this debate, but when I heard Deputy McGowan talking about what the people of Skerries expected and what they told the children they expected to get, I was reminded of the fact that Drinagh, in my constituency, had a cement factory for 50 long years.  That factory was closed down in the last few years, and previous to this Government taking office in 1932 various promises were made by Fianna Fáil representatives in the County Wexford that one of the first things they would do on obtaining office would be to secure the reestablishment of the Drinagh Cement Works in County Wexford.  I do hope that if the Minister has anything to do with the selecting of the locality in which a third factory is to be located he will bear County Wexford in mind, and I suggest to the Minister that County Wexford has a perfect right to the third factory, if it is to be started.  It has been proved beyond yea or nay that the cement manufactured there in years gone by was second to none and was as good as any cement that has ever been imported into this country.  I am prepared to admit that the machinery there is not up to date machinery, but there is plenty of limestone there and the facilities by way of clay and limestone that would be required for the manufacture of cement.  I earnestly hope that the Minister will do something to ensure that the cement factory will be re-established there.  Quite recently, there have been inspections made in <Col N="792" /> the vicinity by representatives of Cement Ltd., and the people of Wexford are expecting that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will intervene on their behalf, especially in view of the fact that very definite promises were made by his representatives in the County Wexford immediately prior to the General Election of 1932.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that some members of the Party opposite should advise Deputy Dillon that his personal influence, and the influence of his Party in this House, is considerably reduced whenever he resorts to personal abuse in order to conceal his inability to deal adequately with some question that is under discussion.  I can assure Deputy Dillon and his colleagues that, as regards myself, the various insinuations he makes against me do not worry me very much; but there is required from Deputies some contribution to the dignity of this assembly, which is, I think, independent of any purely Party consideration. I did not come here in my personal capacity, whatever Deputy Dillon may think of me personally, and my personal characteristics are of no importance to anybody except himself.  I come here in a representative capacity as a representative of an Irish Government and, as such, I think I am entitled to protection against that form of personal attack, and I think Deputies should try to encourage one another to refrain from it.  That is all I want to say on that matter, but I feel a certain amount of humiliation as an Irishman on every occasion that these tactics are resorted to.</P>

      <P>May I be allowed to congratulate the Minister on that change of front?  It is a very important change in the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I propose to get on with the Bill now.  Reference was made to the licence fee now chargeable and which will continue to be chargeable in connection with the importation of cement.  Deputies are apparently under serious misunderstandings concerning both the intention of the Government in providing for that fee and its effectiveness as regards the price of cement.  When <Col N="793" /> the Cement Act of 1933 was before the Dáil, this country constituted the only competitive market for cement in Europe.  It was the only part of Europe in which cement prices were not controlled by the international cartel.  In consequence of that, the price at which cement was sold here was very much below the price in any other country.  The imposition of a licence fee was decided upon then in order to effect an increase in the price of cement so that the variation that would take place when Irish-made cement became available would not be too considerable.  We, of course, contemplated then that Irish-made cement would be available much earlier than now, but difficulties arose, of which the Dáil is aware, which prevented the plans which were in contemplation in that year being brought to fruition.  In the interval, however, a very substantial change has taken place.  I expressed the opinion in the Dáil on that occasion that the circumstance which left a free market here for cement was purely accidental and would inevitably end, and at the present time, not merely is the price of cement here controlled by a body called the Irish Committee of the Cement Manufacturers' Cartel but that committee also decides from what sources we are going to get our supplies and the percentage of the market which is to be allocated to producers in various countries.  Deputies who may be concerned with the possibility of a monopoly being set up should know that that monopoly exists in its most complete form at the present time, and there is no escape from it, but the institution of this control over our market involved, of course, a very substantial increase in the price of cement, and an increase the extent of which was determined by considerations which had no relation whatever to the licence fee.  I think it is an entirely false assumption to make, that the withdrawal of the licence fee would result in a reduction in the selling price of cement by a penny.  I think the price at which it is sold here is fixed by the cartel only in relation to its saleability.  If a higher price could be secured without any <Col N="794" /> diminution in sales, I think we would have to pay that higher price, and if a falling off in sales necessitated a reduction in price, we would probably get it, and that is entirely independent of the licence fee.</P>
      <P>Now, that circumstance was bound inevitably to arise.  It exists in every other European country, but it is going to exist here only until the importation of cement has ceased in consequence of the establishment of its manufacture here.  Deputy Dillon spoke of this fee being a tax upon the consumers.  I do not think the consumers in this country paid one penny extra for cement in consequence of that fee, and furthermore, in so far as working-class houses are concerned, Deputy Dillon should remember that two-thirds of the cost of such houses is being borne by the State, and therefore all his remarks about the fee being a device to pay revenue in a hidden way were completely beside the point.  Undoubtedly, the State gets revenue from the licence fee, a revenue which is now going to diminish very considerably and which will commence to diminish in the course of a week or two if this is made available here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will go into the pocket of the manufacturer instead of into that of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the other peculiarities of his Parliamentary conduct, I think Deputy Dillon might make a habit of finding out something about the subjects he intends to discuss. I informed the Dáil that the intention was that imported cement should be sold at the same price as home-produced cement.  The cement which will be made available from the Irish factories will be sold at a lower price than that now prevailing for cement.  The price of Irish cement is controlled.  Deputies concerned about the possibility of the cement company making undue profits are forgetting the fact, made known to them, that a very rigid control exists over the activities of the company.  The price at which it will sell cement is fixed in relation to a formula, and it is liable to vary with the variations of certain charges, such as the cost of coal, labour and electricity. The price at which cement will <Col N="795" /> be sold will vary in different parts of the country, as transport charges constitute a very important element in the price which the consumer pays for the cement.  The commencement of manufacture here and the inauguration of the system contemplated by this Bill are going to mean for by far the greater part of the country, if not all the country, a reduction in the price of cement which will be effected despite the fact that the licence fee of 5/- will continue to be chargeable upon imported cement. This arrangement, therefore, is going to benefit consumers, although the State will continue to get its 5/- fee on imported cement.  There is going to be a reduction which will be of a different size in different parts of the country, but which in the case of Dublin may be 3/- or 4/- per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This sounds very like the reduction in taxation by £2,000,000, the increase in our social services and the maintenance of salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sound common sense, and that is why Deputy Dillon has so much difficulty in understanding it.  It is intended that the cement company, by reason of getting the sole licence, will make no profit on the importation of cement.  The maintenance of the licence fee merely ensures that the profit which would otherwise go, if not to Cement Limited, then to the cartel or the distributors, will go instead into the Exchequer, but the price of cement will be no different.  It will be the price at which the Irish cement will be sold and that is regulated by contract between the company and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable amount <Col N="796" /> of nonsense can be talked about the benefits of competition in industry, and we had a fair amount of talk of that description this afternoon.  Let me point out that competition in industry can often be the source of higher prices.  Most Deputies who have given the question of industrial organisation any sort of deep consideration will agree with that statement.  I do not think that anybody will seriously contend that the price of flour would be reduced if competition in the manufacture of flour were intensified. Deputy Dillon alleged that we have eliminated competition altogether, although every other Deputy knows that that is not merely untrue but that it is the very reverse of the truth.  In fact, the bulk of the complaints we get from Deputies concerning the flour-milling industry is in relation to overproduction, about the flour mills being on part-time and about the closing down of flour mills because they are unable to dispose of their stocks.  The existence of excessive stocks and of part-time working in flour mills is not compatible with the contention that competition is entirely eliminated.  It is entirely incorrect to assert that an excess profit amounting to 10/- a sack is being made by Irish flour millers. That contention is so ridiculous that it is not necessary for me to spend any time dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the correct figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  I am aware that some flour millers have made no profit at all and some mills closed down because they were working at a loss.  On the other hand, other flour millers may have been making profits which I or the Deputy might consider excessive; but it is impossible to generalise in this manner.  If we are going to get to the point where we would consider, as Deputy Dillon seems now prepared to consider, the nationalisation of the flour-milling industry, it might be as well to recollect that nationalising the flour-milling industry will not make the slightest bit of difference unless it is followed by rationalisation, unless the process of rationalisation is undertaken for the purpose of eliminating the uneconomic units. <Col N="797" /> There are some who would consider that a good policy.  In certain circumstances perhaps I would, but I believe we could get that without rationalisation, if we wanted to.  If that line of policy were to be pursued are we going to get the support of the Dáil when a number of flour mills are to be closed down in order to effect what would be, in practice, a comparatively small reduction in the price of flour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the mills are closed by a ring which will not let them sell their flour below the figure fixed by the ring.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is misinformed. A flour mill is obliged by law to mill 85 per cent. of its quota. If it fails to mill 85 per cent. it becomes liable to penalties.  The Deputy can easily ascertain by way of parliamentary question how many flour mills have, in fact, become liable to penalties because of their failure to dispose of 85 per cent. of their quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told by some people that the only way effectively to control price is by intensifying competition. I think that is wrong.  It will mean the utilisation of capital for equipment purposes and it may mean the working of that equipment in such an uneconomic manner as will raise the cost of production.  It would mean for the workers the tremendous disadvantage of always being liable to broken time and periodic disemployment, periods in which they will have to be maintained by somebody.  If there are Deputies who think that that is a sound and economic and efficient way to engage in industrial production, I disagree entirely.  I think efficiency, and by efficiency I mean the <Col N="798" /> production of goods of the best quality at the lowest price at which they can be made available, involves the regulation of the quantity of production so as to ensure that it will not run too far in excess of the requirements of the market.</P>

We can reduce the price of flour undoubtedly by acting in a variety of directions, but they are all going to be detrimental to somebody's interest. The greatest good for the greatest number might be secured by bringing down the price of flour, but that is a matter concerning which there will be a difference of opinion varying in extent according to the effect on local or individual interests.  However, that is beside the present point, but I am prepared to discuss the subject with Deputies at any time.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to stand with the Deputy to this extent, that if, in any controlled industry of that kind, development of the nature indicated results in the displacement of workers, some provision for such workers should be made and, in the particular case to which Deputy Keyes refers, an assurance was obtained by me, as he knows, in advance, that any workers displaced in consequence of the change would be provided for by way of pension or in such other way as would be considered satisfactory by me.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon waxed very eloquent about my iniquity in consulting cement importers as to the arrangements to be made concerning the importation of cement.  If I had taken a contrary course of action, he would have criticised me for not consulting the cement importers.  The obvious course for me in a matter of this kind was to get a conference called by my Department of all the cement importers and <Col N="800" /> to discuss with them the arrangements that would be most convenient to meet the difficulties of the temporary period during which a limited quantity of cement would have to be imported.  If I had ignored the cement importers, made a decision on my own and brought that decision into operation without any regard to the convenience of the parties affected, I would have been open to criticism, but I am not open to criticism because I consulted these interests.  They gave me unanimous advice&mdash;all the parties directly interested in this Bill&mdash;and I decided to act on that advice.  That advice is embodied in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon made references to Section 9 (5) of this Bill. He said it was a new paragraph, which shows his lack of research.  The paragraph appears in the original Bill.  He dragged that in for the purpose of making certain allegations with reference to the employment of labour in the alcohol factories.  If Deputy Dillon has received one-tenth of the complaints concerning the politics of the persons employed in these factories that I have received, he must have employed a special staff to deal with them, because I am deluged with allegations from every area in which such a factory exists that nobody is getting employment there except Blueshirts and the sons of Blueshirts.</P>

I know he has peculiar ideas on these matters, but I would like him to develop that idea at some time.

      <P>Deputy Dockrell, unlike Deputy Dillon, had some intelligent observations to make on the Bill.  He asked which of the alternatives to which I referred we were going to adopt&mdash;if the cement was to be imported by the cement company without profit, or if any profit made by them was to be utilised for the purpose of effecting an ail-round reduction in prices.  We will adopt, I think, the first of these alternatives.  It will <Col N="802" /> be a more satisfactory arrangement, but I should like to keep myself free to effect a change if that arrangement did not appear to be working out well. This matter is on a tentative basis. The arrangements which we might make with the company in relation to the issue to them of a licence to import cement could not be fixed in detail until the Bill becomes law.  In any event, I should have to retain liberty to determine that arrangement if it appeared to be working unsatisfactorily from the public point of view.</P>
      <P>The Deputy need have no apprehension in regard to the quality of the cement.  The Act of 1933 gave us power to fix a standard specification of our own.  It prescribes a standard of quality considerably higher than that required by the British standard specification, and it is the intention of the company to ensure that not merely will their own cement conform to that Irish standard, but that the cement to be imported will also conform to that standard, so that the Deputy need have no apprehension whatever that the standard of quality will not be as high as it is.</P>

      <P>What I told the Deputy in relation to cements other than Portland and rapid-hardening cement is that the arrangement contemplated in respect of them&mdash;the <Col N="803" /> issue of sole import licences&mdash;will not apply to these other cements, but it will be necessary for importers of these other cements to get a licence. It would be impossible to allow their importation free of all control because of the difficulties of definition and the possibility of evasion of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Some reference was made to the location of the third factory to be established.  I am not aware that the Government gave any promise to any locality that a cement factory would be established there.  In fact, I am quite certain that no such promise was given because, of course, there are very many areas in this country where the materials which would enable cement to be manufactured exist.  I suppose the basic material in the manufacture of cement is limestone and limestone is one thing we have in abundance in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks what did I do to carry them out.  I asked the promoters of the cement company to inspect each one of these areas and to consider as carefully and as fully as possible their suitability as centres for cement manufacture and to choose for the location of their factories places where cement could be made most efficiently and cheaply and where its distribution to the consumers of the country could be best arranged for.  That is what I propose to do in the future.  In these circumstances, I think it is extremely improbable that this particular cement factory will be established at Skerries or anywhere in the vicinity of Drogheda, and I think that it is just equally improbable that <Col N="804" /> it will be established in the vicinity of Limerick.  I think it likely that it will be established somewhere in the south-eastern portion of this country because, as Deputies know, the cost of the transport of cement is considerable. The price of cement is not the price ex-factory.  The price of cement is the price as delivered where it is to be used.  Therefore, the facilities available for the distribution of the cement with the least possible costs for transport is a very important factor in determining the location of the factory. In view of what I have said, I think it is fair enough to describe the situation as this&mdash;that the people of Wexford are likely to win, that the people of Skerries have not succeeded in getting the ticket at all.  Whether the Wexford runner is to be the winner it is not for me to determine. I think there is very little else for me to add.  I think the various matters of importance raised in the debate have been dealt with.  I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time and I recommend the Dáil to agree with that.</P>

I gather now that there is a general revision of the old specification and that the new specification is to be substituted. I would be glad if the Minister would look into this matter and see whether in the guarantees given when they spoke of the British standard specification the cement company meant the old standard and not the new one?</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £27,664 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount provided for in the year 1938-39 is £41,564 as against £38,209 in the year 1937-1938.  There is an increase of £3,355.  This increase is made up of a number of items mainly as follows:&mdash; (a) an increase of about £1,700 in the estimated amount for cost-of-living bonus; (b) a sum of £550 for &ldquo;legal and technical assistance,&rdquo; as against only £100 last year; (c) inclusion of £100 as allowance to a medical adviser to prison services; (d) routine increases in salaries, that is, officers going up in their scales of pay; one extra clerical officer, and a sum of £400 odd provided <Col N="806" /> for extra help in the accounts branch, mainly because in future we are paying the police fortnightly instead of monthly.  With regard to the increase of £550 for legal and technical assistance as against £100 provided in other years, that £550 will be expended in connection with making rules under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    <P>The sum of £500 is set down for providing technical assistance for the Rule-Making Committees.  We want to have no complaints as to the lack of skilled assistance for the Rule-Making Committee, and I am giving the necessary assistance to the committee.  A sum of £50 is provided for having provided a book on coroner's law.  As Deputies, especially legal Deputies, will appreciate, the Coroners Acts are in a very involved position, going back to 1825 and coming down to 1927.  While the Amendment Act of 1927 made many useful and necessary amendments, it did not consolidate the coroners' code of laws.  I would have been anxious, if pressure of other work permitted, that there should be an Act consolidating the Coroners Acts.  But that not being possible, it has been decided in my Department that the assistance of a coroner of very long standing and who has been familiar with the Coroners Acts should be secured so as to prepare in some way and to codify the laws of the numerous Coroners Acts, explaining them and making them easily accessible and easily understandable.  It is for that purpose that this money is being provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has treated the House with very scant courtesy in his explanation of his Vote.  I feel like repeating many of the things he said in days gone by on this Vote but I think that we have arrived at the stage when no useful purpose would be served by so doing.  Therefore, I am going to confine myself solely to my view of the Minister's administration of his Department and the various services that come under his control and for which he is responsible.  The Minister for Justice in any country has a very important function to discharge.  In a country like this, it is imperative that <Col N="807" /> justice should be even-handed and that it should be administered without fear, favour or affection, but so many things have happened within the last couple of years that the most partial supporter of the Government has to admit that things are not exactly as he would desire.  I do not know exactly where I should start or what is the most glaring instance upon which one could put one's finger.  The Minister has told us about increases in his Department.  I could very easily make the case that there was no necessity for these increases.  He has not made any attempt to defend his action upon matters of grave public importance that must have come to his notice within the last 12 months. Rightly or wrongly, the Government has undertaken a policy of imposing hardships on the agricultural community and as the Minister has said himself, arising out of that, certain incidents have taken place all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the gravest of these incidents occurred at a place called Marsh's yard in Cork.  There has been a considerable amount of comment in regard to that incident.  A colleague of mine on the front bench has said many things about it.  The High Courts of this country have said something about it but the Minister blandly forgets all that and makes no mention whatever of the fact that such an incident occurred.  He has made no attempt whatever to justify the conduct of his Department in connection with that particular incident.  Did the Minister read the learned judges' finding?  Does the Minister think that it is something to be ignored and that it is not worthy of comment or what steps has the Minister taken to deal with the matter in an equitable fashion, as becoming a Minister for Justice in any country?  Far be it from me to make any attack whatever upon the Gárda Síochána.  I think they are a most admirable body, generally speaking, and that they have discharged their duties in a fair manner but what has been described by somebody as an excrescence, was placed upon them, which was guilty of <Col N="808" /> certain offences and the Minister here ignores these offences as if they had never happened.  The courts of our country took cognisance of them and yet we have no mention of them here. I am not going into the matter more fully than that but when the Minister is replying to this Vote I want him to say positively what defence he has in that particular matter.  I want to put it to him that he is on his defence in this House for his conduct in that matter and that he will have to show cause why he took the line he did.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community has suffered.  Nobody knows that better than the Minister.  He comes from a rural constituency, just as I do, and he knows the hardships the people have undergone.  It is admitted that even Cromwell in his hey-day could not wreck homes more completely than they have been wrecked.  Speaking here in this House on a previous occasion, I said that there was a moral obligation on Governments, as well as on individuals, if they damaged an individual or a Government even, to make restitution for the damage so inflicted.  No attempt has been made to render such restitution; it has been pushed off in the most light-handed fashion.  Again the Minister for Justice or his Department is responsible for making regulations by which fees are collected when court messengers make seizures.  We all know that court messengers go out and make seizures on five, six, seven, eight, nine or perhaps ten farms on the one day.  In reality the cost involved is the cost of only one trip and yet the sum collected from each of the ten farmers is as considerable as if there was only one farmer concerned. The Minister for Justice is responsible for increasing the amounts collected from these unfortunate farmers by 15 or 20 per cent.  When the farmer says to the messenger &ldquo;You made only one run to carry out all these seizures; why should I have to pay for the whole lot?&rdquo;, the only thing the unfortunate court messenger can say is &ldquo;Write to the Minister for Justice about it.&rdquo;  The Minister, knowing as he does, that that is an important factor in the administration of justice <Col N="809" /> in this country, blandly ignored it as if it were a matter of no importance.</P>
    <P>Again my mind goes back to Government promises.  My colleague sitting here on the front bench and other members of the then Government were responsible for certain reductions in the pay of the Gárda Síochána.  I have no hesitation in saying that that is so.  But the present Government promised the Guards that if they were put into office that would be a matter which would be soon remedied.  To-day the Guards get 9d a week extra.  Again the Minister for Justice makes no comment whatever upon that, although it is one of his primary responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Party also promised to set up a commission of inquiry into the working of the Town Tenants' Act and into ground rents and leases, etc., and after six years almost they are as far away as ever from it.  The Minister for Justice is responsible for that as it comes under his own Department. But, in asking the House to vote this sum for that Department, he blandly ignores it.  Then, everybody knows that an alteration is absolutely essential in connection with the Malicious Injuries Act, which was imposed upon this country to punish the ordinary Irish people.  Yet the Minister and the Government keep it there, just as if Britain were still governing us.  The Minister knows that it is an important matter and he should have told the House what his intentions were about it when asking for a Vote like this.  But he ignores it.  It is true to say that the House must pass this Vote because it is essential that the Department of Justice should go on. But I want the members of the House, irrespective of Party, to tell the Minister what they think of these particular matters.  The Minister has told us that there is an increase for legal and technical assistance and that brings me to another point.  I want to know why certain people were struck off the panel of counsel acting for the State and, when some of them were struck off, why they were put back.</P>

      <P>Then I will raise it on that Vote.  I appeal to the House not to be silent on an important question like this, because there are times when we should all say things that we believe to be necessary.  That refers not only to members of the Opposition, but to members of the Labour Party, the Independents, and members of the Government Party.  I want them to tell the Government what exactly they think upon the various matters I have raised.  I want to say to the Minister that, replying on this Vote, he should say why he has not taken some action or made some gesture in support of the courts that are functioning under his Department.  When that judgment was given against members of a body for whom he is responsible, it was blandly ignored, and I want to hear from the Minister why it was.  The House should impress upon the Minister that he cannot discharge the responsibilities of his office by ignoring important matters that arise under it, especially those which have arisen during the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to avail of this opportunity to protest against the way in which the Department of Justice has either ignored the existence of the Moneylenders Act and the Road Traffic Act or failed in its duty of seeing that these Acts were administered in an impartial and straightforward way.  Some time ago I put a question to the Minister asking him to state the number of cases in which complaints had been made to the Department, the number of prosecutions which had been instituted, and the number of convictions which had been secured in connection with the administration of the Moneylenders Act.  The figures given by the Minister on that occasion disclosed the fact that a considerable number of complaints had been made to the Department but that, as against that, very few convictions had been secured.  The failure to secure convictions <Col N="811" /> was, in my opinion, due to laxity on the part of the Department.  I wonder is the Minister aware of the glaring manner in which the Act is being ignored or openly evaded in the City and County of Dublin to-day? Cases have come under my notice where the Gárdaí appear to be blind to what is going on.  I want to know who is responsible for the administration of the Act and whether it is his desire that that Act should be administered in the way intended when passed by this House after considerable discussion and as the result of a commission set up by the Minister which made a very lengthy report.</P>
      <P>I also want to protest, as I have done in writing in one or two cases, at the way in which the Road Traffic Act is being evaded or ignored.  I allege that the evasion in this particular case is due to the light way, apparently, in which the Department of Justice takes its responsibility in the matter.  I want to make it quite clear that, so far as my knowledge goes, it is not due to a deliberate desire on the part of the Guards or a failure to do their duty. I want to hear what the Minister has to say in connection with this particular matter.  The Road Traffic Act was passed by this House after considerable discussion and as a result of the report of an inter-departmental committee representing the various Departments, including, I believe, the Department of Justice.  The Act, I presume, was passed with the intention of carrying it out in a fair and impartial way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to worry the House by quoting a large number of cases, but I will be pardoned for quoting the particulars of one case which I sent to the Minister some time ago and which he either refused or failed to take any notice of.  This is a case where a road pirate was brought before the Naas District Court in the early part of December last for a number of motoring offences, including non-registration, alleged fraudulent use of registration plates on a lorry, no certificate of insurance, and no driver's licence.  It was stated that there were 170 previous convictions against the defendant <Col N="812" /> and that he had paid £150 in fines.  I am sure Deputy Costello will excuse me for giving that gentleman the title of road pirate, a gentleman who has no respect whatever for any law in regard to registration, the payment of licence fees, or anything else.  The justice complimented Guard So-and-so and Guard So-and-so on their thorough investigation of the case and on the manner in which they had laid the facts before the court.  &ldquo;From these facts, however, he did not think that the defendant had done anything deliberately dishonest&rdquo;&mdash;I want to emphasise the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and in the circumstances he dismissed the summons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, this is a gentleman who would be regarded with a good deal of leniency by Deputies who take and support the gombeenman's point of view.  I say that because of statements I have heard made in this matter inside and outside of the House.  They will say that this man renders a great service to the community; that he carries goods from the wholesaler to the retailer at a very low rate compared to other transport companies which pay decent rates of wages and give decent working conditions to their employees.  Those Deputies will say that a gentleman of this type is rendering a great service to the community by carrying tea, sugar and other commodities from the wholesaler to the retailer at a charge 50 or 75 per cent. below what the honest carrier charges, whether he carries by road, rail, canal or by air, if you like. When I hear those people support the action of a gombeenman of that kind I often wonder whether they take the trouble to find out if the retailer, who gets the benefit of low road rates from this road pirate, passes on the benefit to the community by a reduction in the prices of the commodities he sells. I do not think that he does.</P>
    <P>This is the type of individual who is getting a good deal of sympathy from the Minister and from those who sit behind him on the Government Benches.  I received a reply to that communication indicating that the Minister did not see any justification for censuring anybody connected with this particular case.  I have no <Col N="813" /> intimate knowledge of the alleged efficient way in which the Guards presented this case to the justice, but there is no doubt about it that the justice took a very generous view of the Road Traffic Act in dismissing the summons against that gentleman.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, sir. I fully support the appeal that has been made by Deputy MacEoin to the Minister for Justice to say whether, even now, he is prepared to recommend that the cuts in the pay and allowances of the Gárda Síochána should be restored.  These cuts were put into operation at a time when the cost of living was much lower than it is to-day, and there is, in my opinion, and in the opinion of this Party, a glaring case for a Minister who opposed such a policy, when he was in Opposition, to restore the cuts which should never have been put into operation.  I hope the Minister will make his personal position, and the position of the Ministry, on this matter clear, because he has failed to do so in response to the innumerable questions <Col N="815" /> which have been addressed to him on the subject in this House in the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>I would also like to know whether the Minister has any up-to-date information to give the House and the country in reference to the promises made by himself and his colleagues when in opposition particularly, and even since they came into office, to introduce and pass the long-promised Town Tenants Bill.  A commission has been sitting in secret, nibbling at this business for a considerable period. The last that I heard from the Minister on this matter was this: that when the commission now sitting had finished its work, he would then probably set up another commission for the purpose of inquiring into a matter with which he himself appears to have been fully acquainted.  Every member of this House knows that the Minister for Justice himself has full knowledge of the demands of the town tenants of this country, and that he has given expression to his views on public platforms as well as in this House when he was in opposition.  He then said that he would support certain measures if and when his Party and himself got into power.  They have been in power since early in 1932, and it is time, therefore, that the Minister who, according to himself, knows the subject so well, made up his mind one way or the other and told the town tenants of the country whether he is going to introduce a Bill along the lines promised by his Party when in opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Corry who, I am glad to see, has come into the House will contribute something to the discussion on this matter because, apart from the Minister, there was no one more vocal on this subject when in opposition than Deputy Corry and some of the back benchers of the Party. I am sure that the Minister will not take exception to Deputy Corry intervening in the debate and giving us his views as to whether the delay in meeting the reasonable demands of the town tenants of the country has been unavoidable and, if so, letting us have the reasons why the Town Tenants <Col N="816" /> Bill promised by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1932 and 1933 has not been introduced and passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied that it is in the best interest of justice that magisterial investigations in cases of murder should be held in camera.  Murder is the greatest of all crimes and when the hangman is finished nothing further can be said.  I am against capital punishment but, in my opinion the system of holding magisterial investigations in private is not wholesome.  A person charged with murder is put into the dock for trial and very little is known about the case beyond what appeared in the newspapers when the crime was committed.  No one knows anything about the witnesses, their position in life or their character.  All these things were formerly canvassed amongst the people, as these crimes make a very serious impression on the public mind.  Unfortunately we have three young men awaiting trial in Dublin, and all sorts of statements are heard as to what may happen.  These men will be in the dock for two or three days and the newspapers will then convey to the general public information concerning the evidence. But people will not be able to make up their minds clearly as to whether a criminal deserved punishment or whether there might not be extenuating circumstances connected with the crimes.  Efforts are also made to get <Col N="817" /> a reprieve.  I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister is the best judge here.  Probably he would not allow this procedure to continue unless he was satisfied that it was right.  However, as the public are left in the dark as to what evidence might be produced in such cases the Minister ought to consider the position carefully.  It is a question on which this House should express an opinion.  The practice of holding investigations in camera might extend further than the crime of murder.  Of course, there are certain offences where the trial, in the interests of common decency, should be held in camera.  I raise the matter so that the Minister could give the House the reasons why he has allowed this practice and to know if he is going to continue it.</P>
      <P>In connection with the question raised by Deputy MacEoin, I am in sympathy there as far as married men are concerned. In Dublin especially, the social standards of the class to which they belong are carefully maintained, and the wife and children of these men must always appear in public genteely clad. They must live up to a certain standard, and unless they are provided with means to do so, I am afraid the lives of married policemen are not very happy.</P>

As rents are very high in Dublin, I wonder how a policeman with a wife and five or six children is able to manage.  The workingman may be more free and easy.  Probably he may not have the same responsibilities and the same standard may not be expected <Col N="818" /> from him.  The Minister might consider the efforts that are being made to have the pay increased, certainly in the case of married Gárdaí.  As far as I am concerned, I am willing to give him any support I can.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to deprive Deputy Corry of the opportunity of speaking now, but I am sure the delay will be a short one, and that I shall have the pleasure of hearing him later. Deputy MacEoin referred to matters that arise on this Estimate, and from the public point of view they are far and away the most important matters for discussion this year.  I shall refer first to a number of minor points before dealing with the really grave matter referred to by Deputy MacEoin, and the points that fall for decision in reference to the facts in connection with Marsh's yard shooting.  I am in entire agreement with Deputy Davin in his plea that prosecutions under the Traffic Acts should be taken with complete impartiality. It was a point that I had intended to raise, because, in the course of my experience in court, I have come to the conclusion that a number of prosecutions that take place after an accident occurs, are dictated perhaps by motives which should not enter into the case when the Guards or whoever is responsible for selecting the person to be prosecuted come to make their decision as to which of the two or more parties involved in the accident would be prosecuted.  I have frequently seen that motor accidents are followed by prosecutions.  Where two cars are involved, the police take upon themselves the right to decide which of these parties was the one to be named as defendant in a criminal proceeding. They decide that one person was to be prosecuted and the other was not. When the matter was thrashed out in civil proceedings before a jury the facts frequently made it quite apparent that the Guards had no right to select the particular person they selected.  I have seen frequent instances where the Guards selected for prosecution a stranger involved in an accident, while the local man, who might also be involved, was not prosecuted.  In these cases where accidents occur, I think the very greatest discretion ought to be <Col N="819" /> exercised by the Guards as to the person they will prosecute.  It ought not to be left to the discretion of the local Guards, which is a matter of frequent occurrence, that one of the parties involved in the accident is to be prosecuted and the other is not.  It has been impossible, when the facts were gone into subsequently, to ascertain on what principle one particular individual was prosecuted while another was not.  There ought not to be indiscriminate prosecutions after motor accidents.  Even in serious cases of manslaughter there ought not to be indiscriminate criminal prosecutions. In many cases where accidents unfortunately occur involving loss of life it is fairly clear, when all the facts have been sifted, and all the evidence collected, that no jury would convict in the particular circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In numerous instances prosecutions have been brought in the District Court in cases where there is no possible chance of convictions being secured by the State.  The result of that is that the motorist is put to the degradation of standing in the dock. He has had the unfortunate experience of causing the death of a fellow-creature, and on top of that he finds himself in the degrading position of being in the dock as a criminal. During lunch time even he is not allowed out for his lunch.  At a time before a conviction is obtained, at a time when the State has not yet proved its case, and when, according to the old principles, he is still innocent, he is brought to the cells, where he must as best he may obtain his own luncheon during the luncheon period.  In addition to all that, he has, of course, the expense of conducting his own defence in the District Court. It is well known that insurance policies on motor cars do not in the vast majority of cases cover the defence of a person involved in a manslaughter case arising out of a motor accident.  He has to conduct his defence entirely at his own expense.  I think there ought to be very considerable care exercised in the selection of the cases that will be sent forward to the District Justice for preliminary <Col N="820" /> hearing in the case of manslaughter.  The matter ought to be very carefully considered before the police take action.  Apart from the hardship that may be caused to the particular motorist involved, there is this consideration from the public point of view, that if case after case is sent forward to a jury, either in the City of Dublin or in the country, an attitude of mind will be engendered in juries that those are cases which ought not to be brought before them, and in which they will never convict.  Even in cases where there ought to be a conviction, no conviction will be obtained from the jury as a result of too numerous prosecutions for manslaughter.</P>
    <P>During the time when I had the conduct of criminal proceedings in this country I found the position obtaining that it was the policy not merely of the Department of Justice but the general rule of the Guards that every case, irrespective of the facts or the merits, where a death was involved should come before the district justice for investigation.  So far as it was in my power I put an end to that practice, which was a wrong and insidious practice from every point of view. There were two cases which came before me where prosecutions were instituted in particularly painful circumstances. I think the procedure I laid down at that time has been followed in the Attorney - General's Department, but I think this is the proper occasion again to secure from the Minister an undertaking that in all those cases the greatest possible care will be exercised, and that it will not be merely the rule of thumb for the Guards where a death has occurred in a motor accident to institute criminal proceedings for manslaughter.</P>
    <P>There is another matter affecting the administration of justice to which I again wish to direct the Minister's attention this year.  I think for several years past I have mentioned this matter in the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  So far as I have been able to see in my own practice, no useful purpose has been served by directing the notice of the Minister on successive <Col N="821" /> years to the evil which I think exists.  I refer to the practice in connection with the production in court by Guards who are subpoenaed to give evidence in civil cases of negligence, arising out of motor car accidents, of the statements made by people to the Guards after the accidents, and the production of sketch maps made by the Guards immediately after the accident.  We go through the solemn farce in every negligence action of serving a subpoena on the Guards. Equally, they go through the solemn farce of saying that they have in their pocket those particular sketch maps which they made, and in their other pocket they have the statements which were made by witnesses and the persons involved in the accident.  Of course, they will not produce them unless his lordship tells them to do so, and his lordship invariably tells them to do so.</P>
    <P>The position is that it has become more and more clear that civil cases of negligence are being determined or decided or depend to a very large extent on the evidence of a Guard who comes and takes measurements, and takes a note of the position of the motor cars after the accident.  He sees the position immediately afterwards, and he is presumed to be an independent investigator acting in the interests of truth and justice.  At least, that is the rôle he plays when he comes to give evidence in the civil action between the parties involved in the action for damages arising out of a collision between motor cars.  But very frequently, we find ourselves in this position in court, that the Guards know certain things which occurred after the accident.  They know that immediately after the accident certain statements were made by people interested in the accident.  The parties involved in the case do not know and have no means of knowing what is in the statements that the Guards have taken.  If you do happen by chance to get a look at the statements, or to take a chance on what is in the statements, then you can cross-examine a particular witness about what he said to the Guards, but that is the full length to which you can go without knowing what is in the statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> I should like to impress on the Minister, in the interests of justice&mdash; not in the interests of either the plaintiff or the defendant in those negligence cases, because it cuts both ways in cases arising out of motor collisions &mdash; that those statements made by witnesses after the accident, and sketch maps made by the Guard who investigates the occurrence, should be open to inspection by both parties to a civil action after any criminal proceedings which have been taken have been determined.  Those statements presumably have their origin in connection with the possibility of criminal proceedings being taken by the Guards in reference to the facts of the collision.  Once those criminal proceedings are out of the way, the interests of truth and justice demand that the parties on both sides should know what case was made by the various people to the Guards immediately after the accident.  Neither party should find himself in the position that a witness would get into the box before a jury and give a different account from what, immediately after the accident, he alleged to the Guards took place.</P>
    <P>I do think that the position at the moment is extremely embarrassing and anomalous.  It leads nowhere except to impede the ascertainment of the truth in connection with those motor accidents.  I can see no reason why there should be any privilege in connection with those statements, or in connection with sketch maps made by the Guards.  They have, in fact, been put in evidence, I think, in practically every case in one way or another, but it leads to the position that the people, not knowing what is in those statements, cannot ascertain it without putting the Guard into the box, and even then the statements are not evidence unless you happen to know by intuition or by chance that a particular witness has made a statement in evidence before the jury contradictory of what he made to the Guard when he was investigating the accident immediately after the occurrence.  Those civil actions for negligence are heard many months, sometimes years, after the occurrence.  The Guards are there immediately after the accident, and <Col N="823" /> take statements from people immediately after the occurrence of the accident between the two motor cars. Statements made by people while the facts are fresh in their minds are very much more valuable than statements made months, or even years after, in a court of law, when they may have been thinking over it and talking to the various interested parties, and have persuaded themselves quite honestly, without any intention to commit perjury, that a certain state of affairs did, in fact, occur.  I have pressed for several years that this practice should be given effect to; that the Guards should have a direction that maps made by them after the occurrence of an accident should be available for the inspection of both parties to a civil action, and that any statements made by the parties should be available to both parties in a civil action after the termination of any criminal proceedings which may have been instituted by the Guards.</P>
    <P>Arising out of Deputy Davin's plea that motor prosecutions should be brought impartially, there is one case that I want to bring before the attention of the Minister, with a view to seeing whether or not he considers that, in fact, motor prosecutions are being brought impartially.  It is the case of a prosecution recently of a person who was alleged to be involved in a collision here in the City of Dublin, in which the driver of one of the Ministerial cars was involved.  This particular gentleman had a very long list of casualties, shall we say, fatal and otherwise, to his discredit.  The gentleman who was prosecuted was driving a motor car down along the south side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am speaking of criminal proceedings, and the Minister knows that they have no reference whatever to any civil proceedings.  I am speaking of the scandal involved in the prosecution of a private individual, when what happened was that the driver of a Ministerial car committed what was characterised in court, and properly characterised, as deliberate perjury, and which could have been nothing else in view of the fact that emerged in the course of the case. This man who was giving evidence gave a story that was contradicted in every single detail by the independent witness.  Actually, he swept up on the footpath and knocked down several people, and he had the audacity to say in court and to swear in court that it was the other man who had left his proper side of the road, when the evidence conclusively proved, and was accepted by the district justice, that the man who was prosecuted was innocent of any offence, innocent of any malice or of any fault whatever in connection with the driving of his car that day, and that the whole casualties that were caused on that night were caused by the driving of this driver of a Ministerial motor car who had such a long list of casualties to his discredit.  But he was not prosecuted.  I want to know is he still in the employment of the State?  Why was he not prosecuted, and why was the other man selected? I believe and I allege here that there is a considerable amount of partiality in connection with the prosecution of motor offences, and I think it is time that that was stopped.  I give that example as an outstanding case of a gross scandal in connection with prosecutions. I want to know, is that man still going to be kept in the Guards, and is he going to be allowed to kill and maim people, even on the footpath &mdash; because that is what he did in this case?  He was not prosecuted.  It was the innocent person, who was driving his own motor car on his proper side of the road, who was prosecuted. The driver of the Ministerial car was in a hurry, as it transpired, because he was late for his appointment with his <Col N="825" /> Minister, but he was not prosecuted. He perjured himself in the box in order to justify the people who directed the prosecution against an innocent motorist and put this individual into the witness-box to perjure himself.  I want to know, is that sort of thing going to be stopped?  If it is not going to stop, or to be put a stop to, you are going to bring the administration of justice in this country into very considerable disrepute.</P>
      <P>Now, before I speak about Marsh's Yard, there are one or two minor matters that I wish to refer to.  I spoke last year on the necessity for the Minister setting up something like a law revision committee &mdash; always with the warning that on such a committee, as far as possible, all or any cranks should be carefully excluded.  There is no doubt that, in connection with the modernisation of our legal system and, in particular, certain specified branches of it, we are lagging very distinctly behind modern tendencies and modern legislation in other countries.  There ought to be, as I have pressed here years before without avail, some sort of expert committee to see in what respect the administration of justice may be brought into line with modern requirements.  Having failed to get, I think, two successive Attorney-Generals to bring in and foster the necessary legislation to deal with some of these points that urgently require modernisation in the courts, I intend to introduce a Bill myself.  I do not wish to give myself the trouble of preparing a Private Bill, but I see no other way of dealing with it and I propose to do it, having endeavoured for years past without result to get the Department of Justice to do something other than administer Dogs Acts and things of that sort, and to do something in connection with the modernisation of the law, both criminal and civil, in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice here in the Estimate for the Department of Justice, at page 113, that there is a sum of £50, fees for the preparation of a book on coroners' law. That item rather intrigued me when I saw it.  I make no complaint about the preparation of a book on coroners' law, although it would appear to me <Col N="826" /> that the standard work on the matter is pretty well reliable, and coroners' law, after all, is not a very useful branch or a branch that is of very much use in the courts at the present time.  I should like to know, first of all, who wrote the book and why it was required, and lastly I should like to know can we all have a look at it?  If the public have to pay £50 for it, surely it ought to be at the disposal of members of the legal profession in some shape or another, or is the sum of £50 to be spent exclusively for the delectation of the officials of the Department of Justice?  As I say, it is an intriguing item, and why it should be there at all passes my understanding. I thought that the standard work contained everything that anybody wanted in that connection.  The institution of coroners' law is antiquated and out of date, but perhaps the Minister wants to have a brand new system of coroners' law and coroners' juries and inquests.  I should be interested to hear what he has to say in regard to this very intriguing item. Perhaps he intends to get an inquest held on himself and on the misdeeds of his Department during some years past and wants, even now at this late stage, to see that the conduct in reference to that enquiry conformed to the law.</P>
    <P>The most important matter arising on the Estimate this year, as I said at the outset, arises in connection with incidents in the shooting in Marsh's Yard and the case of Lynch-Fitzgerald which has been decided recently by the courts.  It is not necessary to go into the detailed facts of that case.  The result was that the officials employed by the Minister for Justice, armed with lethal weapons, were condemned by the High Court and by the Supreme Court of this country.  That case involved the taxpayers in very considerable expense.  I think I am right in saying that no more expensive civil bill was ever instituted in this country or any other neighbouring countries, or, I think, in any other country.  The plaintiff in the case of Lynch and Fitzgerald, which raised the whole issue on the right of these parties to fire to kill, brought his proceedings in <Col N="827" /> the Circuit Court in Cork, placing his pecuniary loss by the death of his son at the very moderate sum of £300.  That was, perhaps, a mistake on his part, but, being a poor man, he thought he was not in a position to undertake the risk of High Court proceedings.  He brought it in what is supposed to be the poor man's court in the local venue in Cork.  The costs of that £300 civil bill, which in ordinary cases would not amount, I suppose, to more than £100, have involved the taxpayers in a sum between £2,000 and £3,000.  A rather expensive defence on an indefensible case.</P>
    <P>The State were not content to allow this poor man to bring his case in the poor man's court.  They had to transfer it to the High Court.  They were afraid to leave the case to the decision of a Cork jury, and equally they were afraid to leave the case to the decision of an independent Dublin City jury.  Having transferred the case from Cork on the ground that they did not think that these indefensible criminals, the defendants, would get a square do from a Cork jury, they suddenly discovered that the plaintiff was not entitled to a jury at all and they moved to the High Court accordingly, successfully, and then having selected their venue in Dublin, the case was heard by a judge without a jury, and he gave a judgment which will go down on the records of this country as a monument to the independence of the judiciary, and as a reprobation of the official attitude in connection with the shooting of this young boy, Lynch, in Marsh's yard on that fatal day.  The case was heard very fully and with complete impartiality, and during the course of that case before the learned judge who heard it in the High Court matters came out in evidence that must have shocked the conscience of any fair-minded citizen of this State.</P>
    <P>The judge decided the case against the defendants and awarded the fullest damages that he could in the circumstances.  Actually he came to the conclusion that the damages suffered by the father of the murdered boy were more than the amount <Col N="828" /> claimed, because there was only £300 to be given in the Circuit Court process, and he directed, so great was his feeling in connection with the evidence that had been blatantly and unashamedly given by the criminals in that case, who are still, as far as we know, in the employment of the State, that the papers be sent to the Attorney-General with a view to a prosecution for the felony that they had admitted they committed in Marsh's yard on that day.  What has become of that? Has any prosecution been instituted? Months have passed since the Supreme Court, before whom this case came, decided in favour of the plaintiff and upheld the decision of the learned High Court judge.  What has become of the recommendation, to put it no higher, of the High Court judge to prosecute these people?</P>
    <P>These gentlemen, and I use the word in the greatest possible irony, should have been prosecuted by the Minister or by the Attorney-General without any recommendation and on the facts as they emerged and as they were admitted during the hearing in the High Court.  Not content with the decision of the High Court judge in the manner selected by themselves, these defendants, who had behind them the whole resources of the State, brought this impoverished farmer, the plaintiff, who had lost his son, to the Supreme Court and then they must needs bring a motion, to add further costs to the expenses of the taxpayers, that the execution for £300 awarded by the High Court judge should be stayed, and £500 had to be lodged in Court by the State as a condition precedent to that permission being granted.</P>
    <P>The case lasted seven or eight days in the Supreme Court and the costs of that £300 process will amount to something in the region of £3,000. Fortunately, the Government decided to reimburse the plaintiff for the costs that he had been put to in connection with that case &mdash; at least I will give them the credit for having the decency to do that &mdash; but it is the taxpayers' money they used to fight a case that should never have been fought.  That case was brought into <Col N="829" /> every court that it could possibly be brought into, at the expense of the taxpayers, and a wholly unsustainable appeal was brought into and dismissed by the Supreme Court, with costs. Again the taxpayer has to pay it and now the net result is this, that these three defendants have been convicted of a felony by a High Court judge and that has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of this country, the full Supreme Court of this country, and what has the Minister done in reference to that matter?</P>
    <P>It transpired in the course of the case that the ring-leader of this gang of criminals who operated in Marsh's yard that day, so far from being dismissed or reprimanded for the action he took, was actually promoted.  He got into the box and, in a most naked and unashamed fashion, he gloried in the action he had taken.  He said he had shot to kill, and each of the others stated the same, with the exception of one man who said the only reason he had not shot to kill was that after taking aim with a view to killing he came to the conclusion that he would not hit his target, and that was the only reason he had not shot to kill on that occasion in Marsh's yard. Are these people in the employment of the State still?  Are they paid by the taxpayers and, if so, is it intended that that scandal should be continued?</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of prosecuting these people, is it intended, in the face of their evidence and the condemnation of their action by the courts and the blatant confession they made and gloried in, in the witness box &mdash; is it intended they should be continued in soft jobs, with promotion, at the expense of the State?  I myself saw the ringleader of that gang of criminals sitting with one of the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party inside in the restaurant after a direction had been given, or a recommendation made, by the High Court judge that he should be prosecuted for a felony.  Promotion, and consorting with members of the Parliament of the people!</P>
    <P>Now, this case raises vast issues. Fortunately, we have now authoritatively laid down in a judgment which, <Col N="830" /> for erudition and clarity, cannot be equalled in any of the books of British law, the principles that guide the use of force by the State forces against the civilian population.  At least that good has come out of the case.  Now we know that these people, if again they shoot to kill, will know that they will be tried, if there is a Government that has any regard for the interests of the public, any regard for their own responsibilities, any regard for the sanctity of human life, that if, again, Sergeant Moore and his companions shoot to kill, that it will not be for the felony of manslaughter but for the felony of murder that they must stand their trial before their fellowmen.  We have that good at least out of this case.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister taken steps to see that the forces of the State, whether they are these gentlemen, who apparently are still in the employment of the State, or any other branch of the police forces of this country, know these principles and are prepared to put them into practice?  It transpired in the course of the case that a memorandum had been issued, during the time General O'Duffy was Commissioner of the Guards, setting forth in the clearest and concisest possible fashion the duties of members of the police force who carried lethal weapons, when they were confronted with riot or civil commotion on the part of the civilian population.  These criminals, Sergeant Moore and his companions, admitted in the witness box that these instructions had been brought to their notice and they were familiar with them, but that they ignored them.</P>

      <P>In my submission and opinion, having regard to the admissions made by these people on that day, they can be described as nothing else, and I am entitled so to describe <Col N="831" /> them, with great respect.  We have the question of the particular individuals involved in this case to consider.  Mr. Lynch lost his son, and he got the insignificant sum of £300 to compensate him for the loss of the son who looked after his farm and who, probably, would be the successor to the farm in County Cork.  We have other people who were injured in Marsh's Yard that day, and I want to know if it is the intention of the Minister to compensate them, having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court in this action.  I am well aware that the Minister can take refuge in the technical point that more than six months have elapsed and that no action was brought, but I do say that, in common justice and equity &mdash; apart from legal technicalities &mdash; the men who were injured that day, whether they were part of the crowd engaged in the riot or not, are entitled, having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court, to be compensated by the State.  The one case brought involved the plaintiff in several motions, in a High Court action and in an appeal to the Supreme Court.  As I have said, the costs were nearly £3,000.  Failure to bring these six or seven other actions pending the hearing of this one can be easily overlooked from the point of view of the technical requirements of the Public Authorities Protection Act, and the Minister ought, with the full approval of the Government, to pay out of public funds compensation to those people who were injured on that day by the action of the defendants in the case of Lynch and Fitzgerald.  To that extent this case affects the individual. Whether these people are to be prosecuted or not, whether they are to retain their positions in the forces of the State at the expense of the taxpayer, whether the other persons involved in the occurrence that day and who were seriously injured are to be compensated &mdash; all these are matters of importance to the individuals, perhaps, but there is greater importance to the public and to the State in this case. It is from that point of view I emphasise this case more than from any other point of view.  The law is as it <Col N="832" /> has always been thought to be.  Since this decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Lynch and Fitzgerald it has become the law of this nation that, even over wrongdoers, the law will, in the interest of the sanctity of human life, cast its protection.  I want the Minister, responsible as he is for the conduct and discipline of the police force, to see that the principles authoritatively laid down in the case of Lynch and Fitzgerald will be strictly and rigidly adhered to in the future, that the public interest will be the first concern and not merely the interest of the individual who is going around attending auctions and making money at the expense of the farmers. His interest should not be the paramount consideration.  The paramount consideration should be the sanctity of human life.</P>
      <P>Arising out of this case, I want to mention a matter and, having mentioned it, leave it, because it may arise in court.  I do not wish to discuss it now, although I should be entitled to do so.  We are all familiar with O'Neill as the type of gentleman who is imported into Marsh's Yard.  Everybody thought that O'Neill was one individual who went around buying the cattle seized from the farmers, but it transpired &mdash; in the Lynch and Fitzgerald case &mdash;that there were three O'Neills.  It has come to my knowledge, in the course of a case, that there is an O'Neill engaged as an official buyer in connection with the auction of seized goods.  In reference to goods seized by a county registrar or his sheriff, in execution of a court decree, he will have at his beck and call a gentleman named O'Neill, known as the official buyer.  I had intended to discuss this matter at greater length, but, as it may arise in a case which is pending, I shall not discuss it further.  This Estimate should not, however, be allowed to pass without a statement from the Minister as to whether this alleged official buyer is going to become part of the institutions of the State.</P>

      <P>Two questions arise on this Estimate.  One is the Minister's management of his <Col N="833" /> Department generally; the other is his control of the Gárda Síochána.  There is a separate Vote for the latter, but I take it that anything I may have to say with regard to that can be properly said on this Vote.  To keep the Votes separate would be practically impossible. Dealing with the general question of the administration of the law, I am glad to find that £500 is to be paid to a draftsman in connection with the revision of the rules of court.  Why the payment is not made in guineas, as all payments to professional men are, I do not know.  Leaving that point aside, I should like to know what rules are to be revised.  Are they to be the Circuit Court rules or the High Court rules or all rules?  The rule-making committee, naturally, has a responsibility in this matter.  The Minister, in answer to a question I put to him a short time ago, agreed that the schedule of costs in the Circuit Court required revision, particularly in the case of title actions, actions for assault and actions for slander.  I take it that the Minister is summoning the rule-making committee for the Circuit Court, but I want to know if any other rules are to be revised.  If it is merely a question of drafting the rules of the Circuit Court, £500 is a very large fee, but if Wylie had to be rewritten, I would not consider £500 an excessive fee, because it would involve an enormous amount of labour.  But if £500 is going to be spent merely for advising the draftsmen or for revising the Circuit Court rules, it strikes me as being extremely large.  I would like a little more detail from the Minister than he has given.  I entirely approve of having the rules of court revised. But, after all, no rules ever drafted will come out perfect.  It is only by the experience of seeing them at work that you are able to decide whether they are working well or whether they require to be cast into the melting pot again &mdash; in fact whether they require revision.  That is only to be learned by experience.  There has been considerable experience in the working of the Circuit Court and it has become perfectly clear that some alterations are required.  I will not go into that matter in any more detail now.  But <Col N="834" /> I would like to know precisely what rules are being revised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain aspect in connection with the administration of the Guards to which I wish to refer.  I am personally, and I have always been, of opinion that the Garda force in this country is a credit to the country, apart from one particular branch called the S Branch.  It is called another name outside, but in this House it cannot bear the name it bears outside, and so I will call it the S Branch.  Apart from that Branch the Guards do their work as well as they can reasonably be expected to do it.  But there are very grave complaints in parts of the country that there are insufficient Guards.  And because there are insufficient Guards the police work is not being done.  Take one example, and here is a thing about which the inhabitants of Ballinrobe are very strong.  In Ballinrobe for a very long time past a series of larcenies were going on at night.  There never was a night patrol and the Guards never went on duty at night.  It was thoroughly well known that they did not go on duty at night.  It was said they did not have enough men to do night patrol.  Accordingly there was no protection of property during the night, and some young gentlemen who wanted to help themselves then proceeded to do so, and they did it without any let or hindrance at all.  That went on for a long time, and it culminated in one of them getting four years' imprisonment and the others substantial terms. These persons, in order to hide their stealings, burned down various houses in the town.  They did many thousands of pounds' worth of damage, and the county is very angry indeed.  The reason for that is that there were not sufficient police available to patrol the streets at night, as they ought to be patrolled.  I do not know how far the blame is due to the Guards themselves. There may be no blame attachable to them at all.  It may be entirely because the town is under-policed.  I have some figures here.  More correct figures may be quoted should there be a mistake in the figures I am giving.  My information is that there used to be twenty Royal Irish Constabulary stationed in this town.  There are now only six Guards.  These six Guards are not able <Col N="835" /> to control the criminals; the work has not been done, crime has got out of hand and large sums have now to be paid in compensation by the people of Mayo.  Two houses were on two separate occasions set on fire and burned down.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us any explanation as to why these crimes were possible in Ballinrobe?  Was it because of the absence of a night patrol?  Can the Minister tell us that he has made arrangements and that he will see that a night patrol will be on duty in future there?  This is the business of the Commissioner of the Guards, of course, and it shows great incompetence on the part of the heads of the Guards if there are no night patrols.  The heads of the Guards are responsible to the Minister.  I want an undertaking by the Minister that there will be sufficient Guards in the various towns of the country; that sufficient protection will be given to property and that property will not lie for months and months unprotected, as it has lain in Ballinrobe.  The result is that the people of that town and district have suffered heavily.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in the course of this discussion to the demands of the Guards for extra pay.  I do not think that that situation has been very happily handled at all by the Minister.  The Guards and their representative body were very anxious to put their case before the Minister. I think the Minister should have sent for the representative body, and I think he should have been very anxious to see that body.  Certainly in my time, and before my time, and, I think, in the time of Mr. Justice Geoghegan when he was Minister for Justice, the Minister not only saw but was most anxious to see and discuss with the representative body every question in dispute.  But the present Minister mishandled the situation and did not discuss the matter with them. The representative body was sent home in disgrace by the commissioner as bad boys.  I do not think that that was a happy handling of a somewhat difficult situation.</P>
    <P>As to whether the case for an increase of salary to the Guards has <Col N="836" /> been made out by the representative body, I should say that is a matter for careful inquiry.  The question is, are the Guards, in fact, able to live on the pay which they receive?  That is a matter of fact.  Their budgets can be examined, and the representative body can give facts and figures to the Minister.  I am told that the ordinary Guard who is not extravagant or a spendthrift is not able to make ends meet because the cost of living is too high.  The Guards, I am told, are getting heavily into debt.  That is not limited to the spendthrift Guards.  It applies to the ordinary Guard.  If that is the case then the position is very bad, because if the ordinary Guard gets into debt he cannot be impartial.  It is very hard, in the case of a breach of the law by a grocer, for the Guard to prosecute him if he happens to be in his debt.  The Guard must be financially independent. Whether that is or is not the case I am not definitely in a position to state. I certainly think that the Minister should make very careful inquiries and he should go into the matter very fully.  I do not think that a brusque answer is quite the way to deal with a question of that kind.  The Minister should give this very careful consideration and not wait for months and months, finally coming to no decision and sending the representative body home.  That is not the way a matter of this kind should be dealt with.  Tact is required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has already dealt at considerable length with the Minister's attitude with reference to the case of Marsh's Yard.  This is not a new case. It has been mentioned in this House already, but within the last year it has taken on a completely new aspect. Prior to that the Minister could say: &ldquo;I made up my mind that the people in Marsh's Yard were justified.&rdquo;  He cannot take up that attitude now; though it was open to him before it is not open to him now.</P>
    <P>The matter has been investigated; it has been fully heard; a judicial decision has been given upon it and a very fine judgment by one of our High Court judges has been delivered.  It has gone to the Supreme Court and that judgment has been affirmed.  It <Col N="837" /> is not open to the Minister now to say that there was any justification for the firing in Marsh's Yard.  How the Minister managed to get into the state of mind that he ever thought there could be any conceivable justification for it, beats me.  How any man could have cheated himself into the belief into which the Minister seems to have cheated himself, that there could be any justification for that appalling act, I could never understand. Certainly the Minister cannot put that forward now.  Here we have men who took human life without any justifications &mdash; it was so found by a competent tribunal &mdash; a matter about which there can be no human doubt at all and the judge says that these men should be prosecuted.  The case is so clear, the wrong done is so flagrant, the outrage on the public is so appalling, that the judge says that there should be a prosecution.  Is there a prosecution?  Not at all.  What has happened to the men who have broken the law.  What has happened to the law-breakers?  Promotion! Are we now to learn that, if a man breaks the law, if a man takes the life of his brother man without just cause or excuse or with no cause or excuse, our Minister is going to say: &ldquo;Good fellow; you shot to kill; you committed a crime and the way to get on in the Guards, the way to get promotion in the Guards, the way to be turned into a sergeant when you have only got a year's service, is to commit crime&rdquo;?  That is what the Minister has done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stood over the crime and he has rewarded crime. He cannot deny it.  I ask him why? I ask him how he is going to explain to this House and the country why he has rewarded crime with promotion? That is not the only thing about this &ldquo;S&rdquo; branch.  It is not the only case in which the &ldquo;S&rdquo; branch have been involved.  There are others.  That excrescence on the Guards, as it was described by Judge Hanna in this case to which I have referred, should be abolished.  The Guards should not be disgraced and the good name of the whole force should not be dragged in the mud, because these men should never have been Guards.  They have <Col N="838" /> not got the character, the disposition or the self-restraint to be Guards. Those men who are disgracing the name of the Guards should not be kept in the Guards.  The whole branch should be thoroughly remodelled and put in charge of picked men of the Guards, men of real experience, trustworthy and reliable men and there are hundreds of them in the Guards.  The &ldquo;S&rdquo; branch could be made, as it used to be, a credit to the force, not a disgrace and an excrescence upon it as it is.  I hope the Minister is going to change his policy in that regard. Nothing would delight me more than to hear him say when he comes to reply that he is going to do away with that branch and re-man it under men who are tried, experienced and trustworthy Guards.  I should like to hear him say that.  I should like to hear him say, too, that he is going to see that crime will not be an avenue to promotion in the police force.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  The State dealt with this Marsh's yard case in, I think, the correct way after it had fought the case for these men.  It is very doubtful whether the State should have fought the case but they decided to pay the costs of Lynch and the amount of the decree given Lynch.  That was quite right but it did not go far enough.  Let there be no doubt about it.  There were some 11 or 12 men shot by the Guards without justification. The Guards broke the law. There was no justification, and those young lads who were injured and who were shot down should receive compensation from the State.  There ought to be an inquiry, if necessary, set up by the Minister to ascertain the extent of the damage and the amount of compensation that ought to be given. That is a matter for which there is precedent after precedent.  There was never a time before in which the Department for Justice was satisfied that wrong had been done by the Guards when compensation was not paid.  Why is that precedent not followed here?</P>
    <P>I certainly urge upon the Minister, as vigorously as I can, that common justice means that these men have been wronged by the servants of the State. <Col N="839" /> They have been shot down and wounded by the servants of the State, one of them very badly wounded indeed.  Surely these men should now, according to precedent, receive compensation.  I know they are action-barred. They could have taken proceedings themselves within six months of the shooting.  At the end of the six months, the Public Authorities Protection Act was there to protect the Guards, but the State should not rely upon a technicality like that.  When the servants of the State have done a wrong to citizens of the State, the Department ought to repair that wrong to the citizens of the State when it lies within their power to do so.  I do sincerely hope that when the Minister comes to reply, and when he comes to tell us what his policy is going to be for the future, it will show a very great divergence from what his policy has been in the past.  I hope that the Minister will tell the House that he is determined to see that when the Guards break the law they will not be the masters of the law but that they will be the servants of the law.  They are supposed to be the enforcers of the law.  I hope he will tell us that, when they break the law, they will not be regarded as persons sacred and apart but that they will be dealt with as any other member of the community would be dealt with, that they will not be retained in the force, and, above all, that they will not be promoted in the force as a reward for their criminal activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in support of those who have already spoken in connection with the question of the restoration of the cuts in the pay of the Gárda.  The length of time which the Minister and the Government took to consider their attitude in that matter led everybody in the country to believe that they were about to re-establish the rates of pay which the Gárda had some years ago. The Minister is aware that when the Gárda force was established their salaries were based on the findings of the Desborough Commission.  These rates have been already in operation in Northern Ireland and in Great <Col N="840" /> Britain, and they are being strictly adhered to both in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland.  Representations were made to the Minister by bodies all over the country.  These bodies were composed of all shades of political opinion, and they all agreed that the Gárda have been very badly treated.  I think everybody was very much surprised when the Minister made his announcement recently that the only thing that the Government were about to restore was the boot allowance of 9d. per week.  To my mind, that was an insult to the Gárda, and I think we can congratulate them on the wonderful restraint they have shown in face of the treatment meted out to them.  Deputy Kelly, in the course of his remarks, suggested that the cuts should be restored only in so far as married men are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, as far as this Party is concerned, they would not at all agree to any differentiation between married and single Gárdaí.  I would ask the Minister, as others have already asked him, to reconsider the decision of the Government on this matter.  The Gárdaí are expected to maintain a certain status.  They are expected to live in houses which cost considerably more than those in which an ordinary person would live.  I think the Minister, on reconsideration, will have to admit that the Gárdaí have been very badly treated.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the Cumann na nGaedheal Government had stayed in office, the cuts would have been restored long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter in connection with the duty of the Gárdaí to which I wish to refer.  Certain Gárdaí are sent from the Depôt at election times to do special work in the country, and months elapse before these Gárdaí are paid their expenses.  I think that is very undesirable.  When a man is sent to a strange area at election time, and <Col N="841" /> is involved in certain expenses, it is not at all fair that he should be kept out of the expenses to which he is entitled for three or four months.  As a matter of fact, I understand that some of the expenses incurred by the Gárda at the last election in July have not yet been paid.  I ask the Minister to attend to that matter immediately.</P>
    <P>This time two years, and I think this time 12 months again, when the Gárda Estimate was under consideration, I referred to the question of the housing of the Gárda, especially so far as the larger towns are concerned.  The Minister is, I think, familiar with the difficulties with which Gárda are confronted in the different towns, where it is very hard for them to get housing accommodation.  I suggested on the previous occasion that the Minister should consult with the Minister for Local Government with a view to getting that Minister to release from the Local Loans Fund a sum sufficient to enable a terrace of houses to be built for the Gárda in the different towns.  If that could be done it would relieve the situation considerably.  We all know that Gárda are being charged as much as 15/- and £1 for rooms, and that they are housed under wretched conditions. Ordinary people cannot have respect for a Gárda if he is housed under such conditions as I have suggested.  I am certain that a decent house could be built and let to a Gárda at 12/- a week. As I say, they are now paying from 15/-to £1 per week.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where Gárdaí have been transferred from one town to another, or one village to another, and have had to leave their wives and families behind them because they cannot get proper housing accommodation. I suggest to the Minister that that is a disgraceful state of affairs and that something should be done to remedy it.  We are not living in normal times so far as housing is concerned. House-building was neglected in this country over a long period, with the result that housing accommodation is very scarce at present, and it will be absolutely necessary for the Minister to do something in order to have the Gárda housed properly.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions also I raised the question of medical attendance for <Col N="842" /> the Gárda.  At present, so far as I know, a Gárda is himself entitled to certain medical attendance, but that is not extended to his wife and family. The Minister may say that it is not extended to civilians either.  But, when we had the R.I.C. here, this medical attendance was extended to the wives and families of the men.  I suggest that that position of affairs should be re-established, because a Gárda is supposed to occupy a certain position, and he is a fair mark for everybody.  When the doctor attends a Gárda's family his fees are inclined to be rather higher than for an ordinary civilian.  For that reason, I suggest to the Minister that it would not cost the State very much more if these facilities were extended to the Gárda's families.  Again I ask the Minister to go into the question of housing for the Gárda, because they are housed in the different places under wretched conditions, and it is not at all fair, when a Gárda sergeant or a Gárda is transferred from one place to another, that he has to leave his wife and family behind him because of the absence of proper housing accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were one or two items dealt with already which I should like to emphasise.  The first was mentioned by Deputy Costello and it arose on the question of prosecutions arising out of motor accidents.  To my own knowledge &mdash; and I have a fairly considerable experience of this &mdash; there is a very dangerous practice growing up amongst the Gárda authorities in dealing with motor accidents.  The practice has grown up of putting the Guard who happens to investigate the occurrence into the position of judge and jury.  An accident happens in which two motor cars are involved.  The Guards are called and take statements on the spot from various people and also measurements.  They then go back to the barracks and report and subsequently decide &mdash; without having been there when the accident took place, from what is pointed out to them after the accident had taken place, and from what they were told by people after the accident &mdash; to prosecute one of the parties to the accident for reckless driving and to let the other go free. <Col N="843" /> It does not always follow that the Guards are correct and that they prosecute the right man.  I will go so far as to say that in 60 per cent. of the cases they prosecute the wrong man. I know of a case where the Guards prosecuted one party to an accident and the prosecution was dismissed, and the insurance company for the other party did not feel that their own case was strong enough to risk going into court in a civil action and settled out of court, despite the fact that the Guards prosecuted the other party for reckless driving on the statements they got when they came on the scene.</P>
      <P>I impress on the Minister that there is a very dangerous practice growing up in that way, and that it is not at all in the interests of justice and of the parties and the public that an individual Guard should go to a cross-roads where an accident took place and put himself in the position of judge and jury in deciding who is in the wrong from what he has been told by the parties to the accident; practically deciding on who is in the wrong by the statement made to him by the cleverest person, or the person who makes the cleverest statement to him.  It is the person who happens to have his wits about him after the accident and who makes the best statement who will get off scot free, while the honest person, the person who will tell the truth and own up to what has happened, will be prosecuted by the Guards, and very often in the wrong.  I suggest that that is a matter which should be carefully considered.  I do not think it is at all right that that practice should grow up. I do not think that there is any possible good in permitting Guards practically to prejudge the issues before the case is tried in court.  It is a matter that should be dealt with very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which Deputy MacEoin referred and in which I should like to support him and that is the question of the Malicious Injuries Acts.  Time and again we see shocking impositions put on the ratepayers in various parts of the country owing to the action of some criminal who may or may not be convicted.  Everyone knows the history of these Acts; that they were brought in to protect certain <Col N="844" /> people in circumstances which are not there now and will never arise again in this country.  It is time that something was done about taking this imposition off the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>We had an example recently in the West of what the actions of certain criminals cost the ratepayers of a certain small area.  Time and again Circuit Court judges have commented on the fact that they have to give a decree to be levied off a very small area and that it creates a terrible hardship and imposition on the ratepayers of the area.  At the present state of our civilisation there ought to be some other means of dealing with matters like that.  At present when a criminal sets fire to a house and is convicted and gets a term of imprisonment, the honest, decent people of the neighbourhood are expected to compensate the injured person for his misdeeds.  People not concerned in the crime have to pay in the rates for a number of years for the act of a criminal.  I suggest to the Minister that the time has come to look into this matter of the Malicious Injuries Acts.  It is time, I think, to get away from that system.  There is no intrinsic good in it.  Nine times out of ten the results that flow from it mean an imposition on the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The case of Lynch v. Fitzgerald and others was dealt with at length and with great feeling by Deputy Costello, but at the same time I could not allow this occasion to pass without saying something on it.  It was said here by one Deputy that this Vote for the Department of Justice is one that must be passed, that it is necessary for the maintenance of the State and of law and order.  I, for one, will be no party to the passing of this Vote until I hear from the Minister that some action has been taken against the people who were decreed in the High Court and whose appeal was dismissed in the Supreme Court in the case of Lynch v. Fitzgerald and others.  I cannot believe that it is the policy of the Government, or of the Minister for Justice, that where an employee of the Department of Justice commits an offence against the law he is not going to be dealt with, but rather that <Col N="845" /> he is going to be maintained in his position.  If it is the fact that an employee of that Department who breaks the law is going to be dealt with, why were the people concerned in this case not dealt with?</P>
    <P>In some very trivial cases the Department of Justice, during the past four years, dismissed officials for offences that would not bear, under any circumstances, any comparison with what took place in Marsh's yard. I can give one example.  An employee of the Department of Justice was charged with ordinary assault.  He was charged in connection with a fight that took place, an ordinary common-or-garden country row.  The decision of the court in that case was a dismiss under the Probation Act, but that employee of the Department of Justice, a civil bill officer, was out of his job within a fortnight of the court's decision being given &mdash; he was out of his job as a law-breaker and as a person not fit to serve under the ægis of the Department of Justice.  That was a case of common assault dealt with in a district court.  It was not even an indictable offence, and yet the man lost his job.  He was considered not to be fit to remain an employee of the Department of Justice, but as far as we know there are people in the employment of that Department to-day who drew down upon themselves from the highest judges in this country the greatest castigation that the members of a defence force or of a police force in this country ever got from our courts.  Those people are still in the employment of the Department of Justice, and, if we are to believe what we hear, they have actually been promoted.</P>
    <P>I want to say for myself that I will not be a party to the passing of this Vote for the Department of Justice while that state of affairs exists.  We may hear fanciful tales of corruption and racketeering in the United States of America and elsewhere, but I say that there is not another State in the world that would dare to justify the keeping on in the police force of people who were condemned by the Supreme Court and the High Court in this country in the terms that those men <Col N="846" /> were condemned.  Credit must go to the State for this, that they paid the costs in the case, although I do not give them much credit for it, because the counsel usually employed by the State, the State's legal luminaries, its heavy batteries, the State's legal brains &mdash; all this was put behind those men, not to fight the case in the ordinary way but to take every crooked advantage and every loophole that the law allowed to try and do the plaintiff out of ever getting his case into court, and of ever getting the action started in the Circuit Court. The first application was to remove it from the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to the High Court in Dublin for one reason, because the people who were defending these men in Marsh's yard were satisfied that they would not get a dismiss from a Cork jury. They were not throwing any aspersions on the decency, honour or truth of a Cork jury when they said that they would not get a dismiss from a Cork jury.  Of course they said they would not get a fair trial.  They asked for a fair trial and they got it.  Having got it, it did not satisfy them.  They took it to the Supreme Court and got a still fairer trial.  What happened?  Those men are still in the employment of the Department of Justice, and the taxpayers have to bear the expenses involved in the legal fight that took place in justifying the action of those people in Marsh's yard.</P>
    <P>That is the position that we are faced with on this Vote.  You have one man dismissed because he was summoned to court for an ordinary street assault.  He was sacked within a fortnight of the court's decision being given, while you have the Department of Justice keeping in its employment men who glorified in their desire to kill: who boasted that they shot to kill.  If anything could ever be said against the Gárda forces, then, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney pointed out, it can be said against the &ldquo;S&rdquo; Branch.  If this was an isolated shooting occurrence, one might not have so much to say about it, but it was not. In that same year there were other shooting occurrences.  There was a shooting case at Kanturk, where a <Col N="847" /> young man was wounded, and the &ldquo;S&rdquo; man who was concerned with that shooting is still a member of the force. There was shooting on another night, when an &ldquo;S&rdquo; man was so drunk that he could not control himself, and he is still in the force.  I have never heard that in these cases there was a reprimand, an inquiry or anything else.  It is due to the sanity of the Irish people, and to the grace of God, that there were not ten killed instead of one during that period, and that there were not 100 wounded instead of ten in Marsh's yard.  All I have to say in conclusion is, whether it is necessary for the upkeep of the State to pass this Estimate or not, while the state of affairs I referred to continues, I will not vote for the passing of this amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed himself in agreement with me last year when I suggested that the form of hearing criminal charges against juveniles should be altered, that instead of being heard in court it would be preferable to hear them in a room analogous to a headmaster's study, and with the least possible formality.  The Minister then stated that these were matters largely within the discretion of the presiding district justice.  I agree.  But I think the Minister might use his influence with the district justices to expedite the effecting of these improvements.  I do not want to go at length into the changes I advocated 12 months ago.  The Minister can find them in the Official Debates, but I press urgently on him that no time should be lost in carrying out that reform.  I want to advocate another reform now.  We are in this difficulty in the matter of the treatment of juveniles, that after they leave court <Col N="848" /> they are handed over to the Department of Education, and that Department has virtually said that it will not do away with Summerhill as a place of detention for juveniles in Dublin. Well, if they will not do away with Summerhill, we cannot make them. But Summerhill is a public scandal.  I want to make a suggestion to the Minister.  At present, when a child is brought before the District Court, the district justice may dismiss the charge, or he may remand the child in the parents' custody, or in the custody of the State.  If he adopts the third method the child is transferred to the Summerhill place of detention and placed in charge of the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister for Justice that he should establish a place of remand for children, and that that place should be a clinic presided over by a qualified matron, and having on its staff a qualified psychologist skilled in dealing with juvenile delinquency and juvenile eccentricity.  The present situation is this, that if a district justice makes up his mind that a child ought to be taken out of its parents' custody, Deputies may assume that the district justice is determined, either that it is incorrigible or that the parents are incompetent to give it the training of which it stands in need.  If a child is really incorrigible, in nine cases out of ten I should say that that child is suffering from some psychological derangement and requires skilled treatment, as the incorrigibility arises from a psychological defect.  If Deputies interested themselves in the proceedings of children's courts, they would be astonished at the high percentage of incorrigible children who on investigation reveal profound psychological disturbances. A child suffering from psychological disturbances of that kind that has to make a sojourn at Summerhill might be very materially improved if put into a good clinic, where it could be watched by skilled persons and properly looked after.  There would be this additional advantage, that when a district justice came finally to determine whether a child should be permanently removed from its parents' custody, put into a reformatory or industrial <Col N="849" /> school, or wherever appeared to be suitable, he would be able to make that decision, not only in the light of the Guard's evidence, but of the extra evidence of the psychologist, or of a doctor fully trained in the treatment of children, and in the interpretation of their symptoms, physical and psychological.</P>
    <P>Many district justices find themselves in immense difficulty when they finally come to decide what to do with these children, because they have not the vital information they want as to whether they are dealing with normal children or mentally sick children.  It is so grave a thing to take away a child from its parents, and from family surroundings by force, and for the State to accept responsibility, that it is a course that should not be adopted, unless and until the district justice is fully informed of every fact of the case, and unless we are satisfied, once a child has been taken into the custody of the State, that it will get all the attention that it is humanly possible to confer upon it, in fact, that it will get the same treatment as the child of the wealthiest parents in this State. That may sound quixotic or unreasonable, but I make the suggestion because the State has no right to take a child from its parents unless the State is satisfied that it is the only way to secure the child's welfare.  No matter what the State does for the child after it is taken out of the family circle, it cannot provide anything which will be as good as the care of a good father and mother. Circumstances may, however, require its removal and, in that event, the State should give the child the best it possibly can give.  That is not being done.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind the position of a poor person's child from Dorset Street who is guilty of some act of naughtiness and is brought before the justice. Normally that child would be let out, remanded back to the parents, or put on probation.  If he is guilty again and again, and eventually comes before the district justice as a child over whom control has been lost by its parents, the child may be put into an institution.  If a child of well-to-do parents continually misbehaves, no <Col N="850" /> one would suggest that it should be brought to the police court to be dealt with.  It would be dealt with by the child's parents, friends or relatives but no one would put it into the dock in the police court.  Therefore, we should be extremely circumspect when circumstances arise that make it necessary for the State to deal with the children of poor people.  Otherwise grave injustice might be done.</P>
    <P>May I direct the Minister's attention to another aspect of the question that I witnessed many times.  I do not want to appear sentimental when dealing with these children, because many of them are extremely precocious and one has to harden one's heart when making up one's mind that some kind of order must be maintained. If you take such a child to court and it is the first time that it leaves its mother's charge, that child is undergoing terrific mental stress. I believe we should take every precaution to mitigate that stress at the earliest possible moment.  Whether it is intended to detain the child for a short time or a long time, we should remember that while the child suffers greatly so do the parents, who are immensely distressed at the idea of a little creature ten or 11 years being taken, whither they do not know, and kept in the charge of the police.  They are usually poor people.  I suggest we should be in the position to say to these people that something is being done, and that the child will be taken from the court and placed in a good school where it will be as well looked after as children of well off people.  If they want to go to see it they should be able to do so, as there were no restrictions, and they were welcome to visit it while on remand. I would like to have an establishment so that when parents went to see children they would recognise that they were being looked after solicitously, and that everything possible was being done for their welfare.</P>
    <P>In addition to the clinical side of it, I submit that some educational facilities should be provided.  It is quite true that if you have a child in your charge only for a week or a fortnight you cannot give it much education.  I know that, but, even if a child does <Col N="851" /> not derive much educational benefit from its classes during this week or fortnight of detention, it does provide the child with a normal kind of occupation, and it does maintain a normal kind of life for the child.  At present, in the Summerhill establishment, as far as I can find out, they sit and twiddle their thumbs.  I remember the Minister for Education congratulating himself that there were practically no children in the Summerhill establishment.  Why? Because the district justice had made up his mind it was such a rotten institution that he would not send a child there if he could possibly send him anywhere else.  I do not want to see that attitude adopted at all.  I should like to have an excellent clinic established, and I would send practically every child who is brought into the police court there for a week, because if I did not find it necessary to advise the magistrate at the end of the week there might be some excellent advice for the parent as to how the child should be treated.  This is going to cost a comparatively trivial sum.  It is going to alter the whole attitude of people who have to bring their children to the Children's Court, and it will bring peace to the minds of everybody who is interested in this problem.  Nobody who is concerned with the question of juvenile delinquency in this country at the present time can rest easy at night. It is a horrible thing and a shocking thing to think that at this moment there may be two or three unfortunate children down in that semi-jail at Summerhill. It is an abomination.  If one of our children were in it we would be sitting on the doorstep trying to bring him some form of comfort or solace. The children of the poor may be there, and they should not be there.</P>
    <P>There is ample goodwill on all sides to remedy this matter if somebody would only take the initiative.  Everybody says it is somebody else's job.  I suggest to the Minister that he should accept responsibility for it, and show example in this matter not only to the rest of the country but to other countries in the world.  Unfortunately, it is true that in America and in England the treatment of juvenile <Col N="852" /> delinquents is far ahead of the system that obtains here.  I think the time has come when we ought not only to catch up on the methods in Great Britain and America but surpass them.  We have a much smaller problem to deal with here, and we ought to be able to do it much more easily than they. Before I pass from that, I would commend to the Minister's attention the experiments of Mayor Haid of New Jersey, United States of America.  I am not at all sure that there is much else in Mayor Haid's administration that I would recommend to the Minister.  Mayor Haid began his career in New Jersey as a delinquent child. He found himself in the police courts as a small boy.  When he subsequently became Mayor of New Jersey his first concern was to set up an ideal administration for the treatment of such children.  His first step in that direction was to establish a central clinic where every delinquent was sent for examination with a view to remedying any defect that might exist.</P>
    <P>The clinic has been an unqualified success, and in the majority of the cases of children brought there it has been discovered that, instead of curative or corrective treatment, what they really wanted was medical treatment of one sort or another.  Many children who would have been started on the ghastly road to jail have been made decent citizens, instead of being hopelessly lost, as they would have been if some kind of clinic had not been in existence.  I cannot too strongly impress on the Minister the urgency of this matter.  I may assure him that, so far as the Department of Education is concerned, he may despair of co-operation.  They are dead from the neck up in the matter of juvenile delinquents.  They convey the idea that it is the Minister for Justice's funeral and that they are not going to break their hearts about it.  I would urge on the Minister for Justice to take it on his shoulders to deal with this matter as it ought to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is a matter in connection with the Gárda Síochána to which I wish to direct the attention of the House.  It emerged during the consideration of the Public Accounts that since 1932 no <Col N="853" /> less than 396 Gárdaí were enrolled in the Gárda Síochána in flagrant violation of the regulations.  So flagrant was the violation that it became necessary to introduce a Bill, which was passed in the last Dáil, to regulate the position.  The position has now been regularised.  I want the Minister to tell us the circumstances under which those Guards were brought into the force, and why he thought it expedient to stand by while the Chief Commissioner set at defiance the regulations laid down by his Department and by this House for the proper recruitment of the Gárda.  The House will remember that the Public Accounts Committee have no opportunity of examining the Chief Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána, who is the officer responsible for the recruitment of the Guards, with the result that we found considerable difficulty, despite the assistance given us by the Accounting Officer of the Department, in getting to the bottom of the facts.  I think the Minister should tell us now what were the circumstances in which he permitted those gross irregularities to take place; that he is prepared to give the House an undertaking that in future such a flagrant departure from the regulations will not be permitted; and that if he desires a wider discretion in recruiting a large number of Guards at a given time, he will come before the House and tell the House what it is he wants.</P>
    <P>I now touch on a matter which I approach with profound reluctance.  It is for me a matter of great difficulty. I have always been a great admirer of the Gárda Síochána.  I have always thought they reflected great credit on this country, and I am now with extreme reluctance forced to say here with a full sense of responsibility that as a citizen observing the force I am not satisfied that the discipline and morale of the Guards is being maintained at the high standard which obtained two or three years ago.  I believe that this is partially due to the fact that the Guards are not sure in their own minds that if they do their duty without fear or favour they will be adequately supported.  I believe now that the remonstrances of interested <Col N="854" /> local politicians play altogether too great a part in the attitude of the Chief Commissioner to the individual members of the Gárda.  I believe that many members of that force are under the impression that if they conduct a licensing prosecution, or if they take to task some local light of the Fianna Fáil Party, an early opportunity will be taken of complaining about them to the Chief Commissioner, and securing their public humiliation either by transfer or by rebuke.  Now, I fully recognise that it is not only the right but the duty of a member of this House&mdash;or indeed of any other citizen &mdash;if he believes any irregularity to be taking place, to come to the Minister, make his complaint and invite an inquiry, but that is a very different thing from bringing covert influence to bear with a view to injuring a man in his profession.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied&mdash;I know that this is a very grave thing to say&mdash;that promotion in the Gárda Síochána at the present time is being carried out strictly in accord with merit.  I think that is a matter about which the Minister should concern himself at once.  In my opinion, it is not right for the Minister to wash his hands of all responsibility in this matter, and to say that it is entirely one for the Chief Commissioner.  The Minister is ultimately responsible to this House and must make himself responsible for the proper discharge of the Chief Commissioner's duties.</P>
    <P>I am not myself certain whether the matter of promotion is exclusively in the hands of the Chief Commissioner or in the hands of the Executive Council, but I am not satisfied, and I do not believe the members of the force are satisfied, that that same impartiality which used to obtain in the force until comparatively recently&mdash;that is, up to the last two or three years&mdash; is being maintained now.  I think it would be a disaster if the impression were allowed to grow that men in the Gárda Síochána would not receive the reward of promotion as the result of earnest and honest discharge of their duty, but rather as a mark of favouritism or nepotism from the superior officers of the force.  No body of <Col N="855" /> police will act unless they are assured that their officers will support them, and no body of officers will support the Guards unless they are satisfied that the Minister is prepared to support them, too.  It is a deplorable thing to have to say the things I have just said, but I believe that it would be no service to a force, of which I am very proud, to cover these things up and to pretend to ignore them.  I believe that the best service we can do the force is to face these things and remedy them at the earliest possible moment.  I am convinced that the Minister knows this just as well as I do, and I believe he is at present in a difficulty trying to devise a means of remedying these evils.  I do not think he should hesitate to institute such an inquiry as will command the confidence of all the officers of the force into the general question of discipline, and I can assure him, and I give him this assurance on behalf of the Opposition, that if he will put his hand to that task, we undertake to make no capital out of it and no reflections upon the Minister or suggestions that the indiscipline or failing morale is exclusively due to those recruits for which he himself and the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were primarily responsible for recruiting.  I think we could make a very controversial case, but I do not think it would be in the service of the State or of the force that we should. On the contrary, I want to assure the Minister that, if these general questions are taken under impartial review, he will receive the sympathetic assistance of all parts of the House.</P>
    <P>We know that a dry-rot of this kind can suddenly manifest itself and that it may be extremely difficult to check. It may be very difficult to find the exact causes for it.  It may be extremely unpopular to tackle it really effectively.  Nevertheless, it is one of the most solemn duties of the Minister for Justice to undertake that task fearlessly.  It might be suggested to him that, politically, it would be vastly inexpedient to do so, as constituting some kind of an admission that through his Government's administration <Col N="856" /> this dry-rot had manifested itself. I give him the assurance that no attempt will be made to make capital out of it.  We are prepared to accept that these difficulties arise in a force from time to time &mdash; in the British police force and in police forces abroad &mdash; and if the responsible Minister tackles the evil firmly it can be made an end of and we can get back on to the rails where all of us wish the force to be.</P>
    <P>Now, there has been trenchant and, I think, fully justified criticism to-day of the Minister's reaction to this matter of the officers who were condemned by the Supreme Court of this State for their conduct in Marsh's yard.  Of course, we all know that that sort of thing is bound to have some effect upon the morale of the force, but before concluding I should like to advert to one of those skilful Parliamentary gestures of the Minister for Justice.  The Minister is an extremely quiet and retiring man, but he is probably the most skilful parliamentarian in this House.  Many men have the gift of making mountains out of molehills, but I know of no man who is more skilful than the Minister in the art of making molehills out of mountains.  His blandness in the face of the present howling scandal, and it is a howling scandal, is a sight for the gods, and I think his attempt to defend it is soothing in the last extreme.  I remember, last year, just as his Estimate was coming to a conclusion, the Minister had one final flourish, and said that there was one thing that could be said in connection with that debate on the Justice Estimate, and that was that there had been less criticism or violent comment than in any year before that.  Now, I want to point the moral of that.  That is quite true.  When Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was Minister for Justice, every ragamuffin in this country who had to be disciplined had sixty defenders in the Fianna Fáil Party, led by the Minister for Justice.  He got up and delivered a loud and thunderous oration about these patriotic lads who stood for Cathleen Ní Houlihan.  The Prime Minister followed and wept bitterly, and said that they were brave fellows in any case, and they all went <Col N="857" /> up in a corroboree as soon as they got into office, and let these people out on their first day of office, and they had not them well out when they had to put them back again.  Did we then hold protest meetings and make thunderous orations about the savage oppression of these gallant heroes who were fighting for Ireland?  Not at all. We never said a word.  We knew perfectly well that these people were where they ought to be and that the Minister had no alternative but to put them there if he wanted to preserve the public peace.  We knew that ten years ago, and we knew it all along, but the difference between the debate on his Estimate when he is Minister and the debate when he was in Opposition on the same Estimate was that he happened to be Minister now and we were in Opposition.  If we were on the Government Benches and had to do the things the Minister had to do, and which he very properly did, the welkin would have rung and everything short of the harp that once through Tara's halls would ring through these benches, and two or three of the Fianna Fáil Deputies would have been carried out screaming.  Deputy Ruttledge, as he then would be, would have wept, and his heart would have bled all over the floor.  That gag is done, and I am happy to think that this extremely shrewd parliamentarian has learned in this House not only skill as a debater but responsibility as a Minister.  That is a good thing, both from the point of view of the Minister himself and from the point of view of the country as a whole, and I can assure him that, if he will put his hand to the task of restoring the Gárda Síochána to the state that every Deputy of this House would wish to see it in and to the state which, I believe, 99 per cent. of the Gárda themselves would wish to see it in, he will be assured of the same forbearance and the same discreet silence as he enjoyed while he had to do certain unpopular things during the last two or three years for the preservation of the public peace. If the Minister will attend to those two matters &mdash; the proper care of children on remand and the re-establishment of the splendid spirit of the Gárda Síochána and the making certain <Col N="858" /> that promotion will be the reward of efficiency and zeal and not of ulterior motives &mdash; then I think this debate will have served a useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended, after listening to four or five speeches from the Opposition Benches, to ask a few questions. The last speaker referred to us when we were in Opposition, but from listening to the speeches from the Opposition to-night it would appear that half of them oppose this Vote, and another half wants the Vote increased. If we are to increase this Vote, are the Opposition prepared to back it up by promoting taxation? Again and again I have listened to criticisms here.  I was very much amazed at the Deputy from Cork when he criticised the sending out of Guards to the scene of an accident.  He states that the Guards should not be allowed to make any investigations or make any reports.  I would like to know what they are for if they are not permitted to do that.  We hear from some Deputies opposite that the Guards are not receiving enough pay and, on the other hand, there are complaints that the cost of the police force generally is excessive.  If the Opposition want the Government or the back benchers of the Government to take their arguments seriously, they should at least have one voice.  We should have their opinion definitely as to whether the Guards are to be called to the scene of an accident on the road or whether they are to report at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the speakers who advocate that malicious injury claims should be spread over the whole country, that they should not be localised.  Over and over again we hear the argument used that the Guards are powerless except they have the civilian population behind them. With that I agree.  In malicious injury claims especially it is necessary that the Guards should have the people behind them.  I think everyone is anxious to put down malicious injuries, and if the Opposition are in earnest in this matter there should be some suggestion as to how the Guards are to be helped out in order to find the culprits.  I heard Deputy Dillon <Col N="859" /> criticising the recruits taken into the Guards, and he also criticised some of the decisions made by Circuit Court and District Court judges.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it was the Deputy who spoke before Deputy Dillon.  He said that the Guards, in giving their evidence, actually give the decision in the courts.  That is a poor tribute to pay to the district justices, 90 per cent. of whom were appointed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. I do not believe that.  I believe the district justices give their decisions on the evidence, and it is unfair to suggest anything else.  It is also unfair to say that the Guards will not make an impartial investigation at the scene of an accident.  Having listened to the division of opinion amongst Fine Gael Deputies, I felt anxious to mention those few matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleagues in asking that the cuts made in the pay of the Gárda Síochána should be restored on the grounds that those men are now facing a period when the cost of living is particularly high, and we cannot have an efficient force unless they are paid a living wage.  That principle was backed up by a body I am a member of, the Cork County Council, who feel, like I do, that these men, who have considerable responsibility, should be paid in accordance with that responsibility. One of the Deputies on the Labour Benches referred to the housing of the Gárda Síochána.  There is no question that when a Guard is transferred, if he is a married man he finds the greatest difficulty in getting a house.  Some try to avail of the non-municipal schemes of housing in order to try to get a place to live in.  That is a side of the question that the Minister should take some cognisance of.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to crime in certain parts of the country, due to the fact that there was an insufficiency of Guards.  That has actually occurred in the parish where I reside.  There was a hold-up not so <Col N="860" /> very long ago; a man was robbed and there was no possible chance of discovering who his assailants were, although it occurred in broad daylight. That is a serious position, and I believe that if there was a sufficiency of Guards such cases could not occur, as the Guards would exercise a certain degree of control over crime in the neighbourhoods where they are stationed.</P>
      <P>I have been too closely associated with the tragedy of Marsh's Yard not to feel intensely the allusions made in reference to it.  When we bear in mind the loss of a young and vigorous man who was shot down by men who appeared to glory in their crime, and when we bear in mind that the unfortunate father and mother who are now without the services of that boy have been repaid by a miserable £300 at the cost of £3,000 to the State, then I think we must extend a certain amount of criticism to the Department that has charge of that particular section.  There were numbers of young men wounded on the same occasion, and those men have got no compensation whatsoever.  What is the Minister prepared to do for those young men who were assailed at a time when they were endeavouring to defend what they looked upon as their rights?  We saw in that yard a most brutal exhibition.  Men were knocked down, shot down and carried away.  I stood at the bedside along with the family of Michael Lynch and I saw him die.  No punishment has been meted out to the men who were the cause of his death and who were rightly condemned by one of the most respected judges, who is far different from the judge who taunted a helpless prisoner in the dock with statements that were utterly untrue and unfounded.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to do it.  I faced it before and I will face it again.  I want to say that that was a cowardly action when these men were fighting for their very existence.  When the Minister is replying I hope he will tell us what he intends to do for the men who committed no less a crime than murder.  It was characterised by the judge in the High Court as murder. It is an impossibility to use sufficiently-tempered language such as this House has been accustomed to.  This is one of the cases that will go down in history and we will be ashamed of the men we call our countrymen.  I am thankful to say that the great bulk of the Gárda Síochána are not of that ilk. They showed kindness at any rate to those men who were wounded.  That incident is one which I regard with horror and I hope every right-thinking Irishman will regard it with horror, too.</P>

      <P>With reference to Deputy Dillon's remarks about juvenile delinquents, I do not think I am in entire agreement with the story he has told here about the way delinquents are treated.  I happen to have had experience, as a visitor on a good many occasions, of Glencree, which is run by a well-known order.  I think it can be taken for granted that a great many of the boys confined in that particular institution are well treated and are better fed than if they were at home in their own houses.  When they leave there they generally leave with a trade. A novel idea was introduced through the help of the Department of Defence. The juvenile delinquents were given two or three weeks' holidays &mdash; not with pay &mdash; out in the open spaces and they were not subject to a great degree of discipline.  I think that the experiment has succeeded and that, if persisted in by the authorities, the Deputy's suggestion of a clinic would be entirely unnecessary.  Perhaps a little more respect should be shown by the Department of Finance to the people who run these institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is a place of detention for juvenile delinquents. I understand that some of the people who run these institutions find it difficult to keep the delinquents and carry on the institution on the amount they receive from the Department of Finance.  I think that some provision should be made for them in respect of transport.  These institutions are generally in out-of-the-way parts of the country and expenditure on transport is necessary in order to get to them. These societies are dependent on what they get from the Department and they have not much money to spare.  I think that they should receive a little more attention from the Department of Finance, particularly from the transport point of view.</P>
      <P>On the question of the payment of witnesses' expenses, if a person is convicted of the offence of dangerous driving, as a general rule the district justice makes an order directing the defendant to pay witnesses' expenses. Men who have been brought away from their work and who have lost their day's pay are generally recouped in these cases within a very short period. If not, the usual warrant issues.  What is the position when such a charge is dismissed?  You may have three or four persons called as witnesses by the State.  When the case is dismissed, of course no costs or expenses can be charged against the defendant.  I understand that there is a certain delay before poor people who had to give up their day's work in order to attend court are able to collect their expenses. It is suggested that, in many cases, so many buff forms have to be filled up, and the inquiries are so searching, that the witness waives his claim to expenses.  That matter should be considered in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather that the maximum house allowance for the Gárda is about £26. That is all right in country parts, but occasionally you find a Civic Guard who has the misfortune, or perhaps the good fortune in some cases, to be transferred to a seaside resort.  That <Col N="863" /> Guard will not get a house there under £52 a year.  I know several Guards who have to pay as much as £60 for their houses.  I do not say that that happens universally, but it happens in a great many instances.  Instead of having a flat rate or a maximum rate for house allowance, certain exceptions should be made and the part of the country should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is some move at present to deprive Guards of certain blanket and equipment allowances. The net result, I think, will be that Guards in barracks will have to utilise blankets, quilts, and so forth used the day before by another member of the force.  It is not a nice thing to have one man sleeping in another man's blankets, but I understand that there is some possibility of that occurring. I do not think that that would commend itself to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I now come to a matter which I do not like to mention, but I presume this is the place to air it.  Deputy Dillon considers that the morale of the Guards is not what it was, that the Guards are afraid to do this and afraid to do that.  I have, unfortunately, concrete experience of what is undermining the morale of the Gárda in many areas.  It is &mdash; I say this without fear of contradiction and, if asked for proof, I can produce it &mdash; the influence and interference of local, small party-politicians in respect of the actions of the Gárda.  In certain parts of the country&mdash;I speak with all seriousness and with a sense of responsibility&mdash;a great many Guards have been led to believe that they hold office purely by the courtesy of some of the local politicians. In a great many instances their life is practically a hell.  They are afraid to talk to Tommy or Johnny So-and-so because it has happened that as a result &mdash; I do not say the Minister is personally conversant with this; perhaps it never reached him&mdash;of making friends with persons politically opposed to the Government, another member of the Gárda was transferred to Timbuctoo.</P>

If I were in his position, I should probably adopt the same course, because a Guard who is going to suffer financially or otherwise will blind his eyes to a great many things that happen.</P>

Furthermore, I have known other instances.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Justice is cognisant of the fact. I am not suggesting that at all.  The fact is this: that I have known a sergeant of the Guards to find men on licensed premises after hours.  I have known of a blatant case where the sergeant took the necessary measures, the names and addresses of the parties found there.  I have then known political big-wigs, including Deputies of this House, to approach the local superintendent asking him not to prosecute because the owner of the particular licensed premises and the men found on the premises were <Col N="865" /> politically the same as the Government.</P>

The unfortunate Guard got a rap over the knuckles.  He was told to mind his own business in future and not to dare interfere with the festivities or social enterprise of members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I will put that in writing for the Minister.

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief in what I have to say, because much of what I had intended to bring before the House has been already discussed. I want to say that I subscribe to all that has been said by Deputy Corish and others in relation to the hardships inflicted on members of the Gárda in the cuts in their wages, and especially in the insult offered to them in restoring the 9d. on boots.  The position in that regard has been touched upon, so I will not waste time in dealing further with that.  I am not at all so sure that the morale of the Guards has suffered to the extent that has been suggested, but I do know that they have been severely tried, and one of the biggest proofs of their present morale and one of the biggest tributes that could be paid to them is that they have been able to preserve the grand morale they have won.  Some of the comments made by Deputy McGowan have come upon me rather <Col N="867" /> as a surprise.  Here again I do not believe the Minister is responsible.  I want, however, to point out to the House that immediately after the advent of this Government to power the most effective detectors of crime that we had in Cork City were transferred to very remote places, not quite so far away as Timbuctoo, but at all events to the most remote parts of the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the splendid work done by the detectives in Cork at the time when Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was Minister for Justice and previous to his time.  I do not want to inflict any long course of reading upon the Minister for Justice.  But if he looks up the debates that took place in this House when Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was Minister for Justice, he will see the attacks made on individual detectives in Cork at that time.  These attacks were made on them simply because the detectives were arresting and holding in the Bridewell certain blackguards, footpads and garrotters. These Guards and detectives were really most efficient officers.  They were most active in their duties as policemen, but because of their activities and because of their work in the prevention of crime, the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals, the reward given to them for those services was that they were transferred to very remote stations.  To me the wonder is that the morale of the force is still so high.  The morale of that force was a most distinguished one before the advent to office of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to two other items.  I know that there are certain awards such as the Scott Medals and other decorations for conspicuous bravery.  Cases have been brought under my notice, and they have been brought to the notice of public bodies, where members of the Gárda Síochána in Cork City and other places have performed acts of conspicuous bravery which had only just got a Press notice.  There the matter ended.  There is a Guard who is frequently on point duty in Cork City and to my own knowledge he stopped on more than one occasion, at the risk of <Col N="868" /> his life, runaway horses.  I understand there is no reward of any character for that kind of service.  The other point I want to mention is the cases of members of the force who have saved numbers of lives from drowning.  They have got no award or reward of any kind.  I think the Minister might look into that matter and see that some official recognition from his Department should be given to men like those.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I wish to bring before the notice of the Minister is this: on more than one occasion I have interviewed the Minister for Justice, accompanied by a representative body which sought to have established in Cork City lady probation officers.  Now, we asked for the appointment of a lady probation officer, or lady probation officers, because it was felt that these were most essential in nearly every large centre of population.  Whilst we were refused that application in so far as it related to Cork City, we find that they have appointed additional lady probation officers in Dublin.  The answer of the Minister on one occasion to me, when I raised the matter by way of a Parliamentary Question, was something to the effect &mdash; I am speaking from memory &mdash; that the prisoners to whom these probation officers might be of some assistance were already being looked after by the various religious organisations.  I pay tribute, of course, to the work done by the various religious organisations, but I think there is still some necessity for the provision of a lady probation officer for Cork City.  If they are necessary in Dublin, where you have a very large number of religious organisations, surely at least one lady probation officer should be appointed in Cork.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to add except to pay my tribute to the way in which the Gárda Síochána have done their work and have continued to do it, and I do hope that, as a result of the comments that have been made, and particularly those made by Deputy McGowan, who, I believe, is most sincere and would not make these charges unless there was some foundation for them, something will be done in regard to the matter.  I do not know whether the Deputy is a member of some temperance <Col N="869" /> organisation or not, but perhaps in his zeal for that organisation he may have seen things that, possibly, other people have not seen.  However, I say that whilst the Gárda Síochána have been sorely tempted by reason of the reduction in their pay and other matters, they still maintain, to a very large degree at any rate, the morale and high standard of public conduct they have had for many years since they were first established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGowan raised a question regarding the matter of witnesses' expenses in the courts. I consider that a great hardship, but I consider that an equally great hardship is the position of jurors who have to travel long distances, to leave their homes and their businesses and to spend perhaps days out without being able to get home, and, at the present time, having perhaps to borrow the money to enable them to leave home to attend in court.  The question of witnesses' expenses is one that the Minister may consider in the near future, and I wish to point out that jurors suffer very much as a result of having to leave their homes and attend for days in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that was raised by several Deputies from this side of the House was the question of something that would tend to undermine the confidence of the people in the Gárdaí, particularly in County Cork, which is my native county, and that is the attitude that the Minister had taken up with regard to the party who was responsible for the shooting of young Michael Lynch in Marsh's yard.  A lot has been said about this, but I say that until these men are brought to justice the people cannot have the same confidence in the Gárdaí that they had heretofore.  I had recently another instance in my immediate neighbourhood where a flying squad visited a number of farmers to try to collect arrears of drainage rates.  In this particular case, my information is that they were most insulting and used improper language in the houses they visited.  That, again, is a matter that does help to undermine the confidence of the people.  Another thing that helps to terrorise the people and undermine <Col N="870" /> their confidence is that these flying squads, or mobile squads, that are travelling through the country have been travelling all over Cork in covered wagons with machine-guns out at each side of the wagon.  They have fully-loaded revolvers and ammunition of all sorts.  That certainly, I think, is a source of terror to the poor, unfortunate, law-abiding country people.  Law and order is firmly established in this State.  There is no danger of an attack of any sort on these people, and I think that the least the Minister might do would be to see that, if these people have to go out to seize or to endeavour to seize, they should go without these machine-guns and without all this show, which, as I say, helps to terrorise the people.  I hope that that state of affairs will be remedied in the near future, as I am afraid that, in the condition in which the people are at the moment, this flying squad will have to continue their work for some time, because the people will not be able to pay and the flying squad will have to continue its visits. At any rate, if they have to go out, they should go without machine-guns and rifles and ammunition.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to this question of Marsh's yard, I, with Deputy Dillon and other Deputies, protest against the attitude the Minister has adopted in this case, and I would not feel justified in supporting the passing of this Vote through the House until we have some information from the Minister as to what he is going to do and whether these men will be brought to justice for the action they took on that occasion. In that connection, there is another matter to which I should like to refer, and that is in connection with the other parties who were wounded on that particular occasion and who suffered serious loss.  I think that in the circumstances the Minister should take the case of these people into consideration and see that some suitable compensation is given to them for what they suffered through the action of his irresponsible officers down the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to intervene to any great length in this debate, but there are a few questions I <Col N="871" /> should like to put to the Minister before he replies.  I do not wish to add anything to what has been said with regard to the Marsh's yard incident, because of my personal connection with the matter as an eye-witness and my subsequent connection with the legal proceedings.  It has been sufficiently stressed and I think that any stress that may be made upon the matter in this House, at all events, will not add anything to the strength of the High Court judge's judgment in that matter.  It will be sufficient for us if the Minister in replying will confine himself to those remarks.  Now, with regard to the changes that have recently taken place in the Circuit Courts, I believe that a great many stenographers have found themselves out of employment, or, at all events, that their employment has been very much curtailed.  Would the Minister let us know what provision he is making to afford compensation to these persons, a great many of whom have been deprived altogether of their living?</P>
      <P>There is one other matter that I intend to raise in connection with this question, and it is this: A little document was brought into this House from time to time.  It was known as the plan.  I am sure everybody in this House is by this time familiar with the provisions of that plan.  The plan, I believe, was a short name for the Fianna Fáil programme&mdash;the programme containing the promises on which they got into power in 1932. Part of that plan was a promise with regard to amendments of the Licensing Act and a promise of a new Act. As a matter of fact, I think the predecessor of the present Minister, when he actually did come into office, and when the promises had been all swallowed, outlined to some extent the lines upon which this Licensing Act would be drawn up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>But this was a promise from a Minister.  I do not advocate legislation, nor am I trying to involve <Col N="872" /> the Minister in any expenditure beyond that already in the Estimate, but I should like to ask a courteous question with regard to a matter of importance which will arise out of the Minister's office, and that is the future of the administration of these Licensing Acts and whether they are going to be amended, or reviewed in some way, in conjunction with the state of affairs that at present prevails in the licensing trade.  At all events, the Minister has in his hands the administration of these Acts, and has in fact in his power the whole fate of the licensing trade at the present time.</P>
      <P>That unfortunate trade is in a very precarious condition, as the Minister for Justice knows and as the Minister for Finance also knows from some of the results accruing to his Department from the various duties imposed.  The Minister should let us know if there is going to be any relief in present conditions to the trade, or whether he has any intention of doing something in the very near future with regard to redeeming the promises made so solemnly by himself and his Party when they first came into power.</P>

I will only put one question and then depart from it because I will have another day. On the occasion that I put down the question, the President said that it was in the public interest that Ministers should get an increase in their allowance.

      <P>The main debate to-night has centred around what we have heard so often in this House already and Deputies on both sides are familiar with the question of Marsh's yard.  Certainly, at all times Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has had <Col N="874" /> more than his innings on that.  This evening we had plenty of rhetoric and we wound up with the heroics of Deputy Brooke Brasier.  When we are dealing with a matter of this sort, it is very easy to try and create an atmosphere of heroics and to work up rhetoric by getting people away from what were the facts of the situation. It is very easy for Deputies opposite, who were backing up and who were behind the policy that was responsible for such things as this having happened, to try and work up an atmosphere that will get away from that.</P>

      <P>I have listened since five o'clock to the speeches made and I did not interrupt anyone.  If the case is so bad on the other side that they have to proceed to interrupt, then I suppose I must be satisfied to leave the House to judge that.  The country knows the facts; every Deputy knows the facts.  There was a conspiracy in this country inciting people against the payment of land annuities. I know it will be said that some people tried to get out of that on the pretence or ground that they were not able to pay their annuities.  I heard reference here to-night to flying squads in parts of Cork and so on. I come from one of the poorest areas in this country and flying squads there or lorries out to seize are as rare as the one-time Indian in Manhattan. There was no conspiracy there.  There <Col N="875" /> was no attempt there to work up a conspiracy.  We had to face the most serious situation that any Government could be faced with.  We had to face a situation in which we had either to get out or we had to go out and collect these annuities and assert ourselves as a Government.  To do that, we had to call on the forces of the State.  I regret, and I think any Irishman would regret, that we were put into the position of having to send out squads of armed police to deal with the situation.  Putting arms in the hands of men is a dangerous business.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite have gone through the evidence that was given in these civil court proceedings <i>ad nauseam.</i>  I could go through that evidence too.  I will not and am not entitled to criticise any judgment of a court.  I do not propose to do anything of the kind, but I have to consider the evidence as it has been put forward to me, and as I have read it, what was the position that day in Marsh's Yard in Cork?  If I want to be fair and just, I have to come to the conclusion that those men &mdash; whether their judgment was good or bad may be another thing &mdash; were convinced in their own minds, closeted up as they were in that yard, that they were bound to protect the people they were sent there to protect; that when the battering-ram broke in through the yard and people crowded in&mdash;how did they know whether those people were armed or not? &mdash; that in that set of circumstances they fired with the effect we know.  They have been bandied about here as criminals.  They have been called criminals.  If the Deputies opposite wanted to be perfectly fair and just to those men, they might have talked about their miscalculation of judgment, about their bad judgment, but to try and condemn them here as criminals certainly is not justifiable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be quite satisfied that I have read everything relevant to this case.  I am satisfied that those men acted in the belief, themselves, at any rate, that they were dealing there with overwhelming forces: that their own lives were in danger, and in that set of circumstances, and acting in that belief, they took the action that they did.  We have been asked here to-night to give compensation to the other people who were injured there.  When people talk about criminals, perhaps they would realise themselves that one of the parties I would be asked to give compensation to is a man who is a convicted criminal, a man who did prison for the offence he committed on the day <Col N="877" /> that this tragedy occurred.  Those men are in the Guards.  So far as their position in the Guards is concerned, for the reasons I have stated, I am not prepared to take any action in the matter. As regards any criminal prosecution, such as has been mentioned here, that is a matter for the Attorney-General, but I would be surprised in view of the situation that existed at that time and in view of all the surrounding circumstances, if the Attorney-General would take any criminal proceedings in the matter.  However, that is his province, not mine.</P>
      <P>When a Guard is brought up in a civil court and decreed, the man is not automatically removed from the force. Cases have happened in the time of the previous Government.  Decrees were obtained in court, and no further action was taken in the matter.  It never followed that because a Guard, either by a miscalculation or by a genuine mistake, when acting in his own best judgment if he does make a mistake, it has never been accepted as a principle that there should be disciplinary action taken which might result in his having to be removed from the force.  That is all I desire to say in regard to Marsh's yard.  We have had it here year after year for the last three or four years.  It has been raised here again this evening simply and solely to parade it.  I regret the tragedy&mdash;I sincerely regret it&mdash;but I say that it has been used here with very little thought, and with very little semblance of regret for the tragedy that occurred.  It has been raised simply and solely as a political issue that might capture some votes in the country.  I am not prepared to join in that.  I have dealt with it before, and I have dealt with it now, in the only way that I can deal with it, and I leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a number of other matters that were raised on this Vote, Deputy MacEoin talked about the annuities and the fees for collection. The fees to-day are, in fact, the same as those made under the Sheriff's Order of 1927.  They are practically the same.  The practice is that when they go out through the country in lorries to seize stock, if there are five or six defaulters in the place, they are bound to try and apportion the cost between the defaulters that they visit. <Col N="878" /> If there is some particular case that the Deputy has knowledge of, I shall be glad to have particulars from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister that in every case they claim the full amount.  As Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee last year, I raised a question on the matter, and was told that the fines so collected came into the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>They are bound to apportion them.  That is in the instruction. I assume that the collections that the Deputy refers to are those in regard to land annuity arrears.  The position there is that before ever there is a demand sent from the county registrar or the sheriff a six days' notice has already been issued by the Land Commission.  We know ourselves that it happens that very many months may elapse before cases are sent to the sheriff.  When they are sent, he sends out another notice, a fifteen days' notice, warning the person concerned that if he does not pay the amount demanded within the fifteen days a seizure will be made. I have had the experience myself, and I am sure other Deputies have had it, too, that where people make application to the Land Commission, and make some reasonable offer, the Land Commission are always ready to try and assist them &mdash; to meet them.  If, therefore, there is any complaint about those collection fees, surely the fault does not lie with the Government but with the people who are making no attempt to pay.  People have to pay their debts to the State the same as they have to pay them to the shopkeeper or to anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Town tenants were referred to by the Deputy.  The position is that the commission was set up, and I have no control over that commission for the purpose of expediting or hurrying it up.  As soon as the Town Tenants Commission makes a report I can assure the House there will be no avoidable delay in having the recommendations considered by the Government with a view to seeing if any legislation should be entered upon. The Malicious Injuries law was referred to by Deputy MacEoin, and by two or three other Deputies.  I am <Col N="879" /> amazed to find Deputies beginning to forget that they were members of the previous Government Party.  Their Party was in control of the Government here for ten years, but they seem to forget all about that now.  I suppose we are moving on, and that much more is expected from this Government than from the previous Government. The matter has been receiving consideration, but at the moment I am not in a position to say anything more definite about it.  The Deputy also raised a question which was so much sneered about, the boot allowance.  If it is such a sneering matter there is no objection on this side to have it withdrawn, if it is regarded by everyone as such a terrible insult to the Guards.  I do not want to insult the Guards.  I am the last person in the world who would wish to give insult. As regards insult, I am prepared to try to meet the Deputies who put forward a suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it happens to be £2 a year and that it comes to a total of £14,000 in the year.  It may be said that it is only ninepence a week.  I do not know why Deputies did not bring it down to the minutest amount and say that it was so many points of a farthing a minute.  Anything can be made ridiculous.  The biggest salary could be made ridiculous if people set out to try to do the music hall artist.  I may as well, perhaps, deal now with what were talked about as &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in the Guards' pay.  I do not know what &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; were referred to, or that there was ever in this country a Desborough Commission. During an agitation in England in 1920 the Desborough Commission was set up.  Something different was set up here.  I think it was the Ross Commission. It was not exactly a commission as during the Black and Tan period, when there was not very much agitation here amongst the R.I.C., there was undoubtedly agitation in England amongst what we understand to be constables, who are really under the urban councils, except in the City of London.  There was an agitation over <Col N="880" /> there, and the R.I.C. at that particular time, knowing that there was a position here that they could utilise, and having a very dangerous job, availed of it to press the point on the British Government. As Deputies know, the British Government would give them anything at the time.  I am not saying that they gave them too much.  I am not criticising them.  That is what is referred to, possibly, as the Desborough Commission. Things went on in a sort of slipshod way until 1924, when the then Government here came to a decision as to what should be the pay and allowances of the Gárda Síochána.  They fixed them at that time when the cost-of-living figure was on the basis of 85 above the pre-war level.  They stated that while the figure remained between 70 and 100 above pre-war level the existing scale they fixed was to remain. If it went below 70 it would react against the Guards.  If it went over 100, the Government in the memorandum stated that it should be reviewed.  It did fall below 70 from 1931, but the Government did not take any notice of it, and did not take any steps to bring Gárda pay down.  Civil Servants' salaries go up and down according to the cost-of-living basis, but the Guards did not suffer anything whatever when the cost-of-living basis went down.  The &ldquo;cut&rdquo; made in the boot allowance has been restored.  Every time I hear anything said about &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; or anything like that, I am always told about the pay of police in the North of Ireland. In this particular instance I do not think we can judge in any way by what is paid in this or in other countries. In any case, the Guards got back the same boot allowance as they have in the North of Ireland.  Everybody says the Guards want similar rates of pay here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one other matter mentioned and that was the question of housing.  It has been recognised that in certain places rents are higher than in other places, especially in towns near cities, in the larger towns, and perhaps at seaside places.  We have agreed to have a census taken to see what is the position with regard to rents of Gárdaí houses, and when that has been ascertained, to make some <Col N="881" /> allowance to Guards who have to pay in some cases pretty high rents&mdash;rents that do not bear comparison with what Guards have to pay in smaller towns where houses are more easily got.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the rents, does the Minister recognise the difficulty of getting houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says may be right in some cases, but it has come to my knowledge in urban areas I know that the authorities are very anxious at all times to give houses to Guards.  That is where the local authorities have been making quick progress with housing.  That situation will, I think, adjust itself in a short time.  There may be a shortage in certain places, but where local authorities have built houses, there are no tenants they are more anxious to secure than the Guards.  Reference was made by Deputy Davin to the Moneylenders Act and the Traffic Acts.  I do not know what I can do with regard to the Moneylenders Act. We did what the committee suggested, and that was to fix a rate of interest beyond which it was illegal to charge. We passed the Act in this House.  Let us be clear about this.  It is not a criminal offence for any moneylender, or for anyone else, to charge any interest he likes or any interest he can get.  While it is not a criminal offence, the man who is charged has his legal defence.  If there is what is called illegal interest charged, the man concerned has simply to go to court and say that he was charged so much interest and refused to pay it. He has his remedy there.  That is the only remedy.  I have nothing whatever to do, and the police have nothing to do, with the administration of the Moneylenders Act.  If anyone thinks anything can be done, then the matter should be raised in another way.</P>

    <P>With regard to the Traffic Acts, I am aware of the case to which Deputy Davin referred.  The Deputy wrote to me and put the facts before me, and substantially they are the same as the facts he put before the House to-night.  At the time I gathered that there was some suggestion <Col N="882" /> that the Guards did not pursue that case sufficiently, or that they did not press it sufficiently.  I can assure Deputy Davin that, if he wants to, he can see the files on that particular matter.  If he saw those files he would be quite satisfied that the Guards went as far as they could, and I am quite sure that Deputy Davin is now satisfied in his own mind that the Guards did so.  This man was a nuisance to them.  They had been pursuing him all over the country. In every town he went into he seemed to be committing an offence against the Traffic Act.  I do not know what evidence was given in court but a certain decision was given. I have no control over the district justice.  I am not saying whether the district justice acted rightly or wrongly.  Deputy Kelly has referred to the fact that he does not approve of having trials <i>in camera.</i>  I think murder trials were what the Deputy referred to.</P>

      <P>That is a matter entirely for the justice trying the case. I know that one of the Labour Deputies took the view that cases should be tried <i>in camera.</i>  It is a matter of the viewpoint of the particular justice who is trying the particular case.  I know that some justices would take the view that having all the evidence published in the daily Press in a murder case or any other case would have a prejudicial effect on the jurors who would subsequently try the case.  That is one side of it. There may be another side, but it is regarded, I know, by certain justices that when people read reports in the newspapers they may be prejudiced in some way or other against the accused by the rather sordid or horrid details that may come out in the evidence in court.  However, as I say, it is a matter which is entirely at the discretion of the justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello has referred to the discretion of the Guards in accident cases.  He also referred to the production of statements and sketches that the Guards took at the time.  There is <Col N="883" /> a very old practice which has created that difficulty about producing those statements.  It is a matter on which I should not like to interfere, or give an undertaking that I would interfere, or make any recommendation with regard to it, without first knowing all the facts connected with it.  As regards the discretion of the Guards, he has got into a heat here about some driver who got a man charged.  He said the Minister's driver got some person charged, and the case was dismissed in court.  I am sure the Deputy would not have got into half that heat if he had realised that that very same driver had been driving Ministers of the previous Government.  According to the Opposition, everybody who is associated with this Government is supposed to belong to some strange type who cannot tell a word of truth, while they seem to take it that anybody who was ever attached to them has been anointed a saint in some particular way and cannot do anything wrong.  The man concerned in that particular accident did make a statement. I do not know whether that statement was true or untrue.  Many a man has been beaten in a very truthful case.  In fact, it sometimes happens that the man who swears the most is the most successful.  It does not follow by any means that this man is such a criminal simply because he was not able to convince the court.  Of course, now that the Opposition have heard he belonged to them at one time, I am sure they will change their minds about him. Deputy Costello also referred to somebody named O'Neill as an official buyer.  There is no O'Neill acting as an official buyer in civil cases.  He said he heard some reference to it in the courts.  I should be glad to get some further information from him.  I gather he is referring to cases between ordinary litigants.  One man sues another and gets a decree, which has to be executed.  Apparently the State is supplying an individual called O'Neill to go around and levy that. That is not so.  It is ridiculous.  I am surprised at a Deputy of Deputy Costello's responsibility making such a statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is rather worried about the expenses of the rules.  As a matter of fact the rules that are referred to are mainly rules with regard to the High Court.  I think that was what he was anxious about.  We are making a start with them this year.  Whether or not the £500 asked for in this Vote will be sufficient I cannot say, but we will know at the end of the year at all events.  Now that he knows it refers to the rules of the High Court, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney approves. The same Deputy also asked whether there has been any reduction in the number of Guards.  There has not been any reduction in the number of Guards except what would normally come about as wastage.  The wastage last year was 70.  The present strength of the Guards is 7,221.  Last year it was 7,296.  It has always been around that figure, and I am not aware that there is any extraordinary wastage or weakening in the strength of the Guards.  If information can be given that in certain areas there are not sufficient Guards to police them arrangements can be made.  From time to time there is a number of Guards at the Depôt for training, and when it comes to positions of difficulty, such as have been referred to here to-night, there will not be much trouble in getting over them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the question of expense at election time.  The Deputy may take it from me that the delay is purely and solely the fault of the Guards themselves, simply because they will not send in their claims on the regular forms according to the regulations.  If the Deputy inquires he will find that that is correct.  The fault does not lie with my Department or with Finance or Accounts Branch.  It lies with the Guards themselves.  I know that we have sent out circulars about this already.  Deputy Dillon referred to the trials of juveniles <i>in camera.</i>  I think the Deputy raised that matter last year.  We all know the interest which the Deputy takes in this question.  So far as I know, that is being done.  I think it is being done at the present time by the Senior Justice.  The other matters to which the Deputy referred are not under the <Col N="885" /> control of my Department.  The Department of Justice has to deal with Borstal.  The Department of Education deals with reformatory and industrial schools.  I know that Deputy Dillon will raise this matter on the Vote for the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>If my Department can give any co-operation or be of any assistance in improving the position &mdash; this is without admitting that the position is anything like what he said &mdash; I am sure we will be only too glad to do so.  Deputy McGowan raised this matter of interference with the Guards.  That is a very serious situation. I think that nobody who has any responsibility would want to interfere with the Guards.  In fact, from time to time I have warned people against coming to me or writing to me where representations were being made on behalf of the Guards.  I have hardly ever had anybody, or very few in any case, coming to me complaining about the Guards.  From time to time, if a Guard has been transferred, representations can be made through somebody without in any way connecting the Guard with it.  Several times circulars have been issued from the Commissioner's office warning the Guards of the consequences to themselves if they try to use any influence, or if they do anything except discharge their duty without fear, favour or affection.  I think that was the phrase used.  At every opportunity that has come in the way of Ministers, and very often in the way of Deputies, it has always been pointed out that there will be no interference with the Guards in the discharge of their duties.  I should be glad to have evidence from any Deputy in this House to show that the Guards were afraid to discharge their duty because of what has been described as the use, by some local politician, of influence to prevent the Guards from doing their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Deputy Anthony raised the question of awards for bravery.  As the position stands at present, the only awards available are the Scott medals.  I do not know that it would be very desirable that we should have many more awards for the many acts of bravery performed by the Guards, but it is a matter that can be kept in mind, if some opportunity arises for doing something along the lines suggested. The Deputy has also raised the question of probation officers in Cork.  We have not had any really strong case made for the appointment of probation officers in Cork.  It does not follow, because it is Cork or because it is a fairly big centre, that necessarily probation officers are required. In fact, I should think that in Cork, above all places, there would be no necessity for probation officers.  You have much bigger centres in Great Britain &mdash; for example, Edinburgh &mdash; where you have no paid probation officers at all.</P>
    <P>In other centres the position is somewhat similar.  I always feel that much better work could be done by voluntary societies who would assist in this way in looking after juveniles and other people on probation.  Much more useful work could be accomplished in that way than could ever be done by officials or paid people.  There is more enthusiasm for the work and better results can be achieved.  As I have said, no very serious demands have been made for such appointments, and until there is some more insistent demand I do not think there is any necessity to take action or that Deputy Anthony need have the slightest alarm about the matter.</P>

      <P>I resent, in the strongest possible manner, the attitude the Minister took up in reply to my query relating to Marsh's Yard.  At no time in my life have I tried to make political capital out of the death of anybody, and nobody should know me better in that respect than the Minister. Charging me with that is equivalent to charging the Judge of the Court, who gave his decision with trying to make political capital out of what had been sworn in evidence before him.  I do not desire to say much more than that.  I may add that when the Minister made that statement I was obliged to alter the opinion I have held with regard to him; I rather thought that he would have been particularly careful not to use a statement like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister at this stage to indicate, if he can, now that we have peace established, when he thinks the Gárda Síochána may again become an unarmed force.  When will the arms be taken from them?  One would think that it should be no longer necessary to give them to them. The last point I want to make is with regard to the Minister's statement with reference to any Deputy giving him information as to local politicians interfering with the Gárda.  I should <Col N="890" /> like the Minister to say what he considers would be interference.  Is it interference with a Gárda if a Deputy of the Minister's Party tells him that he would see to it that he would be transferred within the next week for his conduct, that he would be reported to the Minister for Justice, that he would see to it that he would leave, and, unfortunately, the Gárda has left &mdash;he left within the following week. Is the Minister not aware of that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's first point, I should like to say that I am entitled to my opinion and I think it was perfectly clear there was political capital made out of this particular matter.  As regards the question that has been raised about the Guards being armed, the Gárda was never an unarmed force. That was one of the greatest jokes that was played around this country for years &mdash; that the Gárda was an unarmed force.  It was nothing of the kind and, in the circumstances, and with the duties that the Gárda had to carry out, it could not be such.  But I would be very glad, and I would welcome the day when it would be possible to have the Gárda as an absolutely unarmed force.</P>

      <P>There are certain duties the Gárda have to perform from time to time, and perhaps it is the State's duty to see that they are protected when they are going on those difficult and dangerous duties. I should be glad to see the day when the Gárda would be unarmed, but I am not in a position to say whether that is possible at present, or for some time to come.  I hope it will be possible and I join with the Deputy in hoping that that day will come soon. With regard to the Deputy's point as to interference with the Gárda, I do regard what the Deputy has referred to, and much less than that as interference.</P>

      <P>I do not know about doing extra work, but the position is that when the Courts of Justice Bill was going through the House, I explained that the provision we had been able to make to the Department of Finance was that those whose services would be dispensed with would receive half a year's pay in lieu of notice.  We did promise to try to fix up something, and I think that two or three of these men have been fixed up in the Central Criminal Court, and so on.  We were anxious to fix them up in other employment if we possibly could.</P>
