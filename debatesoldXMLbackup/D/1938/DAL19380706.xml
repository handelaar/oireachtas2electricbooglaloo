      <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,192 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach (No. 16 of 1924 and No. 40 of 1937).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an increase of £662 on this Vote as compared with last year.  That increased provision is due to the rise in the cost-of-living bonus; to the replacement of a post of employment staff officer by one of staff officer; to the insertion of a provision of £400 for extra staff, the need for which has become apparent though the proposals <Col N="263" /> therefor have not been officially sanctioned by me; and to the normal incremental charges.  This increase is counterbalanced to some extent by the appointment of the former assistant secretary as secretary to the President, and his replacement by an officer on a lower point on the salary scale.</P>

      <P>I move &mdash;&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; This motion was put down for the purpose of drawing attention to Executive policy, and I suggest that this is the proper Vote on which to raise the question.  I refrained from participating in other discussions because it seemed to me they were not the proper ones for the question I want to raise.  In this connection I say that Executive policy continues to place a load on one section of the community that has not to be borne by other sections.  I will probably be told in plain terms that that means discussing the merits and the demerits of derating.  I may be told, as the Minister for Finance hinted yesterday, that the Government had got a mandate at the recent election to refuse derating and to refuse justice to a certain section of the people.  Nothing can be further from the fact that a mandate was given in that direction.  The statements made during the election campaign by the Minister's supporters are at variance with the actual facts.  I heard one speaker at New Ross, who is a member of the House now, say that the operation of derating in Northern Ireland was nullified by an equal rise on houses and buildings used for agricultural purposes.  That statement was repeated in Monaghan by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  I saw the following letter dealing with the question in the newspapers on Wednesday, June 22nd:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A few days ago Dr. Ward was reported to have made a statement to the effect that the equivalent of the money raised on land in Northern Ireland before derating was now levied on buildings, raising the rates to 12s. in the £.  This is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The total amount which would be <Col N="264" /> realised on land &mdash; had there been no derating &mdash; is handed over to each county council by the Government at intervals during the financial year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In County Down the average rate in the pound this year is 5s. 11d., and in County Antrim 6s. 1d.  Some rural districts pay a little more, some less, but these are the averages.  A rate of 12s. in the pound is unknown in the rural districts.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Judging by his speech, as reported, Dr. Ward does not even know that agricultural buildings as well as land are derated in Northern Ireland.  A farmer only pays on his dwelling-house. No rates whatever are assessed on buildings used for agricultural purposes &mdash; i.e., cow-sheds, stables, etc.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may try to draw a red herring across the path, but that will count for nothing.  The propaganda advanced by the Government was that they had got a mandate to refuse justice.  Even if they had a mandate that would not make injustice justice, or inequity equity.  At the present time County Kilkenny is paying a flat rate of 8/9 in the £.</P>

      <P>The Deputy intimated to me some days ago his intention of moving to refer this Vote back for the purpose of discussing derating.  He had a note from me regarding that matter.  The question of derating agricultural land may not be regarded as the underlying basis of several Estimates.  The practice of this House has been, and it is a very necessary practice, that a matter discussed on one Vote may not be reopened on another Vote.  The question of derating agricultural land was discussed at considerable length on the Vote for Agriculture.  It was discussed yesterday, perhaps rather <Col N="265" /> irregularly, and may not be again discussed to-day.  If the Deputy objects to the policy of not derating, and seeks to initiate a debate on derating of agricultural land as such, he must take some other opportunity.  I also informed the Deputy that on the Vote for the President's Department there could not be an omnibus discussion. Obviously it may not be used as an opportunity to reopen matters discussed on other Votes, or to anticipate discussion on Votes not yet reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that this is the proper Vote on which to discuss Executive policy.  This is a question of policy, and even if this question was raised on other Votes that is not a reason why it should not be raised on this Vote, which, I submit, is the proper one, as this arises out of Executive policy.  Therefore, I submit that I am entitled to go into the question now, as I took no part in the other discussions. I recognise that they were irregular and improper to the matters that were then under consideration.  I submit that this is the proper time to discuss Executive policy as this is Executive policy, pure and simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that there is collective responsibility in the Government, I fail to see what matter arising on any Estimate might not be brought under that heading.  This matter was discussed at length on the Vote for Agriculture to which it was relevant.  The discussion may not be reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that this is the proper Vote to discuss the question, and I refrained from discussing it on other Votes.  I submit that this concerns the policy of the Executive Council, and that I am in order in discussing it.  The guidance I got, with the exception of the note I got from you, Sir, was that I could raise it on this Vote.  Can I continue now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I go back to the whole history where this tax was imposed, and I go back to the year 1847.  I have here in my hand a poor rate receipt from Kilkenny Union in the year 1847 &mdash; July, 1847 &mdash; in which the rate was 5d. in the £.  This rate, too, Sir, was imposed at a time &mdash; perhaps some of the Deputies will be of opinion that it is an historical tradition that they should keep up &mdash; when the common people, such as we are representing, had no voice whatsoever in the affairs of the State, were not even represented on the board of guardians, were slaves in their own country.  These were the penal days, the barbarous days, and this is the last relic of those days.  One class of people ruled the country at that time &mdash; a privileged class.  A rate of 5d. in the £ was in operation at this particular date, which was borne altogether by the landlord.  Four or five years later, four I think, half of it was transferred to the tenant.  He had no option in the matter, he had to take whatever burden was put on his shoulders.  He had either to take it that way or in an increase in his rent. Anybody who has read anything about the history of the penal days and those days will remember that he had no option in the matter at all.  He had to take whatever was given him and shoulder whatever load was put on his back.  In 1851 or 1852 he was given half this load to carry, 2½d. in the £, and that held good up to our own day, up to the year 1897 or 1898, 40 or 41 years ago.  I remember distinctly myself paying at the rate of half this particular rate.  The other half was borne by the landlord.  Legislation came in then that transferred all the load on to the agriculturist in occupation. I want to compare the incidence of taxation in the early days with the incidence of taxation to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> In our time we can remember when the professions, industry and trade, bore a certain burden in proportion to their means.  We must contrast the position then and the position now, and the revolution that has taken place since those early days.  Let us take the baker of to-day in Dublin; he is at present receiving £5 2s. 0d. a week; he is threatening a strike for 10/- extra.  In the early days he had a salary or wage of half a crown a batch, working out at 10/6 or 15/- a week.  He is paying a tax on his home, his household.  That is all he is contributing to the cost of social services, but the farmer's position is different. It was laid down distinctly in 1897 or 1898 that the basis of the farmer's income was his valuation, and even then the authorities at that time had a doubt as to its justice because they put in a provision in the Finance Act that an agricultural farmer who could keep accounts, and who was able to show he was making no profit from his business, was charged no income-tax. Certainly, there can be no question that the valuation at that time was the basis of his income.  It is still the basis of his income under very changed circumstances.  But, in addition to his liability for income-tax, the same as the baker who is in receipt of £5 2s. 0d. a week, liability for income-tax even though he is a married man, the farmer is liable to an impost on every £ of his valuation.  Even a man in a labourer's cottage is liable to the county rate. In my county it happens to be 8/9; in Waterford, 12/6 in the £, and he is liable even on the first £ of his valuation.  A man with no income is liable to that particular impost.  I want you to realise the position of the two classes of citizens in this State, the people who are contributing nothing to social services and who are getting all the social services, and the people who are contributing all to the social services and who are getting nothing from it.  It is an extraordinary position that this one section of the community should be singled out to carry a load that no other section of the community has to carry.  As I say, we have no objection at all to paying an impost like every other citizen on our habitations, <Col N="268" /> but we do distinctly object to carrying a rate that no other citizen has to carry.  Take the Minister.  Take any professional man, for instance.  He is paying a tax on his home, merely a home tax.  He may be in receipt of £1,700 or £2,500 a year, but on no other part of his income is he paying a tax until he has passed the £250 mark, and then he is subject to 4/6 in the £.  In addition, he has allowances for every child he has got who is of school-going age or attending the university, but the unfortunate farmer down the country is liable to an impost, of 12/6 in the £ in County Waterford, on the first £ of his income, even the dweller in the labourer's cottage.  We have another case.  A man here in Dublin who has no home, who is merely living with a friend, may have £1,000 or £1,500 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a considerable amount of hostility here in this country to agriculture.  It is said that agriculturists have always a poor mouth, that they are always claiming something they are not entitled to.  I heard a claim made a month ago by one of the best men of figures in the County Kilkenny.  He said: &ldquo;Look at all we have paid to help to purchase <Col N="269" /> the agricultural holdings of the country for the farmers under the recent British Acts.&rdquo;  I asked him at how much loss was he or the community. He said they paid a considerable amount of money.  The facts were on the basis of the £63,000,000 that we owed England, the whole of the United Kingdom was asked to contribute £300,000 and that was for all the Acts and in the particular Acts a certain bonus had to be made up by the taxpayer.  I will not go into that, because I will just assume in round numbers that they were paying a bonus on all the Acts, because it does not matter which.  It was £300,000 on all the citizens of the United Kingdom.  I will not go on the President's or the Prime Minister's contention that we are only a sixty-sixth part of the United Kingdom. I will go on the population basis and say we are about a thirty-third, to be more accurate and just. On that basis our contribution towards the £300,000 would be £9,090 and, reduced to pence, it would be a lot less than 1d. per head of our population.</P>
      <P>Now, the profits and the turnover of industry 40 or 50 years ago and to-day are two different things.  When the basis of income was fixed 50 years ago it was fixed on infinitely better terms than it is to-day.  We had more prosperity and more security.  Our overheads were less.  Our wages bill was less and outgoings in every direction were less.  Our profits and the prices we got for our produce were as good as and in some cases better than they are to-day.  We were able to get as good a price for corn, barley and oats, and as good a price for every other article.  We were able to get as much for our cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our wages bill was, practically speaking, nothing compared with what it is to-day; our rates were nothing compared with the rates to-day; the cost of machinery and overheads were not more than one-third what they are to-day; replacement costs would be only one-third what they are to-day.  In every way our prosperity and security were infinitely better than to-day.  Even when there was a doubt about our position, <Col N="270" /> we got the benefit of it.  They put in a clause in the Finance Act indicating that, if we could not show a profit, we paid no income-tax.  What is the contrast from the business point of view?  Take the case of the baker, the professional man or anybody else and you will find that a revolution has taken place in the last 40 or 50 years.  As a matter of fact, the position is altogether reversed.  There would be some justification years ago in saying that a landlord was receiving a good income out of his land and he did not earn it.  To-day that condition of things has disappeared.  The poor man of that day is the rich man of to-day. The poor man of that day is a man of wealth to-day, and the man who possessed wealth at that time is not to-day in a position to pay anything.</P>
    <P>We are asking no charity, no compassion. We merely want justice and equity, and those things we are going to get.  You may talk as you like about the mandate you got at the election, but remember, you will be asking for another mandate within the next four or five years.  That day is going to come and we will get what we are entitled to get.  No Government can exist defending a position like that.  Our claim cannot be attacked on any just grounds.  Although you may use the big stick and talk about the majority received under a series of heads, not alone under this particular head, and although you may refer to the claims and appeals to the electorate, you have no mandate in this case, and this country would be a slave country and a cowardly country, not deserving of the salt used in its baptism, if one section of the people lived as slaves to the other half.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when the school teacher was paid by results, and the payment might amount to £55 or £75 a year.  The position is very different to-day.  I suppose the salary to-day runs to £400.  I am speaking subject to correction, but I think, roughly, that it runs to £400.  There are many officials in the same category. A revolution has taken place in that status, and you cannot ignore it. I am not asking that these people should be burdened or that anything should be done to victimise them.  I <Col N="271" /> am merely asking for justice for ourselves. We should not be saddled with an impost that has no foundation in justice and equity.  What is this heritage you have got?  It is a heritage transmitted by the old British régime, by the old privileged, landlord class. Some people might talk about the sacred position, but what is sacred about it?</P>
    <P>I might add, too, that things have occurred in the farming industry. Circumstances are present now that were not present some years ago.  We have epidemics passing through agriculture at the moment, serious epidemics that were not heard of 30 or 40 years ago.  Herds of cattle can be turned on the scrap-heap with a visitation, and no one can help us to combat that.  I say that the position is infinitely worse from every point of view.  Any Executive that wants to be just to all citizens cannot afford to ignore the agricultural community, and they should not try to impose penalties on people unable to bear them.  I am talking now about the need for treating the farmers justly.  No one section of the people should be asked to slave for the other section.  At the moment there is no equity, and I do not know how any Ministry could defend the position.  Is there any Deputy here who could indicate any section of the people subject to the same imposts as members of the agricultural community are subject to?</P>
    <P>I want you to compare the conditions of the citizens of the towns, the comforts and the social services they have, the hours they have to work, the pay they receive on holidays, with the conditions of the people who have to live on the hillsides, on the mountain-sides through the country, with their poor approaches, bad lanes and roadways.  At one time the highways were available for us.  We could go out and drive our cattle and other stock to markets and fairs and to the railways; we could drive our horses to the towns.  We cannot do that now. If we attempt to drive cattle on the roads they are flopping at every turn and get their legs broken, and there is no compensation.  We are, practically <Col N="272" /> speaking, driven off the main roads, the highways of the country. Contrast the lives of the country people with the lives of the people who live in the towns.  The country people have not the same social services and they receive nothing except what they provide with their own hands.  Anybody who has gone through half a dozen or a dozen campaigns the same as I have, and who knows every home in his constituency, will realise the position of our boys and girls to-day.</P>
    <P>There are people who wonder why boys and girls stay on the land at all. So-called statesmen get up here and elsewhere and ask why are the people fleeing the country, emphasising that we must keep them on the land.  How can you keep them on the land?  Why do you not give them fair play?  Have you any idea of the lives they lead? Have you any sympathy with the people on the land?  You have not any; you have not shown any in practice, anyhow.  The people are leaving the country districts.  There are no marriages because young men will not accept the responsibility that in ordinary circumstances people would be expected to accept.  The men and women are growing old and none of them get married and you are coming to the time when that position will have serious reactions.  If the reactions do not appear to you now, they will in ten years' time or less.  Nobody wants to stay on the land.  Boys and girls want to leave it, glad to escape into anything else.</P>
    <P>In the country that I know so well you do not find much lipstick or much polishing of nails.  You will find girls there chopping fir stumps to get a bit of fire in order to cook the meals.  It is all very well for some Deputies to laugh at that, but the people who laugh do not know the country.  The country is not going to stand it.  Revolutions have been put on the way in other countries for less, and I would welcome a revolution here when it comes, and a revolution will come unless there is justice done to the people.  You cannot compel them to live under the conditions that they have in the country while other people here and in the towns are having a <Col N="273" /> much better time.  Any Executive Council that is not prepared to give greater justice to those people in the country does not deserve to occupy the position of an Executive Council. I do not care by what means they have got to the position of being a Government, they will have to do justice to all the citizens of the State.</P>

We have not had the spokesmen we should have, arguing our case.  It might be asked why I did not make this case to the Minister for Finance 12 months or two years ago.  My answer is that I think an apology is due from me to the people I represent. I confess I have failed them.  I did not begin to understand this case nor its implications until I found the Minister for Finance indicating that he had no sympathy with the people who have to bear these imposts.  That set me thinking and, on examining this matter, I found the position to be iniquitous and an injustice to the rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am heartily ashamed of my inability to deal with this question in the way in which I think it should be dealt with. By what law or justice can it be claimed that the farmer is not entitled to the same consideration as any other people in the community?  By what right is it claimed that he should bear this heavy impost on the first £ of his income? What is the position with regard to the young people leaving the country to get a job in the cities and towns?  I challenge any young country boy to find a job in this city or in any other city to-day.  The trade union regulations are so tight that a boy from the country cannot go into any business, such as the business of butcher or baker or even vanman.  The union rules are so worked that they will all go on strike if such a boy comes in.  I challenge any man in the country to get a job in this city or in any other city under the present restrictions.  He simply <Col N="274" /> cannot.  If he wants to get employment he has to leave the country altogether and escape to some other land.  He is absolutely shut out from employment here.  I want to know what the Government's attitude is with regard to that state of things?</P>
    <P>I am not one who wants to be put in the position of being a supplicant. I do not want to be in the position of making an appeal to anybody.  I do not like the rôle of beggar.  In this matter I am not begging; I ask for justice.  I demand justice, and neither the Prime Minister nor anybody else can defend the present position.  I would like to see the Prime Minister stand up and defend it; I would like to know on what grounds he would do so.  I would like to see him attacking our position.  I want to know what we have done that would justify our being degraded to the level of slaves, bearing imposts which no other section in the community has to bear.  What argument can the Prime Minister adduce for that?  What arguments can the Government Party bring forth to justify that? I will be told that this issue was before our Party seven or eight years, and that it was turned down by a commission that had been set up to deal with it.  That is true.  Some of us were just as keen about it then as now, but we did not see the implications then as closely as we see them now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that on this Vote we can discuss the question of the general policy of the Executive Council or the Government, and as the Government is charged with the tremendous responsibility of ruling this country and seeing that the people of this country get justice, fair treatment and a chance of living in this country, it should be the duty of the members of this House to co-operate with the Government as far as possible and to make any suggestions they think reasonable &mdash; suggestions that would be likely to help the Government in improving their general economic policy and in promoting that national recovery which is the urgent need at the present moment.  The country at the present time is in many respects declining.  It is declining economically and socially &mdash; I will not say morally.  It is declining for the reason that the most important industry in the country, the industry upon which the entire population have got to depend, has been reduced to an impoverished condition.  Until that industry is placed on an independent footing and on a paying basis there is no hope whatever for economic recovery.  The proof that the agricultural industry is declining can be found in the statistics published by the various Departments of the Government.  Statistics prove that the rural population is declining while the urban population is increasing. Our statistics prove that the value of our exports is declining and has declined during the past few years to an enormous extent &mdash; I believe by £20,000,000 per year &mdash; statistics which prove that the earning power of each individual farmer working on the land has declined from £93 per year to £51 per year.  All these figures or statistics show that the agricultural industry is in a really desperate position, but one does not require departmental figures to realise the position to which the agricultural industry has been reduced. One has only to note the impoverished condition of the people who are working on the land.  One has only to go to the rural districts and see the women and children out working in the fields because the farmer cannot afford to employ labour and pay for labour at a reasonable rate of wages. <Col N="277" /> We see also young people flocking into the cities and flocking to the emigrant ship, trying to get away from a life of poverty, a life of penal servitude, upon the land.  We must ask ourselves, why does not the Government take adequate steps to end this situation? There is a reasonable answer that they will make, or rather a reasonable question that they will put by way of answer.  They will ask: &ldquo;What steps do you wish us to take in order to put the agricultural industry on a sound and paying basis?&rdquo; The first step is to ensure that everything the farmer produces on the land, everything that it is necessary for him to produce upon the land, should carry a remunerative price &mdash; a price that will cover the cost of production and enable him to pay a living and a reasonable wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you examine the prices of the various foreign products and live stock during the past five years&mdash;and you must always take an average of five years in order to find out whether farming is paying or not &mdash; if you average the prices of any foreign product for the past five years, you will find that the farmer has been working at slave wages: that he has been giving away the produce of his labour for absolutely nothing.  Take, for example, the farmer who bought a calf in 1932 for £3.  In 1935 he probably sold that calf for £3, after feeding it for two years.  Was that just remuneration for the farmer?  The same applies to other products.  Take, for example, beet.  For two or three years farmers were compelled to grow beet at 30/- per ton, a price which did not allow the workers in the industry a living wage.  At the present time that price has been substantially increased, but it will require to be further increased if the farmer is to continue in the beet-growing industry.  In addition to fair prices, it is absolutely necessary that the farmer must not be wronged in the matter of taxation. There is an obligation on the Government to see that justice is done to farmers and to every citizen of the country in the distribution of the burden of taxation.  An obligation rests upon the State to see that no section of the community is forced to contribute in excess of what is just and <Col N="278" /> reasonable.  That obligation has not been carried into effect during the past few years.  Farmers have been taxed in a thousand different ways.  They have been taxed heavily to promote industrial development, which every progressive and every national-minded person agrees is absolutely necessary, but the promotion of industrial development has imposed upon the rural population and the farming community generally a crushing burden, an exceptionally heavy burden, and if the farmers are to continue to bear that burden, they must be given relief in other directions.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of direct taxation, you have the fact that the farmers have been overtaxed in the matter of annuities, and annuities must be regarded as a form of taxation since they are used, or the money collected under the heading of annuities is used, as revenue for the State to a large extent.  Now, in addition to what the farmer is called upon to pay to the Land Commission, he has been called upon during the past few years to pay duties upon his products exported from this country, to the tune of £5,000,000 a year, approximately. That was a crushing burden imposed on the farming community, and a burden from which other sections of the community have been exempt, and it represents only a small portion of the many burdens which have been placed on the farming community during the past few years.  We have also a burden imposed through the restrictions on agricultural exports &mdash; the losses sustained through those restrictions, the losses sustained by farmers through the maladministration of export bounties which, for one year&mdash; the year 1934 &mdash; were distributed by a Government Department, not on a basis of justice, but distributed to people who were selected by the Department as being exporters.  We know that that system was found to be unjust by the Government and that it was discontinued, and the export bounties were handed on direct to the producers.  I am sorry, what I really meant to refer to was the export licences, and not bounties.  These export licences were really valuable, and for one year they were retained in the <Col N="279" /> hands of the Department and handed over to exporters, while the farmers and producers were deprived of the benefit of them, although they were worth at least £5 each.  There was a tremendous loss inflicted on the farming community as a result of that, and there was also a tremendous loss inflicted on them through the smuggling of cattle.  That affected them to the extent that the smuggling of cattle pulled down the price of the cattle in the English market; at least, it deprived the farmer of the benefit of the market price in the English market, and thus it happened that the farmers, in addition to subsidising the so-called exporters, were also called upon to subsidise the smugglers.  The smuggling industry flourished for a year or two and tremendous profits were made at the expense of the agricultural producer.</P>
    <P>All these crushing burdens were placed on the shoulders of the farmer, and there never has been any question of making any recompense to the farming community for the losses they have sustained.  We will be told that tremendous sums of money have been spent on bounties, and that these compensate the farmer to a large extent. We know, however, that those bounties were paid to exporters, and that, owing to the restrictions on the export of live stock, and for various other reasons, a very small portion of those bounties was passed on to the farmer. We know also that, under the heading of compensation, we will have included the £250,000 that was paid to the proprietors of the Roscrea Meat Factory. That also will be included in the account of compensation to the farmers for their losses in the economic war.  But will any serious or fair-minded person dare to suggest that that money was for the benefit of the farming community?  Was it not to a very large extent for the benefit of those enterprising proprietors of the Roscrea factory?  The farmer did not get an economic price for his old cows.  He got 50/-, and even during the economic war 50/- was not a fair price for old cows.  The proprietors of the Roscrea <Col N="280" /> Meat Factory were given those cows absolutely free, skins and all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>I think that matter was discussed on another Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just pointing out, Sir, that other sections of the community have been compensated.  The proprietors of the Roscrea Meat Factory were compensated when it was found impossible to provide them free with the number of cows that was promised to them; but when it comes to the just claim of the farmers for compensation for the tremendous losses which they have suffered &mdash; losses amounting to approximately £20,000,000 a year for five years &mdash; no attempt is made to recompense them to any extent for those tremendous losses. Until some such attempt is made, no one can believe that justice is being done to the farming community.  It is not alone a question of doing justice to or compensating the farmers.  It is a still more important question.  It is a question of reviving the agricultural industry; it is a question of giving the people who are working on the land renewed confidence, a chance to live, and a chance to increase production. The wealth of this country will depend in the future to a very large extent upon the output of the land.  If the people who are living on the land are not given some encouragement to increase their output; if they are not provided with some very necessary capital to enable them to extend their industry, then there is no hope for this country; there is no hope for increasing the natural wealth of this country by increasing the output from the land. What the farmer needs at the present time is capital to enable him to restock his land, and to clear off the accumulated load of debt which is crushing him into the ground.  We were told years ago that the farmers of Ireland were divided into two classes, those who hunt and those who are hunted. To-day there is only one class in the farming community &mdash; those who are hunted; those who are hunted for rates, hunted for annuities, hunted for debts.  Until the powers that be stop hunting the farmer, and give him a <Col N="281" /> chance to settle down and work his land; until they give him a chance to recover some of the tremendous losses which he has suffered, there is no hope for the agricultural industry.  The arm of the agricultural producer to-day is paralysed by poverty.  He cannot increase the wealth of the nation.  If the farmer cannot increase the wealth of the nation, then the wealth of the nation cannot be increased, because there is no other industry in the country which is capable of such extensive and intensive development as the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to do justice to the farmer; to give him some recompense for what he has lost, and, above all things, to stop hunting him.  Surely, after all the farmer has suffered during the past five years, it should not be necessary to recruit a special force known as the Flying Squad to visit the farmers' holdings weekly and almost daily, and keep on persecuting and harassing the unfortunate farmer until he is forced to take his horses from under the plough and sell them in order to meet the demands of this special force.  Surely that should not be the policy of the Government in dealing with a section of the community who have borne a great national burden during the past few years, and who have made tremendous sacrifices in what the Government believe and what the majority of the people believe to be the best national interests.  Surely the Government must realise that the farmers are entitled to justice.  Yet it seems that the Government have not measured their actions in accordance with the principles of Christian justice. I will give an instance.  I will give the case of a struggling farmer whose cows were seized for annuities, although he, in common with all the other farmers in Ireland, had been paying the annuities twice over through the tariffs imposed on his produce, and through the devaluation of his stock. Surely, even if such a drastic step as to take from that farmer his sole means of living were necessary, the powers that be should have seen to it that that farmer got a fair price for his cows when they were offered for sale.  Yet what were the facts? <Col N="282" /> Those cows were put up for sale by the sheriff, and were bid for by the Government's agent.  They were bid up to a price of £90, which was approximately half their value.  It was found even then that the man to whom the cattle were knocked down had not the necessary capital to pay for them.  The cattle were put up for sale again.  They were bid for by the Government's agent and bought by him for £60, that is to say, £30 less than he had already bid for them. Surely the agent acting on behalf of the Government should have been instructed that it was his duty to act fairly.  Surely he should have been instructed that it was his duty to give the unfortunate farmer whose stock were seized a fair price for his produce.  Unfortunately that was not done.  If this agent got instructions that he was to do justice to the unfortunate farmer he apparently ignored those instructions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated that he intended to discuss general Government policy on this Vote.  The matters to which the Deputy now refers were discussed in detail on two other Estimates when the House had not the benefit of the Deputy's presence.  If an individual case is raised in discussing general policy, it is very difficult for the Minister to reply without having had previous notice of the case in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Government to change their attitude with regard to the unfortunate agricultural producer.  I appeal to them to get the idea that the farmer is not a convict on licence; that he is a decent citizen, prepared to do his part in this country, prepared to co-operate with the Government in whatever steps they may desire to take in promoting economic development and progress. You have had an example during the last few years of the manner in which the farmers have co-operated with the Government.  First, you had the beet growing industry, a new industry introduced in this country ten or 12 years ago.  The farmers knew nothing about <Col N="283" /> beet growing.  They were asked in the national interests to grow beet.  They took it up enthusiastically, more enthusiastically than any other section of the community would take up a new branch of industry if asked to do so.  They took up beet growing and made it a tremendous success.  I am proud to belong to the county which led the way in making the beet growing industry such a success.</P>
      <P>There was the attitude of the farmers towards wheat growing, and towards every other branch of industry that the Government tried to promote or develop.  The Government had the wholehearted co-operation and support of the farming community in that respect.  Farmers were always ready and willing to do their part in whatever policy was considered best in the national interests.  All they ask is that the Government should do justice to the farming community, by relieving them of the crushing overhead charge imposed upon them, seeing that they get fair prices for the products of their labour and, above all, that they get some little opportunity to recover from their present impoverished condition.  We know that in 1933 when the farmers were in a difficult position, but were not as badly off as they are to-day &mdash; because they had not then met the full force of the economic blizzard &mdash; the Government suspended the collection of annuities for a time, reduced the annuities permanently, and funded outstanding arrears.  Is it not possible for the Government to take the same course now, to suspend the collection of annuities for a time, to fund outstanding arrears, and reduce the annuities once more to the amount required to meet Government liability under the Land Purchase Acts?  I do not believe that liability exceeds £1,000,000 per annum, although £2,000,000 are being collected.  That is all we ask of the Government on behalf of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully sympathise with the views of the previous speaker, and I want to refer briefly to a few <Col N="284" /> matters appropriate to this Vote.  I do not want to go back on what happened for the last few years.  As a result of the economic war we know that farmers are entitled to compensation and to justice for the losses they sustained. Apart from that, continued injury is being done to the farming community, because the tendency of legislation is to drive people off the land.  Every Act passed into law during the last four or five years, when it is examined, shows that the tendency is to drive people off the land, whether farmers, farmers' sons and daughters, or agricultural workers, because two standards of living are being set up here.  There is one standard for the cities and one for the rural districts.  That is evident in every Act passed by this House.  For instance, take the position of industrialists and compare it with the agricultural industry.  In the case of industrialists in places other than rural districts, provision is made to give them in some cases as much as 75 per cent. protection.  Only yesterday I received notice of the imposition of a duty amounting to 75 per cent. on certain articles of delph.  A number of other articles are protected to an enormous extent, yet the agricultural producer is not only competing in the world's markets but, as the Taoiseach knows, he has to take a lesser price for his produce.  Cattle or other agricultural produce from Éire must be exported by an approved road and, in the market, these cattle are about £1 or 30/- under the price paid for cattle on the other side of the Border.  At the end of the economic war farmers here found that they had to produce under world prices, while other producers had an advantage of 35 to 70 per cent. for their goods.  That was done at the expense of the agricultural community, whether farmers or working people.  That is the position and it is an inequitable one.  Even that might not be so bad.  But what is the real position?  In the matter of taxation here discrimination is made against the farmers.  They are the only people paying direct taxation. On grounds of equity that position cannot be defended.  I refer to the demand for derating.  It has been stated that a commission was set up <Col N="285" /> to inquire into the question.  I was a witness before that commission and when I referred to the equity or inequity of rating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy was present when the Chair indicated to Deputy Gorey certain lines of debate to-day, lines which Deputy Gorey did not follow very closely.  The underlying theme of several Estimates cannot be the same.  For four or five years, the economic war underlay almost every Opposition motion brought before the House.  The question of agricultural derating cannot be substituted as the underlying note in other debates.  On the Estimate for Agriculture, derating was discussed at length.  Yesterday it arose rather irregularly.  On this Estimate derating should not be discussed.  In any case, the derating of agricultural land would require legislation.  Legislation may not be advocated on Estimates.</P>

I am referring to the methods by which prices are artificially fixed in order to give industrial producers an advantage of from 50 to 75 per cent. over agricultural producers.  Then there is the incidence of direct taxation, which is inequitably imposed.  It has been stated over and over again that a commission had gone into the question.  I happened to be a witness at that commission, and I was called to order on several occasions for introducing the inequity or otherwise of taxation. because the terms of reference of the commission precluded consideration of that question.  The terms of reference did not allow the equity of the case to be considered at all, so that it was necessary, before this thing could be satisfactorily dealt with or regarded as having been dealt with by the commission, that the terms of reference should include the equities of the case.  That is all I want to say about derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter.  Social legislation in this House has the very same trend.  It is so shaped and so drafted as to drive the people off the land.  I simply give you one instance <Col N="287" /> and it is typical of many other Bills that go through this House.  Take the case of widows' pensions.  I do not know how the Taoiseach can defend paying a widow in the country 40 per cent. of what a widow in the city gets as a pension. That in effect is what the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act does, and it is most inequitable that a woman in the city should be paid two and one-half times as much as her sister in the country.  I think that any representative coming from the rural districts is not worthy to represent his constituents if he stands over that.  I do not care whether they be Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or Independent, it is up to them to see there is more equity in the legislation that is passed by this House.  A widow in a rural district gets 3/- if she happens to have 5/- of an income.  If she happens to live in the city she gets 7/6. I challenge contradiction of that.  If she happens to have one dependent, provided she lives in Dublin, she gets 7/-.  If she lives in a rural district she gets 4/6.  I put it to all the Deputies on all sides of the House, do they approve of that, especially those Deputies who come from rural districts? Are they satisfied that that is just?  Not only are the farmers unjustly treated but everybody in the rural districts.  The position is that these people are driven off the land. Some people do not seem to understand it because they do not give enough thought to it; they do not know exactly that it is the legislation that is driving them off the land. They had difficulties with bad times. Agricultural depression was worldwide some five or six years ago, but that has passed away.  Times are prosperous, but now they are being driven off by the legislation of the present Government and the Taoiseach is responsible for that because he is the head of the Government.  I hope that amends will be made in these matters, that he will seriously consider this question and change the general policy I know it will be said: &ldquo;We have got a mandate for this.&rdquo; Ninety per cent. of the people who gave that mandate did not examine <Col N="288" /> these things.  They do not understand them, but they have got to learn, and they will learn, and I hope that the Taoiseach, now that he has been given the responsibility, will rise to his responsibility and do justice to the people in the country, whether they are farmers, labourers, widows, or whatever is their position.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made myself clear that the trend of legislation is directed against the people in the rural districts, that that is the general policy of the Government and that it must be changed or otherwise, as other Deputies have pointed out, the people will fly off the land.  Such as remain there are growing old.  They are unmarried.  The population is going down.  The schools are being closed, or they must be closed eventually, because there is no prospect unless there is a change.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of loans, it is well known that the people engaged in the agricultural industry cannot get loans while the people in other industries can.  The reason for that is, not that the Credit Corporation or the banks are afraid that these people are not honest; they know they are amongst the most honest people in the country; but they know that in their present position it is impossible for them to carry on and to make a profit such as would enable them to pay 5 per cent. interest plus sinking fund upon loans.  These banks are very shrewd people.  They will not allow public money for which they are responsible to be loaned to agriculturists. Neither will the Credit Corporation. The reason is that interest is too high and the farmer's economic position is such, with the overheads and with the high cost of production and the poor prices, that he cannot meet his liabilities and pay off any debts.  That is why he will not get credit.  It is up to the Taoiseach now to change the policy of his Government, to put the farmers in the position that they will be able to get credit facilities the same as any other industrial undertaking in this country. Then, and only then, can they give increased employment and do their share to remedy the greatest evil we <Col N="289" /> have in this country, that is, unemployment. The land of this country could give employment to every unemployed hand in this country if things were run wisely and if the Government understood agriculture better and dealt with it more sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and mind you, I will give you this authority for it, the authority of your Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass, and I think that is perfectly good authority from the Deputy's point of view.  Quite recently, at least last year &mdash; this was after he had learned a lesson and after Deputy Kelly and all the people on those benches had learned a lesson &mdash; he made a statement in the House.  Do you know what it was?  I am referring to this specially for Deputy Kelly's benefit, because Deputy Kelly is a man who maintains that he wants to see the standard of living raised in this country.  We all do. What was the cure which the Minister for Industry and Commerce had for the raising of the standard of living here? He said the standard of living would increase when we increased our purchasing power, and our purchasing power would increase when we increased and got higher prices for our exports.  What are we exporting?  We are exporting agricultural produce and nothing else &mdash; nothing else.</P>

    <Col N="290" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may possibly be able to carry some conviction to Deputy Kelly through the words of his own Minister, who told us that the standard of living can only be raised if we can get higher prices for agricultural exports.  Those are his words.</P>
      <P>It is possibly a bit too early to expect from the Taoiseach a statement on Government policy.  A lot has happened in the past six months. The Government have become converted completely to the policy that we advocated &mdash; that was the policy that agriculture was the mainstay of this country, that live stock was the mainstay of agriculture, and that the British market was essential to that.  It is a complete conversion.  Now that the Taoiseach has got his two feet on the ground, that he does realise that it is not like crying for the moon to be crying for the British market, that it is worth crying for, now that he has realised that, he ought to communicate in some shape or form to the people of this country what he has in view to put this country back on its feet again. When he settled the economic war every person in this country was delighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to consider the policy of the Government, as enunciated from time to time, by the Taoiseach particularly &mdash; the policy of self-sufficiency &mdash; and when we come to consider in conjunction with that the terms of the Agreement with Britain, we feel there has been a complete change and that the country ought to be told in the very near future what prospects are in view, from the Government side, with regard to putting this country back on its feet.  It is not enough for the Government to say to the agricultural community that they have now got the British market.  We had the British market, more of it, before the present Government came into office. What happened?  During the period of the economic war other people came in and took the British market behind our backs.  Now we have only a portion of that market.  Our exports to Britain are not anything like what they were.  If the Government are <Col N="291" /> convinced that our standard of living will increase when our exports increase and when we get a higher price for our exports, what will the position be if we produce more goods in this country and if we are not able to sell them?</P>
    <P>If we are going to get back to the British market, are we just to get back what there is there at the moment, or are we going to make any attempt to try to get some share of what we have lost?  Will we attempt to beat the other fellow, and how are we going to do that?  Is there anything in the policy enunciated by the Government that would show that they are alive to that situation?  Is there anything in the policy preached by the Government on election platforms which would show they are now alive to the realities of the situation, that they have got their feet on the ground and that some attempt will be made to put our people into profitable production?</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Government or any section of the people advocating a line of activity which does not pay.  It is ordinary horse sense that, if we are going to produce, we ought to produce something that leaves a profit.  I remember a statement made from this side of the House, when the Taoiseach was in opposition, to the effect that people would be expected to work for the good of the community. That may be a very high ideal and very good, but where is it going to get you?  Do you think any people in this world are going to work for any such thing, outside philanthropists or people with money who can afford to do it? The ordinary man in the field, or in the street, who has to bring up a family, rear and educate them, and who contributes his share to the running of the country, is considering one thing, and that is, what pursuit can he follow profitably so as to leave him some margin to educate and bring up his family?  That is what we want here.  How far have the Government gone for the last six years to put any scheme like that into operation?</P>
    <P>Let the Taoiseach examine his own programme for the last six years, and <Col N="292" /> examine the figures produced by his own Departments with regard to agricultural exports and business generally &mdash; I am talking now of business that pays as a result of production.  If the Taoiseach will examine these figures, he will find that this country cannot exist unless the individual can follow some pursuit for profit.  I think the Taoiseach has abandoned his policy of self-sufficiency.  He has got away from the idea that I heard him mention from these benches once, that he wanted the country to be in the position that, if there was a big wall built around it, it could still exist.  Possibly, it could still exist, but does any person want to get back to the conditions under which it would exist if it were in that position?  I do not think anybody does.</P>
    <P>We can get to a policy of self-sufficiency. The farming community can go back to subsistence farming, but where is it going to lead you, and who will be the first real sufferers? The first real sufferers will be the people in the towns.  If you want to drive the farmers into subsistence farming, producing just their own requirements, the first thing that would happen would be that their standard of living would be reduced, but the towns, for lack of business and profitable exchange, would go out first.  That policy of self-sufficiency has been abandoned because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never contemplated to that extent, I entirely agree, but that would be the logical ending. The Taoiseach did not see at that time where it would lead him, but now he does.  Having realised that this country must follow some pursuit for profitable exchange, and that pursuit is agriculture, the Taoiseach recognises that the British market is essential, and he has settled the whole matter.  We are in entire agreement with him.  Having come to that stage, what are the new proposals to get us back into the position we held in the British market? There do not appear to be any, and that is our complaint.  That was our complaint last night when the Supplementary <Col N="293" /> Agricultural Grant was being considered, the Estimate that Deputy T. Kelly thought was the Estimate of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was our complaint, too, when the Department of Agriculture Estimate was before the House last week.  Deputy Corry last night advocated fixed prices for certain things.  Our complaint again, which Deputy Corry apparently did not see, was that that was not in the Department of Agriculture Estimate.  It is not, either.  We advocated last night some system whereby those grants would be increased, which would be tantamount to derating.  We were entitled to do that.  We believe that if the country is to exist, if the farming community are to pursue farming for profitable exchange, their overhead charges must be reduced.  We have heard the Minister for Finance introducing Estimate after Estimate, all of which are increased, and his explanation for the increase in every case is the cost-of-living bonus.  In one Estimate alone the cost-of-living bonus put up the figure by £22,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we asking for something exceptional for the farmers, seeing that that is being done by the taxpayers for the people who are in those particular Departments?  Are we asking something exceptional when we put it that the farmers' overhead charges ought to be met in some way?  We claim that the agricultural community are suffering, and have suffered for the last six years, greater hardships than any of the people mentioned in those Estimates. If any case can be made in that respect it has been made by the Minister for Finance.  In addition to that, those people mentioned in the Estimates, whose allowances have to be increased because of the increased cost of living, have not to bear the same charges which the agricultural community has to bear.  In a lot of instances those people are not themselves ratepayers. Now all over the country the rates have increased enormously in the last four or five years and they are still increasing.  If the people on this side <Col N="294" /> of the House have demanded derating is it not very reasonable?  The case has been made from the other side of the House against derating that while the halving of the annuities was of great benefit to the people of this country, derating would be of no benefit.  Both statements were made in the same breath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to introduce it to that extent.  I am only referring to it to the extent of showing that the comparison made by the other side is absolutely unfair.  I am making a plea for fair treatment for the agricultural community.  The people on the other side say that the farmers have got benefit by the halving of the annuities, and they say in the same breath that no benefit would be given by derating because the benefits would be to the large holders.  Now if a man has a large annuity to pay he gets half of that annuity; if he has a small annuity to pay he gets half of that annuity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He gets no benefit by halving the annuity.  Deputy Corry is making my case.  There is no use in people on the Government side saying that the farmer has got benefits by halving the annuities and using that as an argument against derating. That argument does not hold water at all.  The people on the opposite side say that the Government has got a mandate to carry on.  They have, but they have not got a mandate to sit down and do nothing.  We cannot, as Deputy Cogan said, sit down and do nothing for the people of this country, the people who have to carry the burden.  It is no use, even if the Government does realise the situation, unless they do something to put the people back where they found them six years ago.  For the last six years, as part of Government policy, we have had tariffs imposed indiscriminately. <Col N="295" /> I wonder if the Taoiseach has ever thought, or if he has put it to his Government, that in considering what tariffs would be imposed there should always be some relation between those tariffs and the agricultural community. There should be, and there must be.  It is not good enough to say to the agricultural community that tariffs are going to be imposed upon agricultural implements, agricultural tools and agricultural machinery unless there is development along these particular lines.  Now as far as the customs duties show, there has not been anything commensurate with the tariffs imposed.  Unless the people who are making these implements and machinery give us as good an article as we get elsewhere, the farmer, as the primary producer, is not getting the consideration that he deserves. What do we get?  I found in the <i>Trade Journal</i> some time ago a very interesting announcement amongst Government contractors.  There has been a tariff on spades, shovels, graipes and forks.  I am compelled because of that tariff to buy an Irish-made spade&mdash;I want to buy an Irish-made spade but I want the Irish-made spade to be as good as another spade. Notwithstanding that tariff the G.P.O. placed its contract for spades with a firm in Sheffield.  They go to that firm when they want spades&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>That is the type of case to which it would be very difficult for the Taoiseach to reply.  If my memory is not at fault, that case was raised on the Post Office Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a lot of tinkering with the industrialisation of the country.  I admit a lot of good work has been done, but I do submit that care was not taken and is not being taken, to see what effect these tariffs would have upon the primary producer.  Surely if the Government has any hand in the setting up of factories in this country it ought to be careful in seeing how that work is done. The Government ought to be careful to see that what happened in the case of the Roscrea factory should not <Col N="296" /> happen again.  In that case we paid for and bought old cows to be sent to Roscrea to be turned into meat meal. We ought to be thoroughly careful in doing a thing like that to see that a great injury is not done to the interests of other meat factories in this country. The people knew that these old cows were not fit for human consumption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was discussed on a previous Estimate by Deputy Gorey.  As already pointed out, in a discussion on general Government policy detailed cases should not be raised.  A reply would be impossible in such cases unless the Minister had notice in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just so, but I want to make a passing reference to this.  I do not know whether the Government is aware that this factory which was subsidised by them was responsible for turning out matter like that, and thus doing an injury to other meat factories. These are things to which the Government have not given consideration. They have never considered what the reactions and repercussions of these things upon the primary producers may be.  These are the things on which the Taoiseach should take advice from people who are in a position to give the best advice that can be given.  I am sure in the Department of Agriculture the Taoiseach and the Government will find officials capable of advising them as to what is best to be done in these cases, and what is the best thing to be done for agriculture.  With the settlement made with Great Britain so near us, I suppose it would be too much to expect the Taoiseach to give us any outline of his change of policy, because there must be a change of policy.  There has been an entire change of front.  I want to know what is being done to give effect to this change of front?  Perhaps it is too soon to expect an answer.  I am patient in this matter, and I make every allowance for the short time that has elapsed since the Agreement was made.  I do <Col N="297" /> think that no matter what mandate the Taoiseach has got at the general election, he is expected to give some effect to the changed outlook of himself and his Government on the agricultural situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree that the Taoiseach has good reason to smile.  It has been a laughing matter neither to the country nor to the Taoiseach to look back just a little on what was Government policy or, at least, what was the policy delivered by Government spokesmen, and the Taoiseach's policy at the present time, so far as one can gather it from the London Agreement and the election speeches.  I do not wonder that the Taoiseach smiles when he looks back and thinks of Senator Connolly's thanking God that the British market was gone, and gone for ever, and when he thinks of the Minister for Lands announcing that although it took a long time to build up the Irish cattle trade, it would take a very short time to tear it down.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach went to the country on the London Agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;well, partially on it &mdash; in view of that fact, it is no wonder he smiles when he looks back on these statements.  Possibly the Taoiseach thinks that he has got away with it.  Possibly he thinks that the memory of the people here in this country is very short, or takes very little notice of the speeches or announcements of Senator Connolly or the Minister for Lands.  It is hard, Sir, to criticise Government policy in this Estimate since we do not know what Government policy is.  To a certain extent, in connection with the Estimates that were dealt with in the last Dáil, you were given the policy <Col N="298" /> of the various Departments, but there is a number of Estimates not yet dealt with.  Neither during the general election nor since has anybody heard from the Taoiseach as to what the Government's present or future agricultural policy was likely to be, and when the Taoiseach is replying I should like to hear from him as to whether or not the position now is that, having regained the British market, steps are going to be taken to put the agricultural community of this country into such a position as will enable them to get the fullest benefit from that market and to enable them to compete with the people who have succeeded in increasing their imports into the British market during the period in which the Government were too proud to go into that market and said they did not want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible that the Taoiseach has not yet made up his mind as to what his future agricultural policy will be.  It is quite possible that it is not easy for him to make up his mind as to his future policy.  If one were to judge by the references made here to-day by Deputy Kelly and the references made last night by Deputy Corry, there would seem to be intense disagreement on the Government Benches as to the future agricultural policy, because, if Deputy Kelly represents anybody but himself, it would seem that he does not want to hear any more about farmers, and it would seem that Deputy Corry &mdash; at any rate, in his public utterances &mdash; does not want to hear anything except about the tillage farmers.  As a matter of fact, I do not think that is really Deputy Corry's actual attitude, or that he is such a terrible advocate of tillage farming as he would lead us to believe. However, passing away from that, I await with interest what the Taoiseach or any member of the Government will have to say as to their future agricultural policy.  I am not going to criticise the Government's agricultural policy before I hear what it is.  Apart, however, from the question of agriculture, there is a number of other items on which there has been a change of front, and again I await with interest some statement from the Taoiseach, or <Col N="299" /> from some member of the Government, as to what their policy is with regard to these items, because, once upon a time, there was a fairy tale, known as &ldquo;The Plan,&rdquo; for the relief of unemployment. I await with interest, as I say, a statement as to what is the Government policy in the future to deal with the unemployment menace in this country.  The unemployment situation has not been improved one iota in the last five or six years.  Mind you, as I have said, there would seem to be, again, a change of front here, but whether it is a change of heart or a change of policy I do not know, because, six long years ago, there was a plan, but in 1938, even in Blarney &mdash; even in industrialised Blarney &mdash; there was no plan or ready-made solution for unemployment.  Again, I do not want to criticise the Government policy until I hear it, but I should like to ask whether any steps are to be taken to deal with the unemployment situation in this country.  Are the Government seriously considering doing anything about that problem, or is the position to be that the Taoiseach will just sit back and smile and let things drift?</P>
    <P>There is one other item to which I should like to refer.  Possibly it is the reason why Government policy has been left so vague both during and since the general election.  One might refer to it as the missing document.  It is now three months since it was delivered &mdash; in March last &mdash; and I presume that, when the stress of the general election was over, either the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach got time to read that document.  I refer to the report of the Banking Commission. What effect that report will have, when published, on Government policy, I do not presume to say.  I hope we will get that report soon and that, when we get it, the Taoiseach will still be able to smile; but when we do get it, no matter what is in it, I hope the Government will come to this House and, whether acting on the report that may be in that document or, entirely without it, acting on the commonsense view of the present situation, will give us some idea, now that they have their mandate, as to what their <Col N="300" /> policy is going to be both with regard to the agricultural community of this country and the unemployment situation in this country, because it is perfectly evident in the rural areas that, no matter what the Government may say about the situation in the country generally, not alone is the agricultural community in a low state of circumstances, but among the hardest-hit sections of the community in this country are the small towns and villages who have got no benefit under the Government's industrial policy, having no new industries there, and who have felt the pinch of the economic war and the stress of the last few years just as much as the agricultural community did.  They were hard-hit because, if the agricultural community &mdash; the farmers &mdash; had not the money to buy the goods of the shopkeepers in these small towns and villages, they could not carry on.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is not easy to criticise Government policy in this Estimate when we do not know what the Government policy is, and I await with interest the Taoiseach's statement on these three items: The question of the agricultural community; the question of the small people in the towns and villages and the business they have lost in the last six years; and the question of what is going to be done about unemployment.</P>

      <P>I should just like to say a few words about some of the statements that have been made.  We were told by Deputy Brennan to put the agricultural community of this country back where we found them.  Where was that?  It was in the position that was outlined by Deputy Carey here on those benches &mdash; a Deputy from my own constituency &mdash;</P>

That is where Deputy Gorey would like to put them and the other tillage farmers in the country.  Deputy Bennett also told us that we had no mandate to sit down and do nothing. The people of this country gave their mandate and their verdict, and they did not want to get back to that position of 1929 to which I have referred. They had got enough of it during the period that Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal or whatever they call themselves were in office.  They got enough of it during that period.  They had got the full length and breadth of the policy of sitting down and doing nothing and of the policy that endeavoured in this House, when there was economic war on, to place the farmers in the position of having to sell their milk at 2d. a gallon.  That was the policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Up to the moment, the discussion on this Vote by Deputies opposite has centred around the wretched position of the agricultural community to-day.  But, according to Deputy Gorey's statement, and Deputy Brennan's statement also, 50 per cent. of them &mdash; namely, the farmers who worked and tilled their land &mdash; suffered nothing and made money during the economic war.  Well then, the position cannot be so bad.  If the other 50 per cent. did not make money, it was because they were too lazy to make it. I am just putting it in a nutshell.  Yet, those statements are made by the people over there who will never be educated.  They have gone before the people half a dozen times &mdash; they have gone before them in 1932, 1933, 1937 and 1938 &mdash; and have got their answer every time, but still they are not educated.  Deputy Dillon told us here the other day that they would not be bribed or intimidated.  Apparently they cannot be educated either.</P>

      <P>In regard to the position of the agricultural community I just wanted to point out those matters.  The position of the agricultural community, <Col N="303" /> as we view it to-day, is far better than it was when we came into office.  We have secured markets for them here at home.  The English market, which Deputy Gorey alluded to, so far as we were concerned, would still have to be subsidised.  The agricultural policy that we have been pursuing here is the only agricultural policy that is going to suit the ordinary farmer in this country. There is very little use in Deputies here getting up and talking about derating and about halving the annuities, and making a comparison between this and Northern Ireland; such a comparison is absolutely useless so far as we are concerned.  I just wished to point out these matters to the Deputies opposite.  We have already pointed them out often enough to get them inside the thickest skin.  The Deputies' hides are so thick that it is impossible to get inside them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it particularly difficult to deal with the debate as it has proceeded so far.  If I were to deal with the points raised by Deputy Gorey I suppose I should have to go into the whole question of derating, but, according to your ruling, Sir, this is not the occasion on which to deal with it.  This has really seemed to turn into a debate on agricultural policy.  I should have imagined that that would have been more properly dealt with on the occasion of the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  However, there is this question of general Government policy in relation to agriculture. It has been suggested that there has been a change of front.  I smiled, as the Deputy noticed, because it is amusing to see this attempt being persisted in &mdash; this attempt to explain the past of that Party by pretending now that it is we who have been converted to their point of view.  For several years past in this debate we have had to deal with the question of the financial dispute with Great Britain.  Anybody who is interested enough to look up the Official Debates will find that on every single occasion on which we had that debate I made <Col N="304" /> it perfectly clear that we were quite ready at any time to discuss with the British Government the settlement of that by negotiation.  On more than one occasion we actually had negotiations with the British Government about it, but the attitude of the British Government was such that it was quite impossible to reach any conclusion which would be satisfactory to this country, and the thing had to be ended.  Now, what was the Government policy fundamentally in regard to that dispute?  It was this, that £5,000,000 of Irish money was being taken away, was being handed over, and as to £3,000,000 of it we were perfectly certain it was not due.  There was a question with regard to £2,000,000 more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very old tale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an old tale, but why do Deputies like the Deputy on the Front Bench there now want to come back on each occasion and think to get away with the other version of it?  That is what I smiled at, because they think that the people are such fools that they do not see down beneath the surface of those matters. The fact is that that money had to be paid somehow from the produce of this country.  I have here before me figures showing the value of the fat cattle &mdash; one of the Deputies a moment ago spoke about the value of the foreign market, and said that live stock was the best of it &mdash; and the value of the fat bulls and bullocks in the year 1931, before we came into office, came to a little over £3,500,000; and the value of the fat heifers came to £1,250,000; so the total value of all the fat cattle was only £4,750,000.  Therefore, it was essential that produce of the equivalent of £250,000 more than the value of all the fat cattle produced in that year had to go to pay that debt. The policy of the Government was to get rid of that burden which was unjustly placed upon our community, and which we felt was of such magnitude that the community could not prosper if they had to continue payment of it. Now, it was definitely to rid the country of that burden that we said that the £3,000,000 of it which we were <Col N="305" /> quite satisfied was neither legally nor morally due was to be retained at home.  The dispute and the struggle during the last five years has been to make good our claims and our rights in that respect.</P>
      <P>I have admitted that hardship was inflicted by that on the agricultural community.  I have never denied that on any occasion.  That hardship was doubly severe because of the fact that agriculture was so depressed all over the world, and we shared in the depression, so that it would have been a bad time for farming in any case.  I have here a table of agricultural prices ranging back from 1922. There has always been a suggestion that the difficulties arose only when we came into office.  That cannot be sustained for one moment in the light of the facts that are available.  If you will look at the index of agricultural prices from 1922 on you will find that the index of prices here in this part of Ireland runs down from 160 in 1922 to 144 in 1923; it went up again to 160 in 1924; then it dropped to 157, 140, 131, 137; it went up in one year to 139, and then dropped suddenly from 1929.  Now, there was going to be a big drop from 1929, as the Deputy knows perfectly well, and that was two years before we came into office. Yet you want to put upon us and upon our Government policy during that period the blame for the total amount of the hardship that has been imposed on the farmers.  I say that only portion of that hardship was due to the British tariffs.  I am ready to admit, and I have always admitted, that the extra pressure of the British tariffs added to what was already a bad case.  I want to point out that agriculture was in a bad condition before we got into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>And that was the time you selected to have another £15,000,000 added to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not select the time.  We selected the time when we got into office because of the fact that if that money was paid for one term you were admitting the case. We had to make that fight from the very beginning.  We were put into <Col N="306" /> office in 1932, and we made it quite clear to the people from that moment that we were not going to pay that money.  From 1929 to 1930 the index price dropped from 139 to 124.  From 1930 to 1931 it dropped another 14 points.  There was a drop from 139.3 to 110. and then down to 98.  That drop is proved by the figures in the Census of Production.  If you take production in 1929 in bacon and hams, it amounted to 870,000 cwts., and in 1931 that had dropped to 736,000 cwts.  There was a decrease in production over two years on account of the world situation, and we participated in it.  In butter there was a drop from 709,000 cwts to 611,000 cwts.  In wheat there was a drop from 634,000 cwts. to 418,000 cwts., and in wheaten flour from 4,000,000 to 3,800,000 cwts.  The index figures, showing a diminution in prices and a diminution in production, prove actually that agriculture was in a serious situation before we got into office.  We did not select the time.  The time was selected by the fact that from the first moment we got into office we believed the money was not due, and we had to hold it.  I do not want to go into the case of the land annuities, the financial dispute, and Government policy in regard to these matters further than to insist that our policy has saved that money for this country, and it is equivalent to saving for the country the value of all the fat stock produced in the years before we came into office.  Whether people say that the cost of that fight was great or small, I am quite willing to admit that it put an extra burden at the time on the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came into office the position was so bad in the dairying industry, as Deputies know, that we had to introduce a Bill for the stabilisation of prices, as a result of which £1,000,000 was given to that industry which it otherwise would not have got.  The dairy farmers got prices that were far better and higher than the prices they would have got in the open market in Great Britain if there was no economic dispute at all and no tariffs.  The position with regard to agriculture was bad when we got into office, and if the Deputy <Col N="307" /> wants to have it that the British tariffs on the agricultural industry made the position worse I agree with him.  But we had either to continue to bear a burden which would have been a burden for a number of decades or fight for our rights. Fortunately there has been during that time an equivalent to the £5,000,000 a year.  If Deputies on the opposite benches were in office that £5,000,000 clearly would be paid. What you have to say is that the real burden on the community because of the struggle is the difference between the money extracted by means of British tariffs and money got otherwise. I do not want to try to bolster up a case on false arguments, and I am willing to admit that the method by which the British extracted £5,000,000 a year was a more severe method and harassed our community more than by paying the £5,000,000, and if it was going to continue indefinitely there would be a point in the Deputy's argument.  Our point was that it would not continue indefinitely, and we have been proved to be right.  The result of the Agreement is that whereas we would have had to pay the £5,000,000 for decades if the position had continued, now, as a result of the Agreement, that money will not have to be paid.  There has been relief to the community as a whole in regard to the land annuities of £78,000,000 as well as a further £10,000,000.  It has been suggested that there has been a change of policy. There has been no change.  Our policy in regard to agriculture has been so always.  There has been no change in regard to negotiating with Britain. We were quite ready to negotiate any time, and we proved that by actually going over, but we were not prepared to make a settlement on the basis of admitting that the debt was due, that the shillings and pence would then be knocked off, and we would pay the pounds.  Fortunately that is finished, and fortunately our efforts to retain the money have been successful.  What change in agricultural policy has there been?  None.  As I pointed out in statements made during the election, it is a simple thing for an <Col N="308" /> opponent to represent one as holding a certain position when you are not in that position at all, but when your opponent persists in saying you are, when the people discover the truth he is not there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any time I made any statement about the British market, I pointed very definitely to the statements of British Ministers, to the effect that in their own market they found that their industries were in a difficult position.  I pointed out that in Britain they were not able, without giving very heavy subsidies, to maintain their own market.  I pointed to the competition, and said that if there was a question of trying to get any market for which everyone was competing, the competition would be such as to make that market of very little value.  There was not going to be very much value in the English market to the dairying industry in 1932 and 1933, if our farmers only got the price that they would get in the open market.  If such conditions were to continue, then, as far as being a profit to us, that market would be of no value, and I would be justified in saying that the British market was gone.  It is very easy to take out a phrase or a sentence and to repeat it, leaving out the qualifications and conditions under which the statement was made, and then to misrepresent the attitude of the people who made it.  It has been suggested that this Government has not realised that agriculture is our principal industry. There has been no time on which I have spoken about industry, whether during the economic struggle or otherwise, in which I have not clearly stated that I hope it will long remain the principal industry of the country.  There is no town mentality either about the members of the Government or the members of our Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, looking at the personnel either of the Government or of our Party, we have got as great a proportion of country members who know country conditions and who are interested in country life as any other Party.  I sympathise with Deputy Gorey when he talks <Col N="309" /> about the change of conditions.  There have been very rapid changes in conditions in this country and in every other country practically between town and country life.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a very big change.  We may differ about the words.  There has been a very big change and one of the difficulties has been this, to try to get people who live in the cities to realise that that change has taken place.  It is not easy.  People who are living in the cities have amenities of various kinds and have a standard of various kinds. Whether in the long run it is a higher standard is another question and depends upon what you are going to use as your test of what is a high and what is a low standard of living.  But there is no doubt that, from a certain material point of view, the people in the cities have been able to make advances which it has not been possible for the country people to keep up with.  I quite agree to that and I do believe that it will be a serious loss to this country if we are not able to stop the change from country life to city life or to check the tendency that there is to go from the country into the towns.  Personally I believe that country life is far better.  I believe that there are advantages pertaining to country life which are not realised by a number of people who leave the country and go to the towns.  I believe they go there because various things attract them but afterwards, in the long run, country life is better for our people and a nation is a better and a stronger nation if it is based on country life rather than on city life and city conditions. Anything that we can do, in reason, to try and change that situation and to try to make living on the land more attractive we will do.  But will the Deputies who talk on the one hand about the burden that farmers have to bear and who say that everything goes back upon them, not realise that many of the remedies that are proposed are faulty just for that very reason, that the reliefs have to come from the class it is proposed <Col N="310" /> to help?  It should not have been necessary to talk here to Deputies in this strain, but I want to point out that the Government has no gold mine at its back.</P>

      <P>I admit again that one of the chief duties of the Government and of the Parliament here ought to be to try to do its best to even up conditions between the various classes and to see that the conditions are just between one class and the other in so far as it can.  It is not easy to do these things, as the Deputy knows.  It is extremely difficult.  You want to try and preserve fair and equitable relations between the different classes of the community. You try to get remedies for it but you often find that the remedies proposed are going to be faulty just because of the fact that those conditions cannot be remedied by the methods that are proposed.  I am ruled out of dealing with derating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind and so has every member of the Government in regard to all these matters of national welfare.  None of us in these matters is set in concrete. We have got to be shown that the suggestions that are made are just and wise and that they can be carried out effectively.  My own belief is that this derating policy, so far as I have seen it from the other side, is not equitable and, in fact, that it is going to put burdens just on the class that should not be asked to bear those burdens. However, as I have said, I do not want to be ambling around, as the Deputy was, trying to manæuvre around the ruling of the Chair in order to deal with this subject.  We can easily have it out.  It is quite easy for the Deputies to put down a motion &mdash; I am not suggesting it to them &mdash; but they know that it is quite easy for them to put down a motion in this House and, if it is of sufficient public importance, get it discussed publicly.  It is very much <Col N="311" /> better to do that in an orderly way, to have the thing worked out properly, than to bring it in on a side-wind on a debate of this kind.  I can tell the Deputy quite honestly that, so far as the Government is concerned, the bias is towards country life.  One of the elements of our policy was to try, so far as possible, to put as many families as could live in reasonable economic security on the land.  The Deputy knows that.  The Deputy knows that money is being spent in putting people on the land.  It would be ridiculous to be putting people on the land if the conditions were such that they could not continue on the land, so that, obviously, from the lines we have taken it must be our policy to try to make living upon the land feasible.  In so far as we can reasonably help to bring about the social situation here in which our land will be carrying a bigger proportion of the population relatively than the towns we will be only too happy to do it.  But these tendencies are very difficult to check and it would seem that it has not been possible in other countries to check it and I do not know what hope we can have here of being successful in any effort we may make towards doing it.  But for the will &mdash; if that is all the Deputy wants to be certain about &mdash; the will is here but the way of doing it is by no means evident and I do not want to pretend for a moment that the Government has a way which will inevitably lead to keeping people on the land instead of going to the towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our general policy with regard to agriculture has been this.  I said when I was in the bench occupied by some of the Deputies opposite at the moment that we ought to be able first of all to keep the home market for our farmers, that is, the home market for agricultural produce: &ldquo;Reserve that for your farmers anyhow,&rdquo; I said &ldquo;that is a sure market.&rdquo;  I will admit it is not able to absorb the whole of our agricultural produce.  We have an exportable surplus which we have got to market.  I could never understand the policy preceding our time.  The policy which was persisted in was not to protect the home market.  I remember <Col N="312" /> asking from those benches from the Minister for Agriculture here on this side: &ldquo;Will you be in any way diminishing your power to avail of the extern markets, such as you have, by protecting the home market and making that part of the market safe for your farmers?  It is a market that is going to be affected only by your own internal conditions.  It is not a market that can be taken from you by the policy of a foreign Government. Obviously you should try to secure for the farming community the home market in any case.&rdquo;  Have we done anything in that way?  We have, and the Deputy knows we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here figures showing the imports of agricultural produce before we came into office and the imports of agricultural produce now, and they show a very heavy diminution.  We have done it by positive action, and the result of that positive action is seen from the figures of the imports here of agricultural produce now and the imports in the year 1937 and the imports in the year 1931.  In 1931 imports of foodstuffs of various kinds here amounted to £16,200,000.  In the year 1937 that was diminished down to £10,729,000, which means that there has been a reduction of £5,472,000.  That corresponds to an increased market for our own farmers here at home.</P>

      <P>That is not my recollection. The Deputy may be right and he may be wrong, but I remember that when I was on the opposite benches I asked the Minister for Agriculture to try and save that, to keep at least the home market for Irish <Col N="313" /> produce in the way of various animal products, and I could never get from the Minister at the time what seemed to be a satisfactory answer as to why that was not done.  At any rate, it has been done by us and it is a part of our general policy to preserve the home market for the farmer.  If we had only enough produce on the land to feed our own people, it would be possible then to proceed on the lines of trying to get a just or a fair price. We have an exportable surplus which has to be got rid of and you have to have a certain adjustment between the price ruling here and the price that rules abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not now talking about exports.  I am dealing only with one aspect of it, and that is the preservation of the home market for our farmers.  I am not making a speech to suit any point of view the Deputy may want, and he will have to understand what I am dealing with.  Our agricultural policy may be divided into two parts, the internal and the external.  The internal portion seeks to save the home market and make it available for our producers here.  That we have done very thoroughly and effectively, and it is a safe home market.  With regard to the external market, we have never said that we should not get for our exportable surplus the best market available, but we had to do one thing which I indicated at the start; we had to save £5,000,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the basis of our attitude towards Britain, that we had to save £5,000,000 a year, which corresponded to more than the value of our fat cattle during the year we came into office.  If Deputies want to have it in terms of butter and other produce, I will give it to them.  Anyway, it was a burden that we had to try and remove from our people.  There <Col N="314" /> is no use in pretending that the struggle that we engaged in, in order to save that money, represented our attitude towards the British market or external markets.  It did not.  We realised all along that these markets were valuable.  The external side of our policy is that we would welcome any external markets we could get, and if we can get alternative markets that will supplement the existing market, we will be very glad to have them.  It is obvious that having all your eggs in the one basket is not a very wise policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>You have tried to get alternate markets and they cannot be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the desire was to supplement the existing market by getting alternative markets and they can be found, to a certain extent, to supplement the existing market.  There have been very valuable supplements found.  That their magnitude has not been great, I am quite willing to admit, and that they would not absorb the whole of our exportable surplus, I am also quite prepared to admit.  The idea is to make the best you can of that market in so far as it is possible to develop our agricultural industry so as to be in the best possible position to avail of whatever opportunities offer. That should be our aim and it is, I am sure, the aim of the Minister for Agriculture.  Any methods that can be used to decrease the cost of production and any other things that are possible, consistent with our line of policy, will be availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes there may be a conflict. For instance, some may want to provide a market for grain crops and it might appear to people in one part of the country that it might be better to let that part of the home market go by default and get in maize or something else of that sort instead of using home-grown grain.  There might be a difference of view and you might have conflicting elements.  In that case you have to consider the whole matter and see what would be most satisfactory for the community generally.  We have <Col N="315" /> taken up a certain line and we have tried to fix a balance.  Our aim is to keep the feeding stuffs for the Irish farmer, to diminish so far as possible the cost of production and put our people in a better position to compete in the foreign market.  You have to strike a balance between opposing elements and see how far you can go in making the best arrangement for the good of the community generally.</P>
    <P>In regard to agriculture, there has been no change.  I do not think there is need for any change. The change that has been effected is due to the fact that a third and outside party has consented to a certain agreement, and a dispute has been settled.  I do say, however, that if I were to find myself to-day in the same position in regard to that matter as I found myself last year.  I would indicate that, so far as this Government is concerned, we were not going to take the responsibility of advising the people to pay that money and to continue bearing that burden. We are in the fortunate position that that is not so, and therefore that particular point of difference between us does not now arise.  I take it that the fundamental attitude of the Opposition would be that it might be better to pay the money, to continue paying it rather than to face a fight.  That was the big difference between us.</P>
    <P>The Opposition undertook the payment of that money.  They said, &ldquo;We believe it should be paid; we believe it is due,&rdquo; and they were prepared to pay the money.  You had a hope, perhaps on account of the dispute having been started, that you might have made some settlement if you were in office. Perhaps you would have, and perhaps you would not have.  One thing I am quite satisfied about is that you were not in the position, on account of having made an agreement and having sponsored it as being just, to make a settlement which would be just and fair to this country.  That might have been so.  You could argue the matter till the end of the world, but I think there is no use in doing so.  Anyway, if I had to find myself in the same position as I occupied on other occasions, I would say to the people that they <Col N="316" /> should continue standing by their right, even though there was a certain pressure.</P>
    <P>So far as agriculture is concerned, we want to see the fullest possible use made of our land.  We favour the policy of growing beet and wheat. With regard to wheat, we have only gone one-third of the way.  Deputy Gorey and I had disputes long ago about the growing of wheat.  We were told, I think, that the farmer would only grow wheat if a pistol were put to his head, or something of that sort. That situation has passed.  It was not necessary to put a pistol to his head, anyhow.  We have over 200,000 additional acres under wheat.  We would want about three times that.  I think we ought to go on inducing the farmers as best we can to continue growing wheat, so that we will get a much bigger proportion of home-grown wheat than at present.  These things are not done without a burden on the community.  If we want to give the farmer a fair price for his butter, we have to charge the people in the towns more for their butter than if the butter were allowed to be imported freely. That was the case for a considerable period in the past.  It may be the case again.  Again there will be a balance between the interests of the farmers and the interests of the consumers in the towns and elsewhere.  It is the business of the Government to try and adjust these things, so that there is no unfair burden on any section of the community.  With regard to wheat growing, a stage may be reached in which it may be said that the burden is going to be too heavy to pay the farmer a high price as compared with the price at which wheat could be imported.  It may be said that that may put too heavy a burden on the community as a whole.  I am not prepared to say at what particular point we should stop.  My own view is that we should go on developing our tillage policy, trying to get more tillage.  If there was any truth in the arguments used by Deputies opposite in the last four or five years that tillage is dependent largely on a live-stock policy &mdash; and there is a certain amount of truth in that &mdash; then, if that is so, the conditions are favourable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> We are asked what further things do we propose to do for agriculture to enable the farmers to utilise the situation we have got.  There is one thing that Deputies on all sides of the House ought to do, and that is to educate the people to realise, just as I said a moment ago, that we have no gold mine from which we can draw. The only gold mines we have are the resources of the community as a whole. If you go looking for help for one section you have got to get it from another section.  There is no doubt about that.  When you ask the Government to help the farmers it is to the farmers themselves you have ultimately to go, because they have to bear, as the owners of the principal industry, a very large portion of the burden.  The resources of the country come largely from the farmers.  When you are asking the Government to do anything you are asking them to take from one section and give it to another &mdash; you are asking them to take from the farmers to give it to another section of the community.  One thing that all Deputies ought to do is this &mdash; to point out to the people as a whole that the Government by a general policy can bring about certain changes, but it finally comes down to the hard work of the individual himself and the use he makes of his own resources. These are the things which ultimately count.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about it.  In the long run, if we get our people to utilise the resources we have got, that is the very best way to help ourselves.  On the other hand, if the attitude of mind is to go to the Government for everything, the people will find they are leaning on something that is going to bend under them.  The Government cannot do those things except at the expense of some other section.  The Government can make certain things easier.  We are trying to bring about increased tillage and to make increased use of the soil for the production of the food of the people.  But in the long run production will depend on what way the individual uses his resources and <Col N="318" /> whether the people are prepared by hard work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Exactly; utilising the resources they have.  We all fundamentally realise these things no matter how we may argue about what the Government may do or may not do.  It is sometimes the practice of Deputies to suggest that the Government is making everything hard for the people or that the world could be made all right if the Government did something or other.  I do not think so. Ultimately the future of this country will depend upon the character of our people and the willingness to make use of the resources each individual has at his command.</P>

      <P>Deputies spoke of hard cases where cows were being driven off by the sheriff.  Do we not all know perfectly well, no matter how we may regret these things, that people will not pay money if they have not got to do it?  It is unfortunate that we are are not all animated with ideas that we should press ourselves very hard in order to pay another man what is due &mdash; that we should tighten our belts so as to do so.  If we were all animated with that idea there would be no need of laws or police forces.  Unfortunately communities are not built up of individuals of that sort. We all need the pressure of force at one time or another.  If farmers want to get credit when they need it and when they can use it properly they must make up their minds that such credit can only be forthcoming if they keep their bargain and pay it back.  If you get land on annuities or rent and if you do not pay your rent those responsible for collecting the annuities will have to collect it.  These annuities are absolutely necessary to the State in order to allow the State to do its work. If these annuities are not paid then there would be an end to things.  If the <Col N="319" /> half annuities which are due at present were not paid, the money would have to be made up somewhere else.  The reason the land annuities are collected is to enable the Government to carry out other works and services.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in favour of lipstick or nail-polish, but I can help neither one nor the other.  We cannot carry on the Government services without the collection of that money: The position is that if one man can get off paying or get away with it, his neighbour would say: &ldquo;Why should I pay?&rdquo; So that no matter how hard a case may be, the Land Commission have to collect.  It is the same in the case of a person looking for alms.  No decent person will let a human being starve or refuse him for an alms; every decent person would give alms if he were sure the person asking the alms needed it.  But it is the person who does not need the alms, but who goes out looking for alms, who prevents the person really in need of alms getting them.  It would be very easy to deal with hard cases if one were sure they were hard cases. People who are well able to pay the land annuities would get in under cover of the neighbour whose case may be a hard one.  These are difficulties which no human agencies can get over.  If there are certain farms off which cattle have been driven to meet annuity demands, it is not because the Land Commission, which is in charge of the collection of the annuities, is hard-hearted.  It is because there is no other way in which you can ensure the payment of these moneys which are absolutely necessary for carrying on the services of the State as a whole.  I do not know that there would be any profit in continuing the discussion of this question any further.</P>
      <P>There was another question raised &mdash; one that would take a whole day's debate to itself &mdash; the question of unemployment.</P>

      <P>Well, I should be glad at any time if the Deputy would put down a motion.  As a Deputy of the House, he is quite within his rights at any time to put down a motion to deal with any particular subject.  I cannot promise, straight off, to give him Government time, but if there is a fundamental matter, such as that of the Government's attitude towards agriculture, or things of that sort, I should be quite ready to meet the Deputy and have a general discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only concerned with two things at the moment &mdash; justice and equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, these are two things that the Deputy cannot pronounce upon in an <i>ex-cathedra</i> fashion. These are matters that have to be argued out.  Deputy Gorey's views on equity and justice may be just as sound as my views, but we might very well differ, with regard to a particular case, as to what is equitable and just.  We have got to argue out these matters and, where remedies are proposed, to see that the remedies proposed will, in fact, remedy what are called injustices.  Our attitude, anyhow, with regard to giving credits, is this.  They can be very dangerous.  They can become a millstone around the necks of people if they are not properly used.  It is very difficult to make credits available just to the classes of people who would make proper use of them and who would make such use of that facility that the giving of <Col N="321" /> credits would really be justifiable. You have the same old difficulty again. How can you separate the classes: those who can, and those who cannot? As the Deputy knows, at the time of the war, credits were given very freely, and undoubtedly some people used them properly.  Some people made proper use of them, but they became a millstone around the necks of other people.  Accordingly, one has to consider whether the granting of easy credits would be a boon or the reverse. Then, there is the question of whether they will be paid.  Of course, it would be all right if there could be some kind of fund which would permit of not having to pay these credits, and nobody would feel that they would not take credits under such circumstances. That, however, means disaster.  That would lead the whole community to disaster in no time, and it is a very serious matter to refund arrears or to remit debts of that sort. That is a very serious thing for the community as a whole, and the trouble is that the doing of it means mostly that the good have to suffer for &mdash; I shall not call them the wicked &mdash; but that the stronger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not know. With regard to the question of wickedness, just as in the case of justice and other things of that sort, it is very difficult to get definitions which will suit all the cases.  However, I do not think we would be spending our time. profitably here on this occasion in talking along the general terms on which I am compelled to talk in connection with the debate at present.  Now, in regard to unemployment, that is a very difficult and serious problem.  I want to say, however, that there has been a very great deal of misrepresentation as to what is the position in that regard, and what has been done.  I have the material here which is dealing with that situation.  And when some people say sneeringly, &ldquo;These are things you used for the election,&rdquo; I say that I am <Col N="322" /> using them here, just as I used them in the election, because they are based on the facts of the situation, as disclosed in the statistics and so on.  They are available to Deputies, and, not merely are they available now, but they are available all the time, because they are obviously things that it is necessary to keep up to date from time to time. What I would say to Deputies who think we ought to do more than has been done at the present time in regard to making it possible for the farming community to get more quickly out of the depression is that, if they have any motion to put down, we will try to find time for it as early as possible. Unfortunately, I do not think there is much hope to find time for it before the end of this session.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not know. The trouble is that we have to finish the financial business by a certain time, and then there is the question as to whether it is wise in the long run to keep the Dáil sitting after the end of July.  There is the question of staffs, and so on, to be considered, and I do not think it would be advisable or right for me to suggest that we might have a debate of such fundamental importance in such a way as to just pass over it in a day.  The whole question of the rural community and of agriculture in relation to other industries and other sections of the community is of very fundamental importance, and if such questions are to be dealt with at all, they should be dealt with in detail and examined closely, and I do not think they should be brought in merely by way of a kind of side-wind on an occasion like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some references to the Banking Commission report.  I have not yet got a copy of it, and it is very strange that all these Deputies seem to be aware of things in it and seem to be deriving satisfaction out of it.  I do not know how they have got ideas of that sort.  It may be so, or it may not &mdash; I do not know.  All I can say is that the commission was, for at least two years, examining the whole situation with regard to the basis of our economic life here.  They <Col N="323" /> were given very wide terms of reference and they spent, I think, two years in examining the question. Surely, if it is worth the time of men of that sort to spend two years in examining such questions, we ought to give the matter serious consideration and not regard it merely as a thing to be read through.  Obviously, if it is going to be of any value, it must be something which the Government ought to consider very carefully.  Then, of course, we have to consider whether or not it is advisable to publish the report in advance of the Government's having made up its own mind with regard to certain recommendations. I do not know what the recommendations are, but they were asked to report and I presume that, in regard to the report, there would be recommendations.  So far as financial matters are concerned, I am sure Deputies will understand that it may be a very serious matter if certain recommendations are made, and if there is any doubt as to the Government policy in regard to such recommendations. As I have not read the report, I do not know whether the Government's attitude would be that we should immediately release the report to the public as soon as we have read it, or whether it will mean that we would have to wait in order to make up our minds with regard to certain recommendations that might be in the report.  If the Government's attitude were not known at the same time as the recommendations were published, there might be a certain uneasiness with regard to financial matters, and there might be serious consequences if there were uncertainty for a period with regard to the Government's attitude.  It may be possible to release it as soon as it is read and to say, in effect: &ldquo;Let the public do their thinking at the same time that we are doing our thinking.&rdquo; On the other hand, it might be the case that the Government may come to the conclusion that it would not be in the public interest to let these recommendations be put before the public before announcing our own attitude.  I cannot say, of course, because it is true that we only got <Col N="324" /> that report on the 4th April, and I understand that it is fairly big &mdash; that there are two or three volumes in the print.  I have not asked for the information, but as far as I know it is not the complete print yet.  All I know is that I have not got the copy of the printed report, and, consequently, it is not in a position to be examined.  What that report may have in it &mdash; whether condemnation or praise or criticism of the Government's policy &mdash; I do not know.  I do not know what the recommendations are. Whether the Government will be prepared to accept the recommendations and put them into operation, if there are recommendations, I do not know.  But it is not right to suggest that this has been done as part of some considered policy.  It just followed in the ordinary way.  There was no instruction from the Government, and no attitude taken up either as to advancing it or keeping it back.  I only say in general that if it took people a couple of years to examine a certain situation &mdash; and the terms of reference meant that they were to examine practically the foundations of our whole economic life &mdash; the Government cannot make up its mind on that matter without serious study over a reasonable period of time. I cannot say, until we have seen the recommendations and considered them, which of the two things will happen. I cannot say whether we will release it, and let the people as a whole do their thinking at the same time as the Government is doing its thinking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No; we cannot censor it.  I cannot say whether that will happen, or whether we will do our thinking first, so to speak, in order to be able to announce, at the same time as the report is published, what the Government's attitude is with regard to the recommendations.  It will depend on the form of the recommendations. If the recommendations are of a drastic type that might have any public repercussions and cause uncertainty for any length of time, then obviously what we would do is to keep it until we are prepared to give our views at the same time.  On the other <Col N="325" /> hand, if they are not of that sort, the obvious thing to do would be to let the people do their thinking at the same time as the Government is doing its thinking.  That will do no harm to anybody.  As I said at the start, this has not been a very satisfactory debate.  Apparently the only thing that was at the back of Deputy Gorey's mind was the question of derating, and the Chair ruled him out on that. Although he skated around it a good deal and managed to keep away from the ruling of the Chair in the matter, at the same time one could see that if he dealt with the points which he had in mind he would have to deal with derating.  I do not think that should be dealt with without having, so to speak, a dress debate on it, where we would all come in here having figures and facts and having carefully studied the matter.  Only in that way would it be profitable.  The other things about justice in general are only vague terms, and will not get us anywhere.  We have to come down to something concrete.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,028 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Secretary to the President, and for certain other expenses of the President's Establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> It will be seen from the volume of Estimates that the total amount of this Estimate is £4,048.  The title of the Estimate, however, is to some extent misleading, as the emoluments and allowances which it is provided in the Constitution shall be paid to the President will be charged upon the Central Fund, and a Bill to provide for that will be introduced to-morrow. This Vote in effect provides for what might be described as the Civil Service side of the Presidential Establishment. It might possibly be more fittingly referred to as a Vote for the President's secretariat, for certain minor and petty expenses, and for certain capital expenditure, making, as I have said, £4,048 in all.  It is contemplated that the office of the Secretary to the President shall have attached to it such duties and functions in relation to the commissions constituted by Articles 57 and 14 of the Constitution as the Government shall direct.  It will be seen from the face of the Estimate that, in addition to the expenses to be borne on this Vote, there will be the ordinary charges in respect of allied services, such as stationery and printing and Post Office services, but it is not possible at this stage to estimate the cost of those services until some experience has been gained in the actual working of the establishment.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A of the Vote covers salaries, wages and allowances, and, under the sub-head, provision is made for the Secretary to the President. This officer's appointment, as the House is no doubt aware, dates from 29th December last.  The scale of salary has not yet been fixed for the post, but the present holder has a personal scale of £1,000, rising by £50 per annum to £1,200 per annum, plus bonus.  In addition to the secretary, there is at the moment a shorthand typist and one temporary messenger. The Vote makes provision for such additional clerical assistance as may be necessary, up to the amount of £300. £300 has been included in the Vote for such allowances as it may be decided to pay to the aide-de-camp to the President.  Under sub-head B, the sum of £100 has been provided for travelling expenses, and that is anticipated to <Col N="327" /> cover travelling expenses and subsistence allowances to the staff of the secretary's office.  It is anticipated that the President will ordinarily travel by car, for the running or maintenance of which no allowance will be paid to him from this Vote, but provision has been made here for the possible payment of expenses when other modes of conveyance, such as trains, may be used by him on exceptional occasions.  The miscellaneous petty expenses of the secretary's office will be met from sub-head C, for which £100 has been provided. Out of sub-head D, the telegraphic and telephonic charges arising out of official business will be defrayed. Sub-head E provides for the purchase of motor cars which will form part of the Presidential equipment.  The cost of maintaining and running those cars, however, will be defrayed by the President out of the allowances which will be provided for him in the Bill to be introduced to-morrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new Vote, and there are just one or two references which I should like to make.  In regard to the figure of £500 under sub-head D to which the Minister for Finance has just referred, for telegraphic and telephonic communication, beyond the fact that sub-head D was for that purpose we did not get from the Minister any further explanation. The point I want to make is that the sum of £500 in this small Estimate is in entire disproportion to the amount for telegraphic and telephonic communication in other large Estimates. The sum of £500 for the establishment of the Secretary to the President works out at one-eighth of the total Estimate.  If you take any other Estimate, that for the Department of Agriculture for instance, the amount allocated for telegraphic and telephonic communication works out at one in 300 of the total Estimate.  I find it hard to explain what great necessity will arise in this particular office for telegraphic and telephonic communication to the extent of £500. I merely direct the Minister's attention to the fact that there is a great discrepancy between the amount asked for in this small Vote and the amount <Col N="328" /> utilised in any other Department where the Votes are three times as large.</P>
      <P>Sub-head E refers to the purchase of motor cars.  I take it that it is intended that the President will have two cars. If so £1,200 seems to be a fairly large sum for two cars.  Although the Minister did not mention it, I take it that the cars purchased for the President will be Irish made.</P>

      <P>I was wondering if he was to have two cars costing £1,200, and if two cars made in Ireland would cost that amount.  I do not think there are cars manufactured in this State that would cost £600 each.  I merely want to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact.  I quite understand that it would be possible for cars to cost over £600 each if made and assembled here.  The bodies might be put on here.  I think it would be a very bad headline, and an extremely bad example to the rest of the country, and a very serious reflection on Irish industry, if the head of the State was going to be supplied with a non-Irish article if the Irish article was available. I do not think any comment would be made on the fact that the President was supplied with one or two cars costing £250 each, or if the total cost was only £500, if they were made in Ireland.  Two of these motor cars could be bought for £500, and I do not think it would make the slightest difference to the dignity of the President's office if that was done.</P>

      <P>Has any arrangement been made by the President's Department for a reception office within the city boundary, or in the centre of the city, for the convenience of distinguished visitors?  I have reason to know that there is a desire on the part of a number of distinguished visitors to see the Head of the State or the heads of Departments.  At present there is no office at which distinguished American visitors, judges, engineers <Col N="329" /> and professional men who come to the city, can call.  There should be included in the Estimate something to provide for an office in the Castle, where a secretary or head of some of the Departments, could receive distinguished visitors and entertain them in some way.  To my knowledge there are very few people to receive visitors who come to this country.  When they are received, even in an humble way, it is extraordinary what an effect it has.  After touring Ireland for three or six months these visitors return to their own countries and it is wonderful to read in their newspapers the glowing accounts they give of their reception. I wish some other Deputy would have raised this question.  There should be a Department of State to deal with it.  I dare not say that it should be done by the municipality, because some people might then say that it was a personal matter.  In municipalities in other countries, and at seaside resorts, the Lord Mayors or the head of some departments receive distinguished visitors.  They put motor cars at their disposal for the day, and show them whatever is to be seen. Visitors coming here may want to see new factories, new housing schemes or new engineering developments and it falls upon someone to look after them. It cannot be done for nothing.  Heavy expense is involved.  I think the time has come when the State or the municipality should make ample provision in that respect.  This is a big city, a city to be proud of, one with something to show, and we should be as good as any other city of the same size and receive distinguished visitors worthily, because when they return to their own countries they give wonderful accounts of their visit.  Ireland is famous for its hospitality.  As the Taoiseach and others Ministers, who had the honour at some time of visiting America know whatever town or city they went to, they were received by the chief citizens and motor cars were placed at their disposal.  As this is a capital city, the Taoiseach's Department or the Department of Finance should accept responsibility for showing this country at its best. This is a great country, and a city office attached to the Department of <Col N="330" /> the Taoiseach could do great work in the way I mention.  At the present there is another House in the city where visitors call, and where an effort is made to put a motor car&mdash;sometimes two motor cars &mdash; at their disposal in order to show off the city and to create a good impression and send visitors home pleased.  There is also the advantage to the tourist industry to be considered.  It has become practically impossible for the past year or two for that House to continue that procedure.  It is not for me to talk about the expense, but the expense of that House is, at least, treble what it was three years ago.  The occupant of that House is abused now and then, and is told that he is getting a large sum of money to put into his own pocket.  I want to assure every member of the Dáil, and the people outside, that the salary paid to the occupant of that House is not more than three-fourths of the expenditure attached to his position.  I put it to the Minister that the time has now come for the setting up of a reception committee to receive distinguished visitors.  There are many visitors coming from the continent, from America and from all parts of Great Britain, and they are worthy of reception. They can be classed as distinguished visitors even though they have no titles.  It would be doing good work if such a committee was formed.</P>

      <P>As the Minister will deal with the items in the Estimate, I might deal with the particular matter mentioned by the Deputy on behalf of the Department of External Affairs. I do not think that we have been remiss in regard to any representative visitors from abroad.  We cannot go beyond that.  We have not been in any way remiss with regard to representative people coming from abroad.  We do everything that is possible.  During the summer months I myself see quite a large number of visitors, but they do not expect, nor do I think it would be wise, to take responsibility for showing them around to various places, because, obviously, if you do it for some and do not do it for others who would regard themselves as equally entitled you create difficulties <Col N="331" /> of various kinds.  I think that the provision that is made for the Department of External Affairs and the Government generally, particularly for the Department of External Affairs, which ought to be principally responsible for it, has not been inadequate in the past, and I think that all that it is necessary to do is being done in that particular way.</P>
      <P>As regards the Office of the President, the President will, no doubt, meet people of the same kind.  He will see visitors who come, in reason.  He cannot possibly receive every tourist, every person who comes to this country.  Whilst it is very true that those of us who went over to America received hospitality in practically every city and from large sections of our people, we did so because we were in a representative character.  It was as representatives, not as individuals, that we were entertained and looked after.  In the same way, where we have people coming from abroad in a representative capacity, we receive them.  I think we do as much in that way as the people in any other country are doing.  I am afraid that the suggestion of the Lord Mayor would lead us into all sorts of difficulties. Where would you stop?  There might, perhaps, be a little more liberal provision made in the Department of External Affairs for meeting that particular case, but I do not think the House would be wise in going beyond that.  I am afraid you could not have a reception committee or anything of that sort.  There is a Department of External Affairs which, in so far as it receives representative visitors, ought to be able to deal with the matter. A case may be made, perhaps, for a more liberal allowance in that particular way.  That could be dealt with, perhaps, on the Vote for External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with a couple of points raised by Deputy Linehan.  First of all about the telegrams and telephones, and the provision which has been made for that.  Of course, the fact that we provide £500 does not mean that we are going to spend £500, but we have got <Col N="332" /> to allow a liberal margin for this service because it is pretty largely a matter of trial and experiment, and we do not know what the cost will be. One thing the Dáil, as a rule, does deprecate is the introduction of Supplementary Estimates late in the year and, accordingly, in regard to possible telephonic and telegraphic charges we have decided to make a very liberal provision, but remember that that provision is only to cover official telegrams and official charges and that the amount which will actually be debited and paid by the Presidential establishment &mdash; by the Secretary's Office &mdash; to another Department of the Government will be the actual cost of the service provided.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of motor cars, of course, it is anticipated that these cars will be made in Ireland, but it will be remembered that some of these cars will be used on special occasions and, accordingly, they will have to be designed to meet the needs of those occasions.  The President, naturally, will have to have at least one limousine car to provide accommodation for himself, possibly a distinguished guest and aide-de-camp, in addition to the driver and other attendants, and a car of that sort would possibly have to have a specially designed body.  But there is no doubt whatever that the cars, so far as I am aware, will be manufactured in Ireland, or at least assembled in Ireland on the same scale as cars are at the present moment.  It is not quite true to say that you cannot get a car which would cost more than £500.  I believe you can &mdash; not that we would look for an over-expensive car, but, nevertheless, we have got to remember that we are dealing with the highest office in the State and that there must be a certain fitness about even the conveyance in which the President travels. We cannot overlook that fact when we are making provision of this sort.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £361,635 chun slánuithe na suime is <Col N="333" /> gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníochta i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1939, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Tionnscail agus Tráchtála maraon le hIldeontaisí-i-gCabhair.</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £361,635 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>Deputies have, I am sure, noted the various details of the Estimate as set out in the Book of Estimates.  The total of the Estimate for the year shows an increase of £52,169 over the Estimate for last year, an increase which is due mainly to the necessity for increased provision under three sub-heads:&mdash; sub-head A for Salaries, Wages and Allowances; sub-heads I and J for Exhibitions and Fairs, and sub-head M for the Production of Industrial Alcohol.</P>
    <P>The increase under sub-head A, the sub-head relating to salaries, wages and allowances, calls for no special comment as it is due mainly to automatic increases in individual salaries.  The total staff, as Deputies will have noted, has remained practically the same as in last year.  There was a slight increase, the figure in 1937-38 being 587 and for 1938-39 being 595.</P>
    <P>The increased provision under sub-heads I and J for Exhibitions and Fairs arises first because we decided to build an Irish Pavilion at the Glasgow Exhibition which is now proceeding, and, secondly, because it was proposed to have an Irish Pavilion at the New York World Fair which is to be held next year.  It is the opinion of the Government that expenditure upon suitable displays at important international exhibitions is money well spent and will repay itself in increased trade and in increased tourist business.</P>
    <P>The increased provision under item M for production of industrial alcohol is very largely a book-keeping item. The five industrial alcohol distilleries <Col N="334" /> will be working continuously this year, and the increase in the Estimate is due mainly to the consequential increased expenditure contemplated in respect of raw materials.  The Estimate is based upon the assumption that 35,000 tons of potatoes will be purchased.  This is probably the last year that that particular sub-head will appear.  On the assumption that the Industrial Alcohol Bill which is now before the Dáil will be enacted, that Bill will transfer the operation of the industrial alcohol enterprise from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the company to be established under the Bill.  The total provision in respect of that service in this year includes a sum of £61,700 for capital expenditure.  The anticipated receipts from the sale of industrial alcohol are estimated to reach £168,000.</P>
    <P>There is on the Order Paper a motion in the names of Deputies Pattison and Davin that the Estimate be reduced by £100 in respect of item A.  A motion of that kind is usually indicative, not of any desire on the part of the Deputies concerned to reduce the particular sub-head, but of their intention to raise some particular matter relating to the activities of the Department.  I may say I have had no information that any particular matter is to be raised on the motion and, consequently, I cannot deal at this stage with whatever the two Deputies have in mind.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce, as Deputies are aware, cover a very wide field, and it is not possible in the course of a short statement introducing the Estimate to make more than a very brief reference to matters of major impor tance or particular interest which arose during the 12 months since the Estimate for the Department was previously before the Dáil.  The work of the Department in the promotion and development of industrial activities is still the most important part of its programme.  Many new industries were established during the past year, and also during that period plans were prepared and completed which will result in the establishment of an additional number of new industrial <Col N="335" /> enterprises during the coming 12 months.  Perhaps it is not necessary, it is probably even not practicable, to refer to these developments in detail, but it is, I think, noteworthy that there has been no evidence of any slackening of interest in the industrial possibilities of this country.  Quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>It is true that during the earlier portion of this year the uncertainty which was created by the prolongation of the negotiations in London had a considerable adverse effect upon industrial output and industrial employment, which did not entirely disappear when the Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom was signed and published, due to the inaccurate statements which were published in the Press from industrialists and others, which had the effect of continuing the state of uncertainty, with its consequential ill effects.  It is only now that a clear understanding of the position has been obtained in trading circles and the resumption of trade upon a more normal basis is taking place.  Conditions here were also affected to some extent, and perhaps are still being affected, by international circumstances, which have produced in some countries a marked recession in industrial outlook and activity.  It is to be hoped that the disimprovement in world conditions is only temporary.  The new circumstances existing here make it possible for us, in any case, to face the future with confidence, in the belief that we will be able to overcome our difficulties and ensure a continuance of our industrial activities and industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>The outstanding event of the year was, of course, the conclusion of a Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom.  It is, perhaps, not necessary to refer to that Trade Agreement in detail.  The details of it are, I think, well known to Deputies, and it was debated here on more than one occasion within the past couple of months. The length of the period during which the negotiations were in progress, and my preoccupation and the preoccupation of the senior officials of my Department with the conduct of the negotiations, upset the Department's <Col N="336" /> programme to a considerable extent, and necessitated delay in respect of many matters, some legislative and some administrative, on which I had intended early action to be taken.  The general election which took place last month was a further cause of upset, and it may be some time before we will be able to make up arrears of work on that programme.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year, efforts were also made to put on a better basis our trade relations with the United States of America, with Australia, New Zealand, the Argentine, Brazil, and with certain other countries.  There has been some evidence of a tendency on the part of some of our new industrial establishments to look abroad for outlets for their surplus production, and that tendency has increased our interest in concluding trade agreements with countries to which we exported very little heretofore. During the course of the year, also, efforts were made, by administrative action and otherwise, to secure an improvement in the quality and the variety of goods manufactured in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In that connection I might make particular reference to the establishment of an advisory commission on industrial design.  That advisory commission held its first meeting in November last.  I do not think the importance of the work of that commission can be overstressed, and I suggest that the thanks of the Dáil are due to the many busy people who voluntarily agreed to act upon that commission, and who are devoting a considerable proportion of their time to its work.</P>
    <P>The work of the Turf Development Board, which is also financed in this Estimate, proceeded during the year according to plan.  Possibly the best compliment which could be paid to the board is to say that its work proceeded according to plan.  As Deputies are aware, the Turraun Peat Works was acquired by the board in 1935, and has since been in regular production.  The development of the bog at Clonsast, near Portarlington, which was commenced in 1936, is proceeding, and it is possible one machine will be in operation <Col N="337" /> there towards the end of the coming production season.  Another at Lyrecrompane, in County Kerry, commenced production during the present season.  The board also co-operates in marketing hand-won turf produced by co-operative societies, but that function will be gradually relinquished by it and transferred to the co-operative societies themselves.  During the next few years a considerable amount of attention will be paid to the survey of large bogs to determine their suitability for machine production, and in suitable cases the preliminary drainage of these bogs will be put in hands.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Dáil would wish me to give any detailed review of the Department's activities under the Factories and Workshops Acts, the Trade Board Acts, the Apprenticeship Act or the Conditions of Employment Act.  Such a review might take a long time.  But if any Deputy desires to raise any point in relation to the administration of these statutes I will deal with it in my reply.  Similarly the operation of the Control of Prices Act might call for some comment.  The new Act has barely begun to operate. I am glad to be able to report that there is some substantial evidence of increased public interest in the protection afforded through the powers of the Prices Commission and the Controller of Prices.  The commission has been occupied with an investigation into bacon prices, and they are now, of course, facing the volume of new work falling upon them under the terms of the Agreement with the United Kingdom.  Provision is also made in this Estimate for the Industrial Research Council.  I do not propose to refer to that matter in detail as the report of the council will be available shortly.  This deals fully with its activities under its various heads.  There are, of course, many other activities of the Department of which Deputies are aware.  If there is any desire to get any information concerning them or to raise any point concerning them I will be prepared to deal fully with such points when replying.  I am merely at this stage drawing attention to the outstanding features of the Estimate and I formally submit the motion to the Dáil leaving <Col N="338" /> for discussion later any matters in which Deputies might be particularly interested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the amendment standing in my name, that the Estimate be reduced by £100, I want first of all to say that I am one who fully appreciates that the Department of Industry and Commerce is a very big Department and that the Minister's job is not an easy one.  I concede to the Minister, as many people in this country do, the credit that he is a very hard-working Minister.  But I think even the Minister himself will agree with me that having regard to the matters which were brought to his attention by members of the Labour Party, particularly on the occasion of the last discussion on this Estimate, by this time there should be some overhauling and some improvement made with regard to certain branches of the Department.  First of all I want to deal with the very important branch &mdash; the employment branch.  To those Deputies in the House who have to deal with that branch I extend the greatest sympathy.  As one who has had a good deal of connection with the work of that branch I want to say very definitely that it is time that the Minister would bring about some improvement so as to deal with the delay that occurs in regard to applications sent in by unfortunate citizens who have to try to exist on unemployment assistance.  I could not describe strongly enough in any words of mine the hardships caused by those delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately people with dependents have to wait for periods of two or three months before they know exactly what they are to be allowed under that Act.  Frequently they are no sooner in receipt of that allowance than they are suspended because of the receipt by the Department of an anonymous communication sometimes to the effect that they are working and signing.  At other times the communication is to the effect that they are not genuinely seeking work.  I think that the question of anonymous communications should be very seriously considered by the Minister. After all, it is not fair to our people <Col N="339" /> who are compelled to seek unemployment assistance that they should be the victims of people who, apparently, have nothing else to do to occupy their time but writing anonymous letters for no other purpose than to punish still further these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the administration of the Act is in connection with the investigation of means.  One finds frequently cases where the circumstances are exactly the same and yet the Department makes an assessment of the means which only provides ultimately for about half the maximum benefit to one applicant, whereas another in exactly the same circumstances gets the maximum rate. I have endeavoured to get from the Minister's Department some idea of the basis on which the means are assessed.  I have been told that it is confidential and that it is a document that cannot be given to a Deputy or to anybody else.  Yet I find without any difficulty I can obtain that information from another Department.  It is understood that the same experts are, in fact, responsible for dealing with the means assessment in both Departments.  Apart from the fact that you can get the documents from one Department and not from another, I see no reason why it should not be made available by the Minister's Department.  My intention is, after all, to help not only those I represent, but the Minister's Department as well.  I think the Minister should welcome information from any Deputy with regard to an injustice done to any citizen under the means test.  I ask the Minister again to have some arrangement made whereby Deputies of this House ought to be trusted in confidence with this information.</P>
    <P>Another activity of the Minister's Department is the inspection of workshops and factories.  I think I could get a good many people to agree with me that the manner in which that work is carried out is farcical to a large extent.  Any of us who go through the country and who go into some of the factories &mdash; even some of the new factories that we hear so much about &mdash;<Col N="340" /> know full well the conditions under which workers have to carry on their work, and from enquiries we make we find that, in some cases, inspectors have never been seen.  I have to complain also that I see no reason why an inspector, if he visits a district, should consult only the employers.  I think that where the workers are members of a Trade Union or have some representative, if there is to be consultation at all, it ought to be on both sides.  Also, under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, I have to regret the Minister's failure to give effect to the registration of agreements. I hope that is a matter which will engage his early attention.</P>
    <P>I regret also to have to say, with regard to a very important new industry started in the city of Kilkenny &mdash; the only industry, in fact, that Kilkenny got as a result of the Government's intensive tariff policy &mdash; that great uncertainty prevails there in the homes of many workers who were employed in that factory.  I know some of the young men in that factory who could have entered other employment a few years ago, but they thought that the establishment of this factory was going to give them better prospect in life.  I know that the Minister is not in ignorance of the position, but yet I think it is my duty to refer to it on this Vote and to express the hope that the Minister's Department will have something done whereby more contentment and security are given to the people, both those who have invested money in it as well as those who are dependent for a livelihood on the wages they earn in the industry.</P>
    <P>I just wanted to avail of this opportunity to bring these few points forward, and I want to say very definitely that I do not raise them in a destructive manner &mdash; a thing that is frequently easy to do, or, in fact, always easy to do.  I want to say that, as a member of this House, I shall always be only too happy and willing to help the Minister or his Department in any way, but I feel very keenly with regard to many of our people who have suffered at the hands of the Minister's Department that he ought at this stage to have something <Col N="341" /> done to avoid these unfortunate happenings in the future.  I had an opportunity during the recent general election of quoting the many statements of the Minister on the problem of unemployment and the very definite solution he had for it, but I do not propose to quote them now.  I wish to say, however, in regard to it, that I always held the view that the Minister's Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, has as its main function the duty to inform the unemployed people where work is likely to be had, and that it was a kind of information bureau for the local offices of his Department. That seems to have been forgotten.  I am not aware that even at the moment there is a register in each of the local offices to show people where there are likely vacancies.  On the contrary, what we do find is that an unfortunate unemployed person is challenged frequently to know what he is doing to find work, and if he is not able to show a number of communications or letters from different employers, he is told that he is not genuinely seeking work and he is struck off and has to fill in an appeal form.  Then, when a fortnight or a month has passed, it is a matter for a court of referees, and then sent up to Dublin, and if some little flaw is found in it in Dublin it is sent back again and there are more excursions very often between Dublin Castle and the local office before a decision is given.  I think that state of affairs should not prevail in this Christian country of ours, and I think that the main function of the Department of Industry and Commerce so far as the unemployed are concerned is to make such information available and that every effort ought to be made to encourage employers to recruit the necessary labour through the Department's local offices.  I hope that the Minister will give his early and careful attention to the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's modest recital of the activities of his Department to-day &mdash; an unusually modest one &mdash; certain operations of the Department have been referred to. There are some that have not been <Col N="342" /> included, and I want to make a plea for a part of the country and a constituency that has had no practical experience of the beneficent rule of the Minister through his Department. I stated some time ago in the House that I represented a constituency where the industrial policy of the Government had no local application or effect whatever, but that in fact we had had one industry for a considerable time that has practically disappeared. I refer now to the slate-quarrying industry in West Cork.  In the decline that has taken place recently the result has been the unemployment of, I think, about 250 men, as far as I could compute the figures carefully, and we now find that local authorities through the co-operation of the Department of Local Government, which is probably in harmony with the Department of Industry and Commerce, are being advised and urged to use alternative roofing materials to slate.  What represents the only industrial effort noticeable in West Cork has almost disappeared, and I should like to get from the Minister, during the course of this discussion, his views as to whether that condition of affairs ought to be permitted to continue.  A number of the smaller quarries have completely closed down, and the one or two main quarries that remain are working with very heavily reduced staffs.  Having regard to the fact that the State housing programme is still very far short of being completed, are we to understand that in future, roofing tiles of concrete and asbestos slates are going to take the place of Irish slates, even in the South, where the local material is entirely superior and where it also represents the only means of employment for a very large number of men.  If that is so, I think it is a very bad situation, and the Minister should give serious consideration to it with a view to changing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a very strong plea here for the working men of West Cork who were employed in the slate quarries, and who have nothing to do now except to join in the painful processions to the labour exchange, and the weary pilgrimages to the appeal courts associated with the Unemployment <Col N="343" /> Insurance Act and the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I make the plea actually in the hope that the Minister has not entirely forgotten the slate deposits in West Cork and the need for giving to the local people, through the medium of an industry at their own doors, the opportunity of getting a reasonable living out of that industry in the future.  I support what Deputy Pattison has said, and I want to express my own view that conditions at headquarters in regard to unemployment assistance administration seem to be nothing short of chaotic.  The position is better than it was, but the position when the Unemployment Assistance Act was passed and for a very considerable time afterwards was indescribable.  I think it is no exaggeration to apply that description to the situation.  The sending of unemployed people from Pilate to Herod and from Herod to Pilate, and all the investigations and inquiries that had to take place in regard to the administration of this Unemployment Assistance Act, have made the position deplorable from the point of view of the people who had to try and get home assistance or some other charitable assistance in the meantime.  I think a good deal of this would be found to be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I also want to make a protest against the very long time that it takes to issue a decision in cases in which a member of this House has made representations to the Department.  It sometimes takes two or three months before a reply emanates from the Department, and then one finds that the matter has been examined a very considerable time before that.  Is there no method in the Department of having correspondence brought up to date?  If there is not, then the Department is a very antiquated and outworn one in regard to that particular aspect of its service.  The whole position with regard to the Unemployment Assistance Act and its administration is still very unsatisfactory. I ask the Minister &mdash; and I do not want to ask him in any apologetic way, because I think it is the right of a member of this House &mdash; to look into <Col N="344" /> this matter and see what is wrong at headquarters in connection with this whole matter.  I am a member of a court of referees.  I have seen recommendations or decisions of the court taken, and it was several weeks afterwards before they were either officially turned down or officially sanctioned. I think there is no need whatever for a situation of that kind, and I think it would be well if some people were occasionally made to understand in some way the agony and the misery that involved for the unfortunate people who are the victims of that kind of system.</P>
    <P>I want also to add my voice to the plea that has been made that members of this House should have some opportunity of making representations in individual cases.  It seems to me that our opportunities in that respect are largely if not completely barred. One writes a letter about a particular case, and the person's papers are suddenly called for from Bantry or Skibbereen or some other remote country town and taken up to headquarters. The investigation of the case proceeds in the absence of the person concerned.  That is probably inevitable, but it is not inevitable that it should proceed in the absence of the public representative who is interested in that case and who desires to make representations on behalf of the particular person concerned.  The fact is that the position of the people involved in certain cases &mdash; whether they arise from some particular mistake on the part of the recipient of unemployment assistance, or whether they arise from some particular action of his that is wrong and not in accordance with the Acts, or whether they arise from the activities of some malicious minded neighbour who is anxious to write a letter to the Department, very often to ventilate some private spleen arising out of another matter &mdash; is a very unenviable one.  I think that there ought to be&mdash; as there is in the old age pensions branch of the Department of Local Government, and recently in the widows' and orphans' pensions Department &mdash; an opportunity for making personal recommendations in cases of that kind, and for hearing the pros and <Col N="345" /> cons of the case discussed.  If there is not, I adhere to the view that the position of the unemployed person whose case is being decided in his absence, and who has had no opportunity of making his particular point of view, or bringing any facts that are of weight to the notice of the people who are giving the decision, is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I want also to call attention to a question that has been raised in this House very often, and over a number of years, and that is the position of the small farmer in rural areas from whom contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Act are extracted without any benefit afterwards.  The man who has a small holding, sometimes with a valuation of £7 or £8, finds an opportunity of getting carting work from the county council for 14 or 15 weeks at a time, but when that employment is discontinued he almost certainly finds that, when he tries to get unemployment insurance benefit following the payment of the contributions referred to, he is refused.  He is informed that he has work on his holding which he can go back to, and that consequently he is not entitled to make a claim of this kind.  There ought to be some finality about this matter.  If contributions are payable in respect of the employment, it is a very unsatisfactory position for such people to find that no benefits whatever are derivable from them.  I feel that this matter ought to be looked into further, although it is a subject that has been discussed without very much result over a very long time.  In fact it is one of the items that I have heard discussed on and off in this House since I entered it a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to the main question of unemployment the position is of course most unsatisfactory.  One is struck by the difference between the manner in which the Minister has introduced this Estimate and discussed it, and the tone and tenor of a number of statements that emanated from him a number of years ago.  The position, according to the Minister for Finance and some of his colleagues, is that we have reached a point in this country where we <Col N="346" /> regard unemployment as inevitable, as something in the nature of a visitation from God, which we have to accept and be thankful that it is not worse.  That is a confession of failure which one would hardly expect to see so fully confirmed a short time after the animated hopes of general employment which were held out to the people of the country.  I do not want to labour that point.  The lesson is obvious to anyone who wants to face it in an unprejudiced and honest way, but it is certainly a lamentable state of affairs.  It is more lamentable when the miserable and inadequate provision made for the unemployed people cannot reach them in any reasonable time, and when they are subject to all kinds of inquisitions and delays, exaggerated assessments of means and all the other things which have made some of us feel that there is very little sympathy in certain quarters for the unemployed people who have to look to the labour exchanges for whatever financial solace, and it is limited enough, they can obtain.</P>
    <P>I strongly add my own views to what has been said by my colleague in regard to the manner in which the Act has been dealt with at headquarters.  I feel that there ought to be some opportunity of establishing local machinery whereby cases of this kind could be quickly decided, rather than having the long wait and the unsatisfactory position that exists at the present time.  I bring the facts to the notice of the Minister, and end with the hope that the idea, as far as industry is envisaged by the Department, will not be forgotten.  In west Cork it is the main industry, if not the only one apart from agriculture, that existed there, and it is disappearing.  I want to see whether the Minister has any views as to how that industry could be preserved and the men restored to their employment.</P>

      <P>To discuss industrial policy at the present time is like <Col N="347" /> treading on eggs.  To discuss it in circumstances when the Banking Commission's report is held up, and when general policy regarding industry, subsequent to the Agreement with Great Britain, has been so little expounded, means that we are treading on eggs.  I do not wish to deal with that to any extent now, but I think the Minister ought to take the House more into his confidence as to what the general line of industrial development is going to be, following the Agreement with Great Britain.  It was suggested to-day by the Taoiseach that before the Banking Commission's report is published &mdash; if it is to be published &mdash; some aspects of it may be such that Government action will have to be taken before the public are given&mdash; if they are to be given it at all &mdash; the report of that commission on some aspects of our economic position.  I think the remarks of the Taoiseach to-day will add to the anxiety of some industrialists.  If his remarks do not apply to the industrial side, but rather to the economic position, then, in the interests of manufacturers, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should, on this Estimate, tell us whether the Taoiseach's remarks applied to manufacturing business or not.  I suggest that they did, because, as far as agriculture is concerned, it has at least been put back into the market in Great Britain that it had before being damaged, somewhat.  As far as industry is concerned, some industrialists do not know exactly where they stand under the present Agreement. They are in the position, happily, that, in so far as the external market in Great Britain has been restored to farmers, the purchasing power of our people will be, to some extent, re-established.  There are other industries, the boot industry, for instance, to which Deputy Pattison referred, in very definite difficulty as a result of the continuous keeping down of the purchasing power of the people during the last five or six years. It remains to be seen whether the boot industry can maintain itself to the extent that it has been established here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> It will require a certain number of months for a disclosure of the general report on the economic position made by the Banking Commission before anyone could make any kind of a fair estimate as to the future of some of the industries recently established.  In the meantime, I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do his part by shedding as much light as possible on the economic situation.  Deputy Murphy stated that the Minister had made a rather mild statement on this Estimate, and that it was the first time that he had ever done so.  All the rainbow colouring of the Minister has been dropped.  That is no harm.  We ought to be able to see things in a somewhat clearer light now.  In relation to that, I might point out that particulars were published, beginning in 1933, dealing with a series of industries, and that was carried on for a few years.  I should like to ask why these particulars have been dropped for one particular set of industries that are of very great importance, if our economic life is to be kept under review.  In early issues, and up to last year, a statement about economic industries appeared in the Irish Trade Journal, giving particulars of the number of working days lost through trade disputes.  The issue for December last instead of bringing these particulars up-to-date dealt with other industries.  From March last no information is given about the number of days lost in trade disputes.  The Trade Journal has been issued for two quarters of this year and that table has been taken out.  The Minister must be aware that during the last five or six years the number of days lost each year owing to trade disputes has risen considerably.  The average number of days lost each month was 8,450 in 1929; 6,451 in 1930, and 25,850 in 1931. In 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937 there was a very substantial rise in the number of days lost.  In 1933 the average number of days lost per month was 16,680; in 1934, 15,010; in 1935, 24,010; in 1936, 15,470, and for the first three months of 1937 about 13,000. There is a substantial increase every year in the position compared with pre-1931, and that is characteristic.  I might say, of our economic situation at <Col N="349" /> the present time.  Why these facts should be so systematically hidden, by taking the different graphs, which were part of the planning of our economic situation, out of the returns is disconcerting.</P>
    <P>At the present time the city of Dublin is faced with a bread strike and a milk strike.  If the Minister tells us that there is no danger of that, everyone in the city will be relieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But bad as the other strikes are, both in their effects on the workers, on employers generally, and on the people who depend upon their products, the Minister will admit that a threatened bread strike as well as a threatened milk strike in the City of Dublin is of much greater importance than any other strike he could think of.</P>
      <P>The Minister in dealing with his Estimates glosses over the fact of these substantially increased figures over a number of years in strikes.  I raised the matter in order to ask him to let us have the facts, and it is only in the clear light of all the facts that anybody can help him or that he may get the criticism from the Opposition to steer him in anything like a proper course. I think we would like to hear from the Minister before he closes what exactly is the position with regard to the threatened strike for milk and bread in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would also like to hear from the Minister why, now that the Prices Commission has been turned to the examination of quite a number of things, a list of which was given recently, he does not take some of the most important things first and why he does not get down to the really crying shame and that is the price of bread, I say the price of bread at the present time is a matter that is hitting every home in the City of Dublin and particularly the working-class home, and <Col N="350" /> that before any elaborate work is taken by the Prices Commission in connection with any of the industries that have been marked down on its present list, he should get the Prices Commission or some other machinery to get down to the bottom of why the price of bread is so exorbitantly high at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister, I suggest, ought to get some other machinery than the Prices Commission to go into the matter, because a thorough examination of the price of bread should disclose that it is unjust and unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that that examination has been made and the factors which are responsible for the price of bread are known to those who have read the report of the Prices Commission.  Further examination is not necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to judge the competency of the Prices Commission machinery to tell us whether an Irish industry should be continued or have its operations reduced or anything like that, by the work they have done on the price of bread, then the Irish manufacturers may have greater dangers in front of them than they know of.</P>

The blind eye has been completely put to that.  But the thing I wish to keep before the Minister is the scandal of the price of bread at the present time, that is a thing that should not be delayed in having his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Again, if there is a danger of there being a bread strike in the City of Dublin I would like to ask the Minister if he has no more helpful suggestion to make to the people wanting bread in Dublin than that which has been made from the Department of Industry and Commerce that they should prepare to do domestic bread-making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the matter that I gave notice of to the Minister by way of question yesterday. At the outset I want to say that in connection with the matter I am going to refer to I lay very little blame on the Minister himself.  I quite agree that he was dealing with parties or individuals that might be a little bit too smart for most people. The situation that I am going to disclose seems to me extraordinary, and what I do blame the Minister and his Department for is to allow themselves to be used as a party to the ultimate end that was reached here. This is in connection with the slate quarries at Carrick-on-Suir.  A grant of £4,500 was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>A loan of £4,500 was given.  The Minister referred in his answer yesterday to an amount of £2,250 of a grant.  My information was that there were two grants, one of £2,500 and another of £1,500.  The <Col N="353" /> Minister might have omitted one of the grants by, perhaps, mistake or his figure may be correct.  I am not in a position to dispute it.  My information is that two separate grants were given.  Before these grants were given I do not know what steps the Minister took when he came into office to see the position of this particular quarry, to see its financial standing, to see in what position it was to meet the obligations it owed to his particular Department.  I do not even know what his powers were to examine the books, or if he had any.  But there was an extraordinary position here.  This is a cheque drawn on behalf of the Carrick-on-Suir slate quarries in favour of the Killaloe slate quarries, a cheque for £3,000.  It is signed on behalf of the Carrick-on-Suir slate quarries by J.B. O'Driscoll, director, and William Blair, director, and endorsed on the back as having been paid on behalf of the Killaloe slate quarries, signed by J. B. O'Driscoll again.</P>
      <P>The same state of affairs applies to another cheque of £419 13s. 6d., drawn in the same way and signed by the same individuals.  The grants were given to develop this quarry.  One grant was given for the erection of offices and the other for development. One of the conditions of this development was that a certain number of people be employed.  I think 15 was the condition.  There were never more than five employed, and those five were let go from the slate quarries and employed on development.  When the inspectors or anyone of that type left the place, these people were brought back again on quarry work.  The people in the quarry, both the foreman and the five people I have referred to, are prepared to swear an affidavit in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was done in the way of development was this: The quarry was 300 feet deep, 150 feet to the water level, and 150 feet over the water level. It was always kept pumped out.  When this company started to develop the quarry with your grants they placed over the one real bed in the quarry 4,000 tons of debris, in or about.  That was taken and placed right over the bed.  It is there yet.  Into the quarry <Col N="354" /> proper they heaped perhaps over 1,000,000 tons of debris over the water level.  Out of the material over the water level the people who used to work in that quarry recovered a valuable quantity of slates.  I might mention that when they did that everything was taken away, not even as much as a staple or a nail being left. The people there made a few tools for themselves.  As I have indicated, they used to work in the quarry.  They had no anvil or vice and no tools, nothing except their hands and a block of metal with a hole in it.  They used that as an anvil and they constructed a vice with a tongs.  With tools of that type they succeeded in selling £4,000 worth of slates taken from over the water level, and I may say they have not explored all the possibilities.  Anyway, £4,000 worth of slates have been sold from over the water level.  They have not explored it all, because it would be too expensive for them to get on to good rock.  It would have been much easier to quarry on a new face.</P>
    <P>I say that this was deliberate wreckage on the part of the company. It was a deliberate attempt, with the money of the State, to wreck this quarry.  It does not require anyone with brains to realise what is the position with regard to the 4,000 tons placed on the top in the way I indicated. The first thing would be to remove all that.  The worst thing they did was to fire all the stuff right into the quarry.  Here you had quantities of loose stuff and you would have to remove all that again.  There is danger sometimes when dealing with the solid rock, but it is impossible to do anything when you are dealing with loose shingle.  The whole thing would have to be removed.  I say there was a deliberate and successful attempt made to wreck this quarry and put it out of commission for all time.</P>
    <P>In Russia wreckers have a short shrift.  The only thing I am sorry about is that the people who did this job could not be treated as they would be in Russia.  I will not say that the Minister or his advisers have a right to be treated as they treat them in Russia, but I think the Minister must not have exercised any due caution with regard to how this money was <Col N="355" /> spent and what the supposed development was like.  I know that one man, I think his name was Lavin, went down on the Minister's behalf on two or three occasions and always notified them that he was going there.  Surely he must have seen what was happening if he has any brains at all.  I understand one man from a Wicklow quarry, I think it is Shillelagh, and I think his name was Roberts, went down there and examined it&mdash;I am sure on the Minister's behalf.  The Minister must have seen his report. When he went to the quarry the first thing he said, when he saw the 4,000 tons, was: &ldquo;Good God, look at that.&rdquo; When he looked further into it I am sure there were more exclamations.  I do not know what report he made.</P>
    <P>This went on for a time until 1935, when there was a final burst up, and I believe the place went into liquidation and a receiver or somebody else was appointed.  Somebody may ask me where did I get those documents, but I am not going to tell.  I will tell the Minister all about it if he wants to know.</P>

      <P>A lorry came from Killaloe to take away all the documents after it went into the receiver's hands.  If they failed to collect them all, that is their look-out.  These documents came into my hands within the last six weeks.  The receiver, acting on behalf of the Department, evidently wanted to get some buyers and he began to touch people who would be likely buyers.  He sent them to examine the plant, fittings, machinery and equipment.  I have here a letter in reply to a telegram sent from the Carrick-on-Suir Slate Quarries to Killaloe warning them that a certain gentleman from Dublin had been on a visit the day before.  This is the reply to the telegram:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with what it was, but I know it could not represent anything like the value of the machinery.  I happen to know something about the price paid for that machinery and the cost of its erection.  Here are some of the items:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three-ton Anderson-Grice all-steel electric derrick crane, 80 foot jib with a 20 h.p. motor d.c.; No. 2, 30 cwt. derrick crane, fitted for motor drive; No. 3, Anderson-Grice cross cut diamond saw, 36 inch blade with d.c. motor: No. 4, 3 ton overhead hand crane, 26 foot span; No. 5, d.c. motors, one 3 h.p. 500 r.p.m. shunt, starter; one 8 h.p. 750 r.p.m. shunt; one 10 h.p. 800 r.p.m. shunt, starter; one 30 h.p. 800 r.p.m. series, controller; one ¼ h.p. Keith Blackman forge fan; one generator, 220 V. 200 Amp., 675 r.p.m. switch board; one 70 h.p. <Col N="357" /> motor, 380 V. a.c. slip-ring, 715 r.p.m. starter; one 30 h.p. motor, 380 V. a.c. slip-ring, 720 r.p.m. starter; No. 6, Reaveil air compressor, 220 cubic feet per minute; No. 7, air receiver 8 feet by four feet diameter; No. 8, 6 slate dressing machines; No. 9, heavy duty lathe, 6 ft. 6 ins. centres, 14 in. over bed; No. 10, hand or power drilling machine; No. 11, 3 ton Blondin rope crane, 440 ft. span; No. 12, quantity of 4 in., 3 in., 2 in. and 1 in. piping, wiring, loose tools and scrap, 262 yards trace, 2 ft. gauge, lorries and tip wagons.</P>
    <P>I do not know what some of these cost, but the first item cost £1,250. Now, there are six or seven pages of these items; I do not wish to read out the lot but under office fittings there is an oak table, armchair, typist's desk, steel letter-filing cabinet, fire-proof safe, tables, chairs, stool, typewriter, electric kettles and lamps, 100 Amp. fuses, files and numerous other things. The garage and oil-house contained a number of tanks, one a 500 gallon petrol tank, steel barrels, etc.  In the magazine there were lorry parts, copper strand, detonators and so on. In the engine house there was the Reavel air compresser, belting, lathe shafting and so on.  In the shed there were brackets, pulleys, steel lorry, diamond saw and tables, piping, Ingersol Rand air hammers and chain slings.  Outside you had turntables, galvanised water tanks, hundreds of yards of 2 inch piping air and piping water.  In the old office there were shovels, diamond saw blades, field telephones, magnetos.  All these items, running to six or seven pages, were sold for £104 net.  Now, this is what I blame you for.</P>

      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that there was no commonsense in this matter.  An agent of the Minister's should be there and should have bought in this plant.  The wrong that has been done to the people of this district is a public and glaring one. It is nothing less than scandalous.  Mr. J.B. O'Driscoll, of the Killaloe Slate Quarries, jockeyed the Minister into this and all these goods were let go. This is one of the gravest scandals of our time.  I admit that the Department was dealing with somebody a little too good for them.  He has got away with all this property.  Large numbers of people are suffering huge losses over this.  Families who managed to get a living there for hundreds of years have been deprived of their livelihood.  Their only resource now is going round in gangs trying to get a living out of what other people threw into the water. These people who had been working there have managed since 1935 to get £4,000 worth of slate lifted up out of the water.  That is stuff that had been thrown away.  There is not as much as a nail or a slab there now and these people with their hands have taken up this property.  They had no cranes, derricks or machinery, but with the most crude instruments they were able to go down there and take up from a depth of 150 feet £4,000 worth of property and sell it.  If that is the way the business of the State is to be conducted, God help the State.  I do not blame the Minister as much as I would blame him in other circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I have the documents here and I am prepared to give them to the Minister if he thinks anything can be done about it now, but I suppose nothing can.  If it were possible <Col N="359" /> it would be a good thing if we could get back some of the public money that has been gobbled up and squandered.  The worst thing about it is the wrecking of the quarry and preventing anyone ever being able to do anything with it in the future except it is taken up in a national way.  Why did not experts who knew their job get an opportunity of taking over and starting that quarry?  Loans were given to people who were not able to play the game honestly.  It is deplorable to think that all that vast equipment there should have been sold for £105.  It was in the Minister's hands and he let it go.  In doing so he condemned the people living in that neighbourhood and who have made their living out of that quarry to misery and unemployment for the rest of their lives.  If I have ever read a history of utter disgrace and scandal it is this case.  I never heard anything like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister the great defects in the Employment Act and especially with regard to arrangements with trade union organisations.  At the moment, I understand, the only thing that can be registered is the wages agreement.  I am sure the Minister knows that while wage agreements are brought up, there are also conditions of work included in the agreements, and so far as the Act is at the moment, the only registration is of wages agreements. If it is at all possible for the Minister to amend the Act so that agreements between employers and trades unions with regard to conditions and so on could be registered, it would avoid some of the unfair competition in the industries concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the point made by Deputy Murphy with regard to the delay in meeting the claims of men who are unemployed because their claims have to be investigated.  I would suggest that there should be no difficulty in the case of a man who may be idle in the forenoon of a particular day and then get employment in the afternoon. What happens is that, very often, he does not report to the labour exchange that he has been employed <Col N="360" /> on that day, and the result is that, after two or three days, that is found to be the case and his claim is held up for, perhaps, five or six weeks.  I do not think there should be any difficulty in a case like that, and I certainly cannot see why a man should be cut off for six or seven weeks when all that is necessary is to deduct the payment for the one day.  I think it should be easy to have some method of giving authority to the local people to deal with such cases.  I have investigated many of these cases, and when I went to the labour exchange I have been told: &ldquo;Well, tell him to sign on and we will find out about it, and he will find at the end of five or six weeks that all that will happen is the deduction of a day's wages for the day he was employed.&rdquo; I hold that that should not be necessary, and there is a great hardship in these people having to wait for six or seven weeks for the adjustment of a matter that could be settled by the local people.  I should also like to stress again what I suggested as to the amendment of the Conditions of Employment Act so that the registration of these agreements should include conditions of work as well as wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Seán Brodrick Mr. Seán Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Estimate, I should like to call attention to subhead L, Minerals Exploration.  The sum concerned is £5,500, and I should like to know what we are getting out of that.  Is it really a matter of a number of inspectors travelling around the country, or are there annual reports?  I put a question down on several occasions about the brick industry that existed as late as 20 years ago in County Galway.  An inspector was sent down, and I was promised some copy of a report afterwards, but I never received it, nor did I hear one word about it.  You will find, with regard to an industry like that, which was really a hand industry, that quite a number of people were able to make a good living out of it 20 years ago, and now we have the Minister spending this £5,500 every year and we get nothing for it.  We have something here about an investigation in the Carrickmacross-Kingscourt area and the Slieve Ardagh area, but as far as I can see, instead of trying to resurrect <Col N="361" /> these old industries that have been worked by hand and to put them on a more modern basis, the policy is to stifle these industries and to start industries of such a kind for the use of which practically all the raw materials have to be imported into the country. It should be the Minister's policy to try to resurrect all these old industries and to develop the natural resources of this country instead of starting new industries and importing the raw materials.  We have these new industries being started, and the raw materials for them being imported, and then we find, at the end of a few years, that we have not got a market and are not able to use all the stuff we are manufacturing.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear that Deputy Gorey, for the first time, exposed the O'Driscoll racket.  The O'Driscoll racket has been a well-known racket in this country for the past five or six years, and I feel that I can safely say that even now at such a late hour, if the Minister gets finished with the O'Driscoll party, he will find that the slate industry of this country will develop.  Certainly it is indeed sad to see so many slate quarries in this country in the position in which they are.  We find money expended on them &mdash; expended on them in order to close them down.  That is the position with regard to every slate quarry in this country at the present time.  You have slate quarries in Donegal &mdash; well, they are probably working fairly well at the present moment &mdash; but you have them in Mayo closed down, and the same is happening in other places.  The only one that is going, practically at the present time, is the Killaloe quarry.  The Minister shakes his head.  What percentage of the houses, even of those for which grants are given by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, are roofed with Irish slates?  I would say that the percentage is very small.  They are roofed with a product which is entirely foreign to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>And no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>They are roofed with tiles.  There is no guarantee for them, <Col N="362" /> and everything that is in that tile is foreign.  The machinery is foreign and, up to two months ago, the cement was foreign.  The dye that is in them is foreign, and it is juvenile labour. The only thing that is Irish in them is Irish sand.  What I am pointing out is that you have a natural product of this country and there is no means of developing it.  You have thousands of tons of slates that could be used in this country.  People have tried to get them, and if you go through the country at the present day you will see numbers of houses with just the timber roofs on them, where there has been a delay of months and months in trying to procure Irish slates.  They cannot get them, and they will not be allowed to use anything else except an inferior article which the people will not use.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies to a lot of other industries.  If you take the West of Ireland, you have a woollen industry there &mdash; a woollen industry that is situated in the centre of the country that produces one-sixth of all the wool produced in the whole country, and there you have that industry at the present time, with Irish capital in it, closed down.  Is it the policy of the Minister or of his Government that industries such as that woollen industry, in the centre of County Galway, that produces one-sixth of the wool of the country, should be closed down at the present time?  I think the Minister should be ashamed that such a thing should be allowed to go on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he should be. Then you had the hosiery industry and other industries, practically every one of which was worked by hand up to 20 years ago, and there is no trace of them at the present time.  If the Minister is to take his position seriously I think he should see to those industries and give them some help. Then you have boot and shoe industries established throughout the country. I see that there is one in Ballinasloe which is practically closed. Where such industries are established the Minister should at least see that <Col N="363" /> the people who invest their money are protected, and that the managers who are sent over to manage these industries are men who know their business and are not going to exploit the people who invest their money in them.  That is really what it means.  That is what has happened in Ballinasloe and you have that industry practically closed at the present time.  The same applies to the milling industry, and the Minister himself threatened here some months ago that he is going to continue with a strong hand to put out the small miller.  The Minister cannot get away from that. He is going to continue with the strong hand, and every small miller throughout the country, even in the small co-operative mills of this country, if he mills over his quota, is brought into the Circuit Court and fined £80.  The Minister said a few months ago:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am going to continue that policy and put the small miller out of trade in this country in order to see that the Ranks and others are going to get their huge profits out of the Irish farmer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They must have been very costly if there is £214,000 outstanding after they had been in <Col N="365" /> operation.  We find that the Minister proposes this year buying 35,000 tons of potatoes to keep these five factories going at £2 per ton delivered at the factory.  Although the Taoiseach said to-day that he was prepared to help, so far as possible, the producer in this country, all the producer will get out of these factories is £70,000 for 35,000 tons of potatoes.  These are the figures given by the Minister himself.  In any case, the cost is £214,000 this year for the buildings and there was a sum of £188,653 in the estimates last year for the same work.  Is it fair to the producer that out of that expenditure he is only going to get £70,000?  We have heard a terrible lot of sympathy expressed with the farmer for all he has suffered during the last five or six years.  Now, when everything is settled up, the farmer who has the sympathy of the Fianna Fail Government is to get £2 per ton for 35,000 tons of potatoes.</P>
      <P>The next thing we come to is turf development.  Here we find an estimate amounting to £93,952, and last year we had an estimate for £105,042.  This is the third or fourth year that this turf development department has appeared on the Estimates.  Last year the Minister for Defence said that he hoped that great things would be done during that year and that the estimate for turf development would be reduced very much</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The burning of turf will not increase.  It is not increasing down the country, at any rate.  Any time that this Department has interfered in the production of turf so far it has been a failure.  An Act was passed here providing that every merchant buying so many tons of coal should buy so many tons of turf as well, but it never came into operation because they knew it would be a failure.  Judging by the way the Minister is acting in connection with turf development I expect it will be a failure too.  It is going to cost the country something when we have an Estimate this year for £93,000 and an <Col N="366" /> Estimate last year for £105,000.  We should like to hear from the Minister how this industry is going to develop or how it is going to be a benefit to the country on the lines on which it is being carried out.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I raised a question here as to a recommendation in connection with certain institutions which were being erected that turf should be burned in them when, as a matter of fact, no provision was made for the burning of turf in these institutions. As a matter of fact provision had been made for the burning of coal in these institutions, although a request had been made by the Department of Local Government that turf should be burned.  The result was that alterations had to be made in these buildings in order to make provision for the burning of turf.  Even if you take the labourers' cottages which are being erected in rural districts at present you will find that in no scheme is provision made for suitable grates to burn turf. If the turf industry is to give employment and to be a success we would like to get some return from it, but so far I have seen no return from this particular industry.  I should like the Minister to show us in what way this industry is going to be a paying industry or is going to help the country.</P>

      <P>I simply intervene to ask the Minister if he can do something for a very deserving class by way of giving unemployment assistance to fishermen who, although they may go out to fish under a share arrangement, may not catch anything.  That is a very outstanding grievance of that class of men and a great deal of suffering has been entailed through that position of affairs.  I would earnestly ask the Minister to devise some arrangement which will help them in that way.  If he does so, a very serious grievance may be rectified. At present these men are not entitled to home assistance because the regulations more or less forbid its being given.  These fishermen during this season are suffering extremely because of the lack of some arrangement of that kind and I would ask the Minister <Col N="367" /> to devise some arrangement by which they could get unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, speaking at some of the functions held in conjunction with the opening of new factories, very often stresses the necessity for a balanced economy in this country. We have been pointing out here for the last couple of days the necessity for giving immediate help and relief to the agricultural community.  During the past six years our agricultural prosperity has been seriously affected by the economic war, but that was not the sole cause of its serious depression. A very serious and unjust burden has been imposed upon the whole agricultural community by the system adopted here for the development of industry.  As I said, we are given to understand that the Minister is working towards a balanced economy but, to my mind, if we are to continue to pursue the present methods, we shall have the most unbalanced economy on the face of God's earth because, as between agriculture and industry in this country, the balance is altogether in favour of industry.  The Minister may feel proud of his industrial achievements, but any fool could have developed industry in this country if he were permitted to create monopolies and to ignore completely the interests of the consumer.  The success of industrial development must be examined in the light of its effects on our primary industry, agriculture. To my mind this development has been a very serious burden on our agricultural community.  In fact we have been completely weighed down by industry here.  The cost of production <Col N="368" /> for the farmer, the cost of his raw material, the cost of machinery necessary to operate his farm, on the one side, has forced up his costs of production so much that he finds himself with a very narrow margin, a dwindling margin, of profit.  In fact it has dwindled so much that in a great many cases it has disappeared.</P>
      <P>We have been asked by the Taoiseach here to-day what can be done to help agriculture here.  It has been accepted by the Taoiseach that this country is dependent on the British market to dispose of its surplus agricultural produce.  Therefore, we have no control over the price we obtained for that agricultural produce. We must take the price it commands there, a competitive price and a world price.  The only redress left to us to-day, if we want to increase the margin of profit for the man engaged in agriculture, is to reduce his costs of production.  That is within the control of the Government.  Everything the farmer has to buy to-day is costing him too much.  He is buying from monopolists in this country, and he is buying very often a rotten article at a price that is not a competitive price at all.  We expect our farmers then to go into production and to compete in the open market against the world. How can we hope to succeed in that market?  The disastrous result is that the farmer has been driven back into his shell.  He has dropped production because he has been losing all along. You have killed his enterprise.  You are not going to have any enterprise in agriculture here until you release that grip, that stranglehold, which your industrial development has on the farmer at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give a few examples.  Take the mowing machine.  You have a type of mower produced in this country that is built on a pattern that is over fifteen years old.  The modern machine that can be imported, the American machine or the Canadian machine, is imported on a tariff of 33? per cent.  The farmers are forced to buy the Irish machine built on that obsolete pattern or else pay a tariff of 33? per cent. on a foreign machine.  Is it for the purpose of developing this industry or for the purpose of bringing in revenue to the <Col N="369" /> Government that the farmer is compelled to pay that tariff?  If it is for the purpose of building up that industry, it is the duty of the Minister to see that the farmer gets a right article at the right price, that he gets an up-to-date machine, because otherwise the farmer cannot be expected to go into competition with the farmers of the world in outside markets.</P>
    <P>Then take a manure distributor which, I submit, is a very important implement, because in any intensive system of agriculture it is essential that artificial manures should be used.  It is absolutely essential when using artificial manure that it should be spread evenly and carefully over the soil to give the best results.  The type of manure distributor made in this country is built on a pattern that was made 15 years ago.  Tremendous improvements have been made in these types of machines in recent years, because, after all, artificial manure is a comparatively recent product, but we have still manufactured in this country a machine on a pattern that was obsolete 15 years ago.  The policy apparently is to try to force the farmer to buy that obsolete machine, and then we expect him to go into competition on the British market against every other agriculturist in the world who has the very latest type of machine at his command at a competitive price. Take forks.  There was a duty put on forks but we cannot make the head of a fork.  The grains were imported and it was handled here in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I say the fork handles were rotten.  I know for a fact that this case was submitted to the Minister's Department.  A man bought an Irish plough and two boards wore off that plough in a month.  Every ordinary farmer knows that the board of a plough should last approximately for four or five months.  He wore off two boards in a month.  That case was handed to a member of the Minister's Party and to the Minister.  The result was that the Irish firm sent another board to the man I referred to.  The fact, at any rate, remains that on that particular plough the man were off two boards.  I presume that in a great many other cases the same thing has happened, but the purchasers did not bother further about it.  This particular man was rather keen on his job. He got in touch with his local Deputy, who reported the matter to the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of sheltered industrial production that you have going on in this country, and that is the type of load that the agricultural community are expected to carry all the time.  If there is going to be any success in an industrial way or any hope of prosperity for agriculture in the future, it must be seen to that the people engaged in industry here will produce decent articles, up-to-date in pattern and that they will be sold at competitive prices.  We have the same thing with regard to everything that the farmer has to buy.  Again, in the case of a plough, a grease cap for an Irish-made plough costs 1/3, while a similar article on an English-made plough costs 8d., although there is protection to the extent of 25 per cent. in favour of the Irish plough.  Is it not the responsibility of the Minister's Department to see that when it gives protection to that kind of industry that the tillage farmer, for whom Deputy Corry is so much concerned, will be able to buy these articles at the right price &mdash; at a competitive price. Recently, the price of parts for English-made ploughs went up 10 per cent. on account of the increased <Col N="371" /> cost of material and of production, and at the same time the price of the Irish articles went up 15 per cent.  Is there any justification whatever for an increase of 15 per cent. as against the 10 per cent. on the imported article? Under the 25 per cent. reduction there was that margin to play with, and why should they get the opportunity of increasing the price by 15 per cent.?  I do not know whose responsibility it is. I do not know whether the matter is going to be referred to the Prices Commission.  If it is, then it ought to be dealt with in the light of the prices at which these types of articles can be bought abroad.  Evidence may be submitted to the Prices Commission by those people that the articles, so far as they are concerned, cost them so much to produce.  I hold that is not enough. In my opinion, the matter ought to be examined in the light of the price at which a particular article can be imported.  If the farmer has to continue to carry his present load he cannot be expected to increase production. We all know, taking the aggregate figures in regard to our exports, that production from the land here has decreased enormously.  There has been an alarming decrease, and to my mind the economic war is not the sole reason for that.  A system has been adopted by the Minister of developing industries anyhow, no matter what the cost to the consumer is.  He can say: &ldquo;We have another industry to boast about.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Take the boot factories.  We have an old boot factory down in Carlow.  It was in operation there before ever Fianna Fáil was heard of.  A number of boot factories have been established all over the country &mdash; in Kilkenny, Clonmel and other places.  They are all on short time.  Some of them are closed down at present because of over-production. What is going to be the final result of all that?  The survival of the fittest, and the others to close down.  It will be simply another few thousand pounds of the people's money gone west.  From the Minister's point of view what does it mean?  The loss of a few more thousand pounds in experiments to develop industry in the country.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to <Col N="372" /> the beet industry?  They are Deputy Corry's favourite &mdash; the four beet factories. The first one at Carlow was established in the time of the last Government.  I think I know as much about the beet industry as any member in the House &mdash; about the growing of it at all events.  Three beet factories have been established by this Government.  The price of beet has been in dispute.  The price this year is still in dispute.  There is one thing, to my mind, that is going to affect the price of beet now and in the future, and it is the lack of proper planning in the development of the industry. We are carrying on those four factories one dud factory, and the sooner it is closed down the better for the industry.</P>

I think that the man who was responsible for the factory at Tuam should be examined immediately by some medical man.  I think he ought to be a case for some medical institution &mdash; for building a factory there when you realise the type of land that surrounds Tuam.  In view of that, how can you ever hope or expect at any time that you are going to get an economic supply of the raw material around Tuam for that factory?  It is the height of absurdity to think that you can.  I suggest that it was not built for any economic reason but from political pressure.</P>

What has been the position? Deputy Corry knows that beet has had to be freighted across the country from the eastern counties to feed the Tuam factory.  That has been the position.  If the factory is going to continue it will not be economically possible to get a supply for it in the Tuam area.  That is the type of industrial <Col N="373" /> development we have to put up with in this country.  That is the type of planning that will have to be dropped.</P>

The people had to suffer and the people are going to suffer.  The Minister and his Department are becoming a bit more sensible about it.  They are beginning to realise that it is necessary to examine the situation; that it is necessary to have expert advice and to go cautiously.

One thing we can say about the Tuam growers is that they are prepared to stand in with their colleagues in looking for a price, and there will be no letters to the Tuam factory offering to grow it at 30/-.  This kind of attack on Irish industry is just the type of attack that we had from the Curragh a few years ago when they wanted to import Russian oats to feed the race horses.  They could not jump on Irish oats.  There was the very self-same frame of mind behind that as there is behind Deputy Hughes's attack this evening.  It is the very self-same frame of mind as that of the people who, when we started to grow Irish wheat, said they could not eat the flour made from it.  That self-same attitude has been the curse of this country.  That kind of thing has gone on in <i>sæcula sæculorum.</i>  If anybody takes the trouble, as I have done, of investigating the position even of smaller industries, the position in regard to forks, for instance, and in regard to spades and shovels, what will they find?  I prepared data for the Prices Commission in connection with that, and I found that forks, spades and shovels which are being sold in England at 45/- a dozen are being sent across here and sold at 38/-.  I have got the invoices for both. That will perhaps surprise Deputies listening to me here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> That is the manner in which Irish industry is being sabotaged on the one hand, and on the other hand attacked in every possible way by Deputies opposite.  Those industries are giving employment to our people. Perhaps what is troubling Deputies opposite is that unemployment is coming down because of the employment being given to our people in industry here at home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brodrick a while ago said that the Minister was out to close down all the rural mills.  That is not in any way in accordance with the facts.  We had the flour mills in Mallow working half-time in 1931.  We had the flour mills in Clondulane closed down altogether in 1931.  We had the flour mills in Midleton working one or two days a week.  Our flour mills are now working full time, and working overtime in many cases.  That does not bear out the Deputy's statement. The trouble is to nail those statements when they are made and where they are made.  I am prepared to make Deputy Hughes a fair offer. Let him get his Canadian mowing machine, and I will get a Pierce one which is ten years old.  We will test out the two and give him a fair run for his money with the old Irish machine against the Canadian one. Let him appoint his own judge.  That is a fair offer for Deputy Hughes if he wishes to take it up.  There is too much of the attitude: &ldquo;Oh, this is an Irish article; have you not got anything English?&rdquo; That is the same as Deputy Gorey's attitude to-day.  He brings something to Dublin to sell, and when an old seonin shopkeeper looks at it he asks: &ldquo;It is Irish?&rdquo; It was not painted before being brought in.  When Deputy Belton brings in something it meets with the same reception. It is the mentality of the seonin shopkeeper that is wrong, as well as the mentality of idiotic farmers who, when they go to buy a spade, a shovel, or a mowing machine, when told it is Irish, say that it must be wrong.  The sooner that situation is ended the better.  I had hoped that Deputies opposite would be educated now.  They appear to be hopeless.  I had a hope that after four or five general elections we would succeed in <Col N="378" /> getting a number of new faces on the benches opposite and that there would be a different mentality there.  The new ones appear to be worse than the old ones.  We must only keep on taking them to the country until we get rid of the whole tribe.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with one other matter to which Deputy Brodrick referred. Deputy Brodrick or any other contractors that require slates can get all they want from West Cork. I should be glad to know if the Minister for Industry and Commerce has called the attention of the Land Commission to the slates that can be had in West Cork.  I have had complaints that the Department of Lands has not put a slate on any of the houses it has erected.  I know that Irish slates have been offered to several contractors.</P>

      <P>Any slates required are in stock and are advertised every day in the public Press.  There are first-class slates, and there is no reason whatever why Irish houses should not be roofed with them.  I think the Minister for Local Government would be lacking in his duty if he gave any <Col N="379" /> further grants for houses, if they are not roofed with Irish states, when they are available.  Some months ago I called the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the injustice that has been imposed on families who, owing to slum clearances, were removed from Cork City to houses built by the corporation outside the borough boundary.  These people were put on the rural rate of unemployment assistance.  That was the first knock they got.  Then the ratepayers had to come to their assistance, so that the difference between the city rate and the rural rate is costing West Cork Board of Assistance £20 a week.  On top of that, these people, who were reared in the city, are supposed to be farm labourers, and under the rural unemployment scheme, they are being deprived of unemployment assistance for three or four months.  They are of no use whatever to farmers. Farmers would not look at them in their way.  It is grossly unfair that these people, who have no hope whatever of getting rural employment, should be condemned &mdash; I cannot describe it in any other way&mdash; by the Cork Corporation and the Minister's Department to eke out such an existence.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to have the matter rectified.  I consider it grossly unfair that men who, through no fault of their own, because the houses in which they were living were pulled down and they were driven to houses outside the borough boundary, should come immediately under the rural rate of unemployment assistance, and then be deprived even of that for four months in the summer, on the ground that they are rural labourers when really they are not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that we are discussing the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, and it occurs to me to point out to Deputies on the opposite benches, that of all the Estimates with which we have been dealing this is really one of the most modest.  In 1929, the total expenditure on the Department was, approximately, £102,000.  This year the Estimate is for £542,000, and I suggest that the increase, in view of what has been achieved by the Department, is a very modest one.  If the Minister had come and asked for £1,000,000 more, in order to enable him to bring about genuine industrial development in this country, I would have said that that was an amount that was well worth spending, in order to end a position that was started by the former Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were genuine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It very ill becomes members of the Fine Gael Party to oppose this Estimate, especially if they recall the fact that it was the late Arthur Griffith who founded the industrial policy in 1905 at the Rotunda, when he announced the new policy of Sinn Féin which involved industrial development.  We on this side of the House adopted and are carrying out his policy and carrying out his tradition and carrying out his beliefs.  We have had a very difficult task, and in presenting this Estimate of an odd half million pounds a year, again an increase <Col N="381" /> of only £440,000 over the previous period, it is well to look back at what the situation was before the new policy came into being.  During the 10 years of the former administration over 117 factories closed, and this Government had to face the position of creating industrial production under circumstances which were in every way made as difficult as possible.  Deputy Corry has spoken this evening of the mentality of the people towards Irish manufacture.  Well, the mentality of the Irish people towards Irish manufacture was certainly lacking in what we may describe as a reasonable national spirit until this Government took office and changed the whole face of the country.  I can recall incidents that occurred in my own particular experience of people who were offered English and Irish products in containers with the reverse label.  That is, they were offered the English product in the Irish container and the Irish product in the English container, and they said the Irish product was far inferior to the English product, although they were actually examining the wrong article.  That is the feeling we had to face when this Government took office.  There was no preparation against world depression.  There was no preparation made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the Opposition Party to face world depression by which, if circumstances lowered the income of those who received dividends in this country, there would be some alternative to fall back on here.  There was no preparation made against war; no preparation made by which we could at least feed and clothe ourselves, and, I may remark incidentally, produce some of our power for our motor transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no preparation for anything of that kind.  There was no variety of production in the country. More and more the country came to rely entirely on one form of production, on one form of export, and there were no alternative industries in order to produce general prosperity in the country and in order to give a general average level of employment, and when Deputies in the Opposition speak, Sir. on the question of emigration, they forget that they themselves ill-prepared <Col N="382" /> the country to face any unusual economic condition that might arise in England whereby there would be a sudden demand for certain sorts of labour at inflated wages.  They themselves failed to create a condition in the towns of this country whereby there would be some alternative employment which would maintain the people at home and give them an inducement to remain at home, and which would do something to restrain whatever emigration might be caused as a result of an unnatural demand for labour in England or in any other country.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that might be emphasised here.  We have had people complaining on behalf of the agricultural community of our industrial development, and it is interesting to know that when the last Government left office we had probably a less proportion of industrial production than almost any other agricultural country in the world.  I challenge the Deputies to study the comparative production in Denmark or Holland or any other country engaged in the agricultural industry, and they will find that the countries with a more modern system of agricultural marketing than we have had up to to-day, because we had not a Government like the one in office, that those countries have had a very pronounced industrial development which constantly increased during the past 10 years, compared with agricultural development.  The Government which took office in 1932 was naturally compelled to take reasonable risks.  We had to clear the way for an entirely new form of economy in this country, and we had to face the position that there would be a large number of factories started in which there would be directors unacquainted with each other, in which there would be executives of labour not acquainted with their employees, in which a whole nucleus of works and executives would be brought together to operate the factory for the first time, and, having regard to those factors, I suggest the industrial progress of this country has been remarkable.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies on the opposite benches have referred, Sir, to <Col N="383" /> what may be described as the growing pains occurring in certain industries Industry has had in many cases only three or four short years in which to develop and there are a number of factors for which the Minister cannot be directly responsible, for which the people of this country and those who have placed their money in industry are responsible, which have to be considered if the new industries are to prosper, such factors as rationalisation in industry, use of modern machinery, avoidance of overlapping in production by industries of the same group through mutual consultation with each other, the insistence that good wages and conditions should be given and, at the same time, if they are given, that the output per worker should be satisfactory.  All these things are matters in which the Government should not and cannot, in a country which is not subject to social legislation, take a direct interest.  It can only have an indirect interest, advise and suggest.  There is every evidence in the country that these problems are being tackled and that if over-production occurs there is a way out for the members of that industry to avoid that over-production through mutual consultation with each other.  The fact that there is over-production in the boot and shoe industry, to my mind, has no relation whatever to the Estimate being considered.  It is a matter purely for internal concern in the industry itself and I fully believe that all those industries that are affected will study the problem and cure it as times goes on.</P>
    <P>As far as the planning of industry is concerned, it is difficult in some ways for the Minister to reply on the question of how far industry has been planned because he is, naturally, speaking for his own Department.  It is better, Sir, that those who have had some indirect part in watching the planning of industry should reply to the charge that industry has not been properly planned in this country.  I challenge any of the Deputies on the opposite benches who themselves have taken part in industrial development, who have taken part in conferences, to deny that every care has been taken <Col N="384" /> in connection with the promotion of industry, that the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce are inexhaustible in their efforts to study every aspect of the situation both in regard to the price of the article when it finally reaches the consumer, the relative market available, the suitability of any one locality for the industry, the possibility of paying adequate wages; that of every single industry established in this country no industry has had a chance of being promoted unless it presents in writing proved facts with regard to those factors.  Naturally, human nature being what it is, some of these statements have occasionally been exaggerated; difficulties always arise; problems arise in connection with the accurate carrying out of the promises made by any one industrial group, but, taking it large and wide, I would suggest, Sir, that the planning of industry has succeeded admirably in this country and that Deputies are too prone to examine cases on newspaper reports of an industry that happens not to be prospering at the present time and they are not aware of the many industries which are prospering and producing articles as good as any English article at a reasonable price to the consumer.</P>
    <P>As far as price is concerned, I believe there is no need for anyone to take an extreme view of the situation. There is no need for members of the Government Party to deny that in the first years of the promotion of an industry the price of an article may exceed that which it would be if the industry had been long established and we who watched 117 industries closed in ten years, make no apology if, in the case of certain industries, during the first years of their development, the price of the goods produced in those industries was slightly in excess of what it would be under normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>During the next five years, Sir, the Government will have an opportunity of stock-taking in industry, of ensuring that all the defects may be remedied and there is no reason to believe that there will not be a gradual diminution of the price to the consumer in the case of certain <Col N="385" /> articles where initial development caused an undue increase in price.</P>
    <P>I would like once more to repeat that an increase of £400,000 has had a remarkable effect on this country.  It has established over 300 factories; it has increased the gross production of industry by many millions of pounds. The expenditure of a comparatively small amount of money in the form of increased staff of the Department and increased facilities for research of every kind has resulted in the most remarkable thing, has actually created for us a balanced economy and we on this side of the House will defend that very modest increase on the Estimate to the last, believing that it will result, in times of prosperity, and particularly in times of depression, in a more average prosperity for the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As an independent farmer, unassociated with any political party, I feel it is my duty to state very briefly my attitude, and the attitude of those who elected me here, towards industrial development.  I have no hesitation in saying that my attitude, and the attitude of the farming community, towards industrial development is simply this, that industry must be developed, that industrial development must continue and must be pushed as far as possible until this country is as self-supporting as it is humanly possible to make it. In connection with industrial development, I feel that the Minister for Industry and Commerce deserves a certain amount of sympathy.  He is faced with two great dangers.  There is a danger on the right hand from those who are over-patriotic, overzealous, in promoting industry, those who, by their ultra-patriotism, are giving a certain amount of shelter and scope to unscrupulous people who wrap the green flag round them and who seek to secure huge profits by protesting that they are out simply and solely for the good of the country.  It is the duty of the Minister, a duty which I believe he is capable of performing, to see that everybody who protests that he is out to help Irish <Col N="386" /> industry and promote its development, is honest and straightforward.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, you have a feeling which does exist, and which always existed in this country, of hostility to Irish industrial development. I do not say that that feeling exists on a very large scale, but it does exist to a certain extent, and, in so far as it exists, it should be curbed.  I do not think that some of the speakers who criticised certain Irish industries to-day have been altogether animated by that feeling.  I believe the criticisms of Deputy Hughes and Deputy Gorey were to a large extent constructive.  I believe such criticism is absolutely necessary and desirable. It is not very easy, outside this House, to expose anything that is dishonest or unjustifiable in connection with an industry.  It is right and proper that full use should be made of the privileges of this House by Deputies to expose, and bring to the Minister's and to the public notice, anything which they consider improper and dishonest, and I think, by so doing, such Deputies are assisting the Minister in promoting industrial development. The inefficient or the dishonest manufacturer is no use to this country, is no use to the Minister, and is no use to the policy of industrial development. It is only right, wherever possible, and particularly in this House, that he should be exposed.  I think I have defined very briefly my attitude towards industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention, and that is, the question of dealing with unemployment.  I hold that the policy of the Minister should be, not to provide maintenance for those who are unemployed but to provide regular, constant employment at reasonable rates.  Socialists and people of that kind tell us that the duty of a Government is to provide either work or maintenance.  I hold definitely that the duty of a Government is to provide work, and that providing maintenance is not fulfilling the moral obligation that rests on the Government of any country.  The provision of maintenance may prevent <Col N="387" /> death from starvation, but it does not prevent the moral degradation of our people, and particularly of our young people.  The policy of forcing young people in country districts to travel five or six miles to the local town to draw a miserable, inadequate dole, and to spend two days in the week signing for and drawing that dole, is one which can only tend to demoralise our young people.</P>
    <P>Any young man who has been forced to submit to that policy, who has been forced to attend at a labour exchange two or three times in the week and to hang around the towns and get into a state of compulsory idleness, is rendered unfit to be a useful citizen, and some machinery must be set up by the Government, some special department must be provided, which will tackle this problem in a business-like manner and so organise development services that will provide work for every unemployed person.  Any man who finds himself out of employment should be in a position to report to the labour exchange and obtain employment within a day or two.  There should be a State department which should make that its main object.</P>
    <P>It may be asked on what lines should development schemes be advanced.  The most important schemes in this country are concerned with the development and improvement of land, which is the country's greatest asset.  There should be a special department to deal with the reclamation of land on a big scale, with drainage and improvement of every kind, so as to develop the country's most valuable asset and improve the greatest source of wealth we have in the country, which is the soil.</P>

      <P>I have been tempted to make a contribution to this debate because of the feebleness, the futility and the presumption of Deputies I heard speaking from the opposite benches.  When I came into the House the question of sugar production in the Carlow factory was being debated, and laboured in debate.  It was being discussed by a Deputy who, I can testify to his own claim, can discuss sugar production and sugar beet growing not only as well as any member <Col N="388" /> of this House, but as well as any man in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A twist has been given to this debate by Deputies opposite, particularly by the youthful Deputy Childers.  On listening to Deputy Childers one would think that we were born last year or the year before.  One would think that we were not born in this country, that we did not grow up in this country, that we did not belong to this country, and that we had not our roots deep in the soil of this country.  I want to tell that Deputy that I am not going to take the teachings of Arthur Griffith from a youth of his calibre.</P>

      <P>One monument to Arthur Griffith and to Arthur Griffith's policy is the Carlow sugar factory.  In 1925 experiments in the growing of beet were started and farmers were asked to grow beet.  The farmers through the country were asked to grow sugar beet as an experiment to enable the Department of Agriculture to learn if the soil of this country were suitable to the growing of sugar beet.  These experiments were carried out under definite regulations.  Many members on these benches here grew an experimental acre of sugar beet in 1925.  I challenge a single Deputy on the Government Benches to stand up and say he grew that year an acre of experimental beet. Go to the Departments where those experiments are recorded.  I think they are in the records of the Department of Agriculture and you will find there the names of those who grew sugar beet but you will not find the name of a single Fianna Fáil Deputy who grew sugar beet that year.  That was the start of sugar production. Now, we witness the impudence of the youthful Deputy Childers standing up and saying that the new industrial era started when the Fianna Fáil Party took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> We on this side stand for industrial development.  We give second place to nobody in that matter.  But it is not industrial development or industrial production to impose tariffs for the purpose of revenue.  The Minister has asked this House to pass tariffs on agricultural implements coming into this country.  I have heard a lot of talk from Deputies opposite about Irish ploughs and foreign ploughs.  We were even told by them that the people on the Fine Gael Benches preferred the foreign plough for no reason but that it was a foreign plough.  Last week I wanted an agricultural implement. I tried every house in this city to get me an Irish one.  They communicated with the supposed makers of these agricultural implements in this country and failed to get even one implement.  I had to import it and pay on it an import duty of £5 10s.  I challenge the Minister to tell me where I could have got a potato digger manufactured in this country.  What justification has he for putting a tariff on an agricultural implement when that implement is not made here?  That implement was delivered to me to-day. The firm that delivered it is Messrs. Thomas Linehan and Company, Capel Street, Dublin.  I ordered an Irish implement but could not get it.  I got the English implement delivered to me to-day and worked it to-day.  I notice the merchant for slates has left.  This youthful Deputy is going to teach poor common or garden Irishmen how to love their country and develop its industry.</P>

      <P>I do not know the name of my friend up there.  He is a newcomer, but will get plenty of time to make an intelligent contribution to this debate if he is capable of doing so. But there is no hurry.  Interruptions and a desire for interruptions do not bespeak intelligence.  In 1930 and 1931 I built houses and I roofed them with Carrick slates.  That was before the Childers era of industrial development. I continued to roof houses with Carrick slates.  I would never have roofed a house with anything else but Carrick slates.  But, strange to say, in this <Col N="390" /> age of industrial development I could not continue using Carrick slates because I could not get them.  In 1931 and 1932 the slate quarries of Carrick were producing the finest slates in the world.  I challenge contradiction to that.  Why are they not being produced still?  What king reigned in Ireland in 1935?  Was it not during this famous era of industrial development that the Carrick slate quarries were closed down?  I have it on good technical authority that the slate seams of this country are richer than those of Wales.  Second to no seam in this country is the shale around Carrick. What happened in 1935?  I have here a list of the selling out of the machinery, etc., in the Carrick slate quarry.  That quarry was sold out lock, stock and barrel &mdash; everything for £104.  What has the Minister to say to that?</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it. But, if I say to the Minister that I will take 100,000 Carrick slates 16 inches by eight inches, or larger, will he guarantee to deliver them, or have them delivered?  Are there slates in the Carrick area?  Is there not rock or shale in the Carrick area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Fianna Fáil came into power the slates disappeared.  As they say on the radio, I will now switch on to another station.  I hope the Minister will listen in.  Will the Minister supply me 100,000 slates, 16 inches by eight inches, from the Killaloe Slate Quarry?  Silence.  He will not, because they are not to be had.  Is not that so? We are forced to roof our houses by concrete tiles because we cannot get Irish slate.  Grants are given for housing, but if we put on the best roofing material, and if we have to import that because we cannot get the Irish material, do we not lose these grants?  Is not that the position Is there any representative from the Local Government Department here?  That Department made it a definite rule that the grant will not be paid unless the <Col N="391" /> material where possible is Irish material.  When you come to look for Irish slate you cannot get it.  What else follows besides not getting the grant?  If the grant is not paid, the builder also loses the remission of rates by the local authority.  So that the builder is driven into a corner.  He must use Irish material that he can get, but that is not the best, and then we have innuendoes thrown across the floor.  Now, I say, in passing away from the slates, and without fear of contradiction, that Irish slates, of 16 inches by eight inches, are not on the market, and, if they are on the market, whoever has them for sale can have an order for 100,000.</P>
      <P>Is it not an extravagant statement for this youthful Deputy to get up here and say that there was less industrial production in Ireland when Fianna Fáil came into office than in any other country in the world?  He instanced Denmark among others.  Denmark had not just recovered from a national war of independence and a civil war.  I do not want to go over this ground &mdash; the sooner it is forgotten the better &mdash; but we had the innuendo in the Deputy's remark that the previous Government sat idle for ten years, and did nothing for industrial development, and that the country had to wait till a Fianna Fáil Government came into office to start industrial development.  Is it not to the credit of the previous Government that they established the fact that we can grow sugar beet in this country &mdash; as heavy a crop as anybody can grow in any country in the world &mdash; that we can grow it with as high a sugar content, I believe, as any country in the world?  That was not known until it was established by the experiments of 1925, which were so successful that the Cosgrave Government was prompted to establish the factory in Carlow, which was largely an experimental factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let us find out the depth of the intelligence of those who shout about 100 per cent. beet production.  I put this to the Minister, and I challenge him to refute it: that there is no country in the world that produces 100 per cent. of its sugar from beet, except those countries which have to do it as a military precaution.  England tried <Col N="392" /> it after the War, but had to stop it, except to about 30 per cent. &mdash; and why? Because it is too dear.  A man can afford certain luxuries according to his station in life, and a nation can do the same; but a nation cannot survive if it is to engage in industrial pursuits, and all at a loss.  Something must pay in order to make up for what has to be run at a loss, and while it would be sound economics in this country to produce about 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. of our sugar, it is decidedly not sound economics to attempt to produce 100 per cent. of our sugar.  Why?  It is for the reason that in no country in the world has sugar from beet been an economic success.  I challenge the Minister, when he is replying, to say where in the world the production of sugar from beet has been economically profitable, and where it had not to get some help from the Government.  The previous Government was wise in establishing the Carlow factory.  Of course, the criticism of the people opposite was that it was a white elephant.  The previous Government harnessed the Shannon, and that was a white elephant too; but these white elephants have become more numerous since the people who nicknamed them white elephants came to power.  Not only that, but they would try to make the country believe that they, and they alone, are responsible for those white elephants that have changed their colour and are now not white any longer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan suggested an industrial department or, I suppose, a subdivision of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to help the reclamation of land because, he said, it is our greatest asset.  Well, yes; it is very appropriate that we should have such a Department or sub-Department, and the first thing it would want to do would be to protect the land of this country from the ravages of the Minister for Agriculture.  We had development in tillage in the last few years, but what was it but agricultural robbery?  There was an extension of wheat-growing.  Will any member of this House stand up and say that tillage was increased in this country in the last six years on the lines of good husbandry?</P>

      <P>I just wanted to relate, Sir, as I have often related in this House, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there is no Minister in this House who should be more anxious to have a prosperous agriculture than the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because the products of the factories that he alleges have been started &mdash; I think they have gone into thousands now &mdash; have only one market, and that is the market that agriculture provides.  The reason that those factories are on short time to-day is because of the agricultural policy of the Government in the last six years, which has pauperised agriculture and left the agricultural community without the money to purchase the necessaries of life, as produced in these factories.  A pauperised agricultural community is no market for any product, and that is why you are on short time to-day, and why the industrial development that was taken up at the time by the Minister and rushed through was ill-advised and wrong, because at that time a double burden was placed upon agriculture &mdash; the burden of bearing industrial development and the burden of carrying on the economic war.  With agriculture impoverished, it is a very serious thing for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pursue his old policy, but of course he is not pursuing it. What had been told to the Minister in this House for six years he would not listen to; but when he went over to negotiate in London he was told it there, and he had to surrender.  Now we have, in our industrial framework in this country, the fact that before the Minister can impose a tariff he must submit it to the Prices Commission, and an Englishman can sit on that commission and show cause that that tariff puts the English out of court in competing in the Irish market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing. The Minister was warned here for the last six years not to impose wild tariffs. Personally, I remember putting up to the Minister, and I put it up to him now, as a convinced tariff reformer and protectionist for Irish industry all my life &mdash; and I think that is a bit longer than the Minister has been in the whirlwind of politics &mdash; that before any tariff is imposed on goods coming into this country there should be a survey of the conditions in the country sending the goods in here and the conditions for the making of similar products in this country.  Whatever advantage there is to the foreigner in the making of a product and sending it in here, a money figure should be fixed on that economic advantage that the foreigner has, and a tariff measured by that economic advantage would be justified. Then we have equal opportunities and, by the aid of that tariff, you put the Irishman competing with the foreigner for the trade in the Irish market.  That is substantially what the British Prime Minister put up to the Irish delegation and which the Irish delegation, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce, agreed to and signed.  You cannot get out of that.</P>

      <P>We shall be interested to hear from the Minister why he has tariffed agricultural implements, which are implements of production, and why we cannot get these implements when we go to the traders to secure them. They cannot secure them from the people who are supposed to make them.  The answer they get from the supposed makers of these implements is that they have not gone into production. We have heard about spades and shovels.  I visited a shovel factory not very long ago and gave an order for £20 worth of shovels and I could not sell them as scrap.  My men would not work with them &mdash; they could not work with them.  They would bend over like paper and you could bend them back again.  But, because of that, I do not say that we should not make shovels.  The spades also will bend backwards and forwards like a glove. Because of that, I do not say that we should not make them &mdash; I do not say we should stop in our attempt to make them.  But I do say that the Department of Industry and Commerce should not only protect an article as regards price, but should take some steps to ensure that the public will get fair average quality at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that by way of criticism of the Minister or his Department.  I am satisfied that the intention of the Minister was right, and that he would be one of the first to stop inferior articles being imposed on the public if he knew of them.  I suggest to the Minister, as part of his machinery for industrial development, that in addition to protective tariffs for keeping <Col N="397" /> out the foreign article, he should take some steps, and I am sure the proper steps will suggest themselves to the Minister and his advisers, to test the quality of the article that is being made here, so that people who may be opposed to Irish industry will not have an excuse for continuing their opposition and giving as a reason that the Irish article is no good.  I know several articles that are no good, but I do not condemn the Minister's policy of industrial development by the aid of protective tariffs because I know there are certain products that are not worth the money.  But the Minister should devise some machinery which will be a guarantee to the public that they will get something like value for their money and that will be a deterrent to people who want to get rich quickly by putting inferior articles on the market.  I suggest in all sincerity to the Minister that he should look after that aspect of his industrial programme.</P>
    <P>Generally, I am not only in sympathy with, but in whole-hearted support of industrial development carried out wisely and prudently. But there are many articles that we have always been getting in this country and that we should get when nature has endowed our country with the raw material for them.  We should work it and produce those articles. Amongst them are slates, and Irish slates we cannot get to-day.  I challenge the Minister to contradict that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Deputies on the Opposition Benches who spoke in the early part of this debate, I had formed the opinion that they had changed their attitude towards the industrialisation of this country, but as I listened to Deputy Hughes, I became disillusioned.  During the recent election I became accustomed to speeches being made all over the country misrepresenting the efforts of men who are endeavouring to start and develop Irish industries here.  Of course, I attributed that to the licence that the members of the Opposition evidently thought they were entitled to when they got on the hustings.  Listening to the debate this evening, I came <Col N="398" /> to the conclusion that some Deputies on the Opposition Benches were unfair to Irish industry.  Deputy Hughes condemned very many of the articles that are required on a tillage farm, such as ploughs, mowing and manuring machines, forks and the handles of forks.  I want to state that we in the County Meath have an industry which produces forks, and one which produces handles.  I want to say that these forks are excellently turned out.  I have heard the greatest praise for the material that is used in the handles. These handles are manufactured from seasoned timber, and they have not been turned out in the manner that Deputy Hughes would suggest.  I cannot sit here and listen to the slanders that were uttered concerning the efforts of those men who have invested their money in these industries, and who have been carrying them on so successfully.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputies opposite that the proper method of approaching this matter is this: that if they find a percentage of Irish manufactured articles, in the early stages after the establishment of an industry, are of inferior quality they should draw the attention of the Department of Industry and Commerce to it.  I know from experience that they are prepared to receive such reports and to see that the matters complained of are remedied.  I will go further and say that, so far as I know, the people who run industries here have no desire to impose any inferior article on the purchasing community.  I say that it is unfair to impute any such desire, such as we have heard from the opposite side, to them.  I say further that it is quite unfair to make an onslaught on industry in general here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton takes great pride in this, that the Opposition when in office established the Carlow beet factory. Whatever praise is due to them for that I am prepared to give it to them. Unless my memory is at fault, I think it was in the year 1927 that I heard Deputy Belton addressing a political meeting in my constituency and on my platform.  I heard him then condemn the Carlow beet factory as a white elephant.</P>

If he did that perhaps he would get an industry that would turn out a very efficient potato digger for him.</P>

I am glad that his statement has been refuted by Deputy Belton.  It is what I would expect from a man who knows the difference &mdash; from a man who has been engaged in the erection of houses, and I am thankful to Deputy Belton for that.  Listening to some Deputies, one would imagine that the Minister could start industries of his own accord, that he could come down and open industries in every town and village.  The Minister cannot start industries of his own accord.  He cannot use Government money, voted by the Dáil, for that purpose, nor can he nationalise <Col N="401" /> industries.  So far as the Opposition and the members of this Party are concerned, the policy is, I think, against the nationalisation of industries. Neither is the Minister disposed to bolster up inefficiency.  I do not think that Deputies on either side would stand for bolstering up inefficiency or for the raising of prices.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister, in his efforts to bring about the industrialisation of this country, has failed to awaken in the Opposition a sense of their duty towards their people.  Before I was interrupted, I had suggested that Deputy Belton should induce some of his friends to invest their money in Irish industries.  I suggest to members of the Opposition that they have an open field &mdash; a very extensive field &mdash; for their efforts in this connection.  We would welcome their help because Irish industry at the moment needs help if it is to be built up.  Now that we look for the awakening of a new civic spirit here, I do think that the efforts of the Opposition should be directed to helping out the industrial policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>I do charge the majority of the Opposition with keeping aloof. They did not give us the help we expected from them, and I hope to see a change.  We should join up to start a campaign not only to revive all the old industries in which Opposition Deputies claim to have such an interest, but to find the capital necessary for the starting of new industries.  The Minister cannot start them.  Industries will be started in the rural towns <Col N="402" /> only by the effort of people living in those towns or people outside prepared to take the initiative and put capital into these ventures.  The people of these towns need not be looking to the Minister.  The sooner they cease looking to the Minister the better for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The boot industry was mentioned in this debate.  We in County Meath have a boot industry which was established since we came into power. The amount of employment given has not been up to the standard we expected. We want to assist that industry in every possible way, and I suggest to the Minister that he should make investigations in connection with similar industries with a view to ascertaining if any alterations could be introduced and full advantage secured to the towns where these industries are established.  We in County Meath have got very efficient industries established since Fianna Fáil came into power.  I have been told by the men in charge of one industry &mdash; they are Scotsmen &mdash; that the people employed in that industry have attained a higher standard of efficiency in six months than workers in the corresponding factory across the water attain in a number of years. People with a tradition in that industry across the water have not the same standard of efficiency after years of experience as is achieved by Meath workers in six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other factory to which I made reference is not making the headway we expected, and we should like to find out the cause and see if it can be remedied.  We know that, under the operation of the Agreement arrived at with Great Britain, the Prices Commission will have a say in the fixing of prices.  However, the position will not be as stated by the Opposition &mdash; that the English manufacturer will be able to come in here and regulate matters to his own advantage.  That will not be the case.  Even before the Agreement was arrived at, it was frequently stated here by the Minister that it would be necessary for him, in the interest of Irish industry, in the interest <Col N="403" /> of the consumer, and in the interest of efficiency, to examine all these industries, that he could not stand for inefficiency whether due to mismanagement or to ignorance. Generally speaking, while I deprecate Departmental interference in any industry, I believe a watchful eye should be kept on these industries in their early years so that some help may be given to them.  It is not a matter of raising prices.  The Prices Commission will see to that matter, but it is a question of examining the position and keeping a close eye on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be converted in regard to one industry, but I should like to point out that there are some old industries the directors of which have not the initiative to instal the up-to-date machinery which is necessary to enable them to keep pace with modern conditions.  It is not the duty of the Minister to impose a tariff on the consuming public for the sake of bolstering up such an industry.  It is a great pity that these men do not fall into step with the industrial policy of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The work of the Minister's Department has been most successful, and I want to pay a compliment to the officials of that Department, particularly those in charge of the industrial policy, for the assistance they are giving those who are coming here to invest their money in Irish industry.  I have heard most favourable comments on the efficiency of the officials of the Minister's Department.  These comments came from men from England, Scotland and other countries who came here to discuss the possibilities of particular industries.  They have paid tribute to the earnestness, keenness and general knowledge of the officials who were dealing with these matters.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Estimate has wandered not so much over a wide field as in various directions. I was rather amazed by one of Deputy Kelly's statements.  If I contradict <Col N="404" /> him, of course it will be held that it is one of those things that cannot be proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have a bet with Deputy Kelly that there is more money invested in Irish industries by Deputies on this side of the House than there is by Deputies on the opposite side.  I do not think that very much weight can be attached to Deputy Kelly's statements at the end of his speech if we are to take as much notice of his compliments as of the statement to which I have referred.  As regards the statement that supporters of Deputies on these benches were still inclined to invest their money abroad and were in danger of losing it from falling dividends, I would say that amongst the new friends of the Minister for Finance, and amongst many supporters of the Government, there are just as many people who are anxious to invest their money abroad as there are amongst the supporters of the Party on these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way every debate develops here is rather remarkable.  From one side of the House we are told that everything the Minister does is right, that everything his Department does is perfect and any criticism of it, particularly as regards industry, we are told, is high treason, slander of Irish industry, sabotage and nothing else.  Mind you, I really think that there is one great lack at the moment amongst the general community and amongst the people who have commercial dealings with the new factories.  It might be to everybody's advantage, to the advantage of the Minister and to the advantage of the community in general, if people who have a grievance, over a question of the quality or a question of the price of the products of the new factories, took the matter up directly with the Minister.  The reason I say that is that I have come across one instance in very recent times in connection with an article produced here by a new factory which is entirely protected.  The import of the article in question is prohibited. I suppose that owing to the fact that <Col N="405" /> I do not use very much of these products I did not trouble very much about it, but the course the debate has taken here convinces me that the proper way to deal with these matters is to take them up directly with the Minister rather than criticise an article here.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any earthly justification for defending the policy of the Minister by the type of attack we had from Deputy Corry and other Deputies here.  When Deputy Hughes spoke he gave definite examples of where he thinks inefficiency or inefficient production has taken place in Irish industries.  It is not good enough for a Deputy of this House to get up afterwards and say that Deputy Hughes must be a bad farmer when he gives these examples or, when he questions the policy of the present Government in extending the beet factories, to suggest that he knows nothing about beet.  I think the Deputy who was challenged in that way is one of the pioneers of the beet industry in this country.  I do not think there can be any doubt about it.  Long before anybody on the Government Benches could see any good whatever in beet production, Deputy Hughes and his colleagues in Carlow were pioneers of the beet-sugar industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Another statement that rather amazed me came from a new Deputy. Several of his statements in fact amazed me.  One would think listening to Deputy Childers that the entire industrial future of this country was settled, that every industrial problem of this country has, already been settled and that all this has been done in the last six years.  He made his maiden speech here to-night and I am sure he made the same speech many times during the recent election.  He mentioned 117 factories.  I do not know if that figure has ever been investigated but it is a figure he mentioned time and again.  He could not remember the number of new factories started since 1932 but he complimented the Minister on providing in this country employment that would keep the people of the countryside at home during periods when there was very attractive employment available abroad or <Col N="406" /> when there was a great increase in employment abroad.  He spoke of the way in which the Department of Industry and Commerce had succeeded in stemming the evil of emigration.  If we take these statements at their face value, what are they worth?  The policy of the Department has not succeeded in stopping the tide of emigration. I say that, not because I want to score a debating point over the Department, but merely to show that there is absolutely no use getting up here saying that the question of emigration or unemployment has been solved or that anything more than the fringe of these problems has been touched upon in the last six years.</P>
    <P>He spoke about the provision of some reserves in this country in the case of war.  It would be very hard to say if agricultural production in this country is not going to be increased, what other branch of production could be increased to such an extent that it would benefit us in this country if there was a great war.  It is equally hard to see that the Deputy meant anything more than to get up and make a nice-sounding speech when he spoke of planned industry and of the people associated with planned industry. Personally I think that as far as discussions on industrial development are concerned, when we hear from the Government benches praise of industrial development, those Deputies should tell us what particular item they are referring to.  They get up and make wild statements about all the industrial problems that have been solved in the last six years, that everything is all right now, but that everything was all wrong for the previous ten years, but they never gave the details.</P>
    <P>Passing from that I should like to take one item in the Estimate that was mentioned previously, namely Sub-head L of the Estimate, dealing with minerals exploration.  I see that under that heading a sum of £5,500 is being provided for mineral exploration in the Carrickmacross-Kingscourt area.  Last year £3,000 was provided for that area and, apparently, this year the £2,000 not required for the Slieve Ardagh area goes up there. <Col N="407" /> Seeing that that money is being provided, and that we have not heard anything from the Minister of the value that is being given for this £5,500.  I wonder would it be worth while asking his consideration for a scheme of mineral exploration in my own constituency?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department will agree with me that, at least, there is a tradition of mineral exploration in that area, that there are certain outward visible signs in our constituency of mineral development at an earlier period and that in that area within the past 100 years there were coal mines.  Nobody seems to know at the present moment what the actual position of these coal mines is. Some people say that coal was never found there in sufficient quantities or of the required quality to make the working of the mines a commercial proposition.  Others say that experts were brought across by the then Government 70 or 80 years ago and that they reported adversely on the mines, that they did so deliberately and that they had no intention of giving a favourable report.</P>
    <P>At any rate, this sum of £5,000 is being provided for mineral exploration and it seems that it is all going to one particular area.  Amongst the older people in my constituency there are some who remember when coal was mined in the areas to which I refer. I mention the matter now in the hope that when the Minister is spending money on mineral exploration in this country he will sometime or other give the possibilities of this area some consideration, that he will have these mines inspected, at any rate, and tell us whether there are coal deposits in that area in sufficient quantities to make the working of them an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of what one might call popular outcry for it, because in various organs of the Press which circulate in that part of the country, we find occasionally articles by people who are apparently interested in Irish industry in which reference is made to these old coal fields. They are very hard on the various Deputies of that constituency as to <Col N="408" /> why nothing is being done about them, but I suggest to the Minister that if he is going to spend money, of whatever amount, on mineral exploration, a survey, even if it is only a surface survey, should sooner or later be made of the land in that area because there is a belief, particularly amongst the old people, that it was a rich coal-bearing area and that it would have been a commercial proposition but for the action of Government officials of a period of 70 or 80 years ago.  I think that particular area would have every claim for the spending in it of some of the money which the Minister proposes to spend, because I do not think we have suffered from over-industrialisation there.  With the exception of the beet factory in Mallow, I do not think we have any major industry in the area, except industries that were there prior to the advent of the Minister, such as the mills in Mallow and one or two other knitting industries.</P>
    <P>I would say that there is one feature of Irish industry that is not made perfectly clear to the public.  I saw recently in a publication &mdash; I think the name of it was &ldquo;Irish Industry&rdquo;&mdash; a list of a number of new industries floated in the last few years, and a very serious complaint was made.  No names were given &mdash; the industries were marked A., B. and C.  It was stated that these industries had been established under and were protected by quota restrictions and high tariffs, that Irish moneys had been invested in them, and that they had not yet succeeded in paying a dividend.  I think it will be found difficult to convince most of the people who buy articles manufactured here by companies which are protected by quota restrictions and high tariffs that these particular companies could not pay a dividend, because, rightly or wrongly, the impression is abroad that a certain section of the manufacturers of the country are taking advantage of high tariffs and quota restrictions to charge high prices and make excess profits.  I hope that the system of sending these matters before the Prices Commission and getting early decisions will be gone ahead with as speedily as possible.  I believe that every one of us could do a lot in this regard if, whenever we had a complaint <Col N="409" /> as to either quality or price, we brought it up as soon as possible and justified the criticism we make in this House and outside it by proving what we say here.  I believe it would be very helpful to Irish industry and its development if every one of us did that, whenever we felt that we had a grievance in respect of either quality or price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want briefly to direct the Minister's attention to the needs of my constituency and to ask him to consider the decentralisation of industry. I know that up to the present the Minister has kept in mind the decentralisation of industry, and has been establishing in different parts of the country, so far as lies in his power, the factories that are the product of the Fianna Fáil Administration; but I would impress on him the necessity for establishing as many of those factories as possible in places like County Mayo and districts like South Mayo and the Gaeltacht, where they are absolutely necessary.  It is unnecessary for me to point out to this House, or to the Minister, the conditions under which a great part of the community down there live, or to stress the fact that it is essential for the majority of the farmers' sons in the Gaeltacht areas of Mayo to migrate to earn a living and that employment of some kind is needed by those people.</P>
      <P>I do not for a moment criticise the policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce, because I think that Department has been the most successful of all the Government Departments, but I do ask the Minister carefully to consider the problems facing us in backward areas like County Mayo, and to divert factories that are about to be started to County Mayo, where the people are not able to live on the land on the small valuations which they have, and where you have farmers trying to eke out an existence on valuations of £3 and £4.  Owing to economic conditions, it is essential for their sons to go to other countries and other parts of this country to earn a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people in County Mayo, and particularly in South Mayo and the Gaeltacht areas there, cannot possibly exist on the land available there. These people are workers, and if there <Col N="410" /> were valuations sufficient to maintain families in South Mayo, they would live on the land; but it is not there.  The opportunities are not there, and these people have to try to make a living for themselves as best they can.  Only a very short time ago, we had a terrible tragedy involving people from that district who were forced to go to other countries to make a living.  Some of them from Achill lost their lives as a result of the economic conditions which forced them to leave the country to make a living elsewhere.  It is a bad system, and one which no Deputy could possibly hope to uphold.  It has, however, been the system for ages, and as a result, a number of people from County Mayo have lost their lives in another country.  That cannot, of course, be attributed in any degree to the Minister's Department, nor do I suggest for a moment that it is attributable to any Department or any policy in operation here; but I do ask the Minister to consider the necessity for the decentralisation of industry in this country.  The new industries should, as far as possible, be sent to those areas where there are migratory and unemployment problems; they should be sent to districts in which industries have not already been established. There is a possibility &mdash; I think a very strong possibility &mdash; of keeping those migrants at home.</P>
    <P>Various means have been suggested by different people whereby those migrants could be kept at home.  When that tragedy occurred in Scotland various remedies were suggested by the general public and by members of this House, but I think the best possible remedy would be to send more industries to the Gaeltacht areas, to congested areas like County Mayo, or any other area in which a migratory problem exists.  I am sure the Minister has done his best distributing those industries through the country.  Under the Minister's policy the towns and cities have got their fair share of the industries which have been established. I would appeal to the Minister to intensify the policy of distributing the industries amongst the rural areas, and in particular to intensify the policy of sending industries to areas which are <Col N="411" /> densely populated like my own constituency of South Mayo, so that in future those migrants will be able to find employment in their own country.</P>
    <P>I have heard it stated in this House to-day, particularly by the Labour Deputies, that proper measures have not been taken to deal with the unemployment problem here.  I certainly have to compliment the Minister on the fact that we had to wait until he came into power to see where the unemployment lay in this country.  We had to wait for the Minister to register as unemployed there people who, although they had occupation for a certain part of the year, were unemployed for three or four or five months.  I know that in my own constituency a great number of the people who are referred to in this House as &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; are not really unemployed in the strict sense of the term; they are people who are employed on their farms for perhaps six, eight or nine months of the year.  They are farmers' sons who are employed on the farms for six or nine months of the year, and who for the remaining months are registered at the employment exchanges as unemployed. Those people are now classified as &ldquo;unemployed.&rdquo;  Prior to the coming into office of this Government they were never so classified, and it is not a strictly correct description.  Those people are not unemployed; they are employed on their own holdings for six or nine months of the year.  The custom was that they migrated for probably three months of the year, and for the remaining nine months they had work on their own farms.  Through the policy of the Minister those people are now registered as unemployed.</P>
    <P>In my area the vast majority of the people registered as unemployed come within that category.  Formerly the custom was that those people would <Col N="412" /> migrate to Scotland or England to find work during the period when there was no employment for them on the farms. They are now in the position that they are registered in the employment exchanges, and ask the Minister to provide employment for them if possible during those remaining months.  They cannot really be classified as the unemployed of this country.  They are people with partial employment and those are the people in whose interests I appeal to the Minister, further to intensify his policy of decentralisation of industry.  In that way, those people who have only partial employment at the moment may be able to find work in their own areas.  I have been listening for some time to a certain amount of critisism of the Minister's policy, from the Opposition Benches and from the Labour Party.  I think that the most effective answer to the criticism, both from the Opposition and the Labour Party, is that a certain number of reasons have been given by the Irish people against those criticisms which have been made.</P>
