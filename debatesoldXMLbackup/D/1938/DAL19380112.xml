    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any official communications were received from the British Government respecting the Constitution of Eire other than the statements that appeared in the daily Press; and if he has any statement to make to the House on the reference made by the British Government to the effect that they were prepared to treat the Constitution as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative, except that the text of the statement made by the British Government and published in the Press of the 30th December was communicated to me beforehand.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I do not think that any statement is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether negotiations regarding the continuance or extension of the trade pact have taken place or are now in progress with representatives of the British Government; whether the British Government have intimated that they are prepared, on conditions, to repeal the measures imposing special duties on produce of Irish origin, and, if so, what these conditions are; further, if he is in a position to say that before any arrangement, having for its object the admission into this country free of duty of <Col N="2888" /> British manufactured goods, is concluded, the Dáil will be consulted in regard to the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) Negotiations for the continuance of the Trade Pact are now taking place.  No intimation of the kind referred to has been received from the British Government.</P>
      <P>(2) With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, in the event of any arrangement being made having for its object the admission into this country, free of duty, of British manufactured goods, it would be necessary for the Government to take cognisance of the provisions of Section 5 of Article 29 of the Constitution, under which every international agreement to which the State becomes a party shall be laid before Dáil Eireann.  The question whether that requirement would apply to an arrangement of the type referred to by the Deputy would depend on the precise nature and scope of the arrangement.</P>

      <P>The council have been very irregular in the repayment of loan instalments to the Commissioners of Public Works and they have been notified on several occasions that unless repayments are made punctually as instalments of loans fall due no further loans would be sanctioned.</P>
      <P>I am informed that a sum of £876 is in arrear in respect of payments due to the Commissioners of Public Works in November last.  I am not therefore in a position to sanction further borrowing.</P>

      <Col N="2893" /> For the years 1934 and 1935 interest was charged to the Society at the rate of 4½ per cent.  There was no repayment of capital in 1934, and the repayment in 1935 was £1,000 in respect of the building loan and £5,000 in respect of the compensation loan.</P>
    <P>For the years 1936 and 1937 interest was charged to the Society on both loans at 4 per cent. per annum, and the capital repayments were calculated on the basis of a funding scheme under which the amount of the loans would be repaid in 25 years with interest at 4 per cent. per annum.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. A grant of £15,228 10s. 0d.:&mdash; was notified on 31st July, 1937.  An application for an increase in the grant was subsequently received and is still under investigation.  As regards the second part of the question, I am prepared to allow the improvements to be carried out when certain amendments of the plans suggested to the hospital authorities are provided for and the conditions agreed to.  As regards the last part of the question I will send the Deputy a copy of the letter sent to the hospital on the 31st July, 1937, which sets out the conditions of the grant.</P>

      <P>I have no objection.</P>
      <P>Following is a copy of the reply referred to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reply by Minister for Justice to representations made by Gárda Síochána <Col N="2900" /> Representative Bodies on the subject of pay and allowances.</P>
    <P>(Conveyed by Departmental minute dated 10th January, 1938, to Commissioner.)</P>
    <P Just="Center">PAY.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot accept the suggestion that the rates of pay of the Gárda Síochána or of any other class of State servants should be determined mainly by reference to the rates payable in corresponding services in other countries.  In determining appropriate rates of pay for the Gárda Síochána, regard must be had, <i>inter alia</i>, to the standard of remuneration of other classes of State servants, and to the financial resources of the State.  In the light of the relevant considerations, the Minister is unable to agree that, in the existing circumstances, the rates and scales of pay of the various ranks of the Gárda Síochána are inadequate.</P>
    <P>When the first Statutory Order fixing rates and scales of pay for the Gárda Síochána was being made in 1924, an explanatory memorandum was issued for the information of the force. It was pointed out in this memorandum that the scales previously in operation (commonly referred to as the Desborough scales) could be regarded as applicable only during a period while the increase in the cost of living (above pre-war) varied from 100 at the lower limit to 130 at the upper limit.  The cost-of-living figure had for a considerable time previously been less than 100 (above pre-war), and was then about 80-85.  The &ldquo;Desborough scales&rdquo; were accordingly adjusted to meet this reduction in the cost of living, the adjustment being made on the basis upon which the remuneration of civil servants is adjusted to meet variations in the cost of living.  The scales of pay for chief superintendents, superintendents and inspectors were similarly adjusted.</P>
    <P>The memorandum further stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not proposed that the rates of pay of the force should be subject to variation to meet trifling or temporary fluctuations in the cost of living and the rates now proposed are based on a cost-of-living figure of 85 <Col N="2901" /> (above pre-war), and are intended to be applicable while the cost-of-living figure varies from 70 at the lower limit to 100 at the higher limit (above pre-war).  These rates will accordingly be subject to readjustment if the cost-of-living figure passes outside that range.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Existing scales were accordingly fixed on the basis of a cost-of-living figure of 85 (above pre-war), and were expressed to be applicable while the cost-of-living figure did not move outside the range 70-100 (above pre-war).  At no time since these rates were fixed has the cost-of-living figure reached the maximum of that range.  In fact, from 1931 to 1937 the cost-of-living figure was always below 70 (above pre-war), but notwithstanding this fact, the appropriate reductions were not made in the scales of pay of the force.</P>
    <P>The Minister considers that the basis on which existing scales of pay were fixed for the force was reasonable and equitable, and accordingly he cannot accept any proposal that these scales should be revised in an upward direction while the cost-of-living figure does not exceed 100 (above pre-war).  He also feels bound to reject very strongly the suggestion that these scales furnish any justification for any member of the force becoming financially embarrassed or not carrying out his duty with zeal and efficiency.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ALLOWANCES.</P>
    <P>The Minister has obtained the sanction of the Minister for Finance for the restoration of a boot allowance to members of the force below officer ranks as from the end of the present financial year.  This allowance will be at the rate of £2 per annum.  A draft allowances order to give effect to this proposal will be prepared in due course.</P>
    <P>The Minister is prepared to give full consideration to the representations made as to the inadequacy of the rates of rent allowances payable to married members who are not provided with official quarters, but he desires to be provided with more detailed information as to the exact position in this matter, and a separate communication will be addressed to you on this subject at an early date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2902" /> The Minister is unable to accept the view that any good case exists for an increase in the existing rates of the other allowances payable, which he regards as adequate for the purposes which they are intended to cover.</P>

Certain repairs and improvements to make the present premises more comfortable are receiving the board's consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The answers to the first two parts of the question are in the affirmative.  Representations for increased remuneration have been made to me on occasions by or on behalf of individual clerks.  The payment of salaries instead of fees was introduced in 1931 following a recommendation by the Committee on Old Age Pensions, which reported in 1925, and the salaries fixed were equivalent to the average annual amounts (rounded up to the nearest 2s. 6d.) paid in fees to the clerks during the three-year period&mdash;1st April, 1925, to 31st March, 1928.  Under the basis adopted the salaries were directly related to the amount of work required of the clerks, and no considerations have been brought forward which would indicate that the present scale of remuneration is not a reasonable one.</P>

There is no change whatever under Standing Order 51.  The terms &ldquo;Deputy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teachtai&rdquo; remain just as before.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask another question.  The Prime Minister is described in the Constitution as the Prime Minister.  I take it that there is nothing in the Standing Orders which requires Deputies to use the word &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; for &ldquo;Prime Minister,&rdquo; and that when speaking English they <Col N="2940" /> can say &ldquo;Prime Minister,&rdquo; and when speaking Irish they can use &ldquo;Taoiseach.&rdquo;  I take it that is the rule.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the following be the rules in accordance with which the election of the appeal committee provided for in Section 13 of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937, shall be regulated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Chairman of Dáil Eireann or in his absence the Deputy Chairman of Dáil Eireann shall be the returning officer for the purpose of the election.</P>
      <P>2.  A member of Dáil Eireann being a candidate for election shall be nominated in writing and such written nomination shall be subscribed by one member of Dáil Eireann, who has signed the roll of members of Dáil Eireann, as proposer, and by another such member as seconder.</P>
      <P>3.  Each candidate shall be nominated by a separate nomination paper, and the nomination paper shall be in the form set out in Part II of the Schedule hereto, and shall contain the particulars required thereby.</P>
      <P>4.  The returning officer shall cause nomination papers to be supplied to any member applying for the same on any week day after the passing of this resolution and before 12 noon on Monday, the 17th January, 1938, which period is herein referred to as the &ldquo;time for election.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>5.  Nomination papers shall be delivered to the returning officer or to such other person as he may appoint for the purpose by the proposer or seconder during such hours, and at such places, during the time for election, as the returning officer may fix, but not after the expiration of the time for election.</P>
      <P>6.  The returning officer may reject as invalid any nomination paper which does not comply with the requirements of this resolution or which purports to nominate a person who is not qualified to be elected.</P>
      <P>7.  Any candidate duly nominated may by notice in writing, signed by him and delivered to the returning officer, withdraw his nomination at any time before the expiration of the time for election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2942" /> 8a.  If not more than 15 candidates stand duly nominated at the expiration of the time for election, the returning officer shall thereupon declare such candidates to be elected to the appeal committee, and shall give notice of the result of the election by declaring to Dáil Eireann the names of the members elected.</P>
    <P>8b.  If more than 15 candidates stand duly nominated, a ballot shall be taken in accordance with these rules.</P>
    <P>9.  The voting shall be by secret ballot.</P>
    <P>10.  The voting paper shall be in the form set out in Part II of the Schedule hereto, and the names of candidates nominated shall be arranged alphabetically in the order of their surnames.</P>
    <P>11.  The voting shall take place at a sitting of Dáil Eireann during the hours and on a day (not being later than the fifth day on which Dáil Eireann shall have met after the commencement of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937) to be fixed by Dáil Eireann (which hours are hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;time for voting&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>12.  As soon as may be, after the commencement of such sitting the returning officer shall cause one voting paper to be handed to each member present at such sitting.</P>
    <P>13.  Any member who may inadvertently spoil a voting paper may deliver it to the returning officer and obtain another voting paper.</P>
    <P>14.  At or before the conclusion of the time for voting each member shall deliver his voting paper to the returning officer.</P>
    <P>15.  The returning officer shall cause the voting papers to be counted and the result of the election determined in accordance with the rules contained in Part I of the Schedule hereto.</P>
    <P>16.  The returning officer shall give notice of the result of the election by declaring to Dáil Eireann the names of the members elected.  He shall also cause to be displayed in some convenient place a statement giving the particulars required by Rule 12, in Part I of the Schedule hereto.</P>

    <P>18.  This resolution may be cited as the Appeal Committee Election Resolution, 1938.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Part I.</P>
    <P>1.  The election shall be conducted in accordance with the following rules:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">Method of Voting.</P>
    <P>2.  (1) Every elector shall have one transferable vote.</P>
    <P>(2) An elector in giving his vote&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  must place on his voting paper the figure 1 opposite the name of the candidate for whom he votes;</P>
    <P>(b) may in addition place on his voting paper the figure 2 or the figures 2 and 3, or 2, 3, and 4, and so on opposite the names of the other candidates in the order of his preference.</P>
    <P>3.  The forms contained in Part II of this Schedule, or forms to the like effect, shall be used for the purposes to which they are expressed to be applicable.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Invalid Voting Papers.</P>
    <P>4.  A voting paper shall be invalid and not counted&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) on which the figure 1 standing alone, indicating a First Preference for some one candidate, is not placed; or</P>
    <P>(b)  on which the figure 1 standing alone, indicating a first preference, is set opposite the name of more than one candidate; or</P>
    <P>(c)  on which the figure 1 standing alone, indicating a first preference, and some other number is set opposite the name of the same candidate; or</P>
    <P>(d)  which is unmarked, or void for uncertainty.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Arrangement and counting of Voting Papers.</P>
    <P>5.  (1) The returning officer shall reject any voting papers that are invalid.  The returning officer shall <Col N="2944" /> then ascertain the number of first preferences recorded on the voting papers for each candidate, and shall then arrange the candidates on a list (hereinafter called &ldquo;the order of preferences&rdquo;) in the order of the number of first preferences recorded for each candidate, beginning with the candidate for whom the greatest number of first preferences are recorded.  If the number of first preferences recorded for any two or more candidates (hereinafter called &ldquo;equal candidates&rdquo;) is equal, the returning officer shall ascertain the number of second preferences recorded on all the voting papers for each of the equal candidates, and shall arrange the equal candidates as amongst themselves on the order of preferences in the order of the second preferences recorded for each such candidate, beginning with the candidate for whom the greatest number of second preferences is recorded.  If the number of first and second preferences recorded for any two or more equal candidates is equal, the returning officer shall, in like manner, ascertain the number of third preferences recorded on all the voting papers for each of such equal candidates, and arrange such candidates on the order of preferences accordingly, and so on until all the candidates are arranged in order on the order of preferences.  If the number of first, second, third, and all other preferences recorded for any two or more equal candidates is equal, the returning officer shall determine by lot the order in which such candidates are to be arranged on the order of preferences.</P>
    <P>The returning officer shall then cause the valid voting papers to be arranged in parcels, according to the first preferences recorded for each candidate.</P>
    <P>(2) For the purpose of facilitating the processes prescribed by these rules, each valid voting paper shall be deemed to be of the value of 1,000.</P>
    <P>(3) The returning officer shall count the number of papers in each parcel, and in accordance with sub-section</P>
    <P>(2) of this rule credit each candidate <Col N="2945" /> with the value of the valid papers on which a first preference has been recorded for such candidate.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Ascertainment of Quota.</P>
    <P>6.  The returning officer shall then add together the values in all the parcels and divide the total value by a number exceeding by one the number of vacancies to be filled.  The result increased by one, any fractional remainder being disregarded, shall be the number sufficient to secure the return of the candidate. This number is herein called the &ldquo;quota.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">Candidates with Quota Deemed Elected.</P>
    <P>7.  If at the end of any count or at the end of the transfer of any parcel or sub-parcel of an excluded candidate the value credited to a candidate is equal to or greater than the quota, that candidate shall be deemed to be elected.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Transfer of Surplus.</P>
    <P>8.  (1) If at the end of any count the value credited to a candidate is greater than the quota, the surplus shall be transferred in accordance with the provisions of this rule to the continuing candidate or candidates indicated on the voting papers in the parcel or sub-parcel of the elected candidate, according to the next available preferences recorded thereon.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) If the value credited to an elected candidate arises out of original votes only, the returning officer shall examine all the papers in the parcel of the selected candidate, whose surplus is to be transferred, and shall arrange the transferable papers in sub-parcels according to the next available preferences recorded thereon, and shall make a separate sub-parcel of the non-transferable papers.</P>
    <P>(b)  If the value credited to an elected candidate arises out of original and transferred votes, or of transferred votes only, the returning officer shall examine the papers contained in the sub-parcel last received by the elected candidate, and shall arrange the transferable papers therein in further sub-parcels according <Col N="2946" /> to the next available preferences recorded thereon and shall make a separate sub-parcel of the non-transferable papers.</P>
    <P>(c) In either of the cases referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) in this sub-section, the returning officer shall ascertain the number of papers and their total value in each sub-parcel of transferable papers and in the sub-parcel of non-transferable papers.</P>
    <P>(3)  If the surplus is equal to or greater than the total value of the papers in the sub-parcels of transferable papers, the returning officer shall transfer each sub-parcel of transferable papers to the continuing candidate indicated thereon as the voter's next available preference, each paper being transferred at the value at which it was received by the candidate whose surplus is being transferred.</P>
    <P>When the surplus is greater than the total value of the sub-parcels of transferable papers the non-transferable papers shall be set aside as not effective, at a value which is equal to the difference between the surplus and the value of the sub-parcels of transferable papers.</P>
    <P>(4)  If the surplus is less than the total value of the transferable papers the returning officer shall transfer each paper in such sub-parcel of transferable papers to the continuing candidate indicated thereon as the voter's next available preference, and the value at which each paper shall be transferred shall be ascertained by dividing the surplus by the total number of transferable papers, fractional remainders being disregarded, except that the consequential loss of value shall be noted on the result sheet.</P>
    <P>(5) A surplus which arises on the completion of any count shall be dealt with before a surplus which may arise at a subsequent count.</P>
    <P>When two or more surpluses arise out of the same count the largest shall be first dealt with and the others shall be dealt with in the order of their magnitude.</P>
    <P>If two or more candidates have an equal surplus arising out of the same count, the surplus of the candidate <Col N="2947" /> credited with the greatest value at the earliest count at which the values credited to these candidates were unequal shall be first dealt with.</P>
    <P>Where the values credited to such candidates were equal at all counts, the returning officer shall deal first with the surplus of the candidate recorded in the order of preferences as having received the greatest number of first preferences.</P>
    <P>9.  (1) If at the end of any count no candidate has a surplus and one or more vacancies remain unfilled, the returning officer shall exclude the candidate credited with the lowest value and shall transfer his papers to the continuing candidate or candidates indicated on the voting papers in the parcel or sub-parcels of the excluded candidate as the voter's next available preference, and shall credit the continuing candidate or candidates with the value of the papers transferred.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) The parcel containing original votes shall first be transferred, the transfer value of each paper being one thousand.</P>
    <P>(b) The sub-parcels containing transferred votes shall then be transferred in the order in which and at the value of which the excluded candidate obtained them.</P>
    <P>(c) For the purpose of determining whether a candidate is a continuing candidate the transfer of each parcel or sub-parcel shall be regarded as a separate count.</P>
    <P>(3) In the transfer of each parcel or sub-parcel a separate sub-parcel shall be made of the non-transferable papers which shall be set aside at the value at which the excluded candidates obtained them.</P>
    <P>(4) (a) If, when a candidate has to be excluded under this rule, two or more candidates are each credited with the same value and are lowest, regard shall be had to the total value of original votes credited to each of those candidates, and the candidate with the smallest total value shall be <Col N="2948" /> excluded, and where the total values are equal, regard shall be had to the total value credited to those candidates at the earliest count at which they had unequal values, and the candidate with the smallest value at that count shall be excluded.</P>
    <P>(b) If two or more candidates are lowest and are each credited with the same value at all counts, the returning officer shall exclude the candidate recorded on the order of preferences as having received the smallest number of first preferences.</P>
    <P>10.  Whenever any transfer is made under any of these preceding rules, each sub-parcel of papers transferred shall be placed on top of the parcel or sub-parcel, if any, of papers of the candidate to whom the transfer is made, and that candidate shall be credited with the value ascertained in pursuance of these rules.</P>
    <P>11.  (1) If at the end of any count the number of selected candidates is equal to the number of vacancies to be filled, no further transfers shall be made.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) When the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of vacancies remaining unfilled, the continuing candidates shall thereupon be deemed to be elected.</P>
    <P>(b) When only one vacancy remains unfilled and the value credited to some one continuing candidate exceeds the total of the values credited to the other continuing candidates, together with any surplus not transferred, that candidate shall thereupon be deemed to be elected.</P>
    <P>(3) When the last vacancies can be filled under this rule, no further transfers shall be made.</P>
    <P>12.  The returning officer shall record the total of the values credited to each candidate at the end of every count.  Such record shall include&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the value of the non-transferable papers not effective, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the loss of value owing to disregard of fractions,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2949" /> and may be in accordance with the form set out in Part II of this Schedule, or in a form to the like effect.</P>
    <P>13.  In these rules&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The expression &ldquo;continuing candidate&rdquo; means any candidate not deemed to be, elected and not excluded.</P>
    <P>(2)  The expression &ldquo;first preference&rdquo; means the &ldquo;figure 1&rdquo; standing alone; the expression &ldquo;second preference&rdquo; means the &ldquo;figure 2&rdquo; standing alone in succession to &ldquo;figure 1,&rdquo; and the expression &ldquo;third preference&rdquo; means the &ldquo;figure 3&rdquo; standing alone in succession to the figures &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo; set opposite the name of any candidate, and so on.</P>
    <P>(3)  The expression &ldquo;next available preference&rdquo; means a second or subsequent preference recorded in consecutive numerical order for a continuing candidate, the preference next in order on the voting paper for candidates already deemed to be elected or excluded being ignored.</P>
    <P>(4)  The expression &ldquo;transferable paper&rdquo; means a voting paper on which following a first preference a second or subsequent preference is recorded in numerical order for a continuing candidate.</P>
    <P>(5)  The expression &ldquo;non-transferable paper&rdquo; means a voting paper on which no second or subsequent preference is recorded for a continuing candidate:</P>
    <P>Provided that a paper shall be deemed to have become a non-transferable paper whenever&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the names of two or more candidates (whether continuing or not) are marked with the same number, and are next in order of preference; or</P>
    <P>(b)  the name of the candidate next in order of preference (whether continuing or not) is marked&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by a number not following <Col N="2950" /> consecutively after some other number on the voting paper; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  by two or more numbers;</P>
    <P>(c)  it is void for uncertainty.</P>
    <P>(6)  The expression &ldquo;original vote&rdquo; in regard to any candidate means a vote derived from a voting paper on which a first preference is recorded for that candidate.</P>
    <P>(7)  The expression &ldquo;transferred vote&rdquo; in regard to any candidate means a vote derived from a voting paper on which a second or subsequent preference is recorded for that candidate.</P>
    <P>(8)  The expression &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; means the number by which the total value of the votes, original and transferred, credited to any candidate, exceeds the quota.</P>
    <P>(9)  The expression &ldquo;count&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  all the operations involved in the counting of the first preferences recorded for candidates; or</P>
    <P>(b)  all the operations involved in the transfer of the surplus of an elected candidate; or</P>
    <P>(c)  all the operations involved in the transfer of the votes of an excluded candidate.</P>
    <P>(10)  The expression &ldquo;deemed to be elected&rdquo; means deemed to be elected for the purpose of counting, but without prejudice to the declaration of the result of the election.</P>
    <P>(11)  The expression &ldquo;determined by lot&rdquo; in Rule 5 means determined in accordance with the following directions&mdash;</P>
    <P>The names of the candidates concerned having been written on similar slips of paper, and the slips having been folded so as to prevent identification and mixed and drawn at random, the candidates concerned shall as amongst themselves be arranged on the order of preferences in the order in which the slips containing their names are drawn, be ginning with the candidate whose name is on the slip drawn first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is entitled an Act to amend and extend the Unemployment Assistance Acts. The principal amendment, however, as Deputies who have read the Bill will have noted, is to provide for a variation <Col N="2954" /> in the rates of unemployment assistance payable in the various areas provided for in the original legislation. Some time ago the Government came to the decision that it was possible to effect an increase in these rates, having regard to the general financial position and in particular to the diminution in the cost of unemployment assistance which has been noted during the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of emigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided that it would be possible to make available a fairly substantial sum-for that purpose, particularly if a call was made upon the resources of the Unemployment Insurance Fund and a further contribution towards the cost of unemployment assistance was obtained from certain of the local authorities.  When Deputies come to consider the Schedule to this Bill, the question to bear in mind is whether the method of distributing the funds between the various classes of people entitled to unemployment assistance is the most equitable.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to increase the unemployment assistance rates must, of course, take into account the cost of the additional provision made.  It is somewhat difficult to give an accurate estimate as to the probable cost of any change because, of course, the total charge for unemployment assistance varies from year to year and may be affected by sudden changes of one kind or another in the general economic condition.  I stated some time ago that it was intended to make available from all sources a sum of, approximately, £150,000 for the purpose of increasing the unemployment assistance rates payable.  It is, however, to be noted that mention of any figure of that kind must be related to the circumstances of a particular period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be said that if the rates now proposed were in operation during the past year the cost of unemployment assistance would have been so much higher.  If these rates had been in operation during 1935 the cost would have been still higher.  But it is less easy to say precisely what the <Col N="2955" /> effect of the higher rates will be upon the total cost of unemployment assistance in the coming year.  I anticipate that the diminution in unemployment which has been noticeable for some years past will continue in the present year and, consequently, the total charge for unemployment assistance, whatever the rates, will be less in this year than in the past year or would have been if similar rates of unemployment assistance were payable.  Certain changes of plans have been made but so far as it is possible to forecast at present, the additional expense which will arise by reason of the change in the unemployment assistance rates proposed will, in the present year, cost about £126,000.  Deputies will, of course, take that figure with the reservation I have indicated.  It is proposed to obtain that sum partly from the Unemployment Insurance Fund and partly by increased contributions from the county boroughs and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and the balance from the Exchequer.  The Unemployment Insurance Fund is capable of contributing a further £50,000. Despite the fact that £250,000 a year has been taken from that fund for the purpose of unemployment assistance during the past years, the deficit existing in it has been wiped out and there is at present a surplus in the fund.  It is anticipated that the excess of contributions over payments will continue in the future at such a figure as will enable this additional £250,000 to be contributed.  The county boroughs and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire however bring in £120,000. Therefore, our estimate of the total unemployment assistance cost in the coming financial year on the Exchequer will have to bear a charge of about £55,000 over and above the charge which would have arisen if the proposed changes in the rates were not made.  It is, of course, to be anticipated that if our expectations concerning the trend of unemployment and employment are not realised and that there should be demands on the Unemployment Assistance Fund in excess of the estimate, the full cost of the excess will have to be borne by the Exchequer.  I think we are justified <Col N="2956" /> in the present circumstances in quoting these figures.</P>
    <P>I know that the announcement of the intention of the Government to introduce this legislation caused some misgiving in many quarters.  But having regard to all the circumstances, I think that the provision of an additional sum for unemployment assistance for the purpose of increasing the rates of unemployment assistance provided by law is justified.  Our unemployment assistance rates here were never what one might describe as on the generous side, and although the unemployment assistance scheme involved the creation of a new and very expensive service and, consequently, the imposition of a substantial amount of additional taxation upon the public we never felt, and, I am sure, the majority of the members of the Dáil never thought, that the provision made represented what might be regarded as adequate to meet the circumstances of all the unemployed persons in the country.</P>
    <P>The new schedule which will replace the old schedule provides for an increase in the rates payable, except in the case of one class.  It is proposed to leave unchanged the rate of unemployment assistance payable in the rural areas and in the small towns to single men without dependents.  It is, I think, generally believed that the present rate payable to such persons is not inadequate, and in any event, Deputies are aware that such persons are excluded from receiving unemployment assistance at all for the greater portion of each year.  It was felt, however, that no undue hardship would be caused by leaving that rate unchanged.  Any reduction in expenditure or any reduction in cost which decisions of that kind made possible are, of course, being availed of to effect in certain other rates increases higher than would otherwise be possible.</P>
    <P>I may mention that the Government approached the consideration of this question on the basis of the distribution equitably of the amount of money which they consider should be made available. Deputies should approach the consideration of the schedule on the same basis.  I know it may be contended in some quarters that the rates of assistance here provided are still unduly low. <Col N="2957" /> That is a case which it is very easy to make, and a case which is perhaps very difficult to answer.  The only answer to it is that the provision of £1,250,000 a year for unemployment assistance represents the maximum contribution which the Government can make to that service having regard to the charges which fall upon the Exchequer and which, consequently, must be met by the taxpayer in respect of other social services, and the charges for the financing of relief works and services of that kind.  It is, of course, not possible to provide for a further increase in the rates of unemployment assistance without at the same time imposing an additional charge upon the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to endeavour to strike a balance between the requirements of the unemployed and the resources of the country and to ensure that while meeting, so far as may be, the obligations of the State to its unemployed citizens, the burden imposed upon commerce and industry is not so unduly heavy as, in itself, to aggravate the problem with which this service is designed to deal.</P>

I invite Deputies who think that these rates are still unduly low and who propose to urge that they be further increased to give us, at the same time, the benefit of their views as to what additional taxes should be imposed to get the revenue that would be required if their proposals were to be accepted.</P>

      <P>If I did not do it, I realised the weakness of my position and I am quite certain the public realised the weakness of my position. If Deputies opposite do not do that, I hope they will appreciate that the weakness of their position will be equally apparent.  Other changes are, of course, being effected by this Bill, some of which are important.  One of these relates to the rate of unemployment <Col N="2958" /> assistance payable in the urban areas.  As Deputies are aware, the original Act provided for three separate rates of unemployment assistance:&mdash; (1) the highest rate, which was payable in the county boroughs and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire; (2) the intermediary rate, payable in other towns exceeding 7,000 population, according to the previous census and (3) the lowest rate, payable in rural areas and in the smaller towns.  Since the original Act came into operation, another census has been taken and that census showed variations in the populations of certain towns.  One town&mdash; the town of Cobh&mdash;which had exceeded 7,000 population in 1926 and where, consequently, the intermediary rate applied, had in 1936 fallen below the 7,000 figure.  Another town&mdash;Ballina&mdash; which had in 1926 been below the 7,000 figure has since advanced above it.  We are proposing, in order to deal with that situation, that after consultation with the urban authorities of these areas, we may either effect a change or leave the position unchanged.  In the case of Cobh, a decision will be made, after consultation with the local authority, as to whether the town will continue to make the contribution from its rates which the original Act provides for and, consequently, secure the payment of the intermediary rate of assistance to its unemployed, or not. Similarly, in the case of Ballina, a decision will be made, after consultation with the local authority, as to whether the existing position will continue unchanged or whether the intermediary rate will become payable following the making of the necessary contribution from the rates by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We decided, however, that it was possible to go further than that.  Consequently, there is introduced in this Bill a proposal which makes it possible to extend to any town with local government the intermediary rate of unemployment assistance, subject to the making of the required contribution from the rates by the local authority.  We think that that is a reasonable provision.  As Deputies are aware, there are certain anomalies in the case of towns of equal size and similarly circumstanced, in some of <Col N="2959" /> which unemployment assistance is payable at a higher rate than in others. We are making it possible by this provision to remove these anomalies and to bring those towns, which are at present not regarded as urban areas for the purpose of the principal Act, within that provision, after consultation with the local authority and with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  In quite a number of those towns which are at present not within the definition of &ldquo;urban area&rdquo; under the principal Act, there will be a desire on the part of the local authority to come within that definition, make a contribution from the rates and, consequently, secure the payment of unemployment assistance at the higher rate to unemployed persons residing there.</P>
    <P>The other changes which the Bill proposes are of no special significance. The need for amendment of the law in one or two respects became obvious during the process of administration, and advantage is being taken of this Bill to effect the necessary changes. Certain changes are made in Section 7 in consequence of the adoption of the Limerick City Management Act, 1934, and Section 8 includes a provision which administration has shown to be necessary, to make it possible for an employer who aids and abets a person in his employment to commit an offence under the Unemployment Assistance Act to be prosecuted.  The existing Act contains no such provision, and persons who, in our opinion, should have been prosecuted for aiding and abetting other persons in committing an offence have, consequently, escaped punishment.  These, however, are minor matters.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to increase the rates of unemployment assistance.  I ask the Dáil to pass the Bill.  I hope I shall be able to secure the co-operation of the various Parties in enacting the measure during the present week.  If any difficulty should arise in that regard, I should regret it.  If it is desired to have any amendments considered, we shall, I am sure, get the co-operation of the Chair in making arrangements to that end. Subject to whatever the attitude of <Col N="2960" /> other Parties may be, I should like to get the Bill enacted this week.  It may not provide for the unemployed rates of assistance as high as those certain Deputies would advocate or profess their desire to see, but it does provide for increased payments, and the sooner those increases come into operation the better it will be from the point of view of unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, to be emphasised that the Government does not regard the provision of unemployment assistance as a solution of our unemployment problem.  The unemployment assistance scheme was instituted merely to ensure that there would be some measure of protection against destitution while long-term plans for the provision of work or the development of industry were being brought into operation.  It is much better that the problem of unemployment should be dealt with by the provision of work than by the provision of financial assistance.  We realised, however, from the beginning that however extensive our works programme might be, it could not possibly be so organised as to make available in every area employment capable of meeting exactly the employment needs of that area, and varying from time to time as these needs varied and, consequently, that it was necessary to put behind any works programme that might be attempted some scheme of this nature which would permit of the direct payment of financial assistance to unemployed persons in need of such assistance, varied in accordance with their needs.  There are a very large number of separate rates provided for in the Schedule.  They represent an attempt to adjust the financial assistance made available by the Bill to the varying needs of different families according to their circumstances.  It would be possible to have a still larger number of separate rates, because even the number provided for in the Schedule do not cover all possible circumstances, but they do, on the whole, fairly provide for the adjustment of the State's contribution to the needs of unemployed persons in direct relation to their family circumstances.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be a mark of progress if the amount payable in unemployment <Col N="2961" /> assistance diminishes, and particularly if that diminution can be directly attributed to the provision of more work.  I have mentioned that the amount provided for unemployment assistance in each financial year since the scheme was adopted has shown a steady reduction.  That reduction may be attributed to a number of causes; but one, at least, of the principal causes is the increase in employment, an increase which is capable of statistical demonstration beyond a shadow of doubt.  We trust that that increase in employment will continue and that the amount which has to be provided for the unemployment assistance service will continue to diminish.  Of course, upward variations in the rates of assistance will arrest any such tendency, but even having regard to the higher rates which it is proposed to provide in this measure, it is still possible to contemplate a lower provision for unemployment assistance in future years.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give the House some information as to the basis of this new addition to the expenses of local authorities?  The rate on local authorities in respect of unemployment assistance was 1/6, and it is now being made 1/8.  That is something like an increase of 11 per cent.  Has the Minister any estimate in respect of the bringing in of urban authorities to whom the Act may be extended by order as to the amount that will come in from local authorities under this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us what was the basis on which they fixed this extra 2d., this extra 11 per cent.?  If I took the Minister's figures correctly, the State's increased contribution is approximately £55,000 and in round figures, we may say that the State's contribution towards unemployment assistance and expenses generally <Col N="2962" /> is in the neighbourhood of £1,100,000. Am I right in that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the increase in the State's contribution is 5 per cent., while the increase in the local authorities' contribution is 11 per cent.  An increase of £55,000 on £1,100,000 is 5 per cent.  That is easily calculated.  An increase of 2d. on 1/6 is one-ninth, which is equally easily calculated as 11 per cent.</P>

      <P>When I said that it is estimated that the State will have to pay £55,000 additional in this year because of the adoption of this measure, we contemplate a reduction in the number of persons receiving unemployment assistance this year.  We think that the number will be less than last year.  If that estimate should prove to be wrong, if the number receiving unemployment assistance this year is the same as, or higher than, the number last year, the whole of the difference will be paid by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the Government's contribution in this case is increased by 5 per cent. and that of local authorities by 11 per cent.  We start off from that.  Could the Minister give the House any information as to the basis on which they made those calculations, or as to any data which he had before him when making up the costs of this and how they were apportioned, and whether the conditions prevailing in local authorities were taken into account, when this was being considered, or if it is simply an arbitrary increase?  It would perhaps tend towards a restriction of the discussion <Col N="2963" /> if the Minister would give us further information.</P>

      <P>The original Act provided that unemployment assistance would be met by contributions from three sources&mdash;the unemployment insurance fund, the urban authorities and the national Exchequer.  It was decided that the additional amount required in consequence of the adoption of higher scales should be met by contributions from the same sources, and regard was had to the possibility of getting contributions from these sources.  The unemployment insurance fund was levied to the extent of an additional £50,000, not so much because it was regarded as an equitable arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but because of the fact that it was possible to get the £50,000 with the least possible variation in existing conditions.  Similarly, it was felt that it should be possible to get a contribution of another £20,000 from the urban authorities, but it was not practicable to distribute the collection of that sum over all the urban authorities making contributions under the principal Act, and it was decided to confine the contribution to the county boroughs and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire by requiring an additional 2d. contribution from those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, so far as the £196,000 is concerned, it means that it will now be £216,000.  If I correctly interpreted the Minister in the course of his speech on this Bill, it is owing to the increase in the cost of living, and owing to the improved position the Government finds itself in, that they are in a position to grant the extra payments set out in the schedule. If I am correct in that, I can go on to examine exactly what is the basis upon which the Minister founds that assumption.  In so far as his own resources are concerned, he is in the happy position of being able to give more money away.  How much is he giving?  £55,000.  He is adding an additional 5 per cent. to what he gave for the last few years.  When he comes <Col N="2964" /> to deal with local authorities he says that their contributions must be 11 per cent.  The money is no more his property than it is mine or anyone else's; it belongs to the insured contributors. The Minister says: &ldquo;That fund is filling up, and I can take £50,000 out of it.&rdquo;  He has as much right to take it as the bank has.  How did it come to be there?  It is insurance money paid by people in insured occupations, and it ought to be there for them in years to come, but because the till happens to be full at the moment, Ministers are going to tax them 20 per cent. on the original contributions.</P>
      <P>As far as I can gather, this is an arbitrary arrangement.  It is easier, according to the Minister, to get 2d. from local authorities than 1d.&mdash;a penny being a miserable sum.  According to the equity of the case, they are only entitled to pay a penny, and as far as the unemployment insurance fund is concerned, they ought not to be asked to pay a larger sum than the Government is paying.  The Government has taken very considerable credit for all the money they made available for unemployment insurance. The local authorities and the unemployment insurance fund have, between them, put up just as much as the Government.  If we take the figures given by the Minister we find that the unemployment insurance fund and the local authorities are going to put up £70,000 while the Government is going to contribute £55,000.  It will be £50,000 if the normal distribution of unemployment assistance is on the same basis as last year; if it is less, the Government will contribute less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, what is the situation in the country with regard to this question? Quite recently South Cork ratepayers got a shock when they found that their demands were up by £22,000.  In the coming year £9,000 of that amount represents money that has to be provided for over expenditure in the past year, and £13,000 represents increased cost in the coming year.  The Minister's friends in Cork are very anxious to make some sort of propaganda out of the situation, and want to make out that it is all <Col N="2965" /> due to the increased cost of items that had to be purchased.  A home assistance officer in reply to the members said that 4,526 persons were now in receipt of home assistance, as against 4,206 12 months ago, showing an increase of 320 persons.  If employment has increased generally throughout the country, it would appear that the shower did not fall in the district of South Cork.  So far as that area is concerned, the increased estimate will mean 7½d. in the pound.  If the Minister's proposals are carried, the only effect of his generosity will be, in the case of the people of Cork, an extra 2d. on the rates, or 9½d. in the pound, in a period of prosperity, as we are told, when statistics show that greater numbers are in employment, that it is likely unemployment assistance will cost less next year; but when the numbers in receipt of home assistance are going up, the Minister can keep the statistics.  He is welcome to them. So far as the Cork ratepayers are concerned, they are not paying for statistics; they are paying for an increase in the cost of home assistance, paying for an increased number this year over last year, and not only that, but they anticipate that in the coming year the numbers will be larger.  We will be told, of course, that we are Jeremiahs. I want to know what answer is to be given to the ratepayers in South Cork who are paying 7½d. in the pound over what they paid last year.  Are they to be told that other parts of the country are prosperous, and that they ought to be well satisfied?  If the Minister had made a correct analysis of the situation, and if he desired to deal with it on an equitable basis, he ought to have discovered which of these boroughs are paying more for home assistance than they were paying last year.</P>
    <P>If they are paying less they ought to contribute more, and if they are paying more they ought to be asked to contribute less.  It is very easy to be generous at other people's expense.  A rise of 9½d. in the £ is a very considerable increase in the rates.  It is quite possible that some of the towns in the hinterland of South Cork are diminishing in population, yet we are <Col N="2966" /> in the position now of having a larger number of people in receipt of home assistance, a larger number unemployed, and a larger number emigrating. Where do they all come from?  I suppose the Minister will tell us very shortly that the population is larger.  I think a case has been made on the face of it for taking out the contributions of the insured and of local authorities, as the Exchequer is very largely, if not entirely, responsible for the increased cost and consequently for the increased sums being paid in home assistance.  If the figures submitted to me are correct&mdash;and I got them from people who purchased goods and paid for them&mdash;the sum the Minister proposes to grant to these people is not sufficient to balance the increase in the cost of living and ought to be greater.  If the Exchequer returns are so buoyant, and if there is such prosperity in the country, the Central Exchequer ought to be able to meet the very small expense entailed by putting the entire charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess I am quite unable to understand the mentality underlying this Bill, or the various devices that have been resorted to, in order to make the contribution from the Exchequer as low as possible.  It is a display of sleight of hand known as &ldquo;passing the buck,&rdquo; and this is a classic example of &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo; from the State to other people, because, of course, persons other than the State, bodies other than the State, are going to make the biggest contribution to whatever slight additional benefit will be paid to the unemployed under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told by the Minister that £21,000 additional will be required from the county boroughs and the borough of Dun Laoghaire.  The Minister is taking power under the Bill to bring in 48 new urban councils who may be required to make a contribution of 9d. in the £ in order to raise the money with which to pay these slightly increased rates.  The Unemployment Insurance Fund, a fund made up of contributions by workers and employers, a fund which ought to be utilised for the purpose of improving <Col N="2967" /> unemployment insurance benefits, a fund which was raided to the extent of £250,000 in connection with the 1933 Act, is to be raided again to the extent of a further £50,000 under this Bill. While that is so, there is not a single proposal from the Minister to indicate that he proposes to do anything to raise the rates of unemployment insurance benefit in respect of insured workers on whose behalf a substantial surplus has been accumulated in the fund in recent years.  Of course the Minister knows that a substantial sum of money has been paid into the fund, that in recent years the fund has substantially liquidated a heavy debt, and that at present it is substantially in credit from an actuarial point of view. Instead of applying himself to the problem of improving the benefits for insured workers, the Minister proposes to raid the fund to the extent of a further £50,000.  In other words, £300,000 per annum is being taken out of the pockets of insured workers and utilised to discharge an obligation to uninsured workers, an obligation which ought to be borne by the State and not by the insured workers.  The rates of benefit payable to insured workers here are lower than they are across Channel or in the Six Counties, and are inadequate in the case of unemployed workers.  A man with a wife and five children who may have been earning £4 a week when in employment gets 25/- a week when unemployed from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and, although that fund has a surplus, the Minister will not utilise it to assist the insured worker.  Instead, he raids it for the purpose of getting money to assist uninsured workers, a responsibility which properly ought to devolve on the State itself.</P>
    <P>I think any proposal to impose a rate of 9d. in the £ in respect of 48 new urban councils will have a very serious effect on the finances of many of these councils.  I put a question to-day to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, asking him whether he proposed to sanction a sewerage scheme to facilitate an additional building scheme in the town of Athy.  The reply that I received <Col N="2968" /> from the Parliamentary Secretary was that no sanction could be given until the urban council paid the arrears which it owed on previous housing schemes.  The council finds it difficult to pay the arrears on previous housing schemes, due to the fact that it is finding it extremely difficult to collect not only the present rates but to collect the rents from persons who are trying to pay a rent of 4/- a week out of a maximum unemployment assistance benefit of 12/6 per week.  In that particlar case the imposition of an additional 9d. in the £ is going to further embarrass the urban council, and is not going to make it easy for it to manage its financial affairs, which are already very difficult to manage from the council's standpoint.</P>

I would like Deputy Moore to go down to Athy&mdash;I would like if he would read the report of the last meeting of the Athy Urban Council&mdash;and see if he can discover any prosperity there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have a classic example of the difference between ministerial speeches made outside the House and ministerial speeches made inside the House.  We are told from the political platforms throughout the country that the nation is on the high road to prosperity, that there is a substantial improvement in conditions all round.  Efforts have been made by Ministers and by spokesmen of the Government Party to try to convince the people that the country is experiencing a measure of prosperity such as it has rarely enjoyed, so that, while we have the language of prosperity used outside the House, when <Col N="2969" /> we come to the House and ask to have adequate rates of benefit provided for the unemployed, Ministers drop the language of prosperity which they use outside the House and use the language of scarcity here.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that this was a Bill to increase the rates of unemployment assistance benefit.  I ask Deputies to look at the type of increase which is being provided.  I would ask them to examine for a few moments the contribution which this additional benefit will make towards relieving the plight of unemployed persons.  Under the existing Act a man with a wife and three other dependents receives 12/- a week.  Now he is going to get 13/- a week.  A man with a wife and four other dependents is going to get 14/- a week instead of the 12/6 which he has under the existing Act.</P>

A man with a wife and five or more dependent children who is now getting 12/6 will get 14/- a week under the Bill, so that for a man with a wife and five or six or seven children, who formerly received 12/6 per week under the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933, what we propose to do in his case is to throw another 1/6 in among these seven or eight people and say: &ldquo;There you are; that will see you right now.&rdquo;  We are going to give that family of seven 14/- a week as a minimum, and that is what that family is going to be expected to live upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just as well that the Minister has raised that point. Let us examine it for a few moments. I make the positive statement that a man with a wife and five children, living in a rural area or in a small town in the County Kildare or the County Carlow, who is getting 12/6 a week unemployment assistance benefit, will not get home assistance from the local authority.  I challenge anybody to deny that.  Everybody knows that that is not common to these two counties. I make the statement in respect to these two counties because I have firsthand information concerning them, and what I say is this: that once you get unemployment assistance benefit, no matter what your circumstances are, the boards of health will not give you home assistance in addition.  As a matter of fact, I have seen cases of men claiming unemployment assistance benefit who had not a farthing income. They applied for home assistance pending the receipt of the unemployment assistance benefit, and they were only granted the home assistance on the distinct understanding that they would agree to refund the home assistance if they got the unemployment assistance benefit.  If the Minister has no information on that, will he ask the local authorities throughout the country whether that procedure is being adopted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a physical impossibility, outside the City of Dublin at all events, and certainly an absolute impossibility in the counties of Carlow and Kildare with which I am familiar, to get unemployment assistance benefit and at the same time get home assistance.  It cannot be done.  Everybody who has any experience of administration knows that it cannot be done.  So that whether the Minister wishes it or not, whether the Minister likes it or not, the fact remains that those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit, even at the absurdly low rates provided in the main Act or by this Bill, will have to live on that income so far as the local authorities and the State are concerned, because it is impossible for them to have unemployment assistance benefit supplemented by home assistance.  I should like the <Col N="2971" /> Minister to tell us how, in these circumstances, a man with a wife and five or six children can live in the year 1938 on an income of 14/- a week as a maximum.  He must have a family of seven before he can get 14/-.  If he has a family of ten, he can still only get 14/- under the Bill.  In face of the fact that that person cannot get home assistance and that any type of income which a person has is taken into consideration to reduce the 14/- unemployment assistance, will the Minister tell us how it is possible for that person to live on that income?</P>
    <P>The Minister says this is not intended to be the extent of the State's measurement of the cost of a person living and maintaining himself in reasonable decency and comfort.  Of course it is. Even if we had not the example of home assistance, of course it is.  If a person has an income, let us say, of 4/- per week in the form of a small pension from any source, that 4/- is taken into consideration when assessing that person's means.  If a person has an income of 4/- per week, the State will utilise that income in such a way as to reduce that person's unemployment assistance benefit by 3/- per week.  Does the Minister attempt to deny that?  Is it not perfectly correct to say that a person who has been awarded a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, let us say, of 8/- per week, and who might under this Bill be entitled to the maximum benefit of 14/-, will only get unemployment assistance benefit at the rate of 7/- per week?  Is not that the clearest possible evidence that the Government regard 14/- as sufficient to maintain a man and his wife and family?  If he has anything more, any income independent of unemployment assistance benefit, that income is used to reduce his unemployment assistance benefit. Therefore can the Minister try to pretend that the State does not regard this contribution as for the purpose of maintaining a family, when in fact any income to the family is taken into consideration to reduce even this miserable pittance?</P>
    <P>In 1933 this House was asked to pass the main Unemployment Assistance Act.  When it did so in October, 1933, <Col N="2972" /> the nearest quarterly cost-of-living index figure published by the Department of Industry and Commerce was for November, 1933.  We ought, therefore, to devote a few moments to considering what way the cost of living has moved, and to what extent it has moved between the time the original rates were framed under the 1933 Act and the present date when we are considering this Bill.  At mid-November, 1933, the cost-of-living index figure, as published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, taking July, 1914, as a basis, was 156 for all commodities. In mid-November, 1937, the cost-of-living index figure on the same basis had risen to 177.  So that between mid-November, 1933, and mid-November, 1937, the cost-of-living index figure had risen from 156 to 177, taking all articles into consideration.</P>
    <P>If we take the position in respect of food alone the rise is even greater. Again, according to the Department's figures, the index figure for food alone in mid-November, 1933, was 140, and in mid-November, 1937, the last quarter for which figures are available, the index figure had risen to 165, a rise of 25 points as between mid-November, 1933, and mid-November, 1937.  In face of that very substantial rise, and in spite of the progress of prosperity in the meantime, which is referred to frequently from political platforms, the most we can do with a man and wife and five or six children is to throw them another 1/6 per week.  The cost-of-living index figure has risen for food by 25 points in the past four years, according to the Department's figures, and in respect of all commodities it has risen by 21 points during the same period.  We cannot give even a single man in the rural areas another halfpenny benefit notwithstanding that substantial rise, and notwithstanding all the so-called prosperity, and the most we can give to a large family is the munificent sum of 1/6 per week. I should like Ministers when referring to prosperity in future to tell us why, if there is such an amount of it, it is not possible to share some of it, in a more substantial way than is provided for in this Bill, with the unemployed people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2973" /> I took the trouble this afternoon to look at some price lists published by the Department of Industry and Commerce so as to find out what variations in prices manifested themselves between 1933 and 1937.  The Department of Industry and Commerce publishes in its quarterly publication, the <i>Irish Trade</i><i>Journal</i>, a statement showing the average retail prices of the principal articles of food in towns, large and small, in Eire.  This statement of prices is published in connection with each quarterly return of the cost-of-living index figure issued by the Department.  I went through the return for the purpose of ascertaining what prices were recorded by the Department as ruling in mid-November, 1933, and mid-November, 1937, so as to be able to ascertain by reference to actual commodities the extent to which prices had risen in the meantime in order that we might compare the extent to which prices had risen with the extent to which the benefit was being increased in this Bill, and I got some interesting information which is worth giving to the House.</P>
    <P>According to the Department's figures the price of sirloin beef in mid-November, 1933, was 10¼d. per lb. and in mid-November, 1937, 1/3¾; corned brisket of beef was 6½d. per lb. in 1933 and 8¼d. in 1937; leg of mutton was 9¾d. per lb. in 1933 and 1/2 in 1937; neck of mutton was 6¼d. per lb. in 1933 and 9d. in 1937; bacon, which once used to be seen on Irish breakfast tables, was 1/1 per lb. in 1933 and 1/7¼ per lb. in 1937; a shoulder of bacon, 8¼d. per lb. in 1933 and 1/1½ per lb. in 1937; the democratic pig's head, 4d. per lb. in 1933 and 5¾d. per lb. in 1937; herrings, per dozen, in 1933, 1/6¾ and in 1937 2/1¼; fresh milk, per quart in 1933, 4¾d. and in November, 1937, 5¼d.; bread, 4½d. per 2-lb. loaf in 1933, and 5¾d. in 1937; flour (household), per stone, in 1933 1/10 and in November, 1937 2/9¼; oatmeal, per stone, in 1933 3/1¼ and in 1937, 3/6½; potatoes, in November, 1933, 7¼d., per stone, and in November, 1937, 9½d.; tea, 2/3¾ per lb., in 1933, and 2/8 per lb. in 1937; sugar, 2¾d. per lb. in November, 1933, and 3¼d. per lb. in November, 1937.</P>

      <P>December.  There is a very interesting table which shows the percentage change in retail prices, plus and minus, for certain commodities such as boots and other clothing, candles, soap, rent, between one month and another, the individual prices of the different commodities not being set out in detail.  The <i>Trade Journal</i>, issued a few days ago, bearing date November, 1937, shows that between November, 1936, and November, 1937, the price of clothing had increased by 12 per cent.  During the corresponding 12 months, from 1935 to 1936, it increased by 1.9 per cent., so that there is a very substantial increase in clothing prices as well.  If we take boots, this table shows a constant upward tendency.  If we take fuel, it also shows a constant increase in the price of fuel.  If we take any commodity at all, the figures operative during the past four years indicate, with possibly one or two exceptions, such as butter and margarine, that prices in 1937 were very substantially higher than in 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that very substantial increase in prices, the most we can afford to give by way of increase in unemployment assistance to persons in rural areas under this Bill is a sum of 1/6 per week.  Then that increase is only given in the case of persons with families consisting of a man, wife and five or more dependents.  To that family, in 1938, we are offering 14/- and we expect them to exist for a whole week and buy commodities at the prices which I have just quoted.  There is no doubt that the substantial rise in the cost-of-living index figure in the past few years has had the effect of substantially <Col N="2975" /> contracting purchasing power. In some cases workers organised in trade unions have been compelled to take industrial action, amounting to a withdrawal of labour, in order to try to secure an increase of wages to compensate them in some measure for the substantial increase in the cost of living. In the case of workers whose wages were static during that period, the effect of the substantial rise in the cost of living has been to contract the purchasing power of that section of the community.  The purchasing power of those whose wages remained static is substantially less to-day than it was in 1933 or 1932.  The effect of the increased cost of living in the past few years has been to pauperise the unemployed, to bring their subsistance standard down to a new low level, because every increase in prices during the past four years has had the effect of compelling them to purchase less food, to spend less on food and clothing, than it would have been possible for them to have spent if there had been no increase in prices.</P>
    <P>Just let us examine for a moment what this House is being asked to enact in, I think, one of the first Bills introduced since the new Constitution came into operation.  We are told in Article 45 of that Constitution all the loving things which the State should confer upon its citizens, and presumably this Bill conforms to the spirit of the Constitution.  Just let us see the extent to which the spirit of the Constitution is permeating this Bill.  A man with a wife and five or more other dependents, in a rural area or in a small town throughout the country, is being expected to exist on a maximum unemployment assistance rate of 14/- per week&mdash;14/- for seven persons for a week.  That is 2/- per head per week.  When you distribute that 2/- per head per week, over three meals for seven days, you find that each individual in that family has five farthings to spend per meal.  We are permitting that family, by the generosity, so-called, which we display in this measure, to spend five farthings per meal.  In face of that allowance of five farthings per meal, in 1938, with streaky bacon at 1/7¼ per lb., I <Col N="2976" /> should like to hear somebody justify the Christian provisions of this Bill. That is all we are doing under this Bill.  It permits them to spend five farthings per meal, and when they have spent five farthings per meal, they have eaten their loaf.  They cannot have it again.  There is not another farthing left at that rate of expenditure, for rent, clothes, medicine, school-books or for the many other articles which ought to constitute the budget of any working-class household.  There is not a farthing for these other items of expenditure. There is merely an allowance of five farthings for each meal; and rent, clothes, medicine, school-books and everything else can go by the board, because the State will not give any more.  I think it is the merest moonshine to talk about prosperity in the face of this pauperised standard which is provided for under this Bill.  We were told by Ministers last Sunday that the solution of all our difficulties is to work hard, or work harder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The recipe now is that the farmers are told to read books, to drink light beer, and others are told they are to work hard, or work harder. The thousands of people registered at the labour exchanges throughout the country, the bulk of whom are dependent upon the benefits under this Bill, will not get an opportunity of working at all, not even for a day in the week. Many of them who are condemned to work under rotational schemes will be allowed to work only three or four days in the week, just in case if they worked a full week they would get a full week's wages.  Then we are told that hard work is all that is necessary to keep up this march to prosperity. I think when Ministers go out again to talk about prosperity they ought to be given a copy of this Unemployment Assistance Bill.  It ought to be posted up in large type in the hall, so that they would be able to see the extent of that prosperity when it came to dealing with the claims of unemployed people throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill which raises the unemployment assistance rates to that extent <Col N="2977" /> for the hungry, destitute, unemployed people will be welcomed probably as a little better than the existing position, but their position will be not nearly as good under this Bill as it was when the 1933 Bill was introduced, because in 1933 they could have bought more food for 12/6 than 14/- will buy for them in 1938.  We have not rectified the shrunken purchasing power of the 1933 benefit.  We have permitted the cost of living to increase, and we have not given the unemployed adequate financial compensation for that increase. In 1938 the rates of benefit will buy less than those rates could have bought in 1933.  It may, in March, 1938, do a little more for the unemployed than in January, 1938, but it still leaves them worse off than in 1933. This Bill provides inadequate rates of benefit, and it is making no perceptible contribution to the widespread poverty which prevails among those who are compelled to exist in this State on the hunger rates of unemployment assistance benefit provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which arise in regard to this matter.  I understand the Minister's case as made to-day is that those rates are being given not because there is any really serious demand to be founded upon an increased cost of living in the country&mdash;that, of course, he has to say in order to follow his other speeches on this point&mdash;but because there is money in hand.  When we come to discover how the money in hand has been distributed we find that this is the situation according to his statement; whatever increases are resolved upon it is estimated that the sum falling to be paid will be divided in the following way:&mdash;The county councils or the local authorities who are concerned will have their contribution to rates increased by 11 per cent.; those who are insured people, employers and employees under the unemployment insurance scheme, will have to contribute a sum which means an increase of 20 per cent. on what they previously subscribed; and the Government puts up a sum which is the equivalent of 5 per cent. on its previous subscription to this scheme. The proportions in which the burden <Col N="2978" /> is to be borne are best seen by the relationship of those figures; an increase of 5 per cent. from the Government, an increase of 11 per cent. from the local authorities concerned, and an increase of 20 per cent. from insured people, from people who are fortunate enough to get occupation in the country, and who should be paying into a scheme actuarially sound.  If that scheme were more than sufficient to meet the outgoings, there was a promise that their burdens would be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact on the rates is something that has got to be considered.  Certain county councils are complaining at the moment that they cannot find the money.  We all know the deplorable position of the rate collection in the country.  In a recent period the South Cork Board of Assistance had a complaint, which they promulgated through the Press, that they have to find this year an additional £22,000; £9,000 arrears from last year and £13,000 additional for this year.  Two councils have complained that they cannot keep the roads in the state in which they think they ought to be kept, because they cannot get the money from the people from whom the rates are drawn, and they do not consider it fair or equitable to try to get the cash. That is the situation, although they admit that the roads have deteriorated, and that they are not going to improve under the contributions that they make.  In regard to local authorities generally, there is a tendency to make those reductions.  In contrast to that, there is the position of the Government in relation to the road fund.  The Minister tells us there is money in hand.  How is it got?  In recent years the road fund has been raided in order to make moneys for the Treasury.  I take the period from 1935.  In 1935 the receipts from motor taxation came to something short of £1,000,000.  The grants to local authorities were less than £750,000.  The Exchequer saved £250,000.  In 1936, a round £1,000,000 came as a result of motor taxation. The contribution to local authorities was £684,000.  In the period ended 31st March, 1937, the receipts from motor taxation amounted to £1,079,000. <Col N="2979" /> The moneys given to the local authorities amounted to £676,000.  In those three years the amount that came in as a result of motor taxation was £3,000,000.  The amounts given to the local authorities were £2,000,000 and some odd thousand pounds.  There was £1,000,000 made; £1,000,000 in relief of the Exchequer; it was not all in relief of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>It went to pay the money you had borrowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>To pay the money we had borrowed?  When the present Government came into office in 1932, there was £640,000 due to the Road Fund from the Central Fund.  What is due now?  A million and a quarter is due now.  Who borrowed it?  That was an unhappy interruption.  There was due to the Road Fund from the Central Fund, when the Minister came into office, something over £500,000. That had risen in 1934 to £1,500,000. It is now only £1,225,000; £250,000 has been paid back.  But whose borrowing was it?  The Minister should pause before those interjections are thrown out carelessly.  The Minister and his colleagues raised the amount that was due to the Road Fund by almost £1,000,000.  They, presumably, consider that they are doing well in that they have paid back £250,000 of that in three years, but the fact remains that, with local authorities finding it hard to keep the roads in good condition and complaining that they cannot get the money in from the ratepayers, the Government, in three years, have removed from the local authorities, in comparison with previous grants made, a sum of no less than £1,000,000.  We know that they have decreased the money due by the amount I have stated, but the rest has been used in some way by the Exchequer.  It must be remembered that at this time we were all told that, once unemployment assistance came in, the expenditure forced on local authorities or on the different boards by home assistance was going to decrease.  That, however, is not the result that has been shown by the figures.  There is a return for every month in the year 1937, except the month of December for which the <Col N="2980" /> figures are not yet available and in every single month of that year, 1937, more money was paid for home assistance than in the corresponding month of the year 1936.  In no single month of the year 1937 was it found possible to make any saving on home assistance, month by month, as compared with the previous year, with the exception of December, as I have said, for which we have not the figures.  With that exception, more was expended on home assistance in every month of the year 1937 than in the corresponding months of the year 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1935 there was a sum of, roughly, £1,000,000 paid in unemployment assistance.  In 1936 that figure rose to over £1,500,000.  It was found possible to squeeze that back to £1,170,000 in 1937.  How was that done? It was accomplished, first of all, by emigration, and, secondly, by inaugurating a very strict campaign to inquire into the question of whether or not people were seeking work or available for work.  First of all, people had fled out of the country, but in addition to that, by making the conditions more rigid, it was found possible to make a saving amounting to some £400,000.  But at this moment the amounts paid in the years 1936 and 1937 are more than in, say, 1931; and in addition to that, in 1935, £1,000,000 had to be paid in unemployment assistance, almost £1,600,000 in 1936, and £1,170,000 in 1937.  Remember what we started with in all this.  We were told that there was to be no necessity for this&mdash;86,041 people were to be put into industrial occupations, and after all these people were employed the Minister was to get back the exiles in order to fill the empty jobs here.  In 1933, when this measure was brought in, we hailed it as a necessity, but we also hailed it as this: that it was coming to the second part of a motion which Deputy Morrissey had put down in this House to the effect that, if there could not be work provided, there should be maintenance.  This, however, means that the Government have decided definitely now to hold up their hands in front of unemployment.  We are increasing the moneys to be provided to some slight extent, but to no great extent so far as the Government <Col N="2981" /> is concerned.  An increase is going to be demanded from the local authorities who, at the moment, find it difficult to get in the rate and most of whom have decided to cut to the minimum the amount that they have spent on roads because they know that they must adopt a more human attitude than the central Government is adopting towards the people who are paying these rates.  I have long since lost interest in the matter of how these moneys will be brought in, but I know that the Minister, in answer to the proposition that maintenance should be provided in lieu of work, used words in 1936 which indicated that, if full maintenance could not be provided, at least some maintenance should be provided, and he put the question of maintenance on the basis of the cost-of-living figures.  His words indicated that the question of maintenance should be decided in so far as it could be deduced from cost-of-living figures.  This matter was thrashed out in a motion which the Labour Party had down in the last Dáil.  We can get a comparison through the amount that was stipulated as the minimum agricultural wage under the Agricultural Wages Act.</P>
    <P>In connection with that, Mr. Luke Duffy, who is well known as an analyst in these matters, made the following comment with regard to the minimum wage of 24/- a week which had been fixed for agricultural labourers by the Agricultural Wages Board.  Mr. Duffy said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the employer provided the farm worker with three meals per day for six days a week, 11/6 would be deducted from his wages of 24/-, and if the worker lived in a cottage owned by the farmer, 2/- would be deducted for rent.  In other words, 13/6 per week would be deducted in respect of food for six days and the rent of a cottage, leaving 10/6 with which the worker was expected to purchase food, fuel and clothing for his wife and family for the seven days and his own food on a Sunday.  In the case of a farm worker with a wife and four children, 108 meals would have to be provided in the week; and, allowing <Col N="2982" /> ld. per meal, this would work out at 9/- per week, leaving 1/6 with which to buy fuel, light, clothing, household utensils, and provide medicine and medical attendance for the family.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Duffy's analysis of how that 24/- a week was to be expended bears some comparison with the figure given here, I suggest.  The Minister can tell us afterwards whether the figure he is providing for under the increased sum is to be regarded as maintenance, or how far it is intended to be near maintenance, and, if it is not intended to be maintenance, perhaps the Minister can tell us where it is to be expected that, in the present conditions to which the policy of the Government has brought the country, the remnant required for maintenance is to be got.  The Minister has spoken previously on the question of the cost of living in this counary. The Minister is one of the few people who still holds that the cost of living has not gone up.</P>

      <P>I put all those things to the Minister as things that he did say, and I will give the exact quotation in the debate this evening on the question of the cost-of-living.  If those things were said by the Minister and if the general effect of his remarks was that the cost of living, generally, has gone down, then the only conclusion to be drawn from that, I think, is that the Minister misled the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might direct his attention and his statistical mind to one other part of the journal published under his auspices, and to which Deputy Norton has referred.  There is a return in the December number of the <i>Trade Journal</i> with regard to the progress made in the bread, flour, confectionery and biscuit industry.  What is the result?  As between 1931 and 1936 the consumption of bread, 2-lb. loaves, has dropped by 6,000,000 loaves. Although the amount of bread consumed in the country has dropped by the equivalent of 6,000,000 2-lb. loaves, <Col N="2984" /> what is the situation with regard to cost?  Although there are 6,000,000 loaves less being produced, the manufactured loaves are sold at £600,000 more.  That may be further analysed when one comes to see the materials used.  The amount of flour milled in the Saorstát in 1931 was milled at a cost approximately of 10/- a cwt.  At the moment the cost is very nearly 20/- a cwt.  The result in the industry is that everything is gone up except wages and earnings.  The number of people employed has dropped and, still more strange, the people under 18 years of age in the industry have gone up by 140, while those over 18 years of age have gone down by nearly 350.  I do not know what that means, but I think the clearest thing that emerges is that the people have been forced to eat 6,000,000 loaves less.</P>

      <P>Let us consider the cost of wheat.  As regards imported wheaten flour, in 1931 the relationship between the quantity brought in and the cost was 10/- a cwt.  In 1936 the relationship between the wheaten flour imported and the cost was about 10/- a cwt.  These calculations, of course, may be wrong, but I have not produced the figures.  If the Minister wants to make a calculation, the details are here.  It cannot be the cost of wheat, if these figures are right.  The relationship between the quantity in cwts. and the price is almost exactly the same.  The Minister will have to think of another answer.</P>

      <P>We had here something like 1,750,000 cwts., costing about £1,000,000.  Where is the change in price as far as wheat is concerned? Of course there is a change immediately in the next line.  There used to be 724,000 cwts. of wheaten flour milled here at a cost of £366,000&mdash; again a relationship of 10/- to the cwt. Now there are 2,266,000 cwts. milled at a cost of nearly £2,000,000.  It has gone up from 10/- a cwt. to 18/6 or 19/-. The Minister will, I am sure, give us something in the way of an irrelevancy, but that is one of the series of figures produced by his Department for the purpose of enlightening people as to the progress in the industry.  If it could be said that by paying £600,000 more for 6,000,000 less loaves we were getting any great number of extra people into employment and there was a greater purchasing power, then there would be some gain for that loss, but where there used to be 8,309 people employed there are now 8,130, and the number of people-under 18 years has increased by 140, while the number of those over 18 has decreased by 320.</P>
      <P>The things that have lessened in regard to this industry are wages and earnings.  They have gone down from £969,000 to £941,000.  The average wage in the industry has gone down; the gross earnings have gone down; the cost to the community has gone up, and there is less of this foodstuff being eaten.  There are other matters that Deputy Norton referred to that are of the greatest importance in connection with this debate.  I segregated that particular one because it emerges from the latest series of statistical returns.  It gives some indication as to the road we are travelling along. In these conditions the Minister thinks he does a benefit to the community by increasing the rates of unemployment assistance.  He cannot argue that the increase is comparable with the increase in the cost of living.  Whatever relationship there was between the sum given in the 1933 and 1935 Bills, that has not been maintained in the new rates in relation to the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2987" /> Where the money is to be found is by the Government making an increase in the subscriptions of the employees and the employers equivalent to 5 per cent. on their previous contributions; by demanding from the local authorities (county councils) that they should increase their contribution by 11 per cent., and that the county boroughs should increase their contributions by 20 per cent.  This again, of course, is travelling further along the bad track that the Minister laid down in his earlier Bills.  The Minister undertakes the administration of these Bills, but he does not take upon himself the odium of raising the money.  He asks other people&mdash;the employers and the employees&mdash;to foot the bill, and he asks local authorities to take on themselves the odium of raising the money. It is with that burden on the local authorities, who at the moment find it necessary to cut expenditure on the roads, that the Minister now proposes further to increase their burdens.  The Government, who are economising on the Road Fund, are now trying to pay back to it the moneys they borrowed in past years.  The Minister said the reason he can do that is because the demand for unemployment assistance was less now.  That may be borne out by the figures given by the Minister, but in this matter the Minister is helped by two factors on which he is insisting&mdash;(1) &ldquo;available for and seeking work,&rdquo; and (2) the very big number of people that he has caused to emigrate out of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has dealt with the rates of unemployment benefit in our proposal in relation to the increased cost of living, and I do not propose to go over that ground except to relate the rate of benefit now proposed in this Bill to the actual cost of living to-day.  Deputy Norton dealt mainly with the position in rural areas in the country.  I propose to examine the position with regard to the unemployed man and his family in the City of Dublin.  The rate of benefit proposed for a man with five and more dependent children is 23/- a week. If you take a family consisting of eight persons, the income of that family will be 23/- per week. That is to say, there will be 2/10½ a week for each member of that family. That is further to say that there will be 5d. a day for each member of that family.  At three meals a day each member of that family will receive a meal costing one and two-thirds of a penny.  That is the sort of meal that each member of that family can have. Assuming that each member of an unemployed worker's family could get bread for his meal, and that one member of the family will consume in bread alone one loaf per day, they will be able to have nothing but bread and water.  It could hardly be contemplated that the members of a family could get nothing but bread and water but actually this rate of benefit lays down as a standard for people in this country who, through no fault of their own are denied the right of work, one loaf per day.  That is what this figure of 23/- a week works out at &mdash;1 2-3rds. penny for each meal for each person.  Now the price of an egg, according to the most recent return issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce, is 2¼d., so that actually the worker and each member of his family whose bread-winner is unemployed would not be able to afford even one egg as the sole menu for each meal.  The assistance would not <Col N="2989" /> provide one egg per member of the family at each meal of the day.</P>
      <P>That is all bad enough, but one has to refer to the fact that 23/- a week is the sole income of the family.  There is no provision for rent; there is no provision for clothing, or for anything but for one loaf of bread per day for each member of the unemployed worker's family.  I suggest that if this measure is intended as a serious contribution towards the problem of maintaining the unemployed worker, the whole thing is a farce.  But the Minister has indicated that this is not necessarily the sole means of support of the unemployed worker.  What are the other means?  Deputy Norton has dealt fully with the question of home assistance being unavailable where unemployment assistance is paid.  The Minister is also aware that there is a rigid means test applied to every person who draws unemployment relief. So, in fact, 23/- a week is to be regarded as the sole income of the unemployed worker and his five or six dependents.  When Deputy Norton was dealing with the question of the cost of living, the Minister could not deny, in face of the official statistics of his own Department, the substantial increase that has taken place in the cost of living.  When Deputy Norton referred to this, the Minister said that the increased cost of living was all the more reason why the Government could not contemplate raising more money for the payment of such social services as unemployment relief.  Is it to be taken that it is the Minister's view that when the cost of living increases the sources of revenue decrease?  I would suggest that an examination of the periods of high prices and low prices would usually indicate that in periods of high prices the sources of revenue are higher, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from that that the Deputy does not object to the increased cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying whether I object or whether I do not object to the increased cost of living, but I am merely taking it as a fact.  The Minister cannot argue, I am sure, that when <Col N="2990" /> the cost of living increases the source of revenue decreases.  Is not that quite clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but increased taxation will still further increase the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  That depends upon whether the increased taxation is accompanied by machinery to see that the cost of living is not necessarily increased.  Some time ago I was examining the returns of a particular industry in this country, the Irish Tanners industry.  Their annual report shows a profit of £25,312.  The chairman congratulated the company on showing this fine profit.  He said they gave good employment to 300 workers in the town of Portlaw.  Assuming that the average wage of these workers was £2 per week&mdash;a generous assumption; I suggest that the average wage would probably be much less than that &mdash;then, the wages cost to that firm would be about equal to the profit shown.  If the average wage was less than £2 per week, as I think it probably would be, then the profit factor was much bigger than the wage factor in that particular industry.  If the Minister would examine these matters, he might possibly find sources of revenue which would enable him to go some distance further towards meeting the increased cost of living by giving more just rates of unemployment assistance to those workers whom the Government and private industry are, unfortunately, unable to absorb into employment.  Some time ago, the Taoiseach said, in effect, that he thought that so long as any section of the people were compelled to wear hair-shirts, there should be no silk shirts for anybody.  If the Government were acting in accordance with that excellent doctrine, they would, I think, have found it possible to provide under this Bill that the unemployed would be in no worse position than they were in 1933, and that they should, in fact, be in a better position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the increased rates contained in the Bill will not be sufficient to enable unemployed workers to maintain even the standard of living they had when unemployment assistance was first introduced.  I am not <Col N="2991" /> going to suggest that the reason for the introduction of this Bill and this improvement, such as it is, was to anticipate the motion which is on the Order Paper in the name of Labour Deputies.  If that be the object of the Bill.  I think it will not deceive many people.  Like Deputy Norton, I welcome the principle of providing for an increase in the present miserably inadequate rates of unemployment assistance, but I think that this Bill does not meet the needs of the situation. I should like to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce give his views on what the obligation of this community is to the people who cannot be provided with remunerative work. If he agrees that there is a responsibility on the community to enable these people to live, not in comfort but under tolerable conditions, I should like to hear him attempt to justify the figures in the Schedule to this Bill.  I do not think that he could do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, gave us to understand that it was not the increase in the cost of living which was responsible for the introduction of this Bill. He told us that the Bill owed its introduction to the fact that the Unemployment Insurance Fund was in a position to advance more money to the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  I look with a good deal of alarm to the proposal made by the Minister in the Bill to call upon the local authorities to strike a rate of 9d. in the £ in areas in which they have not hitherto struck this rate.  Take the county I represent &mdash;the County of Wexford.  There are four fairly large towns in that county but the only town with a population over 7,000 is Wexford.  We are already paying not 9d. in the £ but 10d. in the £ because the Minister insists upon 9d. being paid upon the gross valuation. When one takes into consideration the rebates and reliefs given in accordance with certain Acts of Parliament, it is necessary to strike a 10d. rate in order to get the proceeds of a 9d. rate on the gross valuation.  As Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, it ought to be apparent to everybody that owing to the fact that practically every local authority is endeavouring <Col N="2992" /> to deal with the housing problem in its area and has also been called upon to supplement unemployment schemes, the amount of money a local authority is asked to pay is out of all proportion to what should be expected from it. Local authorities are limited regarding what they are able to do in the way of levying rates.  They are in an entirely different position from the Government to which the Minister belongs.  It will be admitted that, in recent years, the amount the Government has been called upon to pay in the way of unemployment assistance is less because the Government have put into operation what is known as the rotational system of employment.  Not alone has the area which has a population of over 7,000 been called upon to pay, as I have explained, 10d. in the £, but in some cases local authorities have been called upon to bear at least 6d. in the £ in order to finance loans they have obtained for the purpose of supplementing grants given by the Government.  In addition, they have been called upon this year to strike a rate of 6d. in the £, so that it may be taken for granted that, in a great many urban areas, 1/- in the £, at least, is being paid to supplement grants given by the Government in respect of rotational schemes of employment. You may take it for granted that towns like Drogheda, Dundalk, Wexford, Sligo, Clonmel and those towns which have been paying 9d. or 10d. in the £, are paying, along with that 9d. or 10d., at least another 1/- in order to qualify for the grant given under the rotational scheme of employment, and I suggest that that is too much to ask a local authority to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the towns which are known as urban areas, there are towns in the different counties which are under the jurisdiction of town commissioners, and the cost of living in towns of that character is just as high as the cost of living in towns which have been urbanised.  I have in mind the town of Gorey in the northern portion of County Wexford, which the Minister knows.  That town is under the jurisdiction of town commissioners and its population is about <Col N="2993" /> 3,500.  I suggest that something should be done to put that town in the intermediate stage.  I do not know what the procedure might be, or whether or not it should be that the county council in Wexford should have an opportunity of consulting the people in Gorey town as to whether they would be disposed to pay a rate in the same way as the people in Enniscorthy or New Ross would be given an opportunity. I do not know whether the Gorey people would take advantage of such an opportunity or not, but I think the opportunity should at least be given to them, and that they should be allowed to avail of it, if they so wished, because the unemployed people there are just as badly off as people in Wexford, New Ross and Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that the Minister has not made any alteration in the benefit paid to a single man in rural areas.  I suggest there should have been an increase to such a man to the same extent as in the other areas, because the cost of living is felt by him just as much as a man in the other areas. There is one aspect of the Act which was passed in 1933 with which the Minister has not dealt, and I ask him now to do something to relieve the hardship which prevails in consequence of the application of a certain section of that Act.  I refer to the section which prevents a man who has removed from an urban area to a rural area, or <i>vice versa</i>, from receiving benefit until he has been six weeks or three months resident in the area into which he moves.  I forget what the period is but it certainly causes hardship.  I suggest that it would not cost the Exchequer, or this fund, a very big amount to adjust or remedy that situation. There have been many cases of hardship which could be cited, and which the Minister could find out if he consulted the managers of the various exchange, and I ask him very seriously to bring in an amendment which would bring those people into line.  I notice Deputy Dillon in the House now and I know that he has experience of cases of that kind too.  There are some cases of men having to go immediately outside an urban area to houses built by <Col N="2994" /> a local authority, and those people are certainly being very badly treated.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what is the difference between the amount of money spent on unemployment assistance now and the amount spent prior to the time when the rotational schemes were put into operation. I suggest that the difference is very great.  So far as rotational schemes of work are concerned, the Government are saving a great deal.  I have in mind a certain scheme in operation in the town of Wexford at present.  On that scheme, the corporation are asked to pay only one-seventh of the amount. On the first rotational scheme that was carried out in Wexford, we were asked to pay 50 per cent.  It later came down to 20 per cent., and at the moment we are paying only one-seventh of the amount; but even though the contribution is so small, the Government are getting the best of the bargain.  In Wexford a man gets four periods of three days, that is to say, three days in each of the four weeks, and the wages he receives are £1 5s. 6d. for three days, which, less insurance, amounts to £1 4s. 1d.  The corporation pay 3/5 of that amount which is one-seventh, leaving £1 0s. 8d. as the contribution by the Government.  The Government save 15/- which they should pay that man at the labour exchange, which leaves the Government liable for 5/8.  During his period of employment the Government collected 2/11, so all it costs the Government at the end of the period is 2/9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And a 9d. in the £ contribution wipes that out!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it does. Along with that, the man does not get even labour exchange benefit for the week immediately subsequent to the period in which he was employed, so that that week is saved also.  I think that in a case of this kind, where a rotational scheme is in operation, the local authorities should get some relief. There is no question that the local authorities are being called on at the moment to expend a large amount of money.  They are doing what the Minister asks them to do, so far as <Col N="2995" /> housing, sewerage and water works are concerned, and they should get some relief in this respect.</P>
      <P>In connection with the increases which the Minister proposes to give under this Bill, like my colleagues, I suggest that it is not at all sufficient. In view of the increased cost of living, a man was infinitely better off when the Act was passed in 1933.  Since 1933 a good number of houses have been built in urban areas and, in 1933, large numbers of people in receipt of unemployment assistance were living in slum areas in very bad houses for which they were called on to pay rents ranging from 1/6 to 2/- per week.  They have now been put into decent houses, thanks to the Government and the local authorities&mdash;I want to give full credit&mdash;but the rents they are called on to pay now range from 4/- to 4/6 per week.  That is an impost which has been placed on them since the passage of the Act in 1933.  That, in itself, made a big hole in the amount of benefit given under the 1933 Act. Again, I would ask the Minister to deal with the case of the man who has to leave one-area for another and is thereby disqualified under the 1933 Act. It would cost very little, so far as the Government are concerned, to make that adjustment, but it would mean a good deal to people who have to change from one area to another.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned discussion of this amendment on the last occasion, I had practically summed up the reasons for it, and pointed out that nothing has occurred during the operation of the Principal Act to make Section 2 of this Bill necessary.  The Minister has not made any case for the necessity of taking away the limited safeguards which applicants for registration had under the Principal Act.  That Act seemed to work very well and the Minister did not say that any serious difficulties had arisen during its operation.  As he admitted freely that the Principal Act worked so well that it had put a number of undesirable people out of business, there does not appear to be any obvious necessity for the present section.  The amendment is an attempt to provide some safeguard for future applicants for registration, in view of the limited safeguards given in the Principal Act.  I cannot accept the principle that any Minister should have absolute power to refuse to grant a licence, even without the necessity of inspection or of giving notice to an applicant.  I am not suggesting that the present or any other Minister that I can envisage would use his discretion in an undesirable way.  I do not think any Minister would do that.  Nevertheless, it does not seem right that any Minister should get such absolute discretion as would be given in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I did not hear any justification for this section from the Minister, and I do not know how he could defend it.  If the Minister does not wish to accept the amendment he could delete the section, as the effect will be the same.  There is a precedent for such an amendment as this in connection with the Pigs and Bacon Act. There were some unfortunate results there.  Under that Act the Minister <Col N="2997" /> took power to restrict the number of licences, and the result was that people were driven out of pig production because of the prices they received, while the consumption of bacon was reduced.  Was that a desirable result?  Everybody could get licences if they were prepared to comply with the regulations.  This section restricts the right to export fresh pork to a limited number, and the result will be monopoly, the same as happened under the Pigs and Bacon Act.  Therefore, on considering the matter, I think the amendment should either be accepted or the section deleted.  In any case the principle of giving a Minister absolute power in the granting of licences is wrong.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is going to use his powers for a wrong purpose, but our experience under the Pigs and Bacon Act and under all such control was unfortunate.  I should like to get some assurance from the Minister that there will be some change, and that there will not be a move towards monopoly, but rather towards an extension of the rights of those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  On principle I have the strongest possible objection to giving any Minister such absolute powers as are proposed in this section.  It is not a question of saying whether the present or any other Minister would exercise such powers in a wrongful manner.  It is one of principle, as the putting of absolute power of granting licences into the hands of Minister is objectionable.  On the last occasion the amendment was before the House the Minister gave no reasons why the section should stand.  He stated then, according to the Official Debates, Volume 69, No. 15, column 2306:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 2, sub-section (2) of this Bill removes from the Minister the obligation to have premises inspected on application.  If anybody were to apply for a fresh meat licence under the present Act, the Minister must carry out inspection of the premises, and must give a fortnight's notice of his intention to do so.  Where a person's application has been turned <Col N="2998" /> down on more than one occasion, it is hardly fair that every time that person makes an application the State should be put to the expense of having to serve notice that the place would be inspected on such a date...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of the Minister's reasons for the section in the present Bill.  I do not think that argument holds water.  If the objection is that people when turned down will apply again and again, the matter could be easily dealt with by inserting a provision that persons cannot apply for a certain period after being turned down, or that they could not apply again after being turned down on a number of occasions. The Minister made the point that he did not see how a judge could deal with the matter.  I am inclined to agree that it is vitally necessary that there should be an appeal to the Circuit Court.  The main purpose of the amendment is to preserve the right of persons to apply for licences which was there under the original Act.  If the Minister does not see his way to accept the amendment there is an easy course open to him, to allow the provisions of Section 8, sub-sections (2) and (3) of the Principal Act to stand. I do not think the Minister can say that they impose any undue restriction on him when dealing with licences. Sub-section (2) states that whenever an application is made the Minister shall cause the premises to be inspected by an inspector.  I do not think the Minister can suggest that it is an undue hardship on the State, when a person applies for a licence, that the premises should be inspected.  Sub-section (3) merely says that when the Minister makes up his mind to refuse an application he causes a fortnight's notice to be served of his intention so to refuse without considering any further evidence that the applicant might bring to his notice.  The Minister's hands were not tied up by either sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not advanced any reason for turning down the amendment. His main reason seems to be that if it were accepted you would have a number of people applying to <Col N="2999" /> get into the business, damaging people already in it and creating a chaotic state of affairs.  I feel that, if Section 8 of the Principal Act were allowed to stand, the Minister would have sufficient power to deal with applications which were not bona fide, or which he felt were calculated to do damage in the trade, and that he should not take to himself the arbitrary powers that he proposes in this section.  I have the strongest possible objection to giving to a Minister or to a Department the right to exercise final judgment on the application of any individual, company or business, applying for a licence.  I think that the House should not give that power either in this measure or in any other measure that we are asked to pass.  It is altogether unreasonable to say that the Minister would be hampered in the working of the measure if we allowed the two sub-sections of Section 8 in the Principal Act to stand.  The reasons that the Minister has given for this section do not convince me.  If the Minister does not like the wording of the amendment, that is a matter that can be considered.  The Minister does not like putting in the Circuit Court judge, and asked what would he know about it.  In a case where an application had been turned down, the Circuit Court Judge, in my opinion, might know as much as the people who would ultimately advise the Minister and get him to exercise his absolute discretion in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on the amendment before, I quoted several precedents for this section.  In all the previous Produce Acts passed by the previous Government and this, a clause similar to this was inserted. We have it in the Dairy Produce Act and in the Pigs and Bacon Act.  I admit, of course, that that is not any proof that the thing is right.  I refer to these precedents to indicate that in putting in this section we are not introducing something new.  So far as I can recollect, there was no objection to similar provisions in earlier Acts. It may be wrong in principle to give a Minister this discretion.  It is the sort of thing we all object to, but if we <Col N="3000" /> cannot find any better method, what other alternative have we?  As I said on the last occasion, a Circuit Court judge is not the person who ought to have anything to do with this, because if these matters were to come before him, then, naturally, his decision will be based entirely upon the law.  There are, however, other considerations to be taken into account.  Deputy Linehan spoke of the Act as it stood.  If we were to leave the Act as it stands, then I think the Circuit Court judge would have to grant a licence to every applicant whose premises were in order. Even supposing you had six men in the one street in a town applying for a licence, I think every one of them would have to get it.  That would not be a very desirable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is no reason why six men, with all their overhead expenses, should be put in the position of trying to get a living out of that business instead of one. Naturally, that would mean supporting more people than should be supported out of the industry.  The principle that we have been following so far in all these cases&mdash;creameries, bacon factories and so on&mdash;is that there should not be more than sufficient to supply an area.  Therefore, I think we should have some way of settling this rather than by way of appeal to the Circuit Court judge.  I think that we should adhere to the principle that we have been going on in all the previous Acts. It has been found to be the best method, and, therefore, I think we should continue to give a discretion to the Minister in this case as in the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGovern spoke of the Bacon Act, and seemed to object to the discretion given to the Minister in that case.  He evidently wanted to give the impression that if there had been no such power in the Pigs and Bacon Act things would have been different.  I think I am correct in stating that, so far, there has been no definite application from anybody to start a bacon factory.  There have been discussions.  Certain people put up tentative proposals to set up bacon factories in certain districts.  My <Col N="3001" /> Department has discussed with them what the conditions were likely to be, the situation of the factory, the quota that might be allotted and so on.  That has happened in a couple of cases, but so far no definite application for a bacon factory has been made.  The only kind of public agitation that I have met with has been against the issue of licences.  There was a report in some of the newspapers to the effect that a licence would be issued for a certain place.  I received a fair number of resolutions from workers, public bodies and people interested against the issue of such a licence, so that in the case of the Bacon Act, at any rate, the agitation has been against the issue of licences.</P>

      <P>He did not send me any resolution.  With regard to the question of inspection, that is not exactly the same as the one we are now discussing. Deputies are quite entitled to relate it to this, but it is really a different question.  I stated on the last occasion that, even though applicants were to apply to me every six months for five years, under the old Act I would have to send down an inspector to visit the premises every time I received an application.  Deputy Linehan says that is a thing that could be got over.  Take this kind of case.  Suppose there are three or four pork factories in a certain county, and that an application comes from a man living close to them.  We know, having this discretion under all the previous Acts, that we are not going to give him a licence.  Why, therefore, should <Col N="3002" /> we have the obligation put upon us of sending down an inspector in cases like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the previous Act an inspector had to be sent down every time an application was made, even though it was intended from the start to refuse the licence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask if cases have arisen where the Minister had to send an inspector although he knew perfectly well that he was not going to grant the licence; where the expense has already been gone to, although the Minister knew when sending the man out that he was not going to do anything about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has happened. Under the Act we had to do it.  I should like to make this point plan: that under the old Act, as I explained in the beginning, it is held by some people, although there may be some legal doubt about it, that we had no right to refuse a licence except on the ground of unsuitability of premises. That is the position as it stands. Therefore, if the appeal goes to a County Court judge or anybody else, he will decide on the law and say: &ldquo;If the Department certifies that the premises are suitable, then I must grant a licence.&rdquo;  I think that would not be advisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment raises a wide issue, and the issue has been very substantially widened by what the Minister stated.  The Minister claims under the Fresh Meat Act the right to determine absolutely the measure of competition that is going to obtain between exporters when they start out to purchase the produce of the farmers.  The Minister stated that, unless he is given absolute discretion, if six men in the one street put their premises into a condition that <Col N="3003" /> accorded with the requirements of the Act, he would have to grant them all a licence.  Would it not be a very good thing if he did?  He would have six men in the one town all competing for the farmers' cattle and pigs when they came to sell them.</P>
      <P>If there were six men exporting pork from the town of Monaghan or the town of Clones, as there used to be before the Minister destroyed the pork market, you would have six men vigorously competing for the carcases which the farmers brought in.  The Minister says: &ldquo;No, we do not want that; we want to eliminate competition; we want to restrict the number of people who will be there to buy&rdquo;; and he says, &ldquo;We have done it under the Bacon Act, and no representations have been made to me of any kind except representations asking me not to grant a new licence.&rdquo;  I interrupted the Minister when he said that.  He said there was one case where he proposed to grant a licence for a certain part of the country, and he was inundated with resolutions.  I asked him the circumstances.  To anyone who knows the County Donegal it became manifest immediately what happened. The Minister proposed to grant a licence to establish a bacon factory somewhere in the Inishowen district, which is a great pig-raising area, and the bacon industry people in Ballybofey went round to all the neighbours and said: &ldquo;If you do not get the Fianna Fáil clubs and everybody you can get to write to Deputy Blayney and Deputy Brady and to the Minister, you are going to lose your job, because half our pig supply is going to go to the factory in Inishowen, and if we are only handling half the quantity of pigs we handled heretofore, we will only want half the number of men&rdquo;; and the Minister was inundated with resolutions from a part of the same county not to allow the establishment of a bacon factory in Inishowen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have the farmers of Inishowen to say?  Have they not inundated the Minister with complaints that they cannot get a price for their pigs? Have they not bitterly complained that they were being consistently robbed <Col N="3004" /> in Inishowen?  Did not the Minister come to the House and tell us that so grave did the situation become in Donegal as a result of there being only one licensee there that he was at his wit's end to devise a means whereby he could get for the pig producers of Inishowen a fair price for their pigs?  He had to send Government buyers, and rightly send Government buyers, to compete with the local factory in Donegal.  Would it not be very much better if, instead of sending up Government inspectors to compete with the local factory, he allowed enterprising citizens who wanted to embark in the bacon-curing trade so to embark under licence, if necessary, and to provide the competition themselves?</P>
    <P>What reality is there in the Minister's alarm when he says: &ldquo;Unless I have these powers, six people in the same street could bring their premises into line with the requirements of the Act and insist upon getting a licence?&rdquo; What six lunatics would do it?  It costs money to put premises into a condition which will meet the requirements of the Act, and who is going to invest money in doing that if he has not some prospect of making a profit out of it?  Competition is the life of trade, and if the farmers have not got competition amongst the exporters for their products the farmers will be robbed.</P>
    <P>What is the result of restricting competition in the bacon industry?  I now say that the bacon factories in this country have made more money in the last two and a half years than they made in the previous 10 years, and I may say that they robbed that money by a system of licensed highway robbery from the pig producers and the bacon consumers.  I say, furthermore, that if the Minister will get the balance sheets of the bacon factories of this country and produce them here, that allegation will be proved up to the hilt.  I challenge the Minister to produce the profit and loss accounts of the bacon factories for the last five years, and I say that it will be demonstrated clearly that, as a result of the restriction of competition by licences carried out by him, the producers of <Col N="3005" /> pigs have been robbed and plundered by the licensees, as have the consumers of bacon.  If it is the Minister's intention to embark upon a similar campaign in regard to licences for the export of fresh meat, which I think is principally lambs and porkers, then in exactly the same way the producers of lambs and porkers in this country will be robbed and plundered by the privileged licensees.</P>
    <P>In any case, so far as I can see, the trend here is towards State socialism. The Minister is going to take over and run the business of exporting fresh meat, much as he will have to take over the business of curing bacon if the present system is allowed to continue, and it is very necessary that people in this House should open their minds to this fact.  If this House accepts the contention that, in order to carry on certain trades, you must establish monopolies, it is absolutely certain that sooner or later those monopolies will have to be taken over by the Government and run by the Government.  At the present time we have a bacon monopoly and a flour monopoly and certain other monopolies established by tariffs, such as thread and others to which I will not refer.  In these two monopolies&mdash;bacon and flour&mdash;which are closely analogous to the monopoly which the Minister proposes to set up under the Fresh Meat Act, you have a small group of flour millers robbing the consuming public of millions of pounds and putting the money in their own pockets, and you have a small group of bacon manufacturers robbing the producing public and the consuming public of hundreds of thousands of pounds and putting the money in their own pockets.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to set up a further monopoly which is going to operate as a bottle neck through which all exports of fresh meat from this country must go, and the monopolists who constitute that bottle neck are going to be privileged to skim off all our exports the largest profit they can knock out of them.  Such a situation is absolutely intolerable.  If gigantic profits are to be made by monopolists, sooner or later the people will insist <Col N="3006" /> that those gigantic profits go into the Treasury for the relief of general taxation and for the relief of the people. They will not tolerate a diversion of the immense profits there are in monopolies into the pockets of private individuals. If you are going to leave monopolies in private hands, you are going to have a situation arising in the fresh meat business similar to that arising in the pig industry at the present time.  Monopolists become so arrogant and extortionate that they kill the demand for the product on the home market, and they so skin the producer in trying to make ends meet at the price which these monopolists are prepared to pay for the product, that the producer begins to get out of the business, to the immense detriment of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>But before the monopolist has driven the producer and the consumer to that point, he has made his pile and he has invested in good marketable securities upon which he will be drawing dividends for the rest of his life.  He does not care then what happens to the business.  He has skimmed the cream of it, he is rich for the rest of his life, but the community loses the business and the trade.  The individual farmer who produces suffers because he cannot go on producing; the consumer suffers inasmuch as he has to go without that commodity because he cannot afford to buy it, and the nation suffers because the national income is reduced by an amount equal to the reduction in the farmers' output.  That is the story of the monopoly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has calmly announced to-day that his purpose is to establish a new monopoly which is going to dominate and strangle the entire export business of this country in fresh meat and he says that he is resolved to prevent competition.  He will not allow it and he justifies himself by saying: &ldquo;When I did try to allow competition in the bacon industry, I was inundated with resolutions begging me not to do it.&rdquo;  We found out on investigation that the resolutions came from the immediate neighbourhood of a curer who is afraid of competition.  If competition were allowed, he would be forced to pay more to the pig producers than if the monopoly were allowed to <Col N="3007" /> operate.  Do Deputies stand for that? Surely the Deputy sitting up there on the Back Bench does not stand for that?  Does he take the view that the pig producers of Donegal should be left in the hands of one curer?  Does Deputy Breslin of West Donegal take the view that it is not right that the people of that area who work hard should be given the benefits of the highest prices that they can secure by competition for the pigs they produce? I think that the pig producer is entitled to get the highest price that competition between manufacturers will procure for him.</P>

      <P>In the greater part of the country we had a live pig fair.  If I went to a fair, and found a small group of buyers there from one district who might have arranged to pay no more than a certain price, I walked my pigs home on foot and I brought them to the next fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the passing of the Pigs and Bacon Act, we had competition and the result was that the producer got a better price.  I know the Minister will immediately reply: &ldquo;You are getting more for your pigs now than you got a couple of years ago.&rdquo; That is probably true, but we are paying twice as much for feeding-stuffs. The world price of pork goes up when the price of maize goes up, and taking into consideration the price of feeding-stuffs, the absence of competition is weighing very heavily against the producer at the present time, and the result is that people are going out of pigs.  Now, the Minister will reply: &ldquo;I am now guaranteeing 73/- per cwt. for suitable pigs and the farmers are getting that.&rdquo;  The fact is that they do not get it because they are entirely at the mercy of the monopolist.  They have no fair, and if they have only a couple of pigs to sell they have got to take them to the nearest factory because it is not economic to consign them to a factory 30 or 40 miles away. When they go into that factory they are told: &ldquo;These pigs are Grade C.&rdquo; You may tell them that they have a Grade A pig, but, in practice, the producer <Col N="3009" /> merely gets paid for a Grade C or a Grade B pig.  If he had an opportunity of offering that pig at a fair and that three or four buyers wanted to get it, then the man who wanted it most would pay him the top price.</P>
      <P>Just as the monopoly in the bacon trade is destroying the pig industry of this country and will finally wipe it out, so the monopoly proposed in this measure will operate greatly to the disadvantage of the pork trade and the lamb trade.  I despair of making some Deputies see that.  Some Deputies must know these facts to be true.  They must know what an immense disadvantage it is to the farmer to have lost the fairs and to be in the hands of the monopolists, so far as the disposal of pigs is concerned.  Why should we extend the system?  Why should we put the control of the pork and lamb trade into the hands of a monopoly? Why should every man, who is prepared to earn his living, be delivered hand and foot into the hands of a monopoly?</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy is bona fide in his belief.  He has told us that there is a guaranteed market, but I have known farmers to spend a whole day outside a factory with their pigs and then to be told that the manufacturer did not want them and would not take them.  I have known farmers who had pigs finished up to what they considered the requisite standard, and when they went to the factory they were told that the factory could not take them and that they should bring them home for another fortnight.  Then when they brought them back at the end of a fortnight they were told that the pigs were too fat, with the result that they were cut <Col N="3010" /> in price 8/- to 12/- per cwt.  That is what is called a guaranteed market. It is a guaranteed market for the curers.  Heretofore a man could bring his pigs out to a fair and he could find a buyer for them.</P>

      <P>By leave of the Chair we have covered a good deal of ground, but we must not trespass too far on the Chair's indulgence.  The case I am making is this: monopoly has reacted to the disadvantage of the producer and to the disadvantage of the consumer.  The Minister has calmly announced here that his object is to create a monopoly in the fresh meat trade.  Is this House going to let him do it, or is there anybody on the Fianna Fáil side who has the courage to get up and speak on behalf of the producers of fresh meat, asking the Minister to leave the competition that was there for the things they are producing, in the certain knowledge that if he stops that competition it means that the producer of fresh meat is going to get less money for his product?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to keep to the matter before the House, Sir.  However, I shall now deal with Deputy Dillon's argument in connection with the bacon factories and the monopoly, and the loss to the producer and the farmer in that particular respect.  If Deputy Dillon had had any association with farming in his lifetime, he must have gone to a fair and he must have seen a meeting of the different pig buyers outside the railway station, fixing the price that they would pay for pigs at that particular fair.  If Deputy Dillon had had any association with farming, he would have seen, down through the country, where, if a farmer refused the price offered by one pig buyer, no other pig buyer would buy from him.  If Deputy Dillon never went to a fair at all, all he had to do was to look at the newspapers and he would notice a difference of from 5/- to 6/- per cwt. at two different fairs, not 13 miles apart, on the same day.  Deputy Dillon would have seen all these things if he were by any means interested. Where was the competition there? Where was there competition when, at two different local fairs on the one day, there was a difference in the price of from 5/- to 6/- per cwt. in pigs?  I suppose nobody was robbed in those days?</P>
      <P>Then, as regards Deputy Dillon's charge about the enormous profits made by bacon factories, that matter was thrashed out here within the last few weeks.  Deputy Gorey made a certain statement here, and the Minister for Agriculture produced the balance sheet, which completely upset Deputy Gorey's contention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I think it unfair that a Deputy in this House should use his position here, for the purpose of helping out his argument, to make false and misleading statements in connection with men who cannot defend themselves here, or in connection with firms who cannot defend themselves here.  I think it is grossly unfair to do so, and I think that Deputy Dillon should take the earliest opportunity that he can find either to prove that his statements are true&mdash;by doing which he would confer a benefit on the general community&mdash;or else that he should have the decency to withdraw the charges he has made.  As I have said, I think it is grossly unfair that such statements should be made.  I think that Deputy Dillon's attitude in that respect is very unfair.</P>

      <P>In the whole period that has been used for the purpose of opposition to this Bill two arguments have been put up with regard to certain facilities that were given in connection with flour milling and the bacon industry.  In that connection, I need only quote one of the high priests, as we call him, of Deputy Dillon's Party in <Col N="3017" /> my constituency, who stated openly and above board that the Pigs Marketing Board had increased the price of pigs by anything from 10/- to 15/- per cwt. to the producer.  That statement was made by Mr. E.J. Cussen, the Secretary of the Cork Farmers' Union, and that was an open statement made by him at a Fine Gael Committee of Agriculture. Therefore, Sir, it is my belief that the arguments that have been produced against this Bill do not hold water on either side, and I consider that Deputy Dillon should withdraw his charges.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon made a very moving speech about monopolies and so on, and those of us who know him were not very much affected, but if a stranger were listening to the Deputy he would have seen nothing but red ruin and disaster coming into this country if this amending Bill were passed, and it would have appeared as if we were going to do something that had never been done before. Hitherto we have acted on the assumption that we had the power suggested here, but some people held that they were not quite sure whether or not we had that power, and that, if the matter were contested in court, it was possible that we might be beaten.  Whether or not that was the case, the fact is that for the last seven years we have acted on that assumption, and all those terrible things that Deputy Dillon has outlined for us have not happened; at any rate, things were not so serious as Deputy Dillon would lead us to believe.  Deputy Dillon talks about the monopoly created under the Bacon Bill, but that was in the original Bill and Deputy Dillon did not object to <Col N="3018" /> that power at the time.  As a matter of fact, I should like to have an even bet with Deputy Dillon&mdash;of course, we are not allowed to bet across the House, but I should like to have a bet with him that he appealed to me at that time not to use that power unnecessarily. I remember distinctly that he asked me a question as to where did I think we would have to use that power, and, as far as I remember, I answered that it would be only in Donegal, and he was pleased at that.</P>

At any rate, that is my recollection&mdash;that Deputy Dillon's view was that we should not use that power too freely.  Now, however, without any thought, he gets up and makes a speech, and incidentally makes a fool of himself, because he is in favour of the amendment in Deputy Bennett's name.  If it were my amendment, he would make an equally as long and irrelevant and foolish speech on the other side.  The Deputy is quite capable of doing so.  I am going to tell the Deputy what the Bacon Bill has accomplished in connection with the price of pigs.  They are getting 72/- for pigs now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the Deputy's figures, 4/6 and 10/-.  Of course, they are not the correct figures, but, as he put them that way, I will accept them. The difference in the price of a pig was £2 2s. 0d. for a 12-stone, dead-weight, pig, as between December, 1931, and December, 1937.  Feeding four pigs to the ton of meal, you could afford £8 8s. a ton or 8/6 a cwt. more for meal and still be as well off.  The Deputy talks about being the director of a factory producing 250 pigs in the year, and the whole tenor of his speech was that the farmers did not rear pigs because they found it did not pay.  It does not pay the Deputy to rear pigs, he tells us, and then he goes on to describe how he feeds them.  The fact of the matter is that he knows nothing about feeding them.  How could any man so ignorant of the basic facts in relation to the feeding of pigs make them pay?</P>
      <P>The suggestion of a monopoly has been made.  This is not a further monopoly.  This legislation is to remove any doubts there are in regard to the original Act, doubts which my predecessor thought were there and which I thought were there and which, perhaps, are there.  I do not know; I am not a lawyer.  This amending legislation is brought in to remove these doubts and to see that the power is there.  Deputy Corry was quite right.  Deputy Dillon talked about competition.  I remember when we brought in the original Bill and I stated then that we wanted to stop the system of having, as it were, two fairs on the same day, that we wanted to stop the practice then in existence. The Deputy referred to that as fair competition.  Certain curers quoted their prices in the papers and from day to day there was a change.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We set out to do better in regard to pigs and I believe we have <Col N="3020" /> done better, despite what Deputy Dillon and Deputy Gorey say.  The farmer knows what he is likely to get for his pigs and he is not left at the mercy of the fairs.  Deputy Dillon made a most injurious statement&mdash; that is, if anyone pays attention to what Deputy Dillon says.  He says that the poor farmer sends in a Grade. A pig and it is graded as Grade B or Grade C in the factory.  That is not true and the Deputy should not make a serious statement like that without ascertaining the facts.  We have a veterinary surgeon and a lay inspector in every factory to see that the pigs are properly graded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  The Minister is mistaken there.  In every factory, large or small?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In every registered factory the veterinary surgeon examines every pig.  In the bigger factories there are lay inspectors, but if there is no inspector in the smaller factory the veterinary surgeon supervises the grading.  If the Deputy has the interests of the farmers at heart and would like to see more pigs produced in this country, he ought to give as much publicity to the denial of his statement as he did to the actual statement. Of course, he will not do so, for political reasons.  He wants to be in a position, for political reasons, to come here or to go to County Monaghan and tell the people that the number of pigs is going down because of the policy of this Government. It is more important to the Deputy to get some political advantage out of this.  He told us that a farmer had to stand outside a factory all day and in the evening an official came out and told him to go home, that they would not take his pigs. Where did that happen?  In the beginning, when the factories were settling down to work, it might, to a small extent, have happened, but I can say within the last 12 months such a thing has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3021" /> The farmers are advised by Deputy Dillon and others not to take up the rearing of pigs, because if they do they would spoil Fine Gael propaganda. The Deputy is a member of a board that deals with the production of 250 pigs, and he comes here to talk with authority and he thinks the farmers will listen to him and not go into the production of pigs, and in that way, perhaps, Fine Gael will get a further lease of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talks about the prices since the Act came into operation.  Why have little girls been taken up for smuggling 9lbs. of bacon into the Free State from Northern Ireland?  Why does this occur?  Perhaps the Minister will explain.  I furnished him with facts and figures, and I tell him now that people have been taken up for smuggling a few lbs. of bacon from Northern Ireland.  I may also tell him that people have been smuggling pigs into Northern Ireland.  How will the Minister explain that?  The Minister mentioned that there were no applications for licences under the Pigs and Bacon Act turned down.  If this section is passed there will be no applications for licences to export fresh pork, for the reason that no one will be so foolish as to go to the expense of preparing premises when he knows that the granting of a licence will be at the absolute discretion of the Minister.  A man would be quite insane to apply for a licence or go to any expense in such circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Ministers want to find alibis why their pet schemes have collapsed.  It is gratifying to observe the Minister for Agriculture saying that.  After bleeding <Col N="3022" /> the country for six years he has now adopted the policy of the late Mr. Hogan&mdash;one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.  For ten years the Minister has stumped this country and he has denounced the late Mr. Hogan as a futility in his position, as the Minister for Grass, because his policy was one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.  He has spent six years in office and during that time he has devastated the entire agricultural industry, and now he announces that the soundest policy for agriculture is one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.  I did say to the Minister when he was discussing the Pigs and Bacon Bill that if he must have a home sales quota as well as an export sales quota it would be contrary to justice to take from the old factories part of their business and give it to other factories, without compensating the original factories; but if there was a free, open market to sell the bacon abroad or in Ireland to the best of your ability and supply your share to the British quota allocated by the Irish Government, then there need be no restriction on anybody going into the pig business.  Our case was that if you are going to restrict the total amount of pigs that may be cured in Ireland to a figure no greater than the number already cured by the cures in existence, you have no right to take part of their business and give it to somebody else by law without compensating them.  We made that case, and I would make it again to-morrow.  If you had it open without any restriction on the output, then it is ridiculous to argue that people can get competition with the existing curers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy did not argue that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would refresh his memory he would find that the case made was that so long as you restrict your output to the existing figure you have no right to take any part of that output without compensating the factories from whom you are taking it.  The Minister says that every pig slaughtered by a curer for <Col N="3023" /> conversion into bacon is inspected by a veterinary surgeon.  Is that true?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also true to say that if a substantial injustice is done on any of these premises, the Government has no means of testing.  When I made that statement here it was angrily controverted by the Minister as a statement made to deceive members of this House, because he said every pig was inspected by a veterinary surgeon.  Now the Minister has discovered that he made a mistake.  I would suggest to the Minister that the next time he gets up and gets vexed he would look before he leaps.  Then he would not be putting his foot in it so often.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The more this debate has advanced the more am I convinced that I was right when I introduced this amendment to the Minister's amending Bill.  The Minister made it plain in his latest utterance that he is out to create a monopoly in fresh meat just as he has been creating a monopoly in other things.  He has now let the cat out of the bag, though he did not do so when I brought forward my amendment on a former occasion. I said that if the amendment was not accepted that there was a vested interest being created in the trade. The Minister did not refer to that. But he was forced into it to-day by the enlargement of this debate into things with which it was not at first concerned.  We have it now at any rate that he wants to create a monopoly in this matter.  The Minister quoted several precedents to prove that he was right.  These were mainly about pigs.  I do not want to go very much into the pig industry.  When making my speech here I refrained from touching on any industry, pigs or flour or other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My mind was taken away from the consideration of this subject by the speech of Deputy Corry, who spoke for a considerable time and wasted the time of the House.  Yet he never referred to the amendment.  For that reason I say he treated the House with disrespect. One could not gather from his speech that there was anything such as an amendment or a Bill in relation to fresh meat before the House.  On this question I want to say that the Minister seemed at one time to be terribly afraid of a monopoly.  He said that under the existing Pigs Act the trend was the other way, that people were against having new factories.  I know the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not altogether in agreement with that view.  I am aware that certain interests <Col N="3025" /> object to any extinction of the bacon factories.  I used that as an argument for my amendment.  One of the reasons put forward was that it was against the interests of Labour.  I do not know that Labour advocates in this House should be altogether spokesmen for monopolies, or that they can accept the position that monopolies tend to increase employment.  If you have a number of people engaged in the same trade, it appears almost certain that the greater the number engaged in competition, the greater the volume of labour that will be employed.  The creation of one big central organisation tends to save labour.  If you have one central organisation handling a whole industry, less labour is sure to be employed.  In practice it will always be found that where you have a number of small organisations doing what one large one could do, more labour will be entailed.  This is inevitable where you have a group of competitors rather than where the work is done under the control of an amalgamated industry which handles the whole trade.</P>

I am very definitely concerned with the producer, and it is because I am concerned with the producer and with the people who handle the producer's goods that I have tabled the amendment to the Amending Bill. The Minister made no attempt whatsoever to justify Section 2 of this Amending Bill.  The Minister did not say definitely that his operations were <Col N="3026" /> hindered in any way.  The objection he made to the operations of the Principal Act proved conclusively that it tended largely to create a monopoly which in point of fact he desires to create now. When speaking on the last day the Minister said that the Principal Act had the effect of putting a number of people who were not desirable out of business. The Minister had in the Principal Act put a number of people whom he thought undesirable out of business already.  But he did not think that was sufficient.  Now he comes with this Amending Bill to make it possible to put a further number out of business and possibly to prevent anyone coming into the business, whether such a person was desirable or not.</P>

      <P>The Government are going to extend that policy in every way they can and do away with the powers of Parliament.  We have a development of monopolies, so that the small private trader can be put out of business, leading to a system of business monopoly everywhere.  We shall have a few huge industries in Dublin, Cork and a few other places and all competition will be eliminated.  The Minister argued that it was not fair, when pigs were sold from fair to fair, that one man should get 5/- more than another.  The Minister knows that that practice exists everywhere and that it will obtain so long as there are good sellers and bad sellers and good buyers and bad buyers.  A good seller will get more than a bad seller, and a good buyer will purchase more cheaply than <Col N="3028" /> will a bad buyer.  The Minister knows that that practice existed in the pig business and that there was no objection to it.  It still exists in the cattle business.  Everybody knows that there may be a difference of 5/- in price between two fairs or even in the same fair, dependent upon the seller or the buyer.  That does not say that the system is wrong.  I should like to see the Minister or any Deputy get up and say that the cattle fairs should be abolished and that the system which obtains in the case of bacon should apply in the case of cattle.  The Minister has advanced no argument which would justify any Deputy in supporting Section 2 of this Bill.  He has not shown that there is any necessity for it.  He wants to create a monopoly and he intends to create a monopoly.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was drawing the attention of the Minister to the very grave injustice that exists in the suburbs of Cork City in connection with the rate of unemployment assistance paid there, and I was expressing the hope that he would succeed in remedying that state of affairs under this Bill.  Under the new housing policy of the Government, a large number of tenements in Cork City have been closed down and hundreds of families have been transferred outside the borough boundaries to new houses built by the corporation. A large number of those people are unemployed.  When working, they are city workers, but owing to the fact that they live outside the borough boundaries their rates of assistance are reduced by from 4/6 to 9/- a week. That is, in the first place, an injustice to the families because the sole reason for their removal outside the borough boundaries was the clearance of slum areas inside, and the South Cork Board of Assistance found that it had to make up that sum to them.  The board found that it meant an additional £35 or £40 a week to them.  In other words, the bill for home assistance was increased by something close on £2,000 yearly, and the greater portion of it, £1,600, had to be borne by the rural community which had no responsibility for the removal of these people from the city.  It was bad enough that out of the £40,000 paid for home assistance in South Cork area, £28,600 had to be paid by the rural community.  In addition to providing for their own poor they had to provide £15,600 for the poor of Cork City. Now, owing to the anomaly caused by the transfer of these people outside the borough, another £1,500 had been added to the bill.  I suggest that the Minister should find some means to remedy that state of affairs seeing that these people were city workers, were probably born in the City of Cork, and spent all their lives there.  Because of the mere fact that Cork Corporation built houses outside the borough boundary, this extra £1,500 should not fall on the rural ratepayers.  It was bad enough that these ratepayers in the rural area had to pay £15,600 for the poor of Cork City in addition to their own home assistance bill.  As the Minister is amending the Act, I suggest that he should find some means to remedy the present position.  The matter has been repeatedly brought to his notice by me during the past two years and the answer has been that it could only be remedied by legislation.  As this is an amending Bill, I suggest that this is the time to remedy the position by legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exactly six years since this Government took office. Before taking office they publicly pledged themselves to the people, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to put into operation a plan which would wipe out unemployment in this State.  After six years' experience as a Government we are confronted to-day with a Bill which roughly proposes to deal with the amount of unemployment assistance to be provided for approximately 100,000 able-bodied citizens.  I understood at the time&mdash;and I hope I was right&mdash;that it was the deliberate and declared policy of Fianna Fáil that they had a plan to solve the problem of unemployment, and that failing an attempt to find work for them immediately, they would provide a reasonable standard of maintenance.  The Minister, when speaking on this Bill, admitted that the rates provided for maintenance by way of unemployment assistance under the present Act could not be regarded as generous.  He now comes along with this Bill to increase the present miserable allowance by a miserable 10 per cent. or 15 per cent., ignoring altogether the fact that even 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. would not meet the increased cost of living since the original Act was passed.  If it is the duty of a Christian Government&mdash;and this Government claims to be a Christian Government&mdash;to provide work for able-bodied citizens, then it is at the expense of the taxpayers and not at the expense of the ratepayers that maintenance of these people should be provided at a generous rate.  As in the case of the original Act, I object to any part of the money being found by increasing the local rates.  Local authorities cannot regulate the number of unemployed that may reside within their boundaries, and they should not be held responsible for any portion of the cost of maintaining unemployed people.  The Minister proposes to increase the existing rates in a number of areas throughout the State.  How can he suggest that the Borough Councils of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Dun Laoghaire or other corporations, or any of the additional areas that are to be brought into the <Col N="3032" /> scheme, could regulate the number of unemployed that should live in these areas?  It is the duty of a Government to find employment for the people, and failing to find employment for them to raise money to maintain them from whatever source it can be found.  It must be got by a Government that claims to be a Christian Government from those who are best able to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his usual debating style, asked the Labour Party to state what additional taxation they would impose and what additional items they would tax, to find any money that was necessary to provide increased maintenance allowances for the unemployed. That is the duty of the Minister and his colleagues in the Government. That is what they were put into office to do.  If I had the responsibility of finding money for the maintenance of the unemployed I would tax luxury articles certainly.  I would tax those people who are best able to pay for the maintenance of their unfortunate fellow-countrymen, who are unable to find work but willing to take it if they could get it.  The Minister, of course, did not in any enthusiastic way suggest that the allowances to be provided under this Bill were either reasonable or generous.  When this Bill becomes law it will be possible for a man with a wife and five children in the rural areas to get what the Minister would, I suppose, now regard as the generous allowance of 14/- a week.  Under the existing British Unemployment Assistance Act a man and his wife would get 24/- a week.  The youngest child in the family would get an allowance under existing British legislation at the rate of 4/- a week.  In rural Ireland a man, his wife and five children are supposed to be able to exist and to provide the necessaries of life, food, clothing, and shelter on the allowance set out in this amending legislation of 14/- a week.  I hope the Minister will not go back to the hall in Oriel Street and boast about the generosity of the allowances he is providing under this Bill.  When listening to the Minister's speech this evening it struck me that this Bill was thought out and framed in the secrecy <Col N="3033" /> of the Oriel Street hall of the Wolfe Tone Fianna Fáil Cumann, rather than in a considered way by himself and his colleagues in the Cabinet room at Government Buildings.</P>

Years ago 6/- a week was provided by local authorities as home assistance for the destitute poor.  Probably the Minister copied the figure from the books of local authorities.  That sum was provided years ago, before the cost of living had reached its present level.  The Minister, by way of interruption, endeavoured to convey to the House that the maximum allowance provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act, even when this Bill comes into operation, can be supplemented by grants or allowances from the local authority. I invite the Minister to repeat that statement and quote his authority for it when he is replying.</P>

I dare say he would not get anybody who has ever had to make application for unemployment assistance, whether married or single, or whether living in a city or in a rural area, to say that the Act has been administered in anything like a generous way.  The means test has been applied, presumably on the instructions of the Minister for Finance, in such a way as to make it almost impossible for people to qualify for the payment of the maximum allowance provided.  When talking about the administration of the Act, what has the Minister to say with regard to the miserable treatment that he has meted out to the labour exchange managers for all the work they did in the initial stages, after the passing of the Act, for which they were paid nothing? Some of the unemployed in the cities and towns of the country who are drawing the miserable maximum allowances provided are certainly better off than some of the labour exchange managers engaged in administering the Act, and administering it in such a way, under instructions, as to prevent people getting what they are entitled to get.</P>

      <P>I am not going to admit that I welcome the introduction of this measure.  As Deputy Norton said, it is a slight improvement upon a very bad position so far as the unemployed population of this State are concerned. In view of the pre-general election promises that the Minister made in this House and throughout the country; in view of the Party's statement in 1932 that it was the policy of the Government to provide work, and that, in fact, they had a plan for the provision of work for all the unemployed population, and that, failing their efforts to find employment for them, they would immediately provide a maintenance allowance, and in view of the fact that the rates here set out are not reasonable or such as would enable the unemployed to secure the bare necessaries of life, I think the Minister should be ashamed to come to the House and attempt to justify the allowances set out in this amending Bill.  If the Minister compares them with the rates laid down in the Unemployment Assistance Act for Great Britain, I do not think he will be encouraged to go around the country, or into the hall in Oriel Street, and boast of the generous way in which this Government propose to treat in the future the 100,000 unemployed that we have here.</P>
      <P>Under the British Act, an unmarried male person can receive 16/- per week and a female 15/-.  A male person of 21 years and over who is not the owner of a house can receive 10/- per week and a female 9/-. There is also provision in the Act for unemployment assistance at the rate of 4/- per week for the youngest child in the country. In this country the able-bodied single man living in a rural area and unable to find work at present has to try to exist on the miserable sum of 6/- per week.  The Minister should be ashamed of his Bill, but, bad and all as it is, it is a slight improvement on the miserable pittance provided under the existing legislation.</P>

      <P>The same thing was repeated in 1933 at the election.  The Deputy ought to remember, when he asks what additional taxes we are going to support to provide for the unemployed, that the Minister who is now in charge of the Bill, and all his colleagues, told the people that if they returned Fianna Fáil as the Government no additional taxation would be required; not only that, but that the existing taxation would be reduced by at least £2,000,000 without causing injury to any section of the community. That was followed up by the &ldquo;plan&rdquo; that we saw in every newspaper, posted at every church gate, at every cross roads, and on every tree&mdash;&ldquo;Fianna Fáil has a plan.&rdquo;  A few of the industries that were to be started were to absorb 80,000 odd of the unemployed. When it was pointed out to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or Deputy Lemass as he then was, that there was not at that time that number of unemployed in the country, he said: &ldquo;It does not matter, we will be able to send to America for those who were forced to emigrate, and bring them back to fill the jobs at home.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give the Minister and the Deputy credit for good intentions.  Their intentions were one thing, but their performances were very different, as the unemployed have very good reason to know.  When that was put to the Minister before in this House his reply was: &ldquo;But we have put 80,000 into employment.&rdquo;  We still have 100,000 signing the unemployment registers, notwithstanding the fact that another 100,000 have gone out of the country in the last three or four years to Great Britain.  So that we <Col N="3040" /> find this position.  The Minister says he has put 80,000&mdash;I think he claimed 100,000 the last time he spoke on the matter in this House&mdash;into employment; another 100,000 have gone to Great Britain; another 100,000 are still lining up at the labour exchanges; and all that in a falling population. The Minister I know can do many strange things with figures when he starts, but it would take even more than the Minister to reconcile those figures.</P>
      <P>The Minister said a moment ago that he never claimed that the Government were providing maintenance for the unemployed.  Does the Minister deny that he promised maintenance for the unemployed?  Does he deny that the Fianna Fáil Party promised the people that they would provide full employment for every man and woman willing and able to work, and, pending the fulfilment of that, that they would provide maintenance?  Was it not on a particular motion moved in this House in 1932, tying the Government to that particular promise of maintenance, that the Fianna Fáil Government suffered its only defeat in this House?  Does not the Minister remember that?  The Minister comes here, as well as those who sit behind him, six years after they made their promise, and the net result is, not that there is reduced unemployment, but that there is greatly increased unemployment.  If emigration to Great Britain had not been so great for the last three years, instead of having 100,000 signing the unemployment registers, we would have nearer to 200,000.  Those are facts which cannot be denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, as Deputy Davin pointed out, thought it right and proper to go to a place other than this House to make the first official announcement about this addition for the unemployed.  I can understand that the Minister was not anxious to put this Bill under the searchlight of this House, where it could be met and criticised, before he had put it across the country, so to speak.  He wanted to talk about it in a place where it could not be criticised.  He wanted to give the <i>Irish Press</i> the opportunity of making full use of it in its columns <Col N="3041" /> and to present to the unemployed what this Government of the poor were prepared to do for them.  It all boils down to this&mdash;that what the Minister is providing here in this Bill is of less value to the unemployed than what he provided in his original Bill in 1933. I should like to hear the Minister challenge that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Anyone who can do a simple sum in arithmetic will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may do a sum in arithmetic, but it will not be a very simple one.  There is nothing very simple about the Minister or his sums.  The Minister, after six years, should be ashamed to have to sponsor a Bill like this, the Minister who for two years before he came into office stumped the country&mdash;I pay a tribute to his industry and perseverance, if I can pay a tribute to nothing else&mdash; telling all sections of the people, and in particular the workers and the unemployed, how badly they were being treated and what he and his Party would do if sent back as the Government.  Many of the unemployed, perhaps the majority of them, fell for that and they put the Minister in.  He has been here now for six years, and the position of the unemployed to-day is infinitely worse than it was before the present Government came into power, and, what is worse still, more hopeless than it was six years ago.  Any person who is in actual personal touch with the unemployed and the workers of the country knows that.  The Minister says that he did not claim that this was maintenance. What does he claim for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unemployment assistance; that is what it is called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister is not fulfilling the promise, or rather the statement, made by the Minister, by his President, and by his colleagues, that it was the duty of the Government to provide either work or maintenance for every person in the country willing to work.  The Minister has provided neither one nor the other on his own admission.  Fourteen shillings <Col N="3042" /> a week, with the cost of living at the figure it is to-day, for a man with a wife and four, five or six children!  The Minister tells us the Government will not interfere if local authorities see fit to increase that from local funds.  Some local authorities might desire to increase it, but many of them feel they are not in a position to do so because rates and taxes are already sufficiently high.  The Minister nods his head at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thinks the rates should not be increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister contend now that it is the duty of the Government and not the duty of the local authority to provide for the unemployed? That is what he is running away from.  The Government bring forward this scheme and they make the local authorities pay for it.  The Minister is going back to the old saying that &ldquo;it is the poor who always help the poor,&rdquo; because he is robbing another £50,000 out of the Unemployment Fund, the fund built up by those who are to-day in work to be there to meet their requirements when they are out of employment.  These are the facts, and the Minister knows it.  All the Minister's eloquence, all his thumping, and the inspired leading articles are not going to get away from these facts.  They cannot get away from it. Small as the rates are in the cities, boroughs and towns, they are still smaller in the rural areas, still smaller in towns with a population of 5,000 or 6,000.  Does the Minister not know that in many of these towns the cost of living is as high if not higher than in the City of Dublin or in Dun Laoghaire and that so far as essentials are concerned, the cost of living is very little different?  There may be one item which is less expensive&mdash;a very important item, I admit&mdash;namely, rent.  So far as other essentials are concerned, in many cases they cost as much, if not more, as in the cities and larger towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin contrasted the provisions for the unemployed made across the water with what is done here.  I do not want to argue very strongly along these lines.  I am not one of those who ever believed that we had <Col N="3043" /> the same resources as the people on the other side, but there is the fact that not only are they getting much more in actual cash, but they are getting much more in actual cash in a country where the cost of living is lower than it is here.  The Minister does not agree that the cost of living has gone up at all in this country. The Minister will not agree that the 4-lb. loaf which costs 8d. or 8½d. across the water costs 1/- in the City of Dublin.  The Minister does not like to be faced with these facts.  Even Deputy Corry had to enter a protest at the way in which the Minister and his colleagues were saving revenue and attempting to provide this money at the expense of the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The Minister is so intelligent that in attempting to see everything he sees nothing, the Minister's intelligence is so wide and so all-embracing. It is, of course, in keeping with the policy of the Government that they should pass on this taxation to the ratepayers.  They have already passed on taxation to the consumers of this country.  They have passed it on, proportionately, in greater measure to the unemployed and the workers than to any other section. The wheat subsidy was originally met from central funds, but it has now been passed on as a direct charge to the consumer, to the workers and to the very poor.  These, because of their poverty, have to rely more upon bread than perhaps the better-off sections of the people.  The same thing applies to the sugar subsidy.  The sugar subsidy, which originally was met out of national revenue, was passed on and became a direct charge on the consumer <Col N="3044" /> also.  I do not think that it will be contended, even by the Minister, that in regard to these two items the workers do not contribute, in proportion, a far greater amount of the subsidies than the better-off people. Again, that is in keeping with the policy of the Government, and the only man on the Government Benches who did not try to deny it, the only man who admitted it plainly, bluntly and forcibly in this House, was the Parliamentary Secretary.  Deputy Flinn.  He asked, &ldquo;Why should the poor not be taxed?&rdquo;</P>

Will the Minister address himself to this fact: that there are to-day in this country more registered unemployed than there were in 1932?

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to submit, if I may with all respect, that it is very hard to divorce the number of unemployed in the country from the amount of money which it is proposed to spread amongst that number.  My speech might be summed up in this way, if I may say so.  I meet Deputy Tom Kelly's point as to what additional taxation on luxury articles we stand for by suggesting that he might ask the Minister and the Government, who told us that not only would there be no need for increased taxation but there would be a reduction of £2,000,000 without injury to any section of the people.  There need be no increase in <Col N="3046" /> taxation if the Government carried out their promises, because there would be no unemployment in this country. Notwithstanding all the efforts made by the Government, notwithstanding all the new industries, notwithstanding the 100,000 who have gone to Great Britain, we find ourselves after six years of Fianna Fáil government with 100,000 still signing the register.  That is the figure with which the Minister has got to deal, not with what Deputy Norton or Deputy Davin or I may say here.  The Minister may answer us as glibly as he likes.  The Minister may beat the desk and thunder and orate, but all the orations of the Minister and all the thumping and all the figures and all the sums in arithmetic, simple and otherwise, are having very little effect upon the 100,000.  That is the problem which the Minister has got to face, and he is not going to solve it by a Bill that will give some of them, and only some of them, a mere existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that the increased rates are a very miserable contribution to the principle of maintenance for the unemployed&mdash;the Minister now tells us that he does not mean &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;&mdash;at the same time I should like to point to some of the anomalies under this Bill.  In a borough, a man and his wife receive 15/- a week.  A man and his wife and five or more children receive 23/- a week.  I take it that the extra 8/- are to provide for the five or more children.  Outside the boroughs, in the rural areas, a man and his wife get 10/-, while a man and his wife and five or more children get 14/-.  In this case, I take it that the 4/- are allowed to provide for the five children.  I think that one great principle is violated in those Maintenance and Assistance Acts which we have known so far, by the very small value placed on child life.  I think that child life should be looked upon as one of the greatest assets we have in the country, but, in judging the mentality of the Government with regard to the value of child life, we have to consider the fact that only 8/- a week are allowed for five or more children inside the boroughs and 4/- for five or more <Col N="3047" /> children outside the boroughs.  Unemployment and the evils of unemployment press more heavily on children and on growing people than on adults, and I think the amount provided for children should be much greater than it is under this proposed Bill or under the Act which this Bill is supposed to amend.</P>
      <P>I have spoken of the anomaly of the amount allowed for children outside and inside the boroughs, but there is another anomaly to which reference was made by Deputy Corry&mdash;I think it is rather peculiar to Cork&mdash;and that is in the case of people who have been taken from slum areas in the city. They have been part and parcel of the city life, and, through the clearance of those areas they have been put into corporation houses, by the action of the corporation for their own advantage, outside the city area.  Immediately they leave the city area and go just outside the borough the amount of unemployment assistance they receive is reduced.  Take the case of a man with a wife and five children, who is unemployed in the city.  That man receives 23/- a week.  If he goes outside the city, under this Bill he will receive 14/- a week; that is a loss of 9/- a week.  What I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister is that that man has been removed outside the city, and has been placed in that position through no fault of his own.  It is simply that he came under this slum clearance order of the corporation. You cannot by any manner of means divorce his method of living from that of the city.  He still has to buy his provisions in the city.  He still looks to the city for employment, if he can get it.  Under the rotational schemes he is denied the right to work in the city under the city relief schemes, so there is a double hardship created.  That anomaly is particularly apparent when we consider the fact that that man and his family have been brought from the slum area to better housing conditions for the benefit of their health.  Immediately, the amount that is allowed for the necessities of life is reduced.  Therefore, although they gain in the way of fresh air, they have less to buy food and to pay rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3048" /> Deputy Corry has mentioned that matter to the Minister, and in reply to Deputy Morrissey I think he said he was quite clear on it.  I hope that it may be possible under this Bill to amend that position.  You should not reduce the unemployment assistance of a man who was unemployed in the city, and who was transferred just outside the city borough, where he is still &mdash;I want to emphasise that point&mdash;part and parcel of the city life.  He has no connection with rural life as we understand it, although he is in the rural area, and his unemployment assistance should not be reduced owing to that transference of his residence.  I want particularly to stress that point.  I also want to say that I understand the Cork Corporation has requested the Minister to deal with that anomaly under this Bill.  I hope it will be possible. I am sure the Minister, seeing the hardship that is being inflicted on those people by that transference, will take the necessary steps to amend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the people in the rural areas.  Take the case of a widower.  He may be living in his own house, and he is treated as an ordinary boy of 20 or 21 years of age.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the increase in the cost of living in the rural areas.  Take the county home in Rathdrum, Co. Wicklow, which is considered a rural area.  The average maintenance per inmate for the period ended September, 1937, cost 6/6 per week.  That is for food alone, although the food is bought in huge quantities &mdash;tons of sugar, tons of flour and meat in bulk.  If it costs the board of health 6/6 per inmate per week, how can the Minister expect a single man to maintain himself and pay rent for his house on 6/-?  I will give the figures for the last three years for the county homes in the rural areas.  For instance, bread, in 1935, was 6d. for a 4-lb. loaf and, in 1937, it was 8¼d.&mdash;probably supplied by the 100 dozen a day.  Mutton was at 5d. per lb., and it is 6½d. per lb. in 1937.  Then you had bacon at 6d. per lb. in 1935, and at 11½d. in 1937, and you had butter at 1/-, and ½ per lb., and so on.  These are the prices in <Col N="3049" /> quotation in our contract with the county home at the present time.</P>
      <P>In view of the increased cost of living in the rural areas, I am surprised at the Minister bringing in a measure of this kind.  I am not like some members of the House who say that the country cannot afford this.  I say that the country can afford it, and that they can well afford to maintain the unemployed people of this country; and I say that, from the national point of view, nobody will object to making proper provision for the maintenance of the unemployed. I hold that it would be far cheaper for the Government to provide maintenance for the unemployed in a national way, instead of asking the public bodies to maintain them, because the position will be that, if you are going to make the local bodies contribute £100,000 to maintain the unemployed, and if you have robbed the road fund and the unemployment fund, then you are going to rob the aged and infirm, because the public boards will have to reduce the amount they are giving for that purpose at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have figures here with regard to mental hospitals in this country, and these figures show that the cost of living has increased by £3 per patient in the last three years.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister comes in here and states that the people in the rural areas will be no worse off under the new Bill than they were three years ago, although we know they will receive less.  We have a few Labour representatives on the public boards, and I must give them this credit: that wherever they find that an unemployed man is waiting to receive his donation from the unemployment grant from the Minister, we try to give him an allowance to keep him during the period while he is waiting to receive his allowance back from the Labour Exchange.  I say there is too much unnecessary delay in dealing with men's claims.  For instance, take the case of the rotational schemes.  You have the case of men who were dismissed on the 23rd of December, and it was not until last week that they received their first week's pay, and the board of health has to make an allow ance to these people while they are waiting.  They do not receive from the <Col N="3050" /> Minister's Department what they are entitled to receive weekly.  Then, apart from the miserable allowance itself, the Minister should have some arrangement whereby these men would be guaranteed that they would receive, say, next week, their payment in respect of this week, and the boards of health should not be expected to maintain them.  In the case of Minor relief schemes, we have men not being paid for a fortnight, and during that fortnight the board of health in the area concerned is expected to give some relief or some allowance to these people in respect of the fortnight they were employed on the Minor relief schemes. Actually, the public bodies are doing more than their share, and certainly more than the national Exchequer is doing, to relieve the unemployed.  The public bodies at the present time have to raise about 40 per cent. of the moneys for relief works.  In other words, they are bound to give a certain proportion out of the rates.  Now you are going to raise £100,000 in order to supplement this miserable allowance that you are giving to the unemployed, and you will find, as a result, that the public bodies are coming to the position where they will say: &ldquo;Why not let everybody share the burden; why should this not be a national charge?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that money expended on the provision of work or in giving an unemployed man sufficient to maintain himself and his family would be money well spent.  Surely the Minister does not expect a man in a rural area, with his wife and five children to be able to maintain himself and his family on £35 a year&mdash;less than £5 per year per person.  I have some figures here with regard to mental hospitals and with regard to what is needed to maintain a patient in a mental hospital.  It takes £43 per year in Waterford, £45 15s. 5d. in Ardee, and £51 3s. 11d. in Grange-gorman.</P>
    <P>That is for food alone and takes no account of the payment of salaries of officials and so on.  It takes £51 in Dublin to maintain a mentally afflicted patient, but the Minister expects people with families to maintain themselves and pay their rent and so on for about £30 or £40 a year.  As I <Col N="3051" /> have said, I am quite satisfied that the country can well afford to bear this cost, but it should be a matter for the whole country, and the local bodies should not be asked to bear this.  The country can afford it, because each person who is in receipt of this money will pay his share of it in the increased rents and rates.  I do not welcome this Bill, because it is not giving any benefit to the unemployed man other than giving him some slight sop towards enabling him to meet the increased cost of living.  The Minister dare not go to the country on this Bill. He has talked about the Labour Party going conservative.  He ought to look back on some of his own speeches, when he was in opposition and when he told the Fine Gael Party that about 5 per cent. of the people of this country, because of their wealth, were ruling the country.  I agreed with the Minister then and I believed he was right at that time, but I am afraid he himself has gone more conservative now and has more consideration for the people of wealth&mdash;the 5 per cent. of the people of this country&mdash;than for the plain people.  It seems to me that it is to the 5 per cent. the Minister is now giving his support, but I would point out to him that it is the plain people who matter and who will always stand by the National Government. We know where the 5 per cent. will stand.  They will support the Government if it suits them, but if you go against the plain people, the plain people will go against the particular Government concerned, and the sooner they do so in that case the better for the country, if the Government of the country disregards the rights of the plain people.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we had Fianna Fáil members throughout the country promising us they had a plan that was going to solve unemployment.  A number of us believed they had such a plan.  I will not deny that I myself believed they had such a plan, but I have now been converted to the belief that Fianna Fáil are no better than Fine Gael.  Ministers may make speeches in the country to the effect that the cost of living has not gone up, and they may talk about the Labour <Col N="3052" /> Party embarrassing them.  I am glad that the Labour Party should embarrass the Government on such points as these if that embarrassment serves the purpose of making them fulfil some of the promises they made to relieve the destitute poor.  I admit that they made some effort, but they are going very slow now, and I say that the unemployed and the plain people of this country will get an opportunity very soon, and I hope they will not be deceived on the next occasion as they have been deceived on a previous occasion.  I am certain that they will not allow themselves to be deceived, and I am surprised that Deputy Tom Kelly should back up this measure and should congratulate the Minister on this wonderful achievement of the Fianna Fáil Government towards a solution of the unemployment problem in this country.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to give some consideration to the points raised by Deputy Corry and Deputy Hurley about people transferred from an urban to a rural area, and whose methods of livelihood are stile centred in the towns.  These people have already been in receipt of an urban rate of assistance and they will now go back to a rural rate.  I think it is a point that the Minister should seriously consider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister immediately shows prejudice by his interjection. I will preach it at home and, I hope with some effect preach it abroad.  When I say that it should be taken away from the realms of Party politics, I ask you to remember that in our country we have to face a problem of a character that does not call for politics.  We have over 100,000 people who are in very strained circumstances, <Col N="3053" /> and that is not an extraordinary exaggeration.  There is one anomaly in connection with this measure to which I would like to draw the attention of the House.  In the Bill there is a differentiation as between the benefits that are to be given to men with dependents and to women with dependents.  For example, a married man with a dependent wife is entitled to 15/-, but a married woman with a dependent husband is entitled to only 12/6.  I think that is a matter the Minister might seriously consider.</P>
      <P>So far as the amount indicated by the Minister is concerned, if one passes through the city streets one sees newspaper placards telling about the extra amount of money for the unemployed. When one calculates what the amount is to be, it works out at 1/- in one case. What an enormous expenditure!  Do Deputies realise the purchasing power of 1/- in this city at the moment?  It was pointed out by the last speaker that it takes £51 to feed a patient in Grangegorman Mental Hospital.  It must be realised that food is bought there on contract at a very much reduced price compared with what the unfortunate person receiving unemployment assistance has to pay to a retailer.  The £51 does not represent the actual figure that would have to be paid by an outside person, so far as food is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that when he is closing this debate he should give us some hope that additions will be made so as to make more adequate provision for those unfortunate people who cannot find employment.  The Government have told us that they are going to solve the unemployment problem and that they are giving an extra amount of money to the unemployed. That is the type of propaganda we have been treated to.  I think, however, that the Minister will admit that there is an anomaly here as between the amount allowed to the male and the female, and I think that is a point that is worthy of consideration and alteration.  While this measure can be regarded as a small improvement, it is really infinitesimal, hardly worth one's consideration.  If the Minister so <Col N="3054" /> desired, it could be made one of the best measures possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the conclusion of the Minister's speech he made this rather intriguing statement: &ldquo;I have endeavoured to strike a balance between the needs of the unemployed and the resources of the country.&rdquo;  I do not know whether that statement is to be taken seriously or whether we are simply to regard it as mere rhetoric.  I assume, however, that the Minister did mean the statement seriously.  Let us examine it and see what it does really mean.  Are we to assume from that statement that as the prosperity of this country increases, and naturally as a consequence the number of unemployed is reduced, that the rate of assistance to the remaining unemployed will be increased proportionately? And, following on that, are we to assume that as the country gets poor and the number of unemployed increases, the rate is to be reduced correspondingly?  Has any standard been established by the Minister's Department for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of assistance which the unemployed should receive in any particular set of circumstances, or is there anything in the nature of a scientific formula in this or any other country to establish the rate of assistance to be paid to the unemployed in a particular set of circumstances?</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister meant his statement to be taken literally. There is no question that under existing circumstances there is need for a reasonably substantial increase in the amount of public assistance.  There can be no doubt that, owing to the increased cost of living, there is need for a more substantial rate of assistance. Public boards, notably the boards of health, those of them whose estimates we have seen, have been forced to increase their demands for the coming year.  One very substantial item in the estimates of local authorities is the sum to be set aside for the purpose of increasing the amount of home assistance given to those in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing in this Bill to which I object very strongly.  It is apparently, the settled policy of the <Col N="3055" /> Minister to put ever-increasing obligations on public boards for the purpose of helping him in the solution of a problem which should primarily be the responsibility of the Government.  This Bill imposes still further liabilities and responsibilities on public boards and I have no doubt, following on the principle that has already been laid down, that in succeeding legislation ever-increasing burdens will be put on public bodies for the purpose of helping the Minister and the Government to assist in the solution of a problem which is essentially one for which the Government is solely liable.  The Minister should realise that if this policy is persisted in the position will be reached &mdash;perhaps sooner rather than later&mdash; when local authorities will be reduced to such a degree that they will find it impossible to estimate accurately for local services and at the same time make provision to meet obligations which the Government insist on imposing on them.</P>
    <P>The rates at the present time are sufficiently high.  In many counties the rates are so high that there are very many people who are unable to meet their liabilities in respect of them. Surely it should be the desire of the Government to come to the assistance of the ratepayers rather than impose fresh responsibilities and liabilities on them.  I object very strongly to the tendency on the part of the Minister, especially in legislation of this character, to impose ever-increasing responsibilities on the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible in the time available between now and nine o'clock to deal with any of the more controversial points raised.  I do not intend to do so.  Deputy Lawlor referred to the problem associated with the existence of unemployment amongst the workers.  In my opinion the acid test of the sincerity of any public person who intends to deal in any way with this problem of unemployment is his willingness to commit himself to some concrete suggestion for its amelioration.  By that acid test, not merely the members of the Labour Party but the members of the Fine Gael Party stand condemned by their speeches here to-day.  They shied away from any suggestion that they should commit themselves to any definite proposal of any kind for dealing with the unemployment problem. Here is a Bill designed to increase the rates of unemployment assistance.  The increases for which this Bill makes provision are going to cost the people of this country £125,000 a year, that is £125,000 in addition to that £1,250,000 now being spent upon this service.  A further increase over and above the rates contemplated in this measure is going to cost more money. We propose to get this £125,000 by various devices.  We propose to take £50,000 from the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  The Deputies opposite object to that.  But will they indicate any alternative source?  We propose to take £20,000 from certain local authorities.  They object to that.  But did any one of them suggest an alternative source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there not a suggestion made to take money from the profits made by some commercial undertakings?</P>

    <Col N="3057" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain suggestions were made about a luxury tax and the taxation of profits.  Something more concrete has to be done if this thing is to be tackled in a non-Party way. The attitude of the Parties opposite is that not merely £125,000 is to be obtained without touching any of the sources we intend to touch, but that a much larger amount should have been made available to deal adequately with the problem.  Whatever that increase is, it is something over and above that for which this Bill provides. Therefore, a much larger sum is to be procured for the purpose of dealing with these services.  That is the whole problem.</P>
      <P>We did not approach the preparation of this unemployment assistance scheme with the cost in mind.  Nobody ever suggested, and it is not now suggested, that it is possible for any family of the categories described in the schedule to this Bill to maintain themselves on the weekly allowances specified there.  We know definitely that they could not maintain themselves upon these amounts if they had no other source of revenue.  But we approached the problem from an entirely different angle.  We asked ourselves what is the maximum amount of money we could make available for this service.  We decided that the most we could be justified in asking the taxpayer to provide was £1,000,000 yearly.  In fact, the service is costing more than £1,000,000 yearly since it was established.  It was a new service and that money had to be got by taxation. New imposts had to be imposed on the commercial activities of this country.  We carried the unpopularity of having to impose these taxes on industry.  We were criticised by the Opposition Parties inside and outside the Dáil because of our raising the burden of taxation and placing new imposts upon the people.  These new imposts were necessary for the purpose of getting this service of £1,000,000 for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite are speaking glibly about the State being responsible for unemployment.  The State never undertook the responsibility of assisting the unemployed before 1934. <Col N="3058" /> Before that it was the theory of Government accepted here by the Fine Gael Party that the relief of distress resulting from unemployment was the sole responsibility of the local authorities. In fact, until 1929 the local authorities were debarred by law from coming to the relief of able-bodied persons.  It was not until 1929 that the first Act was passed which enabled local authorities to give home assistance to able-bodied men.  Previously there was no provision for the able-bodied unemployed at all.  It was not until 1934 that this Government, this State, undertook the responsibility of directly providing for unemployed persons. It was then that this scheme of unemployment insurance was started, for which £1,000,000 had to be raised and for which it is now proposed to provide £125,000 additional.</P>
    <P>I think the Labour Party are doing a great disservice to the unemployed by linking up this problem with the cost-of-living index figure.  It will never be possible to provide unemployment assistance capable of maintaining unemployed persons definitely. Any such scheme would be faced with immense difficulties.  We contemplate here a scheme which would help the people to maintain themselves during temporary unemployment.  None of those unemployed are permanently unemployed. The majority may be unemployed for three or four or five weeks.  They may be employed for a number of months and then unemployed for short periods.  The aim of this scheme is to assist such persons during periods of unemployment.  If the Labour Party associate the rates in this scheme with the standard of living, then these rates will in the future be associated with the standard of living, and the amount to be provided under this Bill will be taken into account when the earnings are taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The unemployment assistance scheme was first introduced in 1933. Now, 1933 was the worst year of the depression both in this and in other countries.  By their proposal now that the fluctuation in the rates of unemployment assistance should have relation to the variation in the cost of <Col N="3059" /> living, the Labour Party are attempting to standardise for all time the unemployment assistance provisions made possible in 1933.  I think their tactics are wrong.  These tactics they are pursuing through Party motives, and they seem determined to pursue them, but in this they are losing sight entirely of the interests of the unemployed. It may be possible under new economic circumstances to make better provision for the unemployed than is contemplated here; I would much sooner see better provisions made in relation to our general programme of work than in relation to this scheme of unemployment, but we must have both.  But it is futile and wrong to speak of this as the sole measure adopted by the Government for dealing with the unemployed.  It is really the least important measure which the Government has adopted.  At any rate it is the least costly of these measures because other services designed to deal with that problem involve a much higher charge upon the National Exchequer than this one does.</P>
    <P>As regards the statement about the cost of living, the cost of living has risen.  Undoubtedly it has risen.  Nobody is foolish enough to deny that as compared with 1929 the cost of living is high now.  Our contention is that it is no higher, in relation to 1933, than it is in any other country, and that it is not as high as it is in some other countries.  Compare the rise here in the cost of living with the rise in Great Britain, and bear in mind that the British Government have refused to increase their unemployment assistance rates because of the rise in the cost of living.  We are increasing the rates, not in consequence of the increase in the cost of living entirely, but when Deputies say that persons who got the lower rates in 1933 were better off than those who will get the higher rates in 1937, they are ignoring an obvious fact and refusing to carry out the simple sum in arithmetic which I asked Deputy Morrissey to undertake.  Deputy Norton quoted figures here.  He said that the cost-of-living index figure in November, 1933, was 156.  That was the lowest point <Col N="3060" /> of the depression here.  The figure commenced to rise immediately afterwards. It was 177 in November, 1937. It is a simple sum.  177 is to 156 as 100 is to...  In that way he will find out the percentage increase in the cost of living.  He will be amazed to find that the percentage increase in the cost of living is lower than the percentage increase we are proposing in unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>The fact that, on the last occasion this motion was being discussed, I, by rising to my feet, inadvertently and innocently moved the adjournment of the debate, spares you the tedium of listening to the trite remarks and harmless platitudes with which I had intended to introduce myself to you.  My real anxiety in getting to my feet was not so much to air immature views on what, after all, is a highly technical motion, requiring more than a mere nodding acquaintance with economics to discuss relevantly and intelligently, but rather to repudiate certain wild statements made by Deputy Giles against a certain section of the community whom he euphemistically described as &ldquo;opulent.&rdquo;  I refer to the Jews.  As the Deputy is not in the House and as I take it for granted that the views he expressed on that occasion were his own private views and in no way represented the views of the Party to which he belongs, I shall leave the matter aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the motion itself, it is logical to assume, I believe, that a sharp rise in the cost of living must necessarily be followed by a corresponding fall in the standard of living.  That will apply more particularly to those whose <Col N="3062" /> wages, salaries and incomes have remained <i>in statu quo ante.</i>  I, in common with everybody else of limited means, deeply deplore this increase in the cost of living, but, at the same time, I am not prepared to agree that the only way to improve matters is to adopt the motto of the Victorian politician in regard to protection and establish what, if the terms of this motion were literally carried into effect, would be a state of free trade between this country and other countries.  It is all very fine to talk about buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest market, but, with our major industry in ruins and our export trade in decay, any playing around the skirts of free trade can only bring disastrous consequences and would inevitably result in further accentuating our already too serious unemployment problem.  Deputies must face up to the fact that the policy of national economic self-sufficiency has come to stay, whether they, as individuals, like it or not.  I believe that tariff walls cannot be built on shifting sands.  Rather should they be made unassailable so as to avoid the economic confusion and financial chaos that would inevitably result from their collapse.</P>
    <P>History, in this country at any rate, has an unhappy knack of repeating itself.  Let us cast our minds back a century and a half to a time when a native Parliament sat below in College Green&mdash;a Parliament elected on a hopelessly restricted franchise and unrepresentative of seven-eighths of the community, because emancipation was then a mere embryo in the womb of the future.  In less than 20 years, by the action of the Government in introducing levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, our export trade flourished, intensive agriculture was carried out on a grand scale, old industries were granted new leases of life and new industries were established. Then what happened?  The action of the British Government, during the period of the Act of Union, in forthwith abolishing taxes, levies, duties and impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, immediately brought about the complete <Col N="3063" /> collapse of these industries.  Thousands of workers previously employed in the protected industries were thrown out of employment.  A terrible period of misery and depression set in which culminated in the famine of '47.  I do not for one moment hold that an exactly parallel situation exists here to-day, because one must take cognisance of the repeal of the Corn Laws and of the fact that that period was the beginning of an era of great industrial expansion in Great Britain; but, at the same time, we must ask ourselves are we prepared to take the risk of all the calamities that would occur if the terms of this motion were carried into effect?  I, for one, am not. I must say that, for my part, I would hail with joy any suggestion coming from Fine Gael, or from any other Party or individual in this House, that would in any way ameliorate the conditions of the unemployed and the underpaid and unorganised workers, but I see no constructive policy in the terms of this motion.  I cannot agree, either, that the Unemployment Assistance Bill at present before the House improves to any appreciable extent the position of the unemployed, or relieves to any appreciable extent the tremendous bill which has to be paid weekly by the Dublin Board of Assistance to subsidise the inadequate allowances to the unemployed and to those in receipt of national health insurance benefit, old age pensions and so forth.</P>
    <P>So far as I can remember&mdash;because this motion has become somewhat stale &mdash;the last speaker on the Government side was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands.  So far as I am concerned, the only thing he succeeded in doing was in convincing me that there are three types of lies&mdash;lies, damned lies and statistics.  With regard to the ráméis we had to listen to from the Minister for Industry and Commerce anent that Celtic myth, prosperity, which is so much discussed on post-prandial dress-suit occasions, the least said the better.  Let the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and this applies equally to the Minister for Finance, instead of waxing eloquent about the consumption of spirits and <Col N="3064" /> motor cars, of beer and buses, examine the income-tax returns, the balance sheets and, last but by no means least, the consciences of our company promoters, our tariff exploiters, our bounty barons, our quota auctioneers and our licence hawkers, for therein, in my sincere and honest opinion, lies, to some extent at any rate, the solution of the ever-increasing cost-of-living problem.  I may have wasted your time, Sir, and my breath on this motion; I can assure you that I will not waste my vote.</P>

      <P>I should not have intervened in this debate which, as the previous Deputy has said, has been before the House for a very long time, were it not for the most generous invitation of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flinn.  He invited all who were in opposition to the Government on this tariff question to come forward and help them.  I wish to say at the beginning that I do not agree with Deputy Gorey when he disagrees with the Minister on the question of drink. I quite agree with the Minister that there must be an increase in the demand for liquor, and I attribute that to the policy of the Executive Council in bringing the people from the country, where the opportunity for drinking is less, to the cities and towns, where the opportunity and facilities for drink are better.  I think that is really the cause of the increase in liquor consumption, rather than the prosperity of the country.  I am all the more convinced of that by an article which I read a few weeks ago.  It set out the number of prosecutions for drunkenness in 1920 as compared with 1936, and showed that there was an increase of 2,366 in England and Wales over that period. The article pointed out that the marked increase was to be found in the industrial counties of England.  I do not know whether the Minister would agree with that or not, or whether he thinks that having all this extra liquor consumption adds to the prosperity of the country.  Lord Balfour at one time said that the expansion of the liquor trade means increased drunkenness and decreased industrial efficiency, and I should like the Minister for Industry and Commerce to consider whether he <Col N="3065" /> is satisfied as to whether his policy is increasing industrial efficiency or not.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, and, I think, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, spoke of the prosperity of the country and made great capital out of the number of bankruptcies in the country for the last five or six years.  They quoted figures and, although Deputy Hannigan might not agree with them, I do agree with them. There are no bankrupts in the country, and so far as Cavan is concerned, there has not been a bankrupt in the country for the last five or six years; but I do not for one moment want to argue, and I am sure that the Minister for Agriculture does not want to argue, that that shows prosperity.  It shows the opposite; it shows want of confidence, because if there was sufficient confidence in the country there would be plenty of bankrupts, as there always were.  In order to be a bankrupt you have to get a certain amount of credit. That credit is not being given at present because Englishmen will not give it to the wholesaler here; the wholesale people here cannot give it to the individual trader in the country; and individual traders will not give it to farmers and others who are looking for it.  Want of confidence in the country is the reason, and the only reason, for the absence of bankrupts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let us take local affairs.  What bank will advance £1,000 at the present time or even £10 to a farmer?  You might as well look for a needle in a bundle of straw as to ask a bank to advance £10 to a farmer or to anyone else, unless there was collateral security available.  If they willnot advance money where are the bankruptcies coming from?  The speech of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flinn, interested me very much.  Some Deputies complained of the length of the speech, but when I read it over in cold print I thought I could identify at least three different sides to it, wrapped up as it was in his usual flowery language.  When he was speaking I presume he was speaking with <Col N="3066" /> the authority of the Government, and for that reason I was greatly interested in the speech.  He expressed a wish, in the first instance, that the Opposition should come along and try to assist the Government and tell them what tariffs they should do away with. &ldquo;In other words, come along and help us and probably it would be the beginning of other steps that would lead to peace and prosperity in the country.&rdquo; In view of certain statements that I heard expressed lately, I hope there was some responsibility for that statement. If I am allowed, I will put the question in another way: &ldquo;What tariff do you advise us to keep on?&rdquo;  The probability is that that question would be much more easily answered.  To my mind existing tariffs should be done away with, or, at least reduced to 10 per cent, except in the case of a few introduced lately, where 15 per cent. might be allowed.  Why should the people of this country have to pay at least 50 per cent. for almost every article they purchase over the market value of a superior article, while at the same time every farmer is selling his produce, let it be what it will, 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. less than its market value?  If farmers could do what is being done in other industries they would go on strike.  Unfortunately their means will not allow them to do that, and they must try to carry on, despite the hardship of a diminished market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement was made here several times by the late Minister for Agriculture, and in the presence of the present Minister for Finance, that farmers produced 80 per cent. of the income of this country.  If that was so in the past, how much more are they producing at present?  They are handing over £2,500,000 as annuities to the Government, and then they are paying at least £5,000,000 in taxation on their cattle. I do not see why agricultural labourers should have to pay 100 per cent. more rent. on small dwellings than they paid heretofore, because of the present increase in the cost of living.  Then I come to Deputy Flinn's second statement. As far as I remember, he stated that the Government was going to reconsider the tariffs, to see what <Col N="3067" /> alterations could be made.  That was very nice information and we were all delighted to hear it.  I should like to know how the Executive Council or the Minister intend to proceed.  If the Minister is going to appoint a commission in Dublin to make inquiries it would be more or less waste of time. The Minister does not accept many suggestions from me, but I make this humble suggestion: that he should appoint a small committee of this House, composed of members representing southern counties, and a good number of Labour Deputies, and allow them to go around Border counties like Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and to Dundalk, where certain articles are produced, to see what they can be bought there for in comparison with the price that has to be paid for them here. There is no necessity to give the traders in these places any notice of the intention of the committee to call, because there will be ample evidence, invoices and quotations, to show what they paid Northern firms.  That will give an indication of the present unreasonable cost of living here.  I was in a shop in a Border town not very long ago where the merchant was trying to quote for sewer pipes.  He got samples of these pipes and no reasonable engineer would pass them.  They were practically porous, not properly glazed, and crooked.  Such articles would not pass an engineer.</P>

      <P>We had a glowing account in the morning papers about the amount of nails produced at a Limerick factory.  It was a very interesting article.  Is there any reason why it should not go ahead with a tariff of practically 60 per cent.?  Nails are costing the wholesale houses here 29/- per cwt. to-day while they can be bought across the Border for 16/-. They are almost double the price here, and yet we are told they are going hammer and tongs at this trade, when they are getting almost 100 per cent. more than nails can be bought for elsewhere.  It is no wonder the cost of living is high here; no wonder rents are high, and no wonder labourers are not able to pay the rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Heretofore Irish firms were able to compete with any British firms for boots.  There was a firm in Cork which did a good trade in boots that were good enough for any country. The boots they produced were equal to those produced by any English firm. We were all delighted to get them as they gave every satisfaction.  That firm competed without any tariffs. To-day we have practically a tariff of 50 per cent. on boots, and even with that 50 per cent., if the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave permits, the traders of this country would, I believe, import boots and be able to compete with the Irish manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary was, to my mind, the most interesting.  He asked <Col N="3069" /> what would happen if the tariffs were done away with.  His anxiety was not as regards what would happen the owners of the factories, the employees or the poor widows and orphans who had a little money invested in them and were looking forward to small dividends from them.  What he was concerned about was, how money would be raised if we had not these tariffs.  Therefore, according to him, the tariffs were not for the purpose of improving industry or helping the unemployed.  They are there for the purpose of producing income for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this cost of living motion, Deputies on the Government Benches devoted a lot of time to the new industries that have been established.  Quite a big number of the members of the House are closely connected with the agricultural industry.  Some of them seem to lose sight of the fact that 70 per cent. of the population are engaged in that industry, and, therefore, provide a purchasing power of 70 per cent. for the new industries.  Let us take a few items which are necessary for the promotion of the agricultural industry.  I will deal first with manures, the cost of which is increasing year after year. Sometimes you have increases inside a week.  Manures are essential for the production of the various crops&mdash;beet, wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, etc.  If farmers are not in a financial position to purchase manures they cannot grow these crops.  Potatoes cannot be grown without artificial manures.  What is the position of the potato market? In 1937 they were making 70/- per ton, and some 75/- and 80/-.  The price that the alcohol factories are offering for potatoes in 1938 is 40/- a ton, that is 30/- a ton less than the growers were able to secure last year.  Manures are also necessary for the growing of oats and barley.  Take the maize meal mixture without which you cannot produce pigs, butter, fowl and eggs. About 15 per cent. of the agricultural community are growers of oats and 85 per cent. are buyers.  The former want a market for their oats, while 85 per cent. have to pay an excess price for a maize meal mixture which, <Col N="3070" /> as I have said, is necessary for the production of pigs, eggs, butter, fowl, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out, Sir, that it is impossible to hear the Deputy with the buzz of conversation in the Chamber?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Take eggs.  According to the local papers, the value of the eggs that we exported in 1930 was £2,655,000.  That figure has been gradually decreasing.  In 1935 it was down to £995,000.  The progressive decrease in the value of our egg exports between 1930 and 1935 is certainly a very regrettable sign.  I have given the figure for 1930.  In 1931 the figure was £2,227,000; 1932, £1,674,000; 1933, £1,078,000; 1934, £1,040,000; and in 1935, as I have already pointed out, it was down to less than the £1,000,000 figure.  That reveals a very serious position for the farming community, because this is one of the industries that help to provide comfortable circumstances in the farmer's home.  When eggs are produced and taken to the market and sold the proceeds enable the housewife to keep a comfortable home. That is an industry that must get some attention.  Otherwise, it will leave things in a very unsatisfactory position so far as the farmer's household is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the condition of the pig industry to-day?  We see from some recent returns that production is likely to be less next year than it is at present.  The number of sows in the country to-day is 3,000 less than last year.  That means that our pig population will be less by about 100,000. Some days ago the Pigs Marketing Board published an order, which came into force on the 1st inst., fixing the hypothetical price for non-factory purchased pigs.  The price live-weight for first-class pigs is 61/-, second-class 59/-, and third class 56/-.  What I cannot understand is that on the very same day all the farmer can get for his first-grade quality pigs is about 50/-, a slightly lower price being paid for Nos. 2 and 3.  As a result of Government action, and of rules and regulations made, the value of his pigs to the producer is reduced by 11/- per <Col N="3071" /> cwt.  In the case of pigs sold by live weight that means a difference to the farmer of 22/- for a 2-cwt. pig.  If you take 22/- away from the cost of production it leaves a very small profit to the producer.  He gets very little for the feeding or for his time.  You must buy meal to feed and fatten pigs. Take the price of meal to-day as compared with 1929 or 1930.  In 1930 meal was 8/6 per cwt., in 1931 it was 6/6, in 1936 it was 8/-, and to-day it is 10/-. It is very hard to produce pigs with meal at that price.  Take flour.  In 1931 flour was roughly 9/- per 7st. bag. What is the price of it to-day?  About 17/- per 7st. bag.  All these commodities increase the cost of living, and consequently the agricultural community are finding it very hard to exist.  The rates and the social services are practically double what they were five years ago.</P>
    <P>Then take emigration.  I find from a paper I have here that in 1932 the emigration figure was 6,860, while the unemployed in November of the same year numbered 102,619.  In 1933 the emigration figure was 7,731, and in November of that year there were 85,000 unemployed.  In 1934 the emigration figure was 12,362, and in November of that year the unemployed numbered 123,890.  In 1935 the figures were 17,620 and 129,403 respectively. In 1937 the emigration figure was 25,000 and the number of unemployed 95,000.  The people have really to leave the country because they cannot find the means of existence.  The greater part of the emigration is from the rural areas, and a large part of the unemployment is also in those areas.  In my district and similar districts a big percentage of the people live on mountainy farms where they have to till and sow and try to do the best they can.  In these places they are very badly hit.  They have to try to grow crops on the same land year after year, as they have no new land to look forward to.  They have to buy meal and flour in order to exist, and the high cost of these commodities is making it very hard for these people to exist, as their means are very small.  The two or three days' work per week which they get on rotational <Col N="3072" /> schemes gives them very little remuneration.  The second last Deputy who spoke really touched the point in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this motion, which, after all, is a very simple one, as it asks the House to remove forthwith all levies, etc., on foodstuffs.  It has been stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this motion asks the Government to change its whole economic policy.  In other words, he tried to convince the House that the motion was one advocating free trade versus the tariff policy as pursued by the present Government. The Minister was wrong in attempting to convince the House that this motion meant any such thing. On reading the report of the debate on the motion as introduced by Deputy Morrissey and seconded by Deputy Linehan, I find that the total time occupied by the two Deputies did not exceed 17 or 18 minutes, and their speeches did not extend beyond 11 columns.  I think every Deputy will agree that if the motion meant that there was to be a discussion on tariffs versus free trade, Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Linehan did not treat the subject with justice and that it was not given the consideration it deserved. The Minister for Industry and Commerce occupied a full hour on the first night he spoke on the motion and, when he resumed the following week, he occupied another hour.  So that he took two hours and almost 40 columns of the Official Report to reply to a simple motion whose introduction only occupied 11 or 12 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows very well that this is not a motion asking the House to take a vote on the merits or demerits of free trade versus the tariff policy. I can convince him that that is not so on his own admission, because on several occasions recently when opening factories all over the country the Minister went out of his way to pay tribute to the greate assistance and co-operation he received from those who differed from the Government politically. He went so far as to state that were it not for the great financial assistance which he received from the <Col N="3073" /> political opponents of the Government he could not have proceeded with his industrial policy in the manner in which he has proceeded.  In view of that statement, why should the Minister occupy two hours of the time in the House in trying to confuse the issue raised by this motion?</P>
    <P>Again, if the Minister would read his speech he would find that his utterance will do very much more harm to the industries established in this country than anything that has been said by the Opposition for this reason, that the Minister's speech must convey to those who have invested money in industries that those industries are secure only as long as the present Government is in power.  These are bad tactics on the part of any member of this House who occupies the responsible position which the Minister occupies&mdash;to try to convey to the people of the country that if the Fianna Fáil Government went out of office to-morrow and Fine Gael came into power their first duty would be to close up all the industries of the country. Many Deputies on the Government Benches supported the Minister in that argument.  Can anyone imagine that the Fine Gael Party would do anything that would be inimical to the interests of our best supporters in this country, the men who have assisted the present Minister in establishing industries in this country?  Is it not about time that we should come down to brass tacks? Even though a motion is introduced by a member of the Opposition it should get the consideration it deserves.</P>
    <P>Other Government Deputies took up the same attitude.  Some of them went so far as to say that it was political propaganda carried on by the members of the Opposition for the past four or five months.  I am a member of that Party and I challenge the Minister, or any member of the Government, to state where I, on any occasion since the last general election, either by word or in writing, did anything in the way of political propaganda.  I think the present Government are getting much more consideration from the members of the Opposition than they gave the previous Government when they themselves were in opposition.  Another <Col N="3074" /> member tried to convey that it was a ramp started by the <i>Irish Independent.</i> It is no such thing.  This motion deals with the common people of the country in regard to the essentials which they have to buy to keep body and soul together&mdash;I am referring to bread, butter, bacon, beef and milk&mdash;and can the price of these articles be reduced; or, in other words, has the policy pursued by the present Government in the last three or four years been the means of increasing the price of those commodities?</P>
    <P>I intend to show, before I conclude my speech to-night, that the policy of the Government has increased the prices of these articles without in any way furthering their industrial policy or increasing the standard of living in this country.  Take bread, for instance. Could the price of bread be reduced if the Government had only the sense to face the situation?  In the first place, why is bread so dear? Is it because of the cost of the raw material?  Is it because of the wages paid to the bakers and those who deliver the bread?  Is it due to the fact that those who control the bakeries are making excessive profits? Is it due to the fact that those who are milling flour are making excessive profits?  In regard to those who control the bakeries in this country, it has been established by the master bakers, and has been admitted even by the Minister himself on the figures submitted to him by the master bakers, that they could not sell bread at any lower price than they were charging at that particular period.  The Minister had to admit that, and he allowed the master bakers to increase their prices, so, therefore, the fault cannot be laid at the door of the master bakers.  Similarly it cannot be laid at the door of those who make the bread.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for the fact that a 4-lb. loaf costs 1/- here, while it costs only 9d. or 10d. in the City of London?  Does that not make a big difference to a man with a family?  I have myself seven in family, and I know that my bread bill every week amounts from 14/- to 16/-.  There are thousands of people in this country <Col N="3075" /> who have only 14/- or 16/- to expend, not on one item, but on every other item that they require for their families. One can see, therefore, what the price of bread means to a working man at present.  It is no excuse for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell the mothers of families in this country that all this is propaganda on the part of the <i>Irish Independent</i> or on the part of the Fine Gael Party.  I have myself been stopped in side streets in Dundalk by women who have asked me: &ldquo;In the name of God, what do you intend to do with the poor people in the towns when the price of bread is so high?&rdquo; It would be no consolation to those people to say to them: &ldquo;Do not mind that; that is all due to a certain leading article in the <i>Independent</i>&rdquo;.  If I told that to these women they would probably say: &ldquo;The blessing of God on the man who wrote that article.&rdquo; If they had not an <i>Independent</i> then, they would buy it even with their last penny because they would say to themselves, &ldquo;Somebody at least is thinking about us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A shilling for a 4-lb. loaf!  Think of what that means to a man with a family of five or six.  I am one who knows what hardship means, and what humbug means, too, and I know what it is to have to pay 14/- or 15/- per week for bread alone.  Everybody knows that the poorer people are, the more bread they consume, because they cannot afford to purchase beef or other foodstuffs to supplement their daily diet.  Has Government policy been responsible for increasing the price of wheat to the miller?  Previous to the last change, as far as I understand, the millers paid the farmers 15/- per barrel for wheat and the Government gave a subsidy of 7/6, bringing the price up to 22/6 per barrel.  The farmer is now receiving 30/- and he is not getting a bit too much, because, after all, he is the producer of the primary article and he must be paid.  But a change has been made by the Government. Instead of paying a subsidy, they now make the miller pay the whole price of 30/-.  The miller has to add that increased cost to the price of the <Col N="3076" /> flour, and the master baker has to put it on the loaf which the very poor have to buy.  Instead of the increased cost coming out of the national Exchequer as heretofore, the poor have to pay it. Of course, we have been asked by Deputy Flinn, &ldquo;Why should the poor not be made to pay taxes?&rdquo;  They must be prepared to pay, as Deputy Flinn stated.</P>

      <P>I ask what is it that has increased the price of bread in this country.  If the price of bread were reduced would it have the effect of closing down any industry in this country?  That is what this motion deals with simply and solely.  Everybody knows what the meaning of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is.  The Minister for Finance and every member of the Government knows what the dictionary meaning of it is, but we need not take the exact dictionary meaning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Government policy has increased the price of bread to 1/- per 4-lb. loaf in this agricultural country, which should produce food much cheaper than any other country in the world, and that working class people have to pay 12/- to 14/- for bread alone every week? They cannot afford to buy it at that price.  Is it any wonder that Deputy McGilligan, reading from the <i>Trade Journal</i>, was able to show that the consumption of bread in this country has been reduced by almost 6,000,000 loaves?  Does not that show that the workingman cannot buy sufficient bread for himself and his family?</P>
      <P>Then we come to the question of butter.  Can the price of butter be reduced?  Nobody can deny that the present Government, notwithstanding the fact that they are supposed to be engaged in war with our old enemy, England, have for the past three or four years provided Mr. Englishman with butter at 11d. and 1/- per lb., while they were charging poor Irish Paddy 1/4 per lb.  It was good enough for him, I suppose.  Alderman Tom Kelly, who was so given to fighting England in the past, is so fond of Great Britain to-day that he will send butter over to the Englishman and sell it at 10d. or 11d. per lb. and charge the poor people in the slums of Dublin 1/4 per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Englishmen are poor, delicate people.  They want all the butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that state of affairs not due to the present policy pursued by the Government in this fantastic war in which we are supposed to be engaged with Great Britain?  We have to pay a sum almost equal to the price we receive for our butter to get that butter into a market that, in the words of the President and some of his Ministers some years ago, &ldquo;is gone, and gone, thank God, for ever.&rdquo;  In one particular year, if my memory serves me aright, we paid 80/- per cwt. to get our Irish butter into the English market, and we only got for it, I <Col N="3078" /> think, 75/- a cwt.  Then we hear a lot of talk about self-sufficiency.  Why, we would be greasing the railway lines with butter were it not for the British market.  I never was a slave to England any more than the members of the Government, but I am one who was always prepared to face facts. The price of butter could have been reduced, and the poor of our cities here, especially in Dublin, could have received our good Irish butter at a less price than they were forced to pay, while at the same time the dairy farmers in Limerick and every other county could have received the same price for the raw material in the form of milk.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the question of bacon.  The same argument holds good there.  Those are the points with which the motion seeks to deal.  It does not bring in the question of tariffs <i>versus</i> free trade at all.  We have been sending bacon to England at a price much below what we have been charging our people here in Ireland.  More than that, under legislation passed by the Minister for Agriculture recently he has insured that even if the Irish Paddies were to go without a rasher of bacon Mr. Englishman has to get it, because many of our bacon factory people here have been brought to court and have been very heavily fined for attempting to sell bacon here in the Irish Free State when it was wanted for John Bull.  Our Irish Minister for Agriculture passed legislation recently which had that effect.  What is the use of the members there on the Government Benches talking about our being at war with England and twitting us about wanting to surrender to Britain? Many members of the Labour Party, I am sorry to say, took up the same attitude.  &ldquo;Are we going to surrender to England?&rdquo; they said.  You have been surrendering every day in the week for the past four years on those very questions of butter, beef, milk and other articles which are the most essential part of the family budget of the workers of this country.  Yet we are being twitted about wanting to surrender to England.  As a matter of fact you yourselves have made an annual surrender in the form of the very bad Coal-Cattle Pact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3079" /> This motion asks you to open your eyes.  We are not asking you to surrender one iota of your principles, if you ever had any principles.  During the last five or ten years you ran away from any principles that you ever had, and you are twitting us now about being British Imperialists.  We know who the Imperialists are to-day&mdash;the men who are prepared to give cheaper bacon and butter to Englishmen than they are prepared to give to their own Irish at home.  I am not one of those who would like to make it awkward for the Government in any shape or form whatsoever.  I very seldom interfere with the Government outside this House, except to do all I possibly can to assist them in any scheme which I think is for the benefit of this country, but I have no patience at all with hypocrisy.  It cannot be denied that the whole policy of the Government during the past three or four years in connection with the relations with Great Britain is largely responsible for the high cost of living in this country.  I ask the Government to take their courage in their hands and settle this little dispute.  It is not a war by any means; it is a dispute between the two countries.  That will restore our normal trade relations.  That will allow us to get our butter, our bacon, our cattle and every other part of our agricultural produce free into the British market.  It will allow us to get a better price, and at the same time allow us to give cheaper food to our Irish people here.</P>
    <P>It has been stated over and over again by many of the members on the Government Benches that the population of this country was such and such in the year so and so.  Deputy Walsh referred to Royal Meath and all the rest of it.  Surely after four or five years of your policy, the population of this country should have increased by leaps and bounds.  Yet, we find that instead of increasing it has decreased. I have often wondered at what time will we see the President's promise fulfilled&mdash;that this country would be able to support from 15,000,000 to 17,000,000 people.  If after five or six years of the President's own policy <Col N="3080" /> the population has rather decreased than increased, when is he going to arrive at his 17,000,000?  That is what this motion deals with.  I think the Government would be wise in accepting it and in refraining from taking up the attitude which has been adopted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in trying to confuse the issue by making it appear that this was a motion advocating free trade as against a tariff policy.</P>
    <P>Listening to the members of the Government speaking, one would imagine that we had no industries in this country before the advent of Fianna Fáil.  We had very many old-established industries in this country which had withstood all opposition and all competition.  They were flourishing and, thank God, are flourishing to-day.  Tariffs were imposed on numerous articles coming into this country previous to the advent of Fianna Fáil, but it was a moderate tariff policy.  It was a policy that was given due consideration before it was put into operation.  There is no need for Fianna Fáil to take all the credit for imposing tariffs.  The previous Government imposed tariffs on certain articles which they thought could be produced at an economic price in this country, but they did not impose tariffs simply for the sake of collecting revenue.  I should like to impress upon members of the Government, if it were possible to do so, the fact that the Government has been engaged for the last four years in erecting factories in this country. That in itself should be responsible for less income being secured by the Minister for Finance from the tariffs imposed on imports.  If our industrial policy is successful as members of the Government try to make it out to be, how can you explain the fact that at the moment the Minister for Finance is collecting a sum very little less than £11,000,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there is no use in talking politely to you people.  One has got to hammer a thing home.  I maintain that it was from £10,000,000 to £11,000,000.  Even at £10,000,000, does it not seem extraordinary, in the face of all the bombastic eloquence of <Col N="3082" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the talk about all the industries he set up in this country, that the Minister for Finance should be able to collect, let us say, not £10,000,000, but £9,000,000, as against the £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 collected by the former Minister for Finance when we were importing commodities from other countries, such as bacon from China that we were told so much about, from Czecho-Slovakia, and also Russian bacon which one Deputy said contained 100 per cent. less nourishment than Irish bacon, and even bacon from Canada and America, which was also supposed to be inferior in nourishing quality?  Well, it is extraordinary that America can produce a Gene Tunney and such a number of famous athletes, if the food they produce is so inferior.  That is just the usual kind of talk here, however, but when all these commodities were being imported here free of duty, the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe, could only get a maximum of £7,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In what year did he get a maximum of £7,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can almost see the Minister for Finance saying to himself: &ldquo;Thank God there are such great Republicans here in this country who are buying imported goods to such an extent that I can collect £10,000,000; the Minister for Industry and Commerce can bluff the country about native industries and so on, but I hope the people will take in enough foreign stuff to enable me to collect my £10,000,000.&rdquo;  That is the way it is. On the one hand, the Minister for Finance gets £10,000,000, and on the other hand, you have the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying: &ldquo;Look at all the industries I am starting in this country.&rdquo;  Certainly, it is not very complimentary to the supporters of the Government all over the country, who are so fond of loudly professing their nationality, to say that we are importing so much that this large amount of money can be collected.  It is not alone the supporters of the present Government who are responsible for buying articles on which the Minister for <Col N="3083" /> Finance can collect £10,000,000.  There must be a number of tried and true Republicans buying foreign articles that have been imported into this country.</P>
      <P>Therefore I say in all sincerity to the Government that it is about time to stop fooling the people of this country and to finish this sham economic war with Great Britain.  You are not at war with Great Britain.  You are negotiating every day in the week with members of the British Government.  They may not be the Ministers themselves, because, unfortunately, for some reason or another, they have not the courage to go over there and do it themselves, but they do it through the medium of the Commissioner in London, Mr. Dulanty.  If you were to make a trade agreement with Great Britain, it would be possible to reduce the cost of living in this country, and that is what this motion is on the Order Paper for.  That is what Deputy Morrissey and every member of this Party mean.  It is not because we want to have a tilt at the Government or to engage in political propaganda, nor is it because we are influenced by leading articles in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> We are influenced only by the cold, hard facts.  In common with many Deputies on this side of the House, I am sure, I have been stopped by many of my own constituents with reference to the price of bread at the present time.  It is so high that recently a reverend gentleman, preaching to his congregation one Sunday took occasion to say that he was availing of that opportunity to make a public protest against the high cost of bread to the poor at the present time, who, he said, after all, are God's own children.  He was not influenced by a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> or by political propaganda.  He deemed it his duty to make that pronouncement to his congregation and to make that public protest against the high price being charged to the poor for bread at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion simply asks the Government to take steps to reduce the prices of these essential articles of food which are used so largely by the families of the poor people of this country.  The <Col N="3084" /> Government can do that without surrendering one iota of their principles or changing their policy.  We, on this side, want to have industries established in this country just as well as Fianna Fáil, but we do not want a policy which results in increasing the cost of living to such an extent that, no matter what increase of wages is given it is off-set by the cost of living going up day by day.  That is what this motion is for.  It is not a motion to determine the pros. or cons. of free trade or tariff reform, but to reduce the cost of living, and the Government can do that if they accept this motion. If they accept this motion, they will have all the co-operation that is necessary from the members of the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a few points before the House to-night and, as the author of this motion, to try to get the House to understand what the motion means.  As I gather that comment has been made already with regard to quotations from past speeches, I should like to clear the ground first and get rid of any misconceptions by reciting here the quotations which I propose to call to my aid in this debate.  For instance, the President is on record as having said that, so far as he could see, the British market was gone for ever.  Is that challenged?  It was also said that the necessity for agreement with Great Britain was day by day and week by week growing less urgent.  Is that denied?  The Minister for Education, in 1935, making an appeal for the Minister for Finance in the latter's absence, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are taxing necessities, not because we like to do it, but because there is nothing else left to tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is that denied?  Deputy Hugo Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, said, in reference to the Budget:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this Budget the workingman is being made to pay, and why should he not pay, because it was a workingman's Budget?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give the gloss that the Parliamentary Secretary put on that by putting himself forward as a working <Col N="3085" /> man, and it is on that context that he denies to-night that he said baldly and boldly that the workingman would have to pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall is in the House at the moment, and there are two statements that he is recorded in the Cork papers as having made in January, 1935.  Speaking at the annual meeting of the Cork Chamber of Commerce in January, 1935, Deputy Dowdall said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Trading should be left in the hands of the business community. With regard to the statement that people were taking advantage of the tariffs, it was only human nature to do so, and personally he would avail of them to make as much profit as he could.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to make a personal statement, Sir.  On several occasions both Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan have challenged me about what I said. It was at the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce in Cork, the Incorporated Chamber of Commerce in Cork.  The president of the chamber said he hoped that traders would not take advantage of the tariffs to make excessive profits or to give an inferior article.  When I came to speak I said that what the chairman had said was only a pious hope; that most people would take advantage to make as much out of tariffs as they could.  I said I considered myself as honest as most other people and I would do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has pretty well said what I said, but I added something, and this is what the Deputy <Col N="3086" /> never refers to.  I said, further, that competition will alter that, and, if not, then Government legislation would.  That was not stated by either Deputy Dillon or Deputy McGilligan. That is pretty well the whole of what I did say.  I am of opinion, if I may add it now, that the profits of traders who have tariffs should be examined, and they should be checked, but that does not alter the fact that I made the other statement definitely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

This statement I am about to quote was made earlier, in the August of the previous year. The Deputy said:</P>
      <P>The people who were with the enemy in this fight were the people who had money, who had businesses, who had something to lose.  Well, he did not mind if they did lose it. It was out of the common people of this country that they made their money, and it was their duty to join in with them.  And of the firms who had got tariffs, who were waxing fat on them, and were getting more money than they ever expected, he would say, without putting any tooth in it&mdash;</P>
      <P>It was here the Deputy made use of the foul expression which he apologised for afterwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="3087" /> The Deputy was carried away by his language, and he used words that perhaps he would not otherwise have used.  Deputy Dowdall stands here, as honest a trader under tariffs as this country has produced, and he will make as much out of tariffs as he can if competition and Government legislation do not prevent him.  He has put himself on record as saying that firms are waxing fat on tariffs made out of the common people of the country. I will not quote what Deputy Dowdall called them if they did not support the Government.  Anyway, they were putting that money into their pockets.  It is against that sort of thing that this motion is framed. I was partly responsible for framing the motion, which refers to the lowering of the standard of living by Government action through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>While people talk here about shovels and all that sort of thing, the main thing to remember is that the most important aspect is covered by those words &ldquo;foodstuffs and other necessaries of life.&rdquo;  The motion sets out that the Dáil deplores certain things and is of opinion that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished. &ldquo;Such impositions&rdquo; surely refers to impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life?</P>
    <P>I put down that motion after the general election, when I found that the people had, both in regard to this Party and the Labour Party, reacted very wholesomely to the viewpoint that was expressed and put before them at the election.  It was with the same object in view that, on 21st July, Deputy Cosgrave put it as a proposal from this House that if any Government should be formed from any Party or Parties pledged to certain things, then this Party would support that group.  What were the things he asked that the people should be pledged to? In the first place, he referred to the hardships inflicted on the people by the high cost of living and especially by the taxation on foodstuffs and the other necessaries of life&mdash;not a word about ordinary tariffs on industrial <Col N="3088" /> goods.  Secondly, he touched on the Government's refusal to heal the running sore of the so-called economic war.  Then he dealt with the dangers inherent in certain parts of the Constitution, and, fourthly, he mentioned the gerrymandering of the constituencies electing Deputies to the House.  The motion followed along the lines of the speech which Deputy Cosgrave had in mind to make on the 21st July.</P>
    <P>We believe that as far as the great number of the people in this country who voted for Parties other than the Party who form the Government are concerned, the thing that motived them in changing their votes was this, that foodstuffs were being taxed, that the costs of the people were being raised through their foodstuffs to a degree that they could not bear, and they felt that if this country was fated to a further period of delay in connection with the economic war, or to suffer complete destruction through its continuance, then the cost of carrying on the war should not be met out of taxation on the foodstuffs of the people of the country.  I do not know that any country in time of war has allowed profiteering to go on, and I do not see why people should be allowed to operate in the way Deputy Dowdall said he would operate if he had the power, that that would be deemed as patriotism and that people would be allowed to pocket big amounts of money that were made through overcharging the common people.  At the same time the taxation, instead of being levied on shoulders broad enough to bear it, is put on the necessities of the poor.</P>
    <P>The explanation was made by the Minister for Education that it was not for the love of taxation that it was imposed, but because there was nothing else left to tax.  If the Government find the substitutes are few, and if there is any further impact of the economic war, any further suffering to be borne by the people, then it should be borne and paid for by those best able to pay for it, and they are not the people whose foodstuffs are being taxed and who have been driven to the point that 6,000,000 <Col N="3089" /> loaves less are consumed in the country and that, after all the subsidies, 250,000 cwts. of bacon less appear on the breakfast tables of the people.</P>

      <P>I suppose the St. Vincent de Paul Society might be expected to give a fair indication of the condition of the people.

      <P>Not about this Christmas, but about the Christmas before.  I have the other leaflet. <Col N="3090" /> Would Deputies like it read?  Is there an improvement disclosed through it? Is there a line of improvement disclosed in it?  The third thing they said was that they used to get parcels of second-hand clothes from people who did not want them, but they were now faced with this difficulty, that there was not the same amount of clothes cast off because people were wearing them longer, and there was the second point, that they had more people to give the second-hand clothes to.  I move to report Progress.</P>
