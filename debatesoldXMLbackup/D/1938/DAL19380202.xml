Deed of conveyance of site was asked for on the 21st December, 1936, 24th April, 1937, 10th July, 1937, and 8th September, 1937.  Deed of conveyance was received in my Department on the 17th September, <Col N="8" /> 1937.  A sketch plan was received from the board of health on the 8th January, 1938.  This plan is being examined by the Department's technical advisers and it is hoped to issue the necessary approval at an early date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions No. 13 and No. 14 together.  No decision has been <Col N="9" /> made as to the reopening of recruiting for the Gárda Síochána.  As regards the method of selection, the responsibility is vested by statute in the Commissioner subject to the provisions of the Gárda Síochána (Appointments) Regulations, 1937.  It is not considered necessary to invite applications for admission to the Force; there is a waiting list of candidates sufficient to supply all possible requirements for several years.  One recruit was accepted during the year ended 31st December, 1937.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, does he think it proper that a person engaged in the controversial occupation of election agent, or parliamentary agent, in a recent general election should be chosen as the special clerk for the revision of the register for the next general election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inquire into that?  Does the Minister really think that it is a suitable thing, when you have the people of the whole county, including many unemployed <Col N="10" /> persons anxious for work, to select from, to choose the parliamentary agent of his own Party, a man who was already in receipt of a pension from public funds, and appoint him to this position, which would provide a livelihood for many an unemployed man in the County Monaghan anxious to earn a livelihood if given the opportunity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no analogy whatever.  May I ask the Minister why he does not distinguish between a professional man acting as a parliamentary agent and a person in Mr. McCarville's position, a man who is a violent and controversial politician, acting on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party?  No one has anything to say against him acting as that, but does the Minister think himself justified in approving the appointment of such a person?  I have no reason to suspect that the man is not a respectable man, but with his political record, one has reason to ask why he should be selected for the purpose of checking over a register for a constituency in which I may be a candidate, or other persons opposed to the Government may be candidates.  I say that it is the promotion of political corruption and it is a public scandal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. William O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of agreements (a) registered and (b) tendered for registration under Section 50 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936; whether he is aware that objection has been taken in his Department to the registration of agreements which the contracting parties believed capable of being registered under the Act, and, if so, whether it is his intention to take whatever steps may be necessary <Col N="12" /> to overcome these objections and facilitate the trade union and employers' organisations to secure registration for wages agreements into which they have entered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No agreements have yet been registered in the Wages Agreements Register established under Section 50 of the Conditions of Employment Act.  Forty-three documents, either completed or in draft form, were tendered to the Department for registration.  Thirty-six of these documents could not be accepted for one or more of the following statutory reasons, viz.:</P>
      <P>(1)  The document was not signed by a body or bodies representative of employers and workers respectively.</P>
      <P>(2)  The area to which the agreement related was not specified.</P>
      <P>(3)  Agreements made after the 29th May, 1936, did not contain provisions regulating the duration or providing for the termination of the agreement and did not make provision to secure that the agreement would be operative for at least one year.</P>
      <P>In addition practically all of these agreements as well as the remaining seven tendered for registration contained provisions regulating matters other than rates of salary, wages, or other reward payable to workers, and I was legally advised that I was debarred from accepting such agreements for registration.  As none of the agreements presented complied with the terms of Section 50 of the Act, compliance with which in my opinion should not cause much difficulty, there was no other course open but to refuse registration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, I should say that I am most anxious that wages agreements should be registered, and I am aware that advice and assistance with this object are being given constantly by my Department to interested parties.  I am not convinced that any amendment of the section is required, but I am prepared to consider any representations which may be made to me on this matter by interested parties.</P>

Parcels of land on this estate were allotted to these parties under agreements for letting for temporary convenience. Subsequently it was ascertained that they were letting either the whole or portion of their parcels in conacre in contravention of a clause in their agreements and the Land Commission decided to terminate their agreements and take up the parcels from them. Notices were served on the allottees in July last giving them three months' notice of the termination of their agreements as from the 1st November last, and on the 2nd November the inspector called on the parties and took over possession of the lands.</P>

Is the Minister aware that when the inspector called on him, Agnew had to send to school to get his child home from school so as to help him to put on his clothes?  Does the Minister realise that the failure in this man's case is simply because he has been temporarily very indisposed?</P>

That is the information of the Land Commission and I am quite sure that that information is correct.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the case of Owen Marry, the tenant can prove beyond all doubt or question that even last year he spent £10 on seeds and manures for his particular piece of land, and does the Minister realise that if this land is now taken from him his successors in title will enjoy the fruits of Owen Marry's labour and expenditure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer, I want to ask if he will give me an undertaking to give these cases his personal attention, because in the district there is universal condemnation of what has been done by the Land Commission, and the suspicion has been raised that this action on the part of the Land Commission is not altogether above board and that improper influences have been at work.  Is the Minister aware that these tenants are deserving people?  Is he aware that one of them is a widow, the eldest of whose family is only 13 years, and that he would be able to help her soon?  Is he aware that all these people have their land virtually taken from them and that overnight they have been changed from small farmers into labourers? Does the Minister know that it was said locally that there are going to come into these holdings five persons, two of whom were very acrimoniously engaged in politics and one of them a person whose past record contains no <Col N="25" /> glowing testimonials?  If the Minister will give me an undertaking that he will himself personally examine these cases I am prepared to let the matter stand over, but I want to assure the Minister that the facts are altogether exceptional and deserving of his personal attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to know that this is not a matter for me. I do not go out and inspect land and see how it is worked.  Inspectors are employed for that purpose.  The Deputy himself drew attention last year to what has been happening in cases similar to these where people were not making proper use of the land.  I then said that if that was continuing we would have it stopped. In pursuance of that undertaking these lands were visited by an inspector. On the report of the inspector, and without any interference from anyone, this matter came to a head. When the inspector went there he found that these lands had not been worked by the people to whom they had been allotted.  That being the case, and it having continued for a number of years, the Land Commission decided to take over the lands.  In the case of the widow the matter will be reopened.  I will ask the Land Commission to reconsider that case.  So far as I am concerned it is not my job, as the Deputy and every other Deputy here know, to go around and inspect each of these holdings myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that the allotment of land is not a matter over which the Minister has any discretion, but in cases like these, where the land has to be taken up from existing tenants, it is a matter in which the Minister should be concerned.  If, in view of the representations now made to the Minister, he will undertake to look into the matter himself and see that justice is done, I am now prepared to let the matter drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into the matter, but I want to remind Deputy Dillon that if we are going to do what Deputy Dillon is asking to have done we are going to have that trouble in every district where land has been given out, and is being neglected by <Col N="26" /> the tenants.  If the matter is raised here, then we will have trouble in every instance where we want to take over land that has been neglected.  I shall look into this case and see if there is anything in what the Deputy has said. If there is, the Land Commission will probably reconsider it.</P>

Does not the Minister agree that it would have been much more charitable on the part of the Land Commission to have given these people a preliminary warning that unless they tilled their land it would be taken from them?  Instead of that, the people only got notice last July, and were evicted in the course of two or three months.</P>

Owen are in process of acquisition, the purchase price having been fixed.  The Land Commission have decided to take no action for the present in regard to 21 acres of the lands of Blackwood; some 80 acres of the lands of Downings North and South have been inspected but a decision has not yet been made on the question of taking proceedings for their acquisition.</P>

The late Mr. Rice offered to sell to the Land Commission a portion of the holding containing 100 acres in order to help him to pay the arrears of annual sums due out of the lands.</P>
      <P>It is understood that some of the lands are let for grazing, and a petition has been received from uneconomic holders and landless men in the district requesting their division.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy of my reply to his previous question on this matter on the 3rd of March last.  I repeat that it is not possible to arrange the expenditure of money on the improvement of estates on a county basis, though the Land Commission do try to deal with necessary works each year in every area.  Expenditure in particular counties is largely related to the area of untenanted land suitable and available <Col N="29" /> for division in those counties, and, in this respect, County Kerry is deficient in comparison with such congested counties as Mayo, Galway and Roscommon.  But the amount spent on estate improvements during recent years in County Kerry does not compare unfavourably with the expenditure in such congested counties as Clare and Donegal.  The Land Commission are endeavouring to expend to the best general advantage the moneys for estate improvement at their disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to confer powers to control the exportation of scrap iron similar to those at present in operation in relation to sheepskins.  The Bill is in no sense urgent at the present moment, but circumstances did arise during the course of last year which caused considerable anxiety to iron-founders in the country.  There appeared a danger that adverse reactions would follow a rapid rise in the price of scrap iron and, consequently, a tendency to deplete stock by abnormal exportations.  The situation subsequently eased and there is, I understand, no particular cause for anxiety at the moment, but it is felt that these powers should be in existence to be used, if necessary, for the purpose of preventing any difficulty arising because of an abnormal situation leading to such a demand for scrap iron that a scarcity might be produced here and difficulties created for the industries which use scrap iron as their raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to say to what extent the quantity of scrap iron exported last year may have depleted what might be regarded as the normal stocks of that material, but it does not <Col N="40" /> appear as if a situation likely to cause concern has arisen yet.  It is impossible, however, to say what the future may hold in that respect, and in the absence of legislation of this kind, there would be no power to act in order to deal with a situation in which abnormal exports were taking place by way of regulation.  It is, consequently, considered desirable that this Bill should be enacted.  While I cannot say definitely that the Bill will not be brought into operation if enacted, there does not appear from the information available to be any urgent need for its operation at present.  The situation is such, however, that circumstances may change quite rapidly and, consequently, it is desirable that the Bill should be passed by the Dáil and made available for operation should the occasion arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it desirable that the Bill should be immediately passed by the Dáil?  It all depends on how you look at these things.  The Minister, I think, takes the view that the more control he has over industry and commerce in this country the better it is for everybody.  President Roosevelt took the same view, and the result has not been very happy.  He has managed to create pretty general chaos in a much greater and wealthier country than this, and I am sure he did it with the best of goodwill.  I should say that for the Minister to ask for powers to prohibit persons selling their goods to the best buyer is a very drastic request.  It is important to remember that there are a limited number of persons who are scrap iron merchants.  They buy the scrap from the people who have it for disposal and then hawk it around to get their best buyer.  The power in this Bill, if invoked, will compel them to go to the Hammond Lane Foundry or to Allied Iron-Founders in Waterford and take what those firms offer them for their scrap, or not sell it at all.  We all know perfectly well that the Hammond Lane Foundry and Allied Iron-Founders have elaborate understandings between each other that they will share the business of the State between them, and that if one will will undertake not to compete with the <Col N="41" /> other in certain lines, the other will not compete with the first, and <i>vice versa.</i>  They are, in effect, a perfect ring, and we propose to hand over to their tender mercies a small number of citizens, admittedly, but hard-working men, mostly poor men, and compel these poor men to sell their scrap to the Hammond Lane Foundry or Allied Iron Founders at whatever price they will offer.  I think it is a very drastic proposal indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second aspect of the question is: If the Minister does get these powers, is he prepared to give the House an undertaking that he will cause independent inquiry to be made by metallurgical experts before he imposes any prohibition on the export of scrap, or does he propose to be advised in this matter simply by the scrap users? I am told it is possible for iron founders to use too high a proportion of scrap iron in their castings with resultant losses to those who have to use the castings, and that it might be a very good thing if many of these iron founders were forced by circumstances to use a higher proportion of virgin ore than they are at present using.  Would the Minister make personal inquiry into that aspect of the situation before he uses the powers which it is proposed to confer on him under this Bill?  I have not heard him refer to that aspect of the case at all, so far.  If the Minister asserts that for the maintenance of the foundry industry in the country, the Bill is essential owing to the peculiar world situation created by the armament scare, I do not suppose the House can withhold the powers from him, but we ought not to give him those powers without realising that we are not only giving very considerable powers in regard to this particular trade, but doing something much more&mdash;we are creating a precedent on which he is going to rely when he wants further similar powers in regard to other trades.  I remember when the Sheepskin Act was going through, I pointed out that nobody was very much interested in whether sheepskins were exported or not, but that if we gave the Minister power to control these exports, he would come back to us hereafter and ask for <Col N="42" /> analogous powers to control other exports.  The House heard the Minister saying that the Bill is quite simple.  We had the same thing in connection with sheepskins.  Now it is iron.  The next one will be with reference to some other commodities that the Minister does not want exported.  How far does the Minister intend to go in keeping control of the right to sell our merchandise in the best market?  I think he ought to tell us that before the Second Reading is passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the remarks of Deputy Dillon I am acting on the presumption that the Minister does not.  I should like to point out that there is no definition of scrap iron in the Bill.  I do not think there is such a definition in existence.  It seems to me that nothing in the Bill would prevent me from driving my car to the North Wall, if I was going across to England, and having the car refused shipment on the grounds that it was scrap iron.  As there is no definition, some people might refer to it as &ldquo;scrap iron,&rdquo; while others might refer to it as &ldquo;a family heirloom.&rdquo; The position should be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like if the Minister could give us some idea of what he considers to be abnormal shipments of scrap iron.  What quantity would be considered normal in certain years, and by what amount would increased shipments become abnormal?  Will he also say if the increased quantities exported have resulted in an increase in prices?  Was the increase the world price and was that due to competition with outsiders for scrap iron?  The Minister did not tell us what advantage it is going to be to sellers of scrap iron in this country if they are bound to sell to a limited number of buyers. If the advantage is going to be placed at the doors of local foundries is there any indication that they are not going to raise the prices of their products in accordance with the monopoly given to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, very unlikely that there will be many cases in which there will be good reasons for regulating the exports of commodities. <Col N="43" /> There are very few commodities exported that we are anxious to restrict. The only commodities that would come within that class are certain raw materials in respect of which there may, at some time, exist a scarcity.  At the present time there is, due to exceptional circumstances, a scarcity of scrap iron, and furthermore, various international complications have made it more difficult to procure easily supplies of iron ore.  At least that applied last year to some extent until General Franco's forces succeeded in occupying the northern coast of Spain.  In any event, there is an exceptional demand for this material and, at any time, that demand may reach such limits that there might be difficulty in securing the supplies necessary to keep our own industries going.  It is in such circumstances that the powers conferred by this Bill will be used.  It is impossible to indicate what one would regard as normal output or when it is considered necessary to exercise the powers in the Bill.  That is a matter upon which individual judgment must be exercised at the time.  Some people may hold that these powers should have been taken and operated long ago.  It was, in fact, intended to do so.  It might be contended that the amount of best scrap iron left in the country was nil, and that we had been dilatory, or that these powers should not be exercised, except in circumstances of very grave emergency. Some individual judgment will have to be brought to bear on the question. The individual carrying the responsibility should be prepared to defend his judgment, but should have power to give effect to his decision if, in his opinion, a decision to restrict exports is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not altogether a matter of price.  The price of scrap iron has gone up recently.  It went up and then showed a tendency to fall again.  The manner in which the Bill is to work is similar to the Sheepskins Act to which I referred, making it possible to control and to protect the interests of parties engaged in the export of materials.  I think it will be agreed that the control of sheepskins was so <Col N="44" /> regulated as to prevent any undue power being given to purchasers of sheepskins to depress prices.  While one must have due regard to the necessities of scrap iron the primary consideration must be to ensure that the materials necessary to keep an important industry going are available if international conditions make it impossible to get outside supplies.</P>
    <P>There are more iron foundries in the country than the two firms to which Deputy Dillon referred.  There are quite a number of firms and there is likely to be sufficient competition between them to secure scrap iron for use in their foundries to enable a fair price to be maintained, without Government regulations at all.  I do not think it is likely that many more Bills of this kind will be required.  I have been pressed in the Dáil and outside to take power to regulate the export of timber.  I do not think the time is altogether ripe for that.  It may come some time, and that power to regulate the export of timber would have to be taken.  It has been frequently urged in reference to this Bill that the powers should be there, even though not brought into use except in special circumstances.  The question of the percentage of scrap iron that iron founders might use is one upon which even experts would hold different opinions.  At the moment iron founders think that the percentage of iron ore in use is unusually high.  In other words, the difficulty in obtaining scrap iron of a certain quality has compelled them to use a higher percentage of iron ore than would ordinarily be the case, with the result that their production costs have been increased accordingly. Whether that is so I do not know.  I do not know what would be regarded as a proper percentage. It would vary according to the class of products.  There is a natural limit to the percentage of scrap iron used and I do not think there is any danger that that limit will be exceeded, because quality would deteriorate very rapidly if that happened.</P>
    <P>I would not like the impression to go out that the introduction of this Bill has been promoted by the iron <Col N="45" /> founders.  It is quite true that there were consultations with the iron founders, in an endeavour to ascertain what their position was in respect of supplies, and what result they anticipated the abnormal demand would have on the available stocks in the country, but the decision to promote the Bill was taken by the Government, with due regard to all the circumstances, and not for the special purpose of protecting the special interests of iron founders, or of any other section of the community.  It was considered, in the circumstances which existed last year, that these powers should be there.  If we had those powers in the early part of last year we might have felt it necessary to exercise them.  The situation changed, however, and the urgency of the Bill became much less; but, it is felt that the circumstances which existed at the beginning of last year may be repeated, in which case the power of regulation should, we feel, be there. Even though regulation may be brought into operation in a purely nominal way in the beginning, it might become more than nominal if certain developments occurred.  Every Order, of course, which is made under the Bill will be laid before the Dáil, and it will be in the power of the Dáil to secure the annulment of an Order if it thinks that the circumstances do not justify it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Benson, I do not think it would be practicable to get a definition of &ldquo;scrap iron&rdquo; which could be inserted in the Bill.  The only way in which the Bill can be made effective is by leaving it to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners to determine what is, or what is not, &ldquo;scrap iron.&rdquo; In the case of many import duties and import restrictions a similar procedure has to be followed and the judgment of the Revenue Commissioners brought into play.</P>

    <P>  In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Industry and Commerce;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;retail trade or business&rdquo; includes the business of a barber or hairdresser, the business of a dyer or cleaner, the business of the lending for reward of books or periodicals, the business of a pawnbroker, the sale of refreshments or intoxicating liquors, and retail sales by auction, but does not include the sale of programmes and catalogues and other similar sales at theatres and places of amusement;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;wholesale shop&rdquo; means any premises occupied by a wholesale dealer or merchant where goods are kept for sale wholesale to customers resorting to the premises; the word &ldquo;shop&rdquo; includes&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any premises in which a retail trade or business is carried on;</P>
    <P>(b)  any wholesale shop;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> (c)  any warehouse occupied for the purposes of his trade by any person carrying on any retail trade or business or by any wholesale dealer or merchant;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; when used in relation to a shop means the person who carries on business at that shop; the word &ldquo;week&rdquo; means the period between midnight on Saturday night and midnight on the succeeding Saturday night;</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 25, to delete the words: &ldquo;the business of a dyer or cleaner&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the business of serving customers in connection with the business of a dyer or cleaner or launderer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say much about this amendment, because I have already tackled the Minister three times on this matter.  I claim that I have done part of his work for him because I have added the word &ldquo;launderer,&rdquo; which he had already added to the Conditions of Employment Act and not added to the Hours of Trading Bill.  I do not know whether it is his intention to bring it in or not, but there was an amendment down by the Minister to include it in the Conditions of Employment Act.  However, I think that this amendment does give us what we want, and at the same time leaves all the shops and offices in the factory, used for the purpose of receiving laundry, dyeing and cleaning parcels, still under the operation of those Bills.  I hope the Minister will agree to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think an amendment of this kind is necessary, and I am prepared to accept this one in principle. Perhaps the Deputy would allow me an opportunity of consulting the Parliamentary draftsman as to the form the amendment should take by holding over his for the next stage. Such an amendment, I agree, is required.  Otherwise, a laundry might be held to be subject to the provisions of the Bill even though the work done in it was industrial work within the meaning of the Act of 1936.  A <Col N="49" /> similar question arose on the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Bill when I indicated that I would produce an amendment on the next stage extending the reference to the depôt work of dyers and cleaners to depôts generally where goods are received for cleaning or repairing.  A similar provision may be necessary in this Bill, and I undertake to have the matter considered.</P>
      <P>There are, in fact, possible changes in the wording of this measure which may be consequential on the ultimate form of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Bill.  It will be necessary, therefore, I think, to keep one stage of this Bill ever until we have seen the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Bill in its final form in order to ensure that the terminology of both will correspond.  Whatever changes there are in the definition of a dyer and cleaner, and whatever provisions are made in respect of the work of a launderer in one Bill, may cause consequential changes in another.  An amendment of the kind that the Deputy suggests will be required, and I undertake to have it available for the next stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 33, to delete the words: &ldquo;to customers resorting to the premises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the section as it stands&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;wholesale shop&rsquo; means any premises occupied by a wholesale dealer or merchant where goods are kept for sale wholesale to customers resorting to the premises.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;resorting to the premises&rdquo; limit the operation of the Bill and we object to that.  You may <Col N="50" /> have objectionable types of shops to which customers do not resort.  The object of the amendment is to have that type of shop covered by the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same question arose in connection with the Conditions of Employment Act.  It is desirable to distinguish between a wholesale establishment which is, in fact, a shop, and a wholesale establishment which is, in fact, an office.  The words used are intended to make that distinction. I have asked the Parliamentary draftsman to consider whether the words are completely satisfactory; whether the expression should not be a place where goods are kept to which customers may resort rather than the phrase used here.  Subject to whatever verbal changes, if any, which may be considered desirable, I think it is well to keep that distinction because we are legislating here for conditions of employment and hours of trading in shops which are, in fact, shops and not establishments which are, in fact, offices.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to have a distinction between a wholesale establishment which is conducted like a shop as against a place that is an office only. Hence the distinction which appears here.  While the actual wording of this may be reconsidered, the purpose of it will not be changed.  We are anxious to ensure that this Bill will apply only to premises occupied by a wholesale dealer where goods are kept for sale to a customer who might resort or be at liberty to resort to the premises.  In any event, whatever wording we have in the other Bill will have to be reproduced here.  It will be the same in both Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, before line 41, to insert the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;premises&rsquo; includes any van or other vehicle, barrow or stall whether stationary or not stationary in relation to which any retail trade or business is carried on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In certain parts of the Bill there are certain obligations imposed on certain places where goods are sold.  I presume it is the intention of the Minister to ensure that the travelling shop is caught.  I take it for granted that that is his intention.  Section 8 (4) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provisions of this section shall extend to any place where any retail trade or business is carried on as if that place were a shop and as if in relation to any such place the person by whom the retail trade or business is carried on were the proprietor of a shop.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is considered that perhaps the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; would not catch the travelling shop and the idea of this amendment is to ensure that the travelling shop will be caught.  Therefore, the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is defined as indicated in the amendment. Perhaps the better way of explaining the amendment is to say that it is to make assurance doubly sure that the travelling shop is caught by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Deputy would in fact achieve is to restrict to some extent the scope of the Bill.  The term &ldquo;place&rdquo; is all-embracing. The phrase which the Deputy quoted is intended to apply to a vehicle or to any place, whether it is a premises, or a van or a stall or a barrow, where any retail trade is carried on, and even to a place where retail trade is carried on even if there is no premises or stall or barrow or van.  The effect of the amendment <Col N="52" /> would be therefore to restrict to a limited extent the scope of the Bill. It would confine its operation to retail trade carried on in a premises or from a van or other vehicle, barrow or stall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all included in the term &ldquo;place&rdquo; which is wider and which makes it clear that a barrow or a stall or a premises or a van, provided retail trade is carried on, is covered by the Bill.  Therefore, I have to resist the amendment because the amendment, I think, achieves the reverse of what the Deputy has in mind, to some extent, in so far as it limits the scope of the Bill rather than extends it.  There is no doubt whatever that the phraseology of Section 8 (4), which is repeated through the Bill extends the scope of the Bill to cover travelling shops, stalls, and barrows.  It even extends it wider than that because it extends it to catch any trader carrying on retail trade anywhere, in any place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal is to substitute for the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; the word &ldquo;premises.&rdquo;  Therefore, he confines the scope of the section to premises, even though he puts in another sentence to make it clear that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; includes vans, stalls, and barrows.  No matter how he defines &ldquo;premises&rdquo; the effect of the amendment is to restrict the scope of the Bill, because the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; is obviously wider in connotation than any definition of the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; because we say in the Bill that its provisions shall apply to any retail trade carried on in any place, whether there is or is not a premises or stall or barrow or van.  The retail trade would be subject to the Bill in any case.  If the Deputy merely wants to make sure that travelling shops are covered the amendment is unnecessary. <Col N="53" /> I give him that assurance most definitely.</P>

      <P>I am not going to duplicate the debate by arguing it very much further, except that I think there is a certain difficulty in interpreting certain statutes as to what is the definition of the word &ldquo;contravention.&rdquo; I think it has been the practice here not to define it.  It is extremely doubtful when the phrase is used &ldquo;in contravention of this particular section,&rdquo; whether or not that would cover an Order made under the Act. In an English Act, the Shops Act, <Col N="54" /> 1934, I think you will find that the word &ldquo;contravention&rdquo; is defined for the first time.</P>

If the Deputy wants to press the point he might promote a private Bill to amend the Interpretation Act.  So far as I am concerned, I must rely on the advice given by the Parliamentary draftsman and his assistants, and I am advised by them that definition of the term &ldquo;contravention&rdquo; is not necessary.</P>

      <P>In page 3, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:&mdash;&ldquo;the word &lsquo;chemist&rsquo; means a person entitled to keep open shop for the sale of poisons under the Pharmacy Act (Ireland), 1875, as amended by the Pharmacy Act (Ireland), 1875, Amendment Act, 1890.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it would be right that Deputies who have amendments to define the term &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; in connection with particular sections of the Bill should have regard to the terms of this amendment, which is certainly not so wide as some of them propose.  The definition given is one which I have settled in consultation with the Minister for Justice.  That definition is, I think, adequate and will secure that the various sections of the Bill in connection with which the term &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; is used will have the exact scope and operation which I intended in framing it, and not the somewhat wider scope which other amendments seemed to indicate might be urged by Deputies.</P>

      <P>In page 4, at the end of the section to add the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The proprietor of any shop may on giving not less than one month's notice to all persons employed to do shop work in his employment substitute for the purpose of this section in any year, any of the following days for Easter Monday, Whit Monday, or the first Monday in August, that is to say:-</P>
      <P>(a)  Ascension Thursday;</P>
      <P>(b)  Feast of Corpus Christi;</P>
      <P>(c)  Feast of SS. Peter and Paul;</P>

      <P>(4)  The following provision shall have effect for the purpose of the next preceding sub-section of this sub-section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the notice mentioned in the said sub-section shall be in writing and may be given to any person by handing a copy thereof to him personally or by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous position in the place in which such person is employed;</P>
      <P>(b)  no day mentioned in the said sub-section shall be substituted under that sub-section in a year in which such day falls on a Sunday;</P>
      <P>(c)  when a day mentioned in the said sub-section is substituted under that sub-section by the proprietor of a shop in respect of any year, the day so substituted shall in that year and in respect of all persons employed by such proprietor to do shop work be a public holiday within the meaning and for the purpose of this Act instead of the day for which it is so substituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, I think, does not affect any other amendment.  It endeavours to secure a provision similar, although the wording may not be exactly the same, to that included <Col N="56" /> in the Conditions of Employment Bill. It gives the employers the right to substitute Catholic holidays for certain public holidays mentioned in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment has been moved under a misunderstanding. There is nothing in the Bill concerning the closing of shops on public holidays.  The only clause in the Bill which touches in any way on the question is sub-section (2) of Section 17 which gives the proprietor the right to remain open on the half-holiday immediately preceding or immediately following a bank holiday if he closes on the bank holiday.  The amendment does not appear to be necessary in this case and I do not think it should be urged.  I gather from the terms of it that the Deputy had in mind the question of the conditions of employment of shop assistants rather than the hours of trading in shops.  In connection with the other Bill, that is the Conditions of Employment Bill, an amendment of this kind might be moved.  An amendment was, I think, in fact, suggested by the Deputy but was not pressed on the Committee Stage.  The question will again come forward on the Recommittal Stage of that Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have been one of the intentions of the amendment but the other is exactly as indicated in sub-section 2 of section 17. The idea is to put Catholic holidays on a par with bank holidays.  In certain places down the country the majority of the shops do, in fact, close on Catholic holidays and the day before is in a good many places regarded as a kind of half day or as a kind of Saturday.  The idea of this proposed section is to put the Catholic holidays on the same basis as a bank holiday.  I think the Minister will agree that in certain parts of the country Catholic holidays are observed to a great extent.  In some places they are observed even better than Sundays.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misunderstanding.  What we say here is that the proprietor of a shop may keep open on the half holiday <Col N="57" /> immediately preceding or following the bank holiday.  We do not propose to give him that right in connection with these other holidays.  It is an entirely different proposition to talk about permitting him to substitute one for the other.  He can always close his shop on any day, if he wishes. There is nothing in the Bill to compel him to keep open.  He can have a holiday every day in the week if he likes and, therefore, this section is really unnecessary in relation to this Bill.  I do not think the Deputy has quite grasped it.</P>

      <P>There is a provision in the existing law which requires a shopkeeper to close for a half day in each week.  We exempted him from that obligation in the week immediately preceding or immediately following one of these statutory public holidays, provided he closes on the holiday.  In the case of these other holidays he can shut or open if he wishes.  It is true that in some parts of the country, it is the general practice of shops to shut on Church holidays.  It is equally true that in other parts of the country these are regarded as the best business days of the year and it would be impossible to adopt any general provision of this kind in relation to them.  If the proprietor of the shop desires to close on one of these holidays, he can, of course, do so but he must also close on the half-holiday.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On page 4, before Section 4, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Save as otherwise provided in this section, it shall not be lawful for <Col N="59" /> the proprietor of a shop to keep such shop open on a day which is a public holiday for the serving of customers.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall not apply to any shop in which either the only business carried on therein is an exempted business or all the businesses carried on therein are exempted businesses.</P>
    <P>(3)  Each of the following businesses shall be an exempted business for the purpose of this section, that is to say, subject to the operation of an order made by the Minister under sub-section (4) of this section, any business specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order under this sub-section declare that any business specified in the Fourth Schedule to this Act shall cease to be an exempted business for the purposes of this section and upon the coming into force of such order such business as is specified therein shall cease to be an exempted business for the said purposes.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister may whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order (in this section referred to as an area exemption order) declare that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any particular area specified or delimited in such order shall be an exempted area for the purposes of such order, and</P>
    <P>(b)  this section shall not apply in respect of any shop situate in such area.</P>
    <P>(6)  Whenever an area exemption order is in force, this section shall not apply in respect of any shop situate in such area.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where any of the following businesses, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  post office business,</P>
    <P>(b)  the business of selling medicines or medical or surgical appliances when carried on by a chemist,</P>
    <P>(c)  the business of selling by retail intoxicating liquors,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> (d)  the business of selling meals for consumption on the premises,</P>
    <P>(e)  an exempted business,</P>
    <P>is carried on in such shop nothing contained in this section shall render it unlawful for the proprietor of such shop to keep such shop open on a public holiday for the serving of customers if such shop is so kept open for the purpose of any transaction connected with one or all of the businesses mentioned in this sub-section and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Minister may by order under this sub-section revoke or amend any order made under this section (including this sub-section).</P>
    <P>(9)  If the proprietor of a shop acts in contravention of this section, such proprietor shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment, as the Minister has already said, is to make it obligatory on the proprietor of a shop to close on a public holiday, or if you substitute a Church holiday, on a Church holiday.  In fact, its purpose is to make it compulsory on the proprietors of shops to close on these public holidays or Church holidays.  There is nothing in the Bill, as far as I can see, which makes it compulsory on the proprietor of a shop to close on any particular holiday, even on bank holidays, including Christmas Day or St. Patrick's Day.  The purpose of the amendment is to see that the closing of shops on certain holidays will be compulsory.  It is pretty generally recognised that Christmas Day is a day for general closing.  Even in the Post Office last Christmas we had that experiment tried, I think, very successfully. We also have that in regard to public houses.  I think the same also applies on St. Patrick's Day.  The others would follow similarly if this amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy has not given any reason as to why the amendment should be accepted.  I should like him to say why we should make it the law that shops should not be allowed to open on those days.  I think that is the ground upon which he must argue his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I make is that you do suggest that certain days should be observed as holidays in shop life.  I think it is rather ridiculous to have those holidays named, Christmas Day, St. Patrick's Day and so on, while at the same time there is no compulsion on a shopkeeper to close on those days.  There is no compulsion on him to observe a holiday even on Christmas Day or St. Patrick's Day.  In other words you leave it optional.  You say: &ldquo;Those should be days on which shops would close generally.&rdquo;  I think that is the intention of naming the holidays.  At the same time you do not say: &ldquo;You must close;&rdquo; you leave it optional. Surely the purpose of a holiday is to relieve the drudgery and tension of shop life; to allow those days to be definite holidays; to name them specifically, so that the people engaged in shop life would know definitely that those days are holidays.  If it is specifically laid down in the Bill that, say, the first Monday in August is to be a public holiday, then shop assistants and others engaged in shop life will know definitely that they are to have a holiday on that day.  I cannot see the force of naming those days as suggested holidays, without definitely deciding that they must be holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is clear, of course, that under the Conditions of Employment Act shop assistants are given the right to a public holiday. They are not allowed to work upon that day.  That being so, I do not know that there is any real public ground for prescribing that shops must be closed.  In so far as we are dealing with the conditions of employment of shop assistants, it is prescribed or proposed to be prescribed that shop assistants must not work upon the public holidays, other than those employed in the exempted trades, of course.  When we have provided for that, when we have protected shop assistants against being obliged to work on those days, is it necessary to go further?</P>

      <P>I think it is apparent. You say that shop assistants are not to work on certain public holidays, but you say to other people who make their own arrangements to carry on their shops: &ldquo;You can keep open, and you can compete unfairly with the people who observe good conditions and are good employers.&rdquo;  In other words you are catering for the bad employer; you are catering for the people who employ no labour but work their own business.  They are put in a favoured position unless this amendment is accepted.  The purpose of the amendment is to have fair competition all round.  We may take it that in the City of Dublin the assistants are getting the holidays in the principal shops, but the shops up in the back streets are keeping open because they may have nobody employed.  They are competing unfairly with the good employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>To add force to that argument, I think the Minister will agree that the definition of the word &ldquo;relative&rdquo; in the Shop Assistants (Conditions of Employment) Act was very broad.  It extended to great lengths, with the result that those people are able to have the services of their sisters and their cousins, and their aunts, in competing unfairly with the man who is employing shop assistants, and who as a result of previous legislation has got to close. The intention of this amendment is to protect the good employer against unfair competition.  I think the Minister will agree that it is a reasonable suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like also to support this amendment.  I think the Minister, in asking for reasons, really put the strongest case there is for this amendment into the mouths of those who are supporting it, when he referred to the fact that shop assistants are bound to get the public holidays under another Bill.  He indicates, therefore, that the shopkeeper who does not employ shop assistants, or who employs only relatives, can keep open on public holidays, while the shops which do employ assistants are compelled to close.  I <Col N="63" /> think that the element of competition is a very important matter in considering any kind of shops legislation. I think the Minister must admit that the greatest obstacle to legislation of this kind is the existence of small shops which employ nobody or employ only relatives, and are in competition with the larger shops.  I would go further and suggest that the smaller shopkeepers themselves would welcome legislation of this kind, and would welcome this amendment.  The small shopkeepers, just as much as anybody else, would be glad to close on say, Christmas Day, and other public holidays, but the fact is that each of them is afraid of the other. No small shopkeeper can close as long as another one is open, and the position to-day is that a lot of those small shops are staying open day and night, week in and week out, all over the country, and in Dublin City as well as elsewhere.  They would all be glad to close if there was legislation ensuring that, when one is closed, all the others are closed.</P>

The selling of meat, fish, milk, cream, bread, confectionery, fruit, vegetables, flowers or other articles of a perishable nature should be prohibited; also the business of a post office.  The Labour Party has all those amendments in.  There is a suggestion that we should make the public holidays the same as Sundays, <Col N="64" /> and therefore, upon those days, prohibit the sale of the commodities I have mentioned.

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seemed surprised that a case should be made for closing down shops on certain days but this demand is not a new one.  I am old enough to remember 25 or 30 years ago when the Gaelic League and other sections of the national movement claimed all over the country that on St. Patrick's Day there should be a closing too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>But so it is not, in many cases.  I do not think there is any need to make a case here for the closing down of shops on Christmas <Col N="65" /> Day.  I do not think there is any obligation on us to make that case.  I think the case is an obvious one, and as a matter of fact the case with regard to St. Patrick's Day is one that has been made for many years and made with very great vigour 25 years ago.  Hence, I do not think there is anything abnormal or revolutionary in a proposal of this kind, and I think the Minister ought not to endeavour to slide away from the question in the rather light way in which he has tried to slide away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to find out is whether all these amendments are to be taken as representing the whole idea, in regard to shop hours, of the Labour Party or whether they are to be taken as separate points.  If the Labour Party tell me that we should treat the public holidays in the same way as Sundays, allowing to remain open on these holidays the shops that we allow to remain open on Sundays, and compelling to close those shops that we compel to close on Sundays, I am prepared to say that there is a lot to be said for that and I am prepared to consider the introduction of an amendment to the Bill that would meet that purpose; but if they do say that, then they have got to extend considerably their views as to the type of shops to be allowed to remain open on Sundays and holidays, because it would be an impossible position to create precisely the same conditions for public holidays that the various amendments moved by Labour Deputies suggest should exist upon Sundays.  I think that they did not give the matter very serious consideration when they put down these amendments, because it would lead to an impossible situation if you were to prohibit the sale of, say, ice cream on Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to consider the suggestion made at the outset as to having public holidays regarded as the same as Sundays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to consider the matter further.  If there is <Col N="66" /> any objection to introducing an amendment of that kind, it is rather in the nature of an instinctive reaction against legislating unnecessarily.  I think that these public holidays have been observed and will be observed, and if that is so, there is no reason why we should legislate and put the obligation on the Guards to deal with people who may depart in some respects from the letter of the law.  I certainly have no objection, but I should like to consider the matter, particularly from the point of view of the reaction upon rural towns of providing that the public holidays must be observed.  Of course, there have been these rights of substitution in regard to Church holidays, and possibly there are some towns in the country where neither are observed and where shops do not close down for either public or Church holidays. Therefore, I should like to have an opportunity of consulting the representatives of these rural areas before deciding on the matter.  I suppose it will be admitted that many of us are bringing city-bred minds to bear on the matter and that different conditions exist in rural districts, and it must be remembered that this will apply to rural districts as well as to towns.  I am prepared to consider it in the light of whatever modifications might have to be made for rural districts, but I want to make sure that everything that interferes with the exemptions provided for in the Fourth Schedule will be resisted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that both the Minister and the Deputies who have spoken have got away from the main point involved.  I think Deputy Hurley made it clear that what the Labour Party want to get at is this: That if there are certain conditions which compel a shop employing paid labour to shut up, shops of a similar type, which are run by unpaid labour &mdash;members of the family and so on&mdash; should be compelled to close at the same time and under the same conditions, because it would be unfair to the man paying labour to have to <Col N="67" /> close up his shop while those who are carrying on with unpaid labour should have the advantage of being allowed to open.  I think that is the main point Deputy Hurley wished to bring out, and I think it is one that should commend itself to the whole House.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 4, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for the proprietor of a shop to keep such shop open for the serving of customers on Christmas Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is going further than the other amendments, but the idea is, without yea or nay, or without apologies to anybody, to have complete closing of every shop on Christmas Day&mdash;without any reservations, exceptions or anything else, to have complete closing down on Christmas Day.  That is the gist and intent of this amendment, and I do not think the Minister can say that there can be any doubt about the meaning of its wording.  Of course, I know that when amendments are proposed in this way the Minister is reluctant&mdash;and, I suppose, rightly so&mdash;to accept the amendment as worded, even though he agrees with the principle of the amendment.  Therefore, in putting down an amendment the object, as a rule, is only to convey to the Minister a certain idea, and then, if the Minister accepts it, he can have the amendment put down in his own way by his own Parliamentary draftsmen. The idea of this amendment, as I have said, is to have complete closing on Christmas Day.  We are alleged to be, and we are supposed to be, a Christian country.  In fact, our new Constitution starts off with the words &ldquo;In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity,&rdquo; and furthermore, it goes forth as uttering to the world that we are a great Christian country.  Well, I think that as several Bills have been brought into this House since the Constitution was passed which were termed Acts <Col N="68" /> for the purpose of implementing the Constitution, this amendment is another way of implementing the Constitution since we start off in the Constitution with the words &ldquo;In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity.&rdquo; I think the amendment should commend itself to everybody who is a Christian, and particularly it should commend itself to this country of ours called Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for opening on Christmas Day, I hold, but different employers and people do find excuses for having their shops open on Christmas Day and having different other places open.  As a result, in a good many instances, employees suffer, because they cannot get home on Christmas Day, or because they are released at such a time on Christmas morning that there is no conveyance to bring them home.  Without going any further, I think it will be agreed at least that it has been an established custom in this country for everybody to spend Christmas Day at home.  In fact, I would nearly wager that the Minister himself spends Christmas Day at home.  I think it should be our intention here, as a Christian State, to endeavour to have complete closing of all shops on Christmas Day, and if we are a Christian country, to have Christmas Day celebrated or acknowledged in a Christian way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely opposed to this amendment.  It is possible that I may not be as good a Christian as Deputy McGowan, but in my opinion there is nothing contrary to the Christian view in allowing certain classes of shops, as defined in this Bill, to operate on Christmas Day. I suppose Deputy McGowan would be logical enough to urge also that labour of all kinds should cease on that day, and that no public transport service, no public electric light service or public water service or any other kind of service should be compelled to operate on Christmas Day; but if he will agree that public transport services and other such services are required, and that people must work in order to provide them, then perhaps he will also agree that some exceptions to his rigorous rule in regard to shops will be <Col N="69" /> necessary also.  I suggest that it would be rather un-Christian, for instance, to turn out all the hotel guests on Christmas Eve, because they could not be served on Christmas Day, and to tell them that they must stay out until St. Stephen's Day because the hotels must shut.  That is what would happen if this amendment were carried in its present form.  It may be his idea of Christianity to make it illegal for a chemist to sell medicines to a sick person, or bandages and iodine to a person who is injured, or in any other way to engage in the business of selling the goods he ordinarily sells throughout the year.  I do not think so.  I think that if the Deputy considers this matter again he will see that there must be exceptions to the general rule.</P>
      <P>You cannot shut the hotels, because a good many spend Christmas in hotels.  I hope that when my family grows up I will be able to release my wife from the labour of preparing the Christmas dinner and that we may all be able to spend the day in an hotel. I think it is desirable to permit the chemist to sell urgent medicines&mdash;and perhaps medicines are more urgently required on the afternoon of Christmas Day than on other days.  I think the Deputy will have achieved his good Christian purpose if we can get Christmas Day observed as on a Sunday in respect of the carrying on of the retail trade.  I certainly do not propose to go any further and, therefore, the difficulty that the Deputy anticipates in the framing of this amendment will not arise, because I am going to vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I prefaced my remarks by telling the Minister that when his Parliamentary draftsmen <Col N="70" /> got at it they might considerably maltreat it.  The intention is to close particular types of shops on Christmas Day.  If the Minister could go through a town or even the city on that day he would realise the conditions of which I speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there was a sale on Christmas Day?  The intention underlying the amendment is to have certain shops closed on Christmas Day, such as paper shops, sweet shops and so forth.  There can be no case made for opening them.  They could close the same as other premises.  The question of hotels does not arise.  I think the amendment should be accepted.  I gathered from the Minister that he felt the conditions on Christmas Day should be the same as on a Sunday.  The publichouses do not open on Christmas Day, but they open on Sunday.  We indulge in different forms of activity, sporting and otherwise, on a Sunday. Does the Minister want to have Christmas Day in Ireland the same as the English Christmas Day, where they play Association football matches and make it a general day of rejoicing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment suggests that certain shops, for which no case has been made, shall not be allowed to open.  So far as opening chemists' stores would be concerned, there might be a case of a sore head, and surely there are doctors enough available, and they have all the necessary equipment to deal with cases of emergency?  I cannot visualise a doctor writing out a prescription for a person with a sick head.  I am sure that doctor would have everything necessary at hand.  If these shops are allowed to open on Christmas Day, they will sell everything from a needle to an anchor.  When he compares Christmas Day with a Sunday, the Minister makes a definite error.  I ask him to accept the principle of the <Col N="71" /> amendment, and he can later put it in his own words.</P>

      <P>Up to this there has been no legal restriction on the carrying on of retail trade on Christmas Day.  Most Deputies will agree that Christmas Day has been reasonably well observed by the retail traders, and there is no reason to assume they are going to develop all the evil habits Deputy McGowan foresees.  There is nothing in the Bill to compel them. We just simply leave the law as it stands, in order to ensure that it will operate on Christmas Day the same as on a Sunday.  I am not saying that Christmas Day is the same as a Sunday. I think we are going far enough when we fix the legal limits as to what people may not do on Christmas Day in the future the same as in respect of a Sunday.  Personally, I do not think it is an un-Christian act to do many of the things the Deputy seems to deplore.  I would not mind playing golf on a Christmas morning.  I have often done it.  If I find myself short of cigarettes or tobacco, I am glad to purchase them on Christmas morning.  I think most people will take the same commonsense view as that which I have expressed.  I do not know whether the Deputy wants to see a completely workless Christmas Day, on which everybody will stay at home and nobody will have to labour.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent that, if the Deputy wishes to carry out a crusade for it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), page 4, line 30, to delete the words&mdash;&ldquo;a specified time&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;eight weeks from the date of the publication of the said notice (in this section referred to as the specified time).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with the section which relates to the meaning of closing orders.  The provision in the Bill as it <Col N="72" /> stands is that the Minister will make and cause to be published an order which will be operative after any possible objectors have been given a reasonable opportunity of making their objections.  The term is defined only as a specified period.  I think in other legislation of this kind dealing with trade boards and otherwise there is a limit put on that specified period and the purpose of the amendment is to put on such a limit.  I seriously suggest that eight weeks is a reasonable time in which objections might be made or in which representations might be made by any person who desired to make them.  Perhaps the Minister will accept the principle of the amendment, which simply puts a limit on the time.  There is a tendency in legislation nowadays to give to Ministers very wide powers which they will use at their discretion. I have no doubt that the present Minister would operate that power fairly according to his lights, but we are legislating for all time, at least for a possible future Ministry, and I think the Minister should agree that two months is a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>It is really a small point and I would much prefer to leave the Bill as it stands.  I have always found that arbitrary provisions in respect of time and places generally led to difficulty and very often to delay.  The Deputy has the idea of speeding up the operation of the Bill, but I think he missed the point.  A Minister who wished to delay making an order need not rely on the term &ldquo;specified time.&rdquo;  He can give notice of his intention to make the order, but once he gives notice, the Deputy may be certain that he has made up his mind that the order is to be effective and he will insert such reasonable time as appears to him necessary to ensure that the interested parties will have an opportunity of appreciating what is going to happen and making their representations.  I would much prefer to leave the time unspecified.  It will mean more expedition than under the rather arbitrary provision which the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>(3)  If after holding such inquiry it appears to the person holding the inquiry that it is expedient that a closing order should be made under any section of this Act, he shall prepare a draft order and submit it to the Minister together with his report thereon and after considering the draft order and report thereon the Minister shall if he is of opinion that it is desirable that a closing order should be made publish notice of his intention to make such order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 gives the Minister power to cause a public inquiry to be held. That is one of the functions which the Minister holds under the Bill with regard to the exemption of certain classes of shops from the weekly half-holiday. But Section 5 does not <Col N="74" /> prescribe that the person holding the inquiry shall make a report or prepare a draft order.  Under the Shops Act of 1912, the Minister had power to direct a person to hold an inquiry, and in that case the person holding the inquiry had to make a report and draft an order.  I think it would be desirable to have an amendment to this effect inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is entirely unnecessary.  I do not see that anything is to be gained by putting the matter upon this formal basis.  Here discretion is given to the Minister.  He is given power to cause an inquiry to be held, and in the exercise of that power to appoint a fit and proper person to hold such inquiry if he thinks it is desirable, but it is for him to decide whether or not that information is to be made public. The insertion of the amendment would change the scope of the inquiry and cause considerable delay.  I would prefer the Bill as it stands.  The Bill says that the Minister may make an order to hold a public inquiry.  It is necessary to have this section as it stands so that power will be there requiring evidence to be given and making it a penalty to commit perjury or give false information.  That is the reason why the section is there as it stands.  It is undesirable that we should go further and make it a formal inquiry with a written report at the end.  That would cause delay and it would restrict the Minister in the choice of the person to hold the inquiry.  If the amendment were insisted upon it might work out so that the inquiry would not be held.  At any rate, the Minister will endeavour to get the information by inquiry and this would be carried out by his own officers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 6, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever and so often as an application is made to the Minister by a representative number of the proprietors of shops of a particular class in a particular area and of persons employed to do shop work in connection with shops of that class in that area requesting him to make an order under any Part of this Act, the Minister shall, unless he considers the application frivolous, take such steps as may to him seem fit for the purpose of making such order.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every order made under this section shall be an hours of trading order and the provisions in Part III of this Act relating to the making of an hours of trading order shall have effect and apply to every such order as if these provisions were re-enacted in this section, save only that whenever such order relates to a day which is the weekly half holiday, the specified hour of closing may be earlier than six o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Minister has power under this Bill to make an order fixing the closing hours for any specified class of shop.  There is no machinery in the Bill providing for the initiation of proceedings so as to secure that closing orders will be made.  It is presumed that something in the nature of uniformity of closing will be arrived at. You may have a shopkeeper in a certain town who may not act in unison with other shopkeepers and this would jeopardise the chances of the different shopkeepers and shop assistants making certain arrangements which they may wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is undesirable and it might be made inoperative by any individual Minister operating the Act.  From the point of <Col N="76" /> view of the effective administration of the Act, it is better to have the responsibility of initiating and making orders placed upon the Minister.  The Minister is responsible to the Dáil and the Dáil is the body to press him to do things if he is not inclined to do them himself.  It is this thing of taking the view of the traders that has made the existing Act largely inoperative. There is a provision in the existing Act for two-thirds of the traders concerned being in favour of an order. The difficulty is who constitutes representative traders.  If you count heads the opinion of the smallest trader will offset and carry as much weight as the opinion of the largest trader.  Then, if you regard their turnover and the size of the shop you will find that it will be difficult to lay down anything like standard rules determining whether application is to be made by a representative number of traders or by an unrepresentative number of traders.  I think that in practice the applications will come in and the Minister or the officer acting for him will be able to form a reasonable conclusion as to whether they are worth taking seriously.  Having come to the conclusion that they are worth taking seriously, and having ascertained the general feeling of the parties interested by the inquiry and having discovered that there is a general feeling in favour of a closing order, the Minister would make the closing order with the general view in mind to secure uniformity throughout the country.  There are cases where the Minister will make a closing order without applications. The insertion of the amendment here would be interpreted to mean that the Minister should await the application before acting.  I do not think that the Minister should be bound, even by implication, to await applications because there will frequently be a need to bring conditions in adjoining areas into conformity, and making an order in one area may have to be followed by making an order in another&mdash;even though there may not be any application&mdash;and without reference to opinion in the locality.  Even if the amendment were restricted to Part I, I would be opposed to it.  I much prefer to leave the Bill as it stands.  If the Minister <Col N="77" /> fails in his duty it is here in the Dáil he should be made responsible and it is here that pressure should be brought to bear and not in the form of applications from numbers of traders who may or may not be representative according to the individual views of the Minister or the person representing him.</P>

      <P>I anticipate that in the ordinary course at the beginning there will be a number of orders made in order to establish the position.  But when the question of changing these orders arises it will be following representations from interested parties in the areas concerned.  If these representations lead to changes in some areas, they may have to be followed by consequential changes in other areas, to prevent any wide irregularities in the practice in different parts of the country.  It would not be necessary to wait for representations for any other area but, once the practice has been established, the Deputy can take it as extremely probable that, unless somebody makes representations that it should be changed, no change will, in fact, be effected.</P>

We are proposing, under amendment No. 18, to delete paragraphs (b) and (c) of sub-section 3 which were the paragraphs which provoked most criticism.

      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the premises occupied by the proprietor of a shop are divided into two or more separate departments in which different businesses are carried on such proprietor may apply to the Minister for a certificate and the Minister if in his opinion the separate departments are so constructed that they can be closed to comply with the provisions of this Act shall issue a certificate in the prescribed form defining such departments or so many of them as he may think fit and each of such departments so defined shall be deemed to be a separate shop for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>Everybody recognises that it would be within the rights of any person to have one shop on one side of the street carrying on one class of business and another shop on the other side carrying on another class of business.  Under present conditions, in which a number of lines seem to be grouped together in one shop, it is obviously unfair that a trader who is carrying on one class of business should not be given the option of making such structural alterations as would satisfy the Minister, leaving out, of course, the idea that there would be merely a curtain for the purpose of evading the regulations. The idea is that subject to the Minister's approval, he should be able to make such structural alterations as are necessary to place that section of the shop in which this trading is carried on beyond any suspicion of communicating with the rest of the shop, and that in that way a proprietor would be allowed to carry on what would be, in effect, another class of business.</P>

On the face of it, it appears reasonable that where it is possible for the proprietor of a shop to make such structural arrangements that there are, in effect, two distinct establishments, they should be treated as separate establishments.  That is, of course, an entirely different position from what one visualises in the case of a store like Woolworth's, where a multitude of different businesses are carried on under the same roof, and where such alterations could not be made; but where the same premises can be turned into two establishments, even though owned by the same proprietor, and arrangements made to ensure that there can be no successful evasion of the obligations under the Act, I should like to meet the case.  If the Deputy will allow his amendment to stand over, I shall endeavour to have an amendment framed by the Parliamentary Draftsman to provide for the circumstances the Deputy visualises.</P>

The section makes it lawful to serve stores required by any naval, military or air force authority of the State, or required for any ship or aircraft on arrival at or before departure from a port or aerodrome.  Does that refer to the naval forces of our own State?  However, that is not what I want to draw particular attention to. There might be other exceptions where it might be necessary to open <Col N="83" /> a shop for the purpose of conveniencing people at hours other than the prescribed hours of opening.  For instance, in some of the country places, when deaths take place, it is often necessary to get stuff in a hurry for a wake or a funeral.

      <P>I think we should have an all-in debate on this amendment because in amendment No. 22, Deputy O'Brien and Deputy McGowan are moving to achieve a result directly opposite to that which Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Benson aim at in this amendment.  This is an enabling Bill and its general purpose is to give the Minister power to do things by order.  It does not itself prescribe what is to be done; it does not lay down rules subject to which the Minister is to exercise these powers.  It merely defines what his powers are and thereby substitutes the Minister in relation to the hours of trading of shops for the present authority, which is local government authority.  If we are going to give the Minister powers and to allow him to exercise these powers after public inquiry and subject to the overriding power of the Dáil to annul his orders, these powers should at least be adequate to enable him to deal in a suitable manner with any situation that may arise.  We, therefore, provide here for the possibility of the exempted trades being added to or subtracted from by order. That is what this section deals with and that is what these amendments deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, as Deputies are aware, set out in the various Schedules of the Bill the trades which are exempted from these provisions &mdash; from the obligation to close for the weekly half-holiday, <Col N="85" /> from the operation of hours of trading orders entirely and from the obligation to close on Sundays &mdash; but in connection with each of these schedules, the Minister is given power, by order, to add to the trades in the schedules, or to take some trades from the schedules and make them subject to closing orders.  I think he should have these powers.  It has been my experience in relation to Acts of this kind that it is inevitable that circumstances will arise which people cannot foresee and to deal with which fairly wide powers are necessary. If we are to proceed in this way, and I think it is necessary that we should do so, rather than by the more laborious manner of stating on the face of the statute what is to be the law and making that immutable, the powers of the Minister must be fairly wide and he must be given such powers as are contemplated here.  We have an amendment by Deputy Dockrell which seeks to deprive the Minister of the power to take trades out of the schedules, and an amendment by Deputy O'Brien which seeks to deprive the Minister of the power to put trades into the schedules.  I think he should have both the power to put in and to take out, and having said that, I am prepared to sit down and listen to the Labour Party and Deputy Dockrell argue the case out between them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea in this amendment is to prevent any addition to the list of exempted businesses set out in the Schedule, so that the Minister should not have power, perhaps next year, or in other years, to make an order dealing with provincial towns, exempting, if he so desired, all trades to which the provisions of Section 15 applied, in <Col N="86" /> relation to the weekly half-holiday.  A Minister might come along and say &ldquo;I declare all trades in the Schedule to be exempted trades.&rdquo;  In other words, if he wanted to do away with the weekly half-holiday all he had to do was to include all trades in the Schedule and he could achieve his object.  The intention of the amendment is to stop that.  While there is a good deal to be said for giving the Minister certain powers, those proposed to be given in the section go too far.</P>

      <P>Whatever might be said for Deputy Dockrell's amendment, there is nothing to be said for this one.  I could understand Deputy Dockrell arguing against the Minister having power to take trades out of the Schedule, in so far as the Dáil decided that they should go in, but I certainly think he should have power to add. We are in the position that we do not know what interpretation would be given by the courts on the Schedule, and we might find trades we intended to exempt held to be not exempt, unless this power could be exercised on their behalf.  As a safeguard against such interpretation of the Schedule it is necessary to have this power.  I do not think there is the slightest possibility of any Minister at any time using this power to defeat the sole purpose of the Bill.  There would be such an uproar that he could not get away with it.  If he could get away with it, even if he wanted to do it, and if he found that the majority in the Dáil were prepared to support him, he would not do it in that particular way.  All he would have to do would be to introduce a short Bill to repeal this measure and he would then achieve his purpose.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before Section 16, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may by order made after consultation with the representatives of the proprietors of any shops concerned in the making of the order and the persons employed to do shop work in such shops fix the day on which a shop may not lawfully remain open for the serving of customers after one o'clock on one weekday in every week and every such order may fix the same day for all shops in a particular area or may fix &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  different days for different classes of shops, or</P>
      <P>(b)  different days for different parts of the area, or</P>
      <P>(c)  different days for different periods of the year.</P>
      <P>(2)  Unless and until such order is made affecting shops of a particular class in a particular area the weekly half-holiday in respect of every shop in that area shall be such day as the proprietor may specify in a notice fixed in the shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill there is no power to fix a uniform half-holiday.  The Bill requires certain shops to close at one o'clock on certain days but the proprietors <Col N="88" /> of these shops can choose any day during the week.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that there will be uniformity in relation to the half-holiday, particularly in small towns.  We consider that to be desirable. The amendment endeavours to provide that in all towns when an application is made to the Minister by people in certain trades, he is empowered to order an inquiry to be held and to consult both shop assistants, shop owners and other local interests.  He can thereupon make an order that a certain day in the week within a specified area shall be the half-holiday for these trades.  I think that would be for the betterment of trade.  If a provision of this kind is not inserted in the Bill, things will become more or less chaotic, as a draper in one street might close for the half day on Wednesday while another further up the street might have the half-holiday on Thursday. That would be rather hard on the assistants and to a great extent would interfere with the object of the Bill. In small towns shop assistants are, to some extent, a class in themselves having certain activities in which they indulge jointly.  From their point of view it would be hard if some assistants were free on Wednesday afternoons while their colleagues were not free until Thursday.  Apart from that, if there is going to be indiscriminate half holidays, business will suffer as a consequence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy with the point of view expressed, and I would have provided for uniform half-holidays if it were practicable to do so.  That was the position under the existing law.  The existing law permits of a closing order being made after the holding of an inquiry and fixes the half-day.  All traders must give the half-day, although they are always permitted to substitute Saturdays.  While the existing law made that provision, it had the defect that it proved completely incapable of dealing with the position of mixed trading.  A shop engaged in one class of trade was subject to the half-holiday provision, but another class of shop was not so <Col N="89" /> subject, and could remain open for the sale of goods which it was permitted to sell.  In practice, of course, it remained open for the sale of all classes of goods.  That is how the half-holiday became in some instances inoperative in small towns where most shops do a mixed trade.  If this Bill is to be effective we have to provide an alternative arrangement that instead of a shop being entitled to remain open, if entitled to sell any class of goods, it will be compelled to close.  That is the only way to make it effective.  Merely to prescribe a uniform half-holiday goes by the board.  I decided that it was better to get effective enforcement than by maintaining the half-holiday proposition.  I presume Deputies grasp the point that if we prescribe that a shop must close any time when it is illegal to sell any class of goods in that shop, then I think we must recognise that we cannot have a uniform half-holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody, I suppose, contemplates prescribing the same half-holiday for every trade.  You might have a uniform half-holiday for different trades, but you could easily get into the situation in which a shop, doing a very mixed type of trade, might be compelled to close every day in respect of some class of goods that it was selling.  Apart from that, I do not think the danger of a considerable divergence from the practice in particular districts in respect of the half-holiday is very real.  The law in respect of half-holidays has been in operation now for a very long time, and the practice has been established in every town of having the half-holiday on some particular day.  At the moment it is prescribed by law.  In future it will not be, but I am quite certain that the practice will be continued. Everybody knows, commercial travellers, the rural population living in the vicinity of a town, and others &mdash; that a particular day is the half-day in that town: that there is no good in going in to trade there on that afternoon, and, consequently, they will not go in.  Therefore, shopkeepers, in their own interest, will continue to close on the recognised day.  It will not be to any one's advantage to open <Col N="90" /> on that day, because, in fact there will be no trade doing.  I think the risk of a considerable divergence from the practice, in respect of the half-holiday, that has grown up, is not very great. If it should develop I am quite certain that local chambers of commerce and other bodies will step in to regulate the matter.</P>
    <P>It is obviously in everybody's interest that there should be a uniform day.  It is in the interest of traders, because it enables the fact to be made known to people likely to come into the town for trading purposes. It is in the interest of the public who do not like to travel long distances and then find that the establishments they want to trade in are shut, or have changed their half-holiday unexpectedly.  It is certainly in the interest of the shop assistants, who are put in a position to take part in organised recreation which might not otherwise be possible.  In all the circumstances, I think it is inevitable that the practice will remain unchanged, and that we will have achieved our purpose in making the Act effectively enforceable by such a provision as is here.  I am in sympathy with the idea of uniform half-holidays, but we cannot get it except at the cost of lessening the efficiency of the Act, and I do not think it is worth that cost.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the shopkeeper is not allowed to remain open on the half-holiday immediately preceding and immediately succeeding.  In the sub-section the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is used and not the word &ldquo;and.&rdquo; My argument against the amendment is that what we have here is the law at present, and unless there is a good case for making a change, why do so?  I think that the great majority of shopkeepers have found it to their advantage to remain open on the half-holiday preceding the public holiday.  Very few, I think, exercise their right to remain open on the alternative half-holiday &mdash; that is the one succeeding a public holiday, and I think that is likely to be the practice in future.  Where an exceptional trade is carried on, it may be to the advantage of a shopkeeper to adopt the other practice, but even in that case I do not see that it makes any real difference from the point of view of the shop assistants.  I prefer to leave the sub-section as it is because it is the law at present and because there is really <Col N="92" /> no good argument for changing it.  If the law had been in the other form originally I would argue for keeping it. What I have stated is the established practice; that the majority of shopkeepers remain open on the half-holiday preceding the public holiday.  There may be cases where the type of trade carried on in a shop is such that it is more to the advantage of the shopkeeper to keep the half-holiday in the week following the public holiday rather than in the week before.  There is no reason why he should not do that. The only case that I can think of in my experience where shopkeepers exercised a discretion to remain open on the half-holiday following a bank holiday was where that half-holiday coincided with a Church holiday on which the shopkeeper anticipated a large influx of country people to the city.  I think there is no reason why shopkeepers should not be allowed to do that.</P>

      <P>The reason for bringing forward this amendment is due to the results which have followed from the operation of a similar provision in the Act of 1912.  Certain specific cases have been brought to the attention of members of the House indicating that chaotic conditions have resulted from the operation of the provision in the 1912 Act.  In certain towns some shopkeepers keep their establishments open on the half-day preceding the bank holiday, while others select the day following the bank holiday.  Shop assistants suffer as a result of this non-uniformity. I do not want to repeat what I said on a previous amendment, but a good deal of it is, I think, applicable to the amendment before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been my experience, and I think the experience of many shopkeepers whose opinions I have obtained, that it does not pay as a rule to remain open on the half-holiday following a public holiday, because their customers come to know that they close regularly on a particular day, so that even when they are entitled to remain open under this sub-section it is not worth their while to do so because their customers do not come into town.  The practice that has grown up is not to avail of the sub-section, <Col N="93" /> but rather the reverse except at special times like Christmas.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3) (b), line 47, after the word &ldquo;period&rdquo; to insert the following brackets and words&mdash;&ldquo;(not exceeding two months in any year)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to limit the period during which the operation of a half-holiday can be suspended in certain holiday resorts.  I think the Minister will agree that it is likely, where you have loopholes of this kind in an Act, that he will be inundated with requests to have the provisions of the Act suspended.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be some limitation.  We are suggesting two months.  Perhaps the Minister would be agreeable to limit this to the months of June, July and August.  If he were to do that it would save him, I think, from being inundated with requests for the exemption provided for in the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection that I have to putting in any period is that a period covering all possible cases would have to be so long that everyone would expect to get an order for that period, whereas in fact the circumstances would not require it. Again, I have an instinctive reaction against tying the Minister up in a particular way of that kind in advance of knowledge of the circumstances.  I do not suppose we will ever develop any winter resorts here, but something may happen in some part of the country which would justify the exercising of the power of this sub-section to a greater extent than the amendment would permit.  I do not think that is likely, but it may happen, and because it may happen, or because there may be some exceptional type of case even existing at the present time of which we are not aware, I would much prefer to leave the sub-section in the more general form in which it is here rather than make it too specific in itself.  From the point of view of the <Col N="94" /> shop assistant I do not think it makes any substantial difference.  The shop assistant has his hours of employment limited to 48 per week in any event, and that operates irrespective of whether the exemption is granted in respect of the half-day under this sub-section or not.  The traders who operate in these holiday resorts have, of course, only a certain limited time in the year in which to do business, and it is necessary to give them reasonable facilities to do that business.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from the interest of the traders, one must also consider the interest of the public.  Holiday resorts are very frequently centres of excursions.  We must not always think of them as places where people stay for a week or a fortnight or a month.  They are also places where people go for the day and where they might be very considerably inconvenienced by finding a certain type of establishments not open to cater for them.  In these circumstances, I think there should be this power of exemption. I take it that the Deputy agrees that there should be this power to exempt, although he wants to limit it by his amendment.  I would much prefer to leave it in the wider form, bearing in mind that any order the Minister makes is going to be laid on the Table of the Dáil, and if any Deputy thinks the order is improper or should be annulled, he can table a motion to have it annulled.  Certainly, he can arrange to have the matter debated here.  I know that the power of annulling orders is more apparent than real, because the House will always be reluctant to throw out the Government because of an order closing an ice cream shop or something like that.  But the mere ventilation of the case is often sufficient to secure that irresponsible action will not be taken in the exercise of a power of this kind.</P>

      <P>I think that the Deputy is trying to do something here which should not be done.  The Deputy will notice that there are two classes of businesses excluded from the various provisions of the Bill: (1) businesses which are called exempted businesses; and (2) businesses which are described in the schedules to the Bill. These are excepted businesses.  The difference between exempted and excepted businesses is that the Minister can by Order alter the exempted businesses.  He can add to their number or subtract from their number. But the excepted businesses are put outside the scope of his power altogether. The four businesses are: Post Office business; the selling of medicine or medical appliances; the selling of intoxicating liquor, which is controlled by another Act; and the selling of meals for consumption on the premises.  These four businesses are put outside the Minister's power and I do not think the Deputy should press his amendment to give the Minister powers in relation to the <Col N="96" /> number of such businesses.  He is proposing to add to them, but it would be illogical to give the power to add without giving the power to subtract.</P>
      <P>What in fact we are asking by the sub-section is that the Minister may, in relation to every other business, have certain powers to apply closing orders to them or exempt them from the obligation of closing orders.  But, in relation to these four businesses, he must keep his hands off.  They are going to be regulated by the Oireachtas. The Post Office is regulated by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and it would be improper for the Department of Industry and Commerce to step in and dictate to that Department how it should conduct its business.  If there is anybody who wants to talk to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, it is the Oireachtas not the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The sale of medicines, of course, is excluded for the obvious reason that the time of the day or the week in which medicines may be required is subject to considerations which do not permit of regulation.  We cannot prescribe the time at which some person may be injured or taken ill.  Consequently, that particular business is exempt from these closing orders.  Again the sale of intoxicating liquor is exempted from these closing orders because the Oireachtas deals with the matter otherwise under the liquor laws and should not permit of these laws being annulled or amended by orders made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The business of selling meals for consumption on the premises is exempted because we consider that there is no public interest to be served by restricting the hours in which the business may be carried on.  In fact, it is a business which must be carried on continuously.  It is because these four types of businesses are in an exceptional position that they are not dealt with as the other businesses mentioned in the Schedule in this particular way.  I think it would be undesirable to give the Minister any power in relation to their number or classification.</P>

      <Col N="98" /> That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1938, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (9 and 10 Geo. 5, c. 58, and No. 34 of 1928), including a Grant-in-Aid for the Acquisition of Land.</P>
    <P>A Forestry Bureau has been recently established by the Commonwealth Governments on the same lines as the existing Agricultural Bureaux maintained by them.  This country, with the approval of the Dáil, has been a contributory member of these Agricultural Bureaux for some eight years past, and it is considered that great advantages will be derived from association with the new Forestry Bureau.  Our membership will involve a yearly contribution of £93 15s. 0d. for five years.  The contribution for the current financial year can be met to the extent of £84 out of savings on other sub-heads of the Vote, leaving a balance of £10 to be provided.  This Supplementary Estimate is being introduced for the purposes of meeting the balance, and of obtaining approval for the expenditure as a whole.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Commonwealth Forestry Bureau followed a decision taken at a Commonwealth scientific conference held in London in September, 1936, for the purpose of reviewing the work done by the Agricultural Bureaux and Institutes.  The conference was attended by representatives of this country, and the annual contribution of £93 15s. 0d. decided upon as our appropriate share of the total annual cost of the bureaux amounting to approximately £3,000, was fixed on a <i>pro rata</i> basis similar to that which applies to the contributions made to other institutions of a similar kind.</P>
    <P>Our State Forestry Service is not yet fully organised, and there are numerous problems of a technical nature requiring study and development. For example, there are special problems relating to soils, and to the treatment of growing wood; problems relating to fungi and insect pests, etc., <Col N="99" /> as well as the general scientific problems of sylviculture and of the utilisation of forest produce.  These matters are of the greatest importance, and up-to-date and reliable information in respect of them is essential.</P>
    <P>There is no scientific journal available in this country dealing with the various technical aspects of forestry. The Forestry Bureau will deal with the general literature affecting all branches of forestry, and will collect and collate information on all matters relating to afforestation, and will circulate useful extracts from scientific journals and publications.  This information will be most useful, not only to the Forestry Service, but to the Government itself.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1938, for schemes for the Provision of Employment and the Relief <Col N="100" /> of Distress, including cost of administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn) Hugo Victor Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Estimate at the moment is rather formal.  It is not really brought before the House to raise the whole question of employment; it is merely to enable us to give the House certain information which Deputies would be entitled to have in relation to the practice. It is a rather technical question. The practice in connection with the Vote for employment schemes has hitherto been to sanction within the financial year, schemes representing in cost not more than the total provision in the Vote, with the result that there is always a considerable carry-forward in respect of schemes sanctioned but not completed within the financial year for which the money was provided.  The necessity for carrying forward a considerable part of the Vote into the succeeding year arises from a number of causes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Owing to the incidence of the Employment Periods Order the great bulk of the new works are sanctioned for the winter programme; and as both the commencement and the completion of the programme are gradual processes, the interval of four-and-a-half months from mid-November to the 31st March is much too limited for practical purposes;</P>
      <P>(2)  Owing to unavoidable difficulties in arranging with local authorities, and for other reasons, a considerable number of schemes are invariably held up to a late period of the financial year, with the result that in many cases works cannot actually be put in hands until close on 31st March.  In addition allocations are sometimes declined by local authorities, and this means either reallocation at a very late stage or perhaps the surrender of the amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the foregoing, it should be clear that in order to spend a given sum on employment schemes within a financial year, it would be necessary to sanction at an early date in that year works costing from 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. in excess of the sum which is required to be spent.  Proper financial procedure would not permit of the taking of a Vote in any financial year for a sum <Col N="101" /> which would be needed merely to allow commitments to be undertaken and the Supplementary Estimate for a nominal sum of £10 is, therefore, designed as a means of indicating to the Dáil the Government's general proposals in regard to employment schemes so that no difficulties in the matter of anticipating the authority of the Dáil in respect of the advance framing of continuous programmes of schemes would in future arise.</P>
    <P>In any year in which an active attempt is made to spend the whole of the money voted by the Dáil for the purpose of unemployment relief, two cases in practice will occur: (1) that the whole of the money must be allocated before the end of the year to specific works, and (2) that certain works for which the money has been allocated will not, in fact, have been fully carried out.  The total amount of money for which we must be authorised to make commitments must, therefore, in all cases exceed the amount of money which can, in fact, be spent.  Moneys unspent as above have in the past appeared as a re-Vote and are in effect a reduction of the apparent amount available for spending in the current year.  As this money will, in fact, be spent in the next year, and found out of Budget or other provisions, it may be regarded as belonging to that year's commitments.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this and in future years, in relation to portion of money which is voted and which obviously cannot be spent in relation to uncompleted works which will have to be completed in another year, to use such portion of that money as would, in practice, appear as a re-Vote for the purpose of financing other works which can, in fact, be started before the end of the financial year.  If, for instance, there was a particular work to which £12,000 had been allocated and we found that that work could not possibly come into that year, under the present arrangement that £12,000, not having been spent, would be barred.  What we are trying to do now is: We are informing the Dáil &mdash; that is the whole purpose of bringing forward this Vote &mdash; that we intend <Col N="102" /> to use that money to take up other alternative works.  That is being done.  Schemes representing a total cost of £120,000 in excess of moneys actually voted by the Dáil for the current financial year have been sanctioned and put in hands and, in addition, it is proposed to ask local authorities to contribute to the cost of employment schemes to be carried out during the spring and early summer, the total cost involved being approximately £140,000 &mdash; State contribution only.  If the local contributions are to be provided for out of the current year's rates, it is necessary that the local authorities should be informed of the offers at a very early date in February, as their rates meetings begin from that time.</P>
    <P>I think the House will understand the difficulty which we have been in; the fact that we have had to make this sort of provision; the generosity of the Minister for Finance in allowing us to take this particular way of dealing with it; and the fact that we are discharging our duty to the Dáil in telling them in advance what we are proposing to do.  Technically, I think on this Vote it would be possible for anyone to raise questions on the general employment policy and all the rest of it, but that is a matter for the Dáil.  I do not propose to raise those matters at all unless they are raised by somebody else.  I am here to discharge an obligation; that obligation has been discharged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the attitude of the Ministry on this question this year is very commendable.  Last year the public bodies were notified only in March, I think, that a certain amount of money would be available for them, provided they were prepared to put up a contribution, but they were told very specifically that they would have to raise a certain rate.  Unfortunately certain bodies had struck their rate, and they were left in an awkward position.  I do not know if the question which I am about to raise will be ruled out.  Do minor relief schemes come under this Vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact minor relief votes are financed out of the <Col N="103" /> central fund.  There is no contribution to them.  Therefore, they would not come under it from the point of view of informing the authorities in advance, but they may come under it in the sense of our having to make arrangements and commitments in regard to them.</P>

      <P>Some time ago, when we were complaining of the low wages being paid on minor relief schemes, the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that in his opinion the work they were doing on minor relief schemes was analogous to what would be done by agricultural labourers.  We endeavoured to persuade him to increase the rates to the rate prevailing for county council workers in the area.  His answer to that was that the work they were doing was not at all equivalent to the work being done by county council workers.  I know a case in County Wexford where men who were supposed to be working on minor relief schemes were breaking stones by hand in a quarry.  I submit that that is work similar to that carried out by county council workers, and that they should at least be given the county council rate.  I am not complaining about the Government at all in this matter.  I consider that the minor relief schemes have been abused by the county council in permitting that to be done.  The work suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary in the last debate was work similar to that done by farm labourers, and I should like to have his views on that question.  I do not think those men should be used for breaking stones by hand at 24/- a week. Some of them are on three days a week, for which they get 12/-, minus insurance.  Prior to being employed on minor relief schemes some of them had been drawing 12/6.  They are, therefore, in a worse position than when they were drawing unemployment assistance.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take that matter up, and to see that they are employed on work which he considers proper to <Col N="104" /> a minor relief scheme.  That is the only matter I want to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I had not an opportunity of listening to the whole of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, but I understand first of all that he introduced this Vote primarily for the purpose of giving local authorities an opportunity of making provision for whatever their contribution will be towards the expenses of minor relief schemes in the coming year.  Secondly, he stated that in regard to any works which would remain unfinished at the end of the financial year, the money for them would be transferred to some other work &mdash; probably some work which would be finished by the end of the financial year.  I should like to know something about drainage schemes.  I understand that portion of this money will be spent on small drainage schemes of one kind or another.  What is the Parliamentary Secretary's arrangement in such circumstances? Will he come to the Dáil again for the purpose of getting the authority of the Dáil to spend that money after the end of the financial year, or what other provision will he make to ensure that small drainage schemes are carried out in various parts of the country?  I myself recommended a few small drainage schemes in my own particular county some few years ago, and, although engineers were sent to report on them, no work has since been done in connection with them, in spite of the fact that the work is of very great importance, and that a very big number of men would be employed.  There is also another point which I should like to raise.  I know perfectly well that the Parliamentary Secretary cannot give me a reply to-day.  When local authorities are obliged to make a contribution towards the cost of carrying out minor relief works, it is only just that those local authorities should have the right at least of recommending schemes to be undertaken by the Board of Works.</P>

      <P>The trouble about the expenditure of this money is that it is confined to the areas where there is the greatest unemployment, with the result of course that, in each county, works are done in the same area year after year.  There are other areas in the county where it is necessary to do works just as important, but they cannot very well be done because of the small number of unemployed in the particular areas.  I do think it is not desired by the Parliamentary Secretary or the Board of Works to go on spending money indefinitely in the same areas.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should give some consideration also to those other areas where the number of unemployed is very small, in fact negligible, so that he might be able to devise some ways and means of meeting that situation. I think the local authorities, on the whole, are anxious to co-operate with the Parliamentary Secretary in giving effect to this scheme, but I think also it is the duty of the Parliamentary Secretary to meet the objections and susceptibilities of local authorities in regard to the areas in which the works are carried out.  There is no question about the fact that the condition laid down in regard to spending the money in areas where there is the greatest unemployment does not suit in certain counties, and I do think the Parliamentary Secretary should at least examine the point, so that some other means might be devised for meeting the local authorities in that respect. I am particularly anxious to get some reply about the drainage schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points which I want to make on this Vote.  First of all, I want to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that a good deal of hardship is occasioned by, shall I call it, the system of recruitment of labour for some of those schemes.  Although I represent South East Cork, I know a good deal about Cork City.  I have known men in Cork City whose wives happen to be dead, and who have large families &mdash; families of eight or nine or ten &mdash; but because they are not drawing the full amount of unemployment assistance, due to the fact that the wives are not living, they have not got the work that they would ordinarily get on those schemes if the wives were living.  I have known of some cases of very severe hardship being occasioned in that way, although probably the responsibilities and commitments of a man with eight or nine children would be greater, and probably his circumstances would require greater consideration, than, say, those of a man with a wife and five children. At the same time, the amount of unemployment assistance is taken as the criterion of these people's necessities. I think some means should be devised whereby the circumstances of a man and the number of people dependent on him, apart from the actual amount he draws in unemployment assistance, should be the standard by which employment should be given where employment is limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the question that was raised here previously on an Adjournment Debate on a question raised by me with regard to unemployed men on Spangle Hill will be dealt with and that these people will be eligible now for employment in city relief schemes. They were debarred under the conditions of the city schemes because they happened to live just outside the city boundary, and some of them were provided <Col N="107" /> with work which was not suitable for them because they had no experience of the county council relief schemes.  There is another matter upon which I should like to get information, and that is in connection with the aerodrome that was to have been erected in Midleton.  I do not know whether this is premature, or whether it is a matter that probably should not be discussed, but it comes directly under the ægis of the unemployment relief schemes because a certain amount of money was to be allocated for the erection of this aerodrome.  A certain amount of money was to be provided by the Cork County Council and Cork Corporation. I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary how far the preliminaries with regard to this work have gone, and whether the allocation that was made, I think, last year will be allowed to continue on into the coming year.  These are some of the points on which I should like to have information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to deal with the few points which have been raised.  As far as minor relief works are concerned, it is the nature of the works which are done which governs the matter.  No money is spent on minor relief works in which the work is done for a county road.  Take the question of the stones which are used. For instance, we are now finding quite definitely, in relation to certain bog roads and so on, that they are being used for other purposes than those for which they were originally built.  I came across a couple of cases in Kerry the other day, for example, where peat, wheat, and beet schemes have combined to throw on to roads which were built merely as bog accommodation roads to be used by carts and so on, the traffic of lorries, and heavy traffic of that kind, and it may be that some of these roads, which are built purely and simply for agricultural purposes, may have to be built in the future more soundly. Broadly speaking, however, the Deputy can take it that minor relief money is not spent upon county roads or anything of that kind.  It is spent on <Col N="108" /> boreens and so on, and if stones have to be broken for them, there is no reason why they should not be broken for them, and all I can say to the Deputy is that in the places where we do most of these works the people are more than anxious and willing to do anything which is required for the purpose of these particular roads.  To some extent, the carrying out of minor relief schemes at all in places like Wexford, Wicklow and Meath, and so on, was one of my own indiscretions.  Minor relief works had not hitherto been done at all in those areas.  They were completely neglected, and it is quite possible to put such obstructions in the way as to make it very difficult to do them again. Some of the obstructions that were put in the way, undoubtedly, have prevented us from doing some very useful work in the eastern counties which we should like to do.  The House, however, can take it that my intention is to carry out minor relief works in the spirit of minor relief works so far as it is humanly possible.  While mistakes may be made; that is the intention.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear with regard to Deputy Roddy's point in relation to drainage schemes.  The Deputy knows that these schemes are of three kinds &mdash; big bears, little bears, and very small bears, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking about the small bears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is thinking of the little bears.  Those are the schemes done out of minor relief moneys.  To the extent to which any of those are in course of operation they are being carried out, and a considerable number of them are being carried out.  Our experience has been that, while they were probably the most valuable of all the minor relief works that could be done, in an area in which they were most useful the period at which they were carried out most economically might be the wrong period for the purpose of employment and the relief of distress.  We have recognised that by experience, and last year we outraged all our previous views on the matter by concentrating on periods in which they ought to be done for value and by <Col N="109" /> making an exception for the little bears.  Some 400 minor drainage schemes of one kind or another were done during the spring and summer of last year.  I think we spent about £40,000 on that, and it is intended this year to continue that policy of doing minor drainage schemes during the summer.  I am quite satisfied that we got altogether better value and that a good many schemes which were technically impracticable in the winter have become easy and economic and useful when carried out in the summer. I think that our experience of last year has confirmed the policy of doing very minor drainage works in the summer.</P>
      <P>Now, there is no difficulty in the summer or at other times in doing works in poverty areas.  That is where we come to the issue of the whole question.  This money is not voted specifically for the purpose of doing works as such.  It is money voted by the Dáil for the provision of employment and relieving distress due to poverty and unemployment, and the works which are done are merely the machinery through which the purpose of the Dáil is carried out.  It is for that reason that schemes are done largely in the poverty areas.  As a result, we have done many thousands of works, such as bog roads, little bridges which enable children to go to school, roads to lands, roads to creameries and roads down the faces of cliffs to enable people to get up seaweed. All sorts of minor human adjustments in relation to the lives of very poor people have been done in connection with this Vote, and some of them are of almost inexpressible value in relation to the individual lives of those whom they benefit.  I have seen works which have made all the difference between living and not living in the district concerned, and some of them have been works of a very small but very critical character.  Now, the effect of that has been to improve the amenities of life in many ways among very poor people.  The people in those districts, therefore, have got the benefit of the expenditure and the benefit of the works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> The appeal which has been made to me, not merely by Deputy Roddy, but also by all sorts of people in all parts of the country &mdash; made very strongly and, in my opinion, a well-founded appeal &mdash; is in relation to people who say that because they are not in poverty areas they are deprived both of the money which goes for the relief of unemployment and of the amenities which are created in the expenditure of that money.  I think there is something in that case.  There are many small works of very high social value which cannot at the present moment be done out of this fund.  I am not entitled to use this money except for the provision of employment and the relief of distress amongst the poor.  The specific purpose of this expenditure is that it shall be for the provision of employment and for the benefit of poor people, and that it shall go eventually for sustenance and things of that kind.  Therefore, I am bound to turn my back on many works, irrespective of the high utility value they may have, if the expenditure on them does not discharge the purpose of this Vote unless, of course, where we find it necessary to experiment to find a suitable medium for expenditure. I think that that is agreed.</P>
    <P>The only question is that people do feel that there might be some arrangement made for the purpose of providing those amenities in non-poverty areas which are to-day being provided in poverty areas.  It is a question of who should provide them, whether they should be provided by the local authority or by the central authority. The difficulty, so far as the local authorities are concerned, is that there are little schemes which might be very desirable but which, as conditions stand, they cannot do &mdash; they are not allowed to do.  Broadly speaking, the local authority cannot legally do any road unless it is prepared to take over that road and maintain it.  There are, for instance, roads into little villages and, while the general feeling of the county council might be to do something to them, they find they cannot. As to the method of dealing with that in non-poverty areas, I am not now in a position to say.  It seems to be a case that is well founded.  It is <Col N="111" /> being examined and I hope some solution will be found.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hurley raised the question of men being kept out of participation in employment schemes, due to the fact that their unemployment assistance qualification was lower than that of other people.  He rather suggested that some new standard should be taken by which the number of dependents of a single man should be taken into account rather than his unemployment assistance qualification.  Deputy Hurley may not be aware of the fact that the whole of a man's dependents, in so far as they can be ascertained, are taken into account in setting his unemployment assistance provision.  The purpose of the Act is to examine into every man's state of dependency, the income which he has apart from wages, and to make that up to a standard during the period in which he is unemployed. A single man who has dependants gets full credit in his unemployment assistance qualification for his state of dependency.  Originally, the employment was confined to married men.  A very strong and well-founded pressure was put to include single men in the employment qualification&mdash;this was before the Unemployment Assistance Act.  We did include 25 per cent. of single men, as such.  I have checked up statistically in certain rural areas and now when we are ignoring altogether the distinction between married and single, as such, and concentrating on the unemployment assistance qualification, we find that a higher percentage of single men are being employed than when we gave the single men a specific allocation of 25 per cent.  Whatever the state of a man's dependency is, it is supposed to be taken into account in his unemployment assistance qualification.  If it is not, he has the right of appeal to the umpire to revise it.</P>
    <P>Another point the Deputy had in mind was the fact that men who are on schemes of this kind, and who are first employed, are the men who have the 23/- down perhaps to 16/-, U.A. rates. What used to happen, he said, was that men with a low qualification did not get any advantage.  That was <Col N="112" /> what happened last year, and last year, as you know, was merely an experimental period in relation to this matter. This year the arrangement is so made that men, having been employed for a certain period on a scheme in an urban area are replaced by another body of men having the next lower qualification for unemployment assistance, and this is carried on until, as we hope, this year two-thirds of the people on the register will receive some benefit, instead of the benefit being concentrated on the top end of the register.  Men in a city like Cork, for instance, where the work was previously confined to those receiving 20/-, may now get their share of the work, although their qualification may be as low as 15/-, 14/-, and possibly lower.</P>
    <P>In the rural areas the position is even better.  I examined some time sheets on schemes in Mayo and Galway last week, in which I found hundreds of men with 3/-, 2/-, and even 1/- qualifications being employed.  In the areas in which minor relief schemes, where the 4/- per day wage is operative, are being carried out, practically every man on the register is being employed.  So far as Deputy Hurley's questions are concerned, the position is that dependency is taken into account in setting the unemployment assistance standard which decides the period at which a man would be employed; work on relief schemes in the boroughs is not now confined to men on the top end of the register, but will gradually spread until we have covered, we hope, two-thirds of the people on the register; and in the rural areas the people on very low qualifications are receiving access to work on schemes of this kind.</P>
    <P>I think the only other question is the question of the aerodrome.  Provision was arranged for the Cork aerodrome, subject to certain contributions by the local authorities towards an aerodrome costing a certain amount.  Plans in relation to that have been altered by those who were originally responsible for the plans, and the result is that a new element has been introduced.  As and when we know definitely what the new plans are, and the commitments <Col N="113" /> they will involve, the question will be taken up again.  There will be no difficulty in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the rural road schemes did not work out as anticipated? In several rural areas the number of unemployed assistance men who were to be absorbed in these schemes were not absorbed, and, therefore, in a good many districts in our county, men have not been employed either on the minor relief schemes or on the rural road schemes.  These things have occurred, not through anybody's fault, but simply because the money allotted was not sufficient.  Through the overlapping which resulted between the minor relief schemes and the other schemes, large numbers of men were left over.  Steps should be taken in these areas, which can be pointed out by the county surveyor, to see that some assistance is given to those who are in great need of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something in what Deputy Flynn has said and we are very glad to have it brought up to us.  As the Dáil knows, rural areas were previously dealt with entirely by minor relief schemes. These were merely bog roads averaging roughly from £100 to £200 each.  These were peppered over the country in order to meet the actual position. They have very high labour content. Practically the whole of it is labour content.  This and last year it was desired to expend in the rural areas very considerably larger sums than had at any time previously been spent there.  To confine the amount which you would like to spend in the rural areas on minor relief works and to find enough schemes to keep that up is impossible.  For that reason, we turned to certain county roads and tried to fit in the two kinds of scheme in order to cover those areas.  The difficulty is, of course, that you cannot distribute as well.  In the first year we used the roads rural schemes very much as we used the minor relief schemes.  The number of small works that you could distribute over roads of the latter kind would rapidly run out.  This year we had to do the larger schemes.  The effect of that has <Col N="114" /> been undoubtedly to make it more difficult to distribute the works where they would suit the people who are actually needing employment.  In addition to that the roads rural schemes have a lower labour content than the minor relief schemes.  Deputy Flynn may take it that we have in mind the whole question as to how this should best be dealt with.  The real problem is not going to be the providing of the money for the relief schemes.  Assuming that that was all granted, to find that number of schemes for the distribution of relief all over the country bringing the work to all requiring it, in the places they require it and in proportion to their needs, will be a very difficult matter, but Deputy Flynn may take it that we are dealing with that matter.  The position has been reported to us in relation to parts of Donegal, Kerry, Mayo and other counties where the blank spots have developed.  We are doing everything we possibly can to reach those blank spots and one of the reasons why we have come here to the Dáil with this £10 Estimate is to tell them that we have certain devices prepared to do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £200,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1938, for payment to the Pensions Investment Account (Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1937 (No. 29 <Col N="115" /> of 1935, Section 42 (2) and No. 11 of 1937, Section 21)).</P>
    <P>The Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, provided for the payment into the Pensions Investment Account out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of a sum of £250,000 per annum for each of the ten financial years beginning 1935-36.  This annual sum represented the estimated equalised subvention over the first ten years of the operation of this scheme of pensions established by the Act of 1935 in order to meet the estimated net excess of expenditure over income during that period.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1937, which considerably extended the scheme of non-contributory pensions, the annual sum of £250,000 was increased to £450,000 for the year 1937-38 and each of the succeeding years.  The sum of £200,000 now asked for is to supplement the Vote of £250,000 already made under the Act of 1935, so as to make the full provision for the year 1937-38, required by the Act of 1937.</P>
    <P>There are just a few words which I wish to add respecting the working of the Act up to date, and I am giving the position as it stood on the 31st December, 1937.  The claims for contributory pensions received amounted to 4,210.  Many of these claims were made in respect of persons who were not insured under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, and after being formally rejected under the contributory provisions, they were transferred to the non-contributory class. In addition, there was a number of cases where the qualifying conditions for the payment of a contributory pension were not satisfied, and these also were treated as claims to non-contributory pensions.  The total number of cases transferred from the contributory to the non-contributory class was 1,877.  Out of the remaining 2,333 cases, contributory pensions were awarded in 1,983 cases, and there were 332 cases under consideration.  Eighteen claims were withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The number of claims received for non-contributory pensions was 36,574. This figure includes 1,877 claims for <Col N="116" /> contributory pensions which were either not properly within the contributory class or which failed to satisfy the qualifying conditions for the grant of contributory pensions.  Out of these 36,574 cases, pensions have been awarded in 28,879 cases; pensions were refused in 5,453 cases, 944 claims were withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn, and there are 1,298 claims under examination.</P>
    <P>There are in course of payment 1,929 contributory pensions at a weekly cost of £1,444, and 26,359 non-contributory pensions at a weekly cost of £8,026, a total of 28,288 pensions amounting to £9,470 per week.  These represent payments in respect of 27,543 widows and 20,732 dependent children and orphans. Appeals to referees against decisions that pensions were not payable, or were payable at reduced rates, have been received in 5,495 cases.  The appeals have been decided in 4,137 cases, and there were still 1,358 cases awaiting decision on the 31st December, 1937.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points to which I would like to refer in connection with this Estimate.  It was understood, I think, that contributory pensions were to be made available to the widows of all men who were paying into the National Health Insurance Fund at the date of their death. It now appears that that is not true &mdash; that if a person paying into the National Health Insurance Fund died prior to January, 1935, his widow is not eligible for a contributory pension. That, I think, is a lacuna which was not perceived when the Act or amending Act was passing through the House.  I do not quite see on what basis that arrangement is made.  I think it is a mistake.  When dealing with a class of persons which cannot grow, I think it is a great mistake to exclude any part of the class.  I can see that you must set some limits if the class you are dealing with may increase in the future but, in this case, there is no such danger.  By omitting the widows of certain insured persons while granting pensions to the widows of other insured persons who died before the passing of this Act, one creates a great deal of ill-feeling and <Col N="117" /> misunderstanding because it is extremely difficult to explain to the average widow who feels the need of this relief, when she imagines her circumstances to be identical with those of a neighbour who is receiving a pension, that she herself is not entitled to a pension.</P>
      <P>As regards the other matter to which I desire to draw attention, we are in the presence of rather an unsatisfactory arrangement because the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for determining the means of an applicant for a pension, but, at some stage, the Department of Local Government and Public Health comes into the question.  Therefore, I submit the difficulty to the Minister of that Department.  Officers charged with a task of assessing the means of claimants to non-contributory pensions have made it their practice to regard as income casual gifts received by parents &mdash; including widows &mdash; from their children.  In the West of Ireland that means that if a widow has children in America and gets a few pounds from them at Christmas or other seasons, that gift operates to exclude her from the benefit of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  I think that that practice was taken over from the old age pension scheme, and I submit that where a parent is in receipt of casual gifts from her children or relatives the payment of which she is not in a position to enforce, they ought not to be taken into account as means for the purpose of rendering her ineligible for a pension under this or any other Pension Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the question of the means test and to protest, on behalf of the people I represent, against the method adopted by the investigation officers.  We receive many complaints in this connection, and we can show that the value placed upon certain receipts by these investigation officers is unfair in every way and that their interpretation of the Act is altogether too drastic.  The principle of the Act and the benefits which it was intended by the Government to bestow upon the recipients have been defeated by the <Col N="118" /> system of computing the means.  This system is contrary to justice.  I appeal to the Minister to have inquiries made with a view to having a more lenient view of the means test taken by investigation officers and some adjustment of the system carried out.  In the cases which come before us, the investigation officers have gone beyond the limit.  Not alone have they taken upon themselves the role of interrogator in the proper sense, but they have adopted the rôle of detective officers.</P>

      <P>I am just making a protest and pointing out that the system of investigation is defeating the whole principle of the Act and defeating the intentions of the Government.  The value placed upon the means of applicants by the investigation officers is out of all proportion to the real value as it is known to be in these districts. I appeal to the Minister to get somebody to go into the whole question, if at all possible, as we are receiving numerous complaints with regard to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first point made by Deputy Dillon, I do not think there could be any doubt as to when the contributory pensions commenced to operate.  They began to operate from the date specified in the Act &mdash; 1st January, 1936.  The people who were then making national health contributions were regarded as contributors for the purpose of the Act. Those who had ceased making contributions even a week before are not, unfortunately, regarded as eligible for contributory pensions.  That is an unfortunate position, but some date had to be fixed.  It is a hardship on those who have not the benefit of the new scheme, but, as I said, some date had to be chosen.  Of course, those who come under the non-contributory scheme are not as well off as those who are getting the benefit of the contributory scheme.  I do not see at present, in view of what we have done <Col N="119" /> in the last two years for widows and orphans, much chance of getting a further increase unless the House makes a very strong claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be easily possible for the Minister to make inquiries as to what it would cost to give contributory pensions to the widows of men who had been paying into the National Health Insurance Fund prior to 1st January, 1936?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall ask for that information, and perhaps the Deputy would remind me of the matter by putting down a question.  As regards casual gifts, to which Deputy Dillon and Deputy Flynn referred, a small allowance is made&mdash;£6 10s. 0d.  That figure was fixed so that it would be in line with the allowance under the Old Age Pensions Act.  If there were different amounts under the two Acts, there would be an anomaly.  Means tests are everywhere unpopular, but there would be greater anomalies if some means tests were not provided. There are always difficulties and complaints about the items that are taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of complaints examined as to investigation officers, and I am of opinion that they do their work well, honestly and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not wish the Minister to take me as suggesting that investigation officers or appeal officers are unduly hard.  I think that some of the investigation officers are very stringent, but I find the appeal officers consistently reasonable.  I raised, however, a net point, as to whether receipts from emigrant children by way of gift, which are not enforceable by the widow, should be taken into account as means.  I do not think they should, because they are not means in the true sense of the word.  The remedy is in the hands of the children &mdash; to withhold the gift &mdash; and that is surely not a desirable thing to bring about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, there are two anomalies in this section.  The first is in sub-section (2).  Power is given to a shop to stay open on a half-day, either before or after a statutory holiday.  In the companion Bill the employee must get a half-day except during the Christmas fortnight.  That is the only concession made.  It seems to me that the result of that is to favour a shop where relatives only are employed, because in the case of a shop employing assistants, it will either close, or, if it stays open on the statutory holiday, a day in lieu must be given, which will, of course, add considerably to its costs, whereas a shop which is manned entirely by relatives can stay open on the half-day without having to give any concession to the assistants in respect of the other half-day.  That is a point the Minister might consider.</P>
      <P>The other anomaly arises in sub-section (5), where the Bill says that a shop carrying on an excepted trade and also any other trade, may stay open to deal with the excepted trade, but may not deal with any other trade. When Deputy McGowan raised the point of the standard half-day, the Minister said it was impossible to allow a shop to stay open for an exempted trade and not to allow it to deal in the other trades.  I admit that the number of excepted trades is very much smaller than the number of exempted trades, but if it was impossible in one case, why does it become possible in the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points. It will be necessary, I agree, to <Col N="121" /> examine the provisions of this Bill in relation to the Shop Assistants (Conditions of Employment) Bill to ensure that there is no conflict between them.  It is true that we permit a shop to remain open on the weekly half-holiday immediately preceding or following the public holiday.  My recollection of the provisions of the Shop Assistants Bill is that it permits of an employee being deprived of his half-holiday in a week in which a public holiday occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in respect of the Christmas fortnight, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have that matter looked into because, in any event, it will be necessary to keep in mind what I said here earlier, namely, that the majority of shop proprietors would desire to avail of the concession given in sub-section (2) in the week preceding a bank holiday rather than in the week in which the bank holiday occurs, where that bank holiday occurs early in the week &mdash; on Monday, as frequently is the case.  I thank the Deputy for drawing attention to the point, but, as I say, it will be necessary to ensure that there will be no conflict in that regard.  It is true that, in relation to excepted businesses, we permit of shops remaining open for the purpose of these businesses even though they may also engage in other businesses in respect of which they should be closed.  We put these excepted businesses in a different position from that of the exempted businesses, recognising that there may be that difficulty of enforcement to which I have referred.  We are prepared to face it in relation to these businesses, and that is the only excuse I can offer for the difference in treatment and for the apparent departure from my own argument.  In relation to these four businesses, we have to recognise that possibility, but we are prepared to recognise it rather than to require premises doing these businesses to close merely because they carry on some other trade.  That is why I was disposed to resist another amendment moved by Deputy Dockrell which sought to give power to add to the list <Col N="122" /> of excepted businesses as distinct from the exempted businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has anyone adverted to the situation which is going to arise when a fair day in a rural town falls on the named half-holiday?  As I understand the Bill at present, a shopkeeper is obliged to declare that a certain day shall be a half-holiday every week.  In rural Ireland, in certain towns, the monthly fair is a movable feast, falling on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday, as the case may be. Suppose you fix Wednesday as your half-holiday and the monthly cattle fair falls on Wednesday.  It becomes manifestly impossible to close all the shops in the town on that day.  Is there provision made in this Bill for altering the half-holiday if that contingency arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the position of the shopkeeper in that respect is rather improved.  Under existing law, following a local inquiry, an order is made fixing a particular day as the half-holiday and that day must be the half-holiday.  It cannot be changed except in certain circumstances. Under this Bill, the individual shopkeeper is allowed to pick his own half-holiday.  He can only alter it by giving lengthy notice and informing the Guards, but, nevertheless, it is left to himself to determine what the half-holiday will be, so that there is a slight loosening of the regulations in that regard, a loosening which has been objected to by the Labour Party, but which is necessary in order to give effect to the provisions of the Bill.  The position in that respect is slightly better and certainly no worse than the existing position in respect to the weekly half-holiday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In Ballaghaderreen there is a half-holiday for ten years, and it was fixed by nobody but by the will of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In Ballaghaderreen, Castlerea, Ballymote, Collooney, Ballisodare, and other towns of which I could name a litany, the half-holiday was fixed by nobody.  Under this Bill the half-day will be fixed for everyone in all towns.  In certain towns the fair is fixed by Charter.  It is not held on <Col N="124" /> the third Wednesday, or the first Thursday, but is fixed like Easter, on a date to fall after such and such a seasonal event.  The old fairs relate to the holidays of the Church.  For instance they fall on Candlemas Day, Lady Day, or a day near Easter. To alter these fair days would involve many towns in incalculable loss. It is hard for anyone who was not born, and who has not lived in the country, to realise what immense importance attaches to established fairs.  If they are changed great injury might be done to these fixtures.  In Ballaghaderreen five cattle fairs fall this year on Wednesday.  Last year there would have been only one fair on that day, and next year there might be none. From what I gather, this Bill permits shopkeepers in towns to alter the half-holiday from the established day to another day only once in three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It permits each individual trader to fix whatever half-holiday he wishes, and to alter it on giving three months' notice.  It does not fix a universal half-holiday in any town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens in the towns to which I referred?  Three or four of the larger shops chose a day and there was such a suspension of business that everyone was obliged to follow.  Once these shops closed nobody came to town on that day.  Let us assume, as in the case of Ballaghaderreen, that the half-holiday is on Wednesday.  If the fair is going to fall on Wednesday, the shops in Ballaghaderreen must have the right to have the half-holiday on another day.  My suggestion to the Minister is to provide that where fair days periodically clash &mdash; fair days established by Charter, if you want to get something which would be recognised judicially &mdash; with the declared half-holiday in such towns the merchants can have the half-holiday another day in that week.  I mentioned Ballaghaderreen as an illustration, because I know the circumstances there.  Wednesday is the ordinary half-holiday. Might it not be arranged, where a fair fixed by Charter falls on a Wednesday, that the half-holiday could be held on a Monday?  Unless <Col N="125" /> you make a provision of that kind you are going to cause great hardship in these small towns and, in fact, you might upset their economy and destroy their trade.  I have no hesitation in saying that the refusal of such discretion to the merchants of Ballaghaderreen would involve the town in the loss of thousands of pounds in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be done in the precise way the Deputy indicated. He has not appreciated the change made by the Bill.  We are not fixing the weekly half-holiday for any town. We are obliging each shopkeeper to close for a half day in the week chosen by the proprietor of the shop.  There is no question, therefore, of making an Order as to the date of a fair in a particular town applying to all shops because, in fact, the majority of the shops may not have chosen that day for the half-holiday.  There is provision by which the proprietor of a shop can, on giving three months' notice, change the date.  He cannot change it more than once in three months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was mentioned that provision is made for the preservation of orders under an Act which will be repealed by this Bill.  Take the position in Mullingar, where a closing order was made under the 1912 Act <Col N="127" /> affecting certain classes of trade.  That was done by the express wish of over two-thirds of the traders.  I presume that order will continue in force when this Bill becomes law.  That order brought within its grasp some of the trades which are now termed &ldquo;exempted trades&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This section does not repeal the weekly half-holiday.  It repeals a series of closing orders. What we are here providing is, that where a shopkeeper engages in an exempted trade, and only in an exempted trade or trades, then no existing order shall be deemed to apply to it.  But if he carries on, in addition to an exempted trade, some trade not exempted, then, of course, the orders do apply.  I think that is logical and obvious.  The proposal is to exempt these trades from the scope of these orders for reasons which are different in the case of each individual trade.  If they are exempted, then it is not within the Minister's power to come and reverse that decision again.</P>

      <P>I take it that what the Deputy has in mind is the case of tobacconists and confectioners who sell fruit, but he is overlooking the fact <Col N="130" /> that, as the Bill stands, an early-closing order cannot be made in respect of tobacco and smokers' requisites.  Consequently, the amendment is not in order.  If an order were made withdrawing from the list of exempted businesses the business of selling tobacco and smokers' requisites then such order would have to be laid on the Table of the House, when the Deputy would have an opportunity of dealing with the matter.  It is most unlikely that such an order will ever be made.  Consequently, the need for the amendment will not arise.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to draw the line between the type of person that we mean when we ordinarily use the phrase &ldquo;street trader&rdquo; and a travelling shop&mdash;the person who is selling certain classes of goods from a stall. It is, apparently, the desire of all parties that the latter should be subject to the same restrictions as the ordinary trader.  We are getting over that point, I think, in the main by means of these exemptions.  The exemptions do cover the ordinary type of street trader.  There is power to add to the list of exemptions should cases arise.  There are certain types of hawkers and it is desirable that they should be subject to the same restrictions, in respect of hours, as the trader who works from premises.  It can be said that it would be unfair to the trader in premises if they were not subject to the same restrictions.  So far as I have been able to discover, under the Bill as it stands the ordinary street trader is exempted, but the travelling shop &mdash; the person who engages in the sale of drapery goods and articles of that kind at a fair &mdash; is covered by the Bill.</P>

In rural Ireland the hawker will sell tin pannikins, caps for pipes, etc.  These are his ordinary wares.  As I read the Bill, he will be prevented from operating. Then what about the country boy coming into a town with a cart of turf? The usual practice is that, if you are a turf man, you bring in a cart of turf and walk through the streets until somebody comes out and stops you and buys the turf from you.

These are questions which will have to be considered when the question of making an order in relation to these particular trades arises. There is provision for publication of the <Col N="133" /> order and for the making of representations by anybody in relation to a particular trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is power to distinguish between classes of shops. If we made an order covering the sale of a commodity, it would in practice have to apply to everybody selling that commodity.  It would be impossible to make any useful restriction which would not be unfair to somebody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a difficulty of administration.  You have made provision in the schedules and doubtless excluded certain businesses that otherwise you would have included because you do not want to catch the poor of Dublin who make a reasonable living out of hawking these commodities in the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that operated on the mind of the Minister.  He did not want to close up the hawkers of flowers and fish, though he might have closed the fish and flower shops if the consideration had not operated on his mind.  What I am pressing is: that he ought to bear in mind a similar consideration when dealing with the rural hawker.  I cannot imagine that he is going to apply these orders to shops in a town and exclude hardware shops.  Supposing he does apply the orders to hardware shops, he is going to prevent every tinker from vending his wares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a great hardship. If the Minister knew as much about the country as most of us know, he would agree that it is a hardship. The tinker has to sell his tin cans wherever he can make his way in and do his dealing wherever he can get the opportunity.  It is grotesque to suggest that the man who is battling with the wolf at his door should be forbidden to sell tin mugs after 6 o'clock because the hardware shops <Col N="134" /> are closed.  It is a terrible wrong to inflict grievous hardship on very humble individuals because we cannot be bothered to make provision for their particular difficulty.  If this presents great difficulty administratively, I would be very anxious to give the Minister a very wide discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of administrative difficulty.  It is a fact that every Deputy who spoke has pointed to the necessity for ensuring that any order made in relation to any trade should apply to everybody in that trade.  The unfairness would be if it did not.  That was the primary consideration in preparing the Bill in this form, just as in preparing the schedules it was not the position of certain classes of street traders that was in mind, but the nature of the commodities.  The commodities which the Deputy mentioned are exempted from the operation of these closing orders because they are perishable commodities or of a special kind in respect to which it can be said that there was no public interest to be served by requiring the shops to be closed, and perhaps a public convenience to be met by allowing them to keep open.  These were the primary considerations.  If, in relation to hardware, or any other class of commodity, you contemplate the possibility of a small trader being exempt, then everybody here will say that that is going to be unfair to those who are compelled to close.  Everybody has been saying that right through the whole debate and pressing the necessity for ensuring that every order made in relation to any trade has universal application within that trade.</P>

We have the mendicant, commonly known as the beggar, who circumvents the Civic Guards by selling studs or something of that kind.  Is there no means of protecting that person?  Under this Bill, he immediately becomes liable to a statutory penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to you that that is the kind of thing the bureaucrat forgets completely.  You cannot possibly know them if you do not live amongst them.  It may be absurd to argue that one ought to consider these people, but it really is not.  If the Minister lived in a country town, as most Deputies do, he would know that he had three or four very good friends amongst that class&mdash;familiar friends who have come in collecting twopence or threepence on one day per week.  They come most religiously on that day and would be ashamed to come on any other day. They have a regular route.  They are old friends and they circumnavigate the regulations prohibiting their activities by selling studs or bootlaces or something of that kind, so that if a Civic Guard came on the scene you can grab a pair of bootlaces and protest that you were engaged in a commercial transaction; that there was no eleemosynary element in operation at all.  I know that it sounds absurd to be talking about these things, but these people will be guilty of a statutory offence if they offer these commodities, and they will be caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It all leads to this: that I want the Minister, if it is administratively possible, while catching all the shops, not to apply this to the really impoverished hawker.  I do not believe any Party wants the hawker, who is maintaining a family out of the business of carrying about these wares and disposing of them from house to house, to be caught by the Bill.  We do not want to close the shop that employs labour and leave open the shop that employs nobody. But we ought to draw the line.  The bureaucratic view is that it is administratively impossible to draw the line; <Col N="136" /> that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  That is all very well for Merrion Street or Lord Edward Street, but when the eggs happen to be personal friends of long standing, then you take a more personal interest in their fate.  I strongly urge on the Minister that this is a matter he ought to look into.  I put it to Deputy Tom Kelly, who is familiar, I have no doubt, with the street hawker in Dublin, that if you caught some of these people under this Bill and prohibited them from trading outside the hours fixed for shops, you might inflict very grievous hardship on a hard-working and respectable people.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to restrict the exemptions, which the Minister takes power to make, to towns with a population not exceeding 500.

      <P>I think the Deputy will have to rely upon the good sense of the Minister or his fear of the Dáil when he comes to present his Orders to it, because there is no safeguard against his abusing his powers other than the Dáil.  The particular device which the Deputy has put forward could be easily evaded.  In order to evade it the Minister, instead of making one Order applying to one area, could divide that area up into sections, each with a population of less than 500, and issue a series of Orders for each section.  In the end the result would be the same.  I can assure the Deputy that the object of the section is to deal with exceptional circumstances in outlying districts, principally along the west coast, where a considerable amount of business is done on Sundays.  People have to travel long distances to towns and usually do their business after Mass on Sundays.  That arrangement saves them the trouble of having to travel twice a week, and it is undesirable to compel them to do so.  It is only in a few areas along the west coast that that situation obtains.  So far as I am concerned, the power of exemption would only be exercised to meet such cases.  The only safeguard the House can have against an abuse of power is that the Minister, when proposing his Order here, will have to justify it.  I do not think there is any other way of doing it.  You cannot get a watertight <Col N="140" /> definition of all circumstances under which the power would be used which might apply in every case.</P>

I think if there is a case to be made for the closing of a post office, that case must be made to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If he agrees with it, he has power to do that without statutory backing at all.  It is useless to have the power in the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because it is certain he will not use that power unless the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs concurs and, if he does concur, it is not necessary for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make an Order.  It is the general practice in legislation of this kind not to give one Minister power to make Orders which directly react on the administration of another Minister's Department.  There are exceptions to that rule, I grant you; there are exceptions in the Conditions of Employment Act, for example. Here, the logic of the position is that the power will not be used except the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs concurs.  If he does concur, then the power is not necessary.</P>

      <P>In page 13, to delete line 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is simply a drafting amendment. Line 23 refers to the business of selling by retail intoxicating liquors.  In the Schedule, this is an exempted business, and as such under Section 15 of the Bill it is an exempted business to which the closing on weekly half-holiday does not apply.  Section 17, however, includes in paragraph (b), sub-section (5), amongst excepted businesses the selling by retail of intoxicating liquors.  It seems unnecessary that the same business should be <Col N="144" /> described in Section 17 as an excepted business and in the Second Schedule as an exempted business.</P>

      <P>A part of what Deputy McGowan has said in relation to his amendment applies also to this one, I think.  No. 2 in the Schedule refers to the business of selling refreshments.  I think there is not a sufficient definition there.  What is the business of selling refreshments? Does it mean refreshments sold for consumption on the premises, or what does it mean?  I think it is not sufficiently clear as it stands, and I doubt if it is necessary at all.</P>

The intention here was to exclude from the weekly half-holiday provision the business of selling refreshments for consumption on the premises, and if it is necessary to insert those words I will have them inserted to make it clear.  There is no doubt that that is the intention.  If the sale of refreshments is otherwise than for consumption on the premises I think the weekly half-holiday provision should apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly opposed to that.  The Deputy will understand that in the other Bill we are giving shop assistants the right to a half-day. There is, therefore, no question of the shop assistants being affected by an amendment of this kind, but the public convenience is affected.  A further consideration which the Labour Party might bear in mind is that the restriction of hours of trading in tobacconists' shops and other places has led very largely to the substitution of human assistants by automatic machines, and I do not think we should encourage that.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 34, to delete the words &ldquo;meat, fish&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the same case has to be made on this amendment as was made by Deputy McGowan on previous amendments. It seems to me that there are altogether too many exemptions in <Col N="146" /> those Schedules.  For instance, in regard to the sale of fish, what case can be made for not having a half-holiday? Why should those things be exempted?  Having regard to the fact that practically every shop of a certain kind has a department selling those commodities, it seems to me that those exemptions render the whole Act practically useless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree as to that.  Of course, they are included in this list of commodities here under paragraph 9 because they are perishable articles.  I think there is no doubt that meat, fish, and so on are perishable articles and the exemption given under paragraph 9 is to articles of a perishable nature.  I have no very strong objection to the deletion of the words &ldquo;meat and fish&rdquo; from paragraph 9 of the Second Schedule, but I think it is better to leave it as it is. We have got to bear in mind the position of these street traders in meat, fish and so forth, who would be affected by the Order.  So far as I know, it is not an unusual practice for shops selling these commodities to close for a half-day.  In any event, I would prefer to leave it the way it is instead of making it a statutory obligation in relation to these commodities. Again, it is only a question of whether any public good is to be served by the Order.  The shop assistant gets his half-holiday.  It is provided under another statute that the shop assistant should get his half-holiday, and here the only question that arises is as to whether any public good would be served by obliging the shop itself to be shut.  That brings up the question of whether or not the trader is affected adversely, and I do not think he is, to any extent, in relation to these goods.  For these reasons, I should prefer to leave the matter as it is and to classify these articles as perishable commodities and let the situation remain unchanged in view of the fact that we have protected the shop assistant with regard to his hours anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, Sir, I think the Minister minimises the <Col N="147" /> effect on what one might term the legitimate business people &mdash; good employers and so on &mdash; employing assistants.  I think the Minister minimises the effect upon them, and incidentally on the assistants of such employers, of giving loopholes to the person who either does not employ assistants or who employs members of his own family on the one hand or is generally a bad employer. I think that this element of competition &mdash; and I am sure no one knows it better than the Minister &mdash; in shop business is a very important element, and that if you are going to compel one employer to work under conditions which are not imposed upon another, you are putting him at a definite disadvantage. I think that in the interests both of the good employer and of his assistants it is desirable that these exemptions should be reduced to a minimum.  In the case of the meat trade, the Minister has pointed out that at present there is a custom in the trade in Dublin and in most large centres of having a half-holiday. I suggest that the existence of that custom makes it clear that there is nothing impossible about enforcing a half-holiday all round, and when it is taken into account that the purpose of this kind of legislation is to bring a bad employer into line with a good one, I think that the meat and fish trade at least should be taken out of this Schedule, and I think that in doing that the Minister would be acting not only in the interests of the assistants of the good employer, but that, in the long run, he would be acting in the interests of his Department as well.  While it is true to say that the assistants are protected by the other Bill, I think the Minister will agree that it would be much easier, from an inspection point of view and from the point of view of his Department, to enforce the observance of the half-holiday where the shops close rather than having to depend on the employer himself to close the shop.  It simplifies the whole thing if the shops are closed, and in the interests of the Department as well as of the shopkeepers and assistants I think that the Minister should limit these exemptions as far as possible.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 7, after the word &ldquo;selling&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on production of a doctor's certificate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter of the chemist's, in relation to the Bill, has been discussed before, and it raises the question of making a distinction between legitimate chemists' business &mdash; between urgent chemists' business, which might be done outside ordinary opening hours &mdash; and the general business of the chemist of selling all sorts of things that are sold in other shops. I think the Minister, probably, would accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to this.  If there is any case at all for exempting a chemist from an Hours of Closing Order, it is the general case because of the class of goods he sells, and not merely because somebody wants chemical supplies ordered by a doctor.  The chemist's supplies might not be ordered by a doctor and yet be just as urgent as if they had been. Therefore, it could apply generally and not in a specific instance of this kind. <Col N="150" /> I considered this question of the application of the Bill to chemists very carefully.  I have had many representations from chemists, some asking for complete exemption from this control and others asking quite the reverse.  A very large number of chemists have, in fact, urged that the hours of trading legislation should apply to their business. The usual argument is that they want to close, but they cannot close because their competitor across the street will not do it; but if the competitor closes they are only too willing to do so.  I found it hard to make up my mind, and in the end I came down to the point to exempt them from the hours of trading regulations altogether. Perhaps the matter might be further considered before the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, I think the attitude of the State in the matter should be that they do not see any public need for requiring these shops to close at particular hours.  We have protected the interests of the chemists' assistants, limited their hours of work and given them the right to a half-holiday and so forth.  Having done that, I think we have gone the limit of our obligations in the matter.  I would have no doubt on this point, that we should exempt the chemists, were it not for the representations which some chemists have made.  That is the only thing which has shaken my view, and I am anxious to find out to what extent that view is held by all the chemists.  When I find out their opinions, we might be prepared to modify our view in that connection.  At any rate, there is power by Order to take the chemists out of this Schedule if, in the course of time, it appeared desirable to do that.</P>

      <P>I suppose one could not get unanimity in any trade, but undoubtedly there is a section of the chemists who think that if they are to keep open only to supply the needs of sick people, their sales would not justify keeping the places open.

      <P>The amendment that has been proposed would allow that and would also provide for a doctor's certificate. I think on the whole question of the chemists the Minister should seriously reconsider the matter.  The case that is being made for the exemption of the chemists' business is very largely exaggerated.  The occasions upon which a chemist is required in an emergency are very rare.  On the other hand, a person might require a surgical operation in an emergency, or a particular kind of medicine in an emergency which ordinarily a doctor would be able to make up.  The chemists open on Sundays and on half holidays when other shops are closed. No matter what restriction you try to place on them, what they are in fact doing is selling the type of things that are stocked in other shops, and they are really in competition with other trades.  There is a good deal of exaggerated nonsense about this question of emergency in regard to chemists' shops, and the Minister should seriously consider the matter.</P>

    <P>that is, to except the business of selling meat, fish, milk, cream, bread, confectionery, fruit, vegetables, flowers, or other articles of a perishable nature. I do not know that any great case could be made for that paragraph.  There may be, in certain isolated towns, a <Col N="155" /> case made for opening a butcher's shop on Sundays.  I have seen this in one or two cases myself, but, taking it as a general point of view, it is very unusual to see a butcher's shop or a fish shop open on Sunday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question that arises is the exclusion of these perishable commodities from Sunday Closing Orders.  In some areas it is the custom for the people to deal in such shops on Sundays.  The point to be considered is what is the best public policy in the matter.  I do not think it can be urged that these businesses should be precluded from the possibility of being carried on on Sundays.  Circumstances might arise where excluding them would cause considerable public inconvenience.  That argument applies with different force to the various commodities just mentioned.  It would be a great inconvenience in certain congested areas in Dublin if milk shops and such shops were closed on Sunday. It would not be convenient to buy these goods on the previous day.  In addition, I would ask the Deputy to bear in mind the position of street traders who deal in these matters on Sundays and who should not be precluded from doing so.  I think the best course to take is to permit such a trade to be carried on.  I do not think there is any alternative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent I agree with the Minister, but I am afraid that the fact of this permission in the Bill is more of an incentive to people who would otherwise not open on Sunday, to open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could hardly accept that.  If there was a profit to be made out of opening such shops on Sundays they would be open before now, and if they are not open now they will not be opened in the future.  The sole reason as to why shops open to sell a particular article is that there is a profit in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had representations made to me about fish and meat shops.  I know that selling meat and <Col N="156" /> fish in cities and large towns on Sunday is very rare, but there are parts of the country where butchers do the bulk of their business on Sunday mornings. It might be desirable to promote a change in that practice, but we have to recognise the existence of the practice. There is power in the Bill to apply the Closing Order eventually if it is desirable to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>As the thing stands, it really represents a lot of the business the grocer does.  A great deal of what he sells is of a perishable nature.  As the Bill stands, that paragraph practically exempts the whole grocery and allied trade.  There are very few grocery shops that do not sell one or other of the commodities mentioned in this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that they sell one of these commodities does not exempt them.  A shop is exempted from the obligation of closing on Sunday only if its business is confined to the sale of the exempted commodities or to the sale of an exempted commodity. If it sells any commodity that is not exempted, then the shop is not entitled to remain open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">

      <P>It is made an offence. They can be stopped by a prosecution. If a shop stocks a commodity which is not exempted, then it cannot be open, and the selling of that non-exempted commodity is an offence.  A shop is only entitled to open if everything in the shop is an exempted commodity.</P>
