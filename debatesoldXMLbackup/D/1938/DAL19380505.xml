      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if <Col N="624" /> he will have circulated in the Official Report in respect of (a) estate duty grants and (b) agricultural grants for each of the years ended February 16th, 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937 (1) the amount chargeable to each country of the sum drawn from the Guarantee Fund in respect of purchasers' annuities in arrear, and (2) the amount credited to each county in respect of old arrears which have been recovered, as certified by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
      <P>Upon the clearance of the Guarantee Fund in February of each year, each county is debited with the arrears accrued up to the 31st January and credited with the amounts recovered in respect of arrears which had previously been met by draws upon the Guarantee Fund.  It is only where the arrears in respect of current gales exceed repayments in respect of arrears accrued at previous gales that the country share in the Estate Duty Grant or Agricultural Grant is attached in the Fund.  Where the repayments exceed the draws in respect of current gales, the Local Authority receives an amount equivalent to the excess inaddition to normal grants.  The following Table shows the net position at February, 1934; February, 1935; February 1936 and February, 1937, apportioned as between Estate Duty Grant and Agricultural Grant.</P>

      <P>On the procedure to be followed under this section, the Minister told us yesterday that there would be a list prepared for review by the United Kingdom Government, and that this would be the first review undertaken by the Prices Commission, the object being, I take it, that they would get on speedily with the work. <Col N="633" /> For the sake of argument, I would like to know from the Minister what the position of a United Kingdom manufacturer who appealed to the Prices Commission, without the intervention of the British Government, and asked for a review would be.  Would he be referred back to his own Government, or would his application be put at the tail end of the list?  Would the Minister tell us what procedure would be adopted in a case like that?  I think the Minister explained to us most of the procedure yesterday.  He told us, of course, that this Bill and this review would not prevent the ordinary imposition of tariffs if and when they were considered necessary by his Department.</P>

      <P>Nobody has the right to ask the Prices Commission to undertake a review except the Minister for Industry and Commerce.

      <P>Perhaps I have not properly explained what I meant.  I meant that the request would be made via the Minister, because of course I understand that nobody can appear in person before the Prices Commission and cut out the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department.  In order to understand the procedure, I should like to put to the Minister the hypothetical case of an English manufacturer who asked the Minister or his Department to forward a request to the Prices Commission.  Is that procedure closed?  That is what I want to understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, of course, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce can ask the Prices Commission to undertake a review on anybody's suggestion or on his own initiative.  What the Agreement provides for is that the review referred to in Article 8 will be held by the Prices Commission first upon classes of goods for which the Government of the United Kingdom request early consideration.  If, therefore, we <Col N="634" /> receive a request from the Government of the United Kingdom that early consideration should be given to the duties upon specific articles, then those articles will be the first reviewed by the Prices Commission, and any other review will take second place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which I think might with advantage be clarified.  I know the Minister has on more than one occasion tried to make the position clear, but I am not satisfied that the country has got the hang of the situation yet.  One of the objects in expediting the passage of these Bills is to restore trading normalcy at the earliest possible moment, because a lot of people held up orders pending the result of the negotiations and the publication of the Agreement.  So far as I am aware, there is still a considerable hold-up going on, because the public have somehow got it into their heads that with the completion of this legislation which we are now considering there will be large variations in existing tariffs, and very drastic adjustments.  I think I am right in saying that as a matter of fact all the actual adjustments which will immediately take effect are in the Schedules to the next Bill.  It is true that, in so far as the quotaed articles are concerne, ultimately those quotas will come off, but in each case when the quota comes off its place will be taken by a rate of duty substantially higher than the rate of duty at present existing, in all probability, and that therefore any person who ordinarily deals in the commodities which are now quotaed might with perfect safety purchase normal supplies of any of those commodities without having any apprehension that there would be a substantial influx of the quotaed commodity at a price substantially lower than he paid for it on purchasing it now.  I think it <Col N="635" /> would be very valuable if the Minister would make that function of the Prices Commission clear now, and explain that it will take time for this Prices Commission to review the case of each quotaed article, and that there is no reasonable ground for stopping trading in those articles in the anticipation of an early decision by the Prices Commission which would completely upset the existing price for the articles at present subject to quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says, of course, is quite correct.  The immediate changes which become effective upon the completion of the Agreement are comparatively minor in character, and they are in any event stated clearly in the Schedule to the Bill.  In so far as goods that are subject to quota restrictions are concerned, there will be no change at all when the Agreement comes into operation.  A change can be contemplated in the future, however. The Agreement does provide for the substitution of customs duties for those quotas.  What the rates of customs duties will be cannot be determined now.  They will be determined following the investigation by the Prices Commission. I do not know if it is the intention of the British Government to ask that early consideration should be given to goods which are subject to quota restrictions.  Perhaps they will, and perhaps they will not.  In any event, the procedure is as follows: First of all the Agreement comes into operation. Secondly, a request is received from the British Government that certain reviews should be undertaken.  That matter is referred to the Prices Commission, which will carry out those reviews.  There will be public sessions, public giving of evidence, examination of all relevant factors and details by the commission, and a report.  On that report we will act, but it is necessary to keep in mind that public convenience is often served by delaying action of that kind for some time.  Although we are morally bound to act as expeditiously as possible upon the recommendation of the Prices Commission, we could, of course, give due regard to the dislocation or losses that might be caused by any sudden change in the <Col N="636" /> conditions under which trading or importing might take place.  It is, therefore, to be contemplated that quite a considerable time will elapse before any substantial number of changes is likely to take place.  As the Deputy said, traders and others who are deferring the making of purchases in anticipation of changes occurring immediately the Agreement is brought into operation are unwise, because no such change will occur, and in fact no change can occur until there has been a review by the Prices Commission, to which adequate, publicity will be given in the Press, because there will be those public sessions held.  Even following those reviews, attention will have to be given to the circumstances of the time in which the change will be made, so as to minimise any difficulties that might arise therefrom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that the procedure would be that applications would be received from the British Government for review, and that then a review would take place.  Does that conform to Article 8?  As I read Article 8 it states:</P>
      <P>The Government of Eire undertake that a review shall be made as soon as practicable by the Prices Commission of existing protective duties and other import restrictions,</P>
      <P>and it goes on to say that those duties and import restrictions will be supplanted by certain other duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood, therefore, that the initiative need not be taken by the British Government in regard to quotas; that the Irish Government undertakes to review every existing quota except those specifically mentioned in the Schedule for exclusion and undertakes itself to move the Prices Commission to name an equitable duty to take the place of the existing quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite correct, but we must assume that, when the British Government desired that Article 12 should be put in&mdash;that is the Article which provides that the first reviews will be in respect of goods for which the United Kingdom Government request early consideration&mdash;it was their intention <Col N="637" /> to do as stated there, that is to request that early consideration will be given to certainly articles.  It is upon that assumption I have been speaking. If in fact no request is received from them, then nevertheless under Article 8 we are bound to make the review.</P>

      <P>Of course, I can tell the Deputy that the class biscuit referred to, in the parlance of the Bill, is an unsweetened biscuit not containing cocoa, but it the Deputy desires me to give him the trade names <Col N="638" /> under which these biscuits are sold, that would be a matter of some difficulty.  The section refers to a duty of 3d. per lb. on all biscuits imported which are made from or contain wheat or a wheaten product and do not contain cocoa and are not sweetened.  I think the Deputy may take it that all unsweetened wheaten biscuits would be included in that class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what I am really concerned with is the question of whether or not this duty has reference to what is popularly known in the country as the &ldquo;farthing biscuit&rdquo; On fair days biscuits of that kind used to be sold and bought by the country people for their lunches.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I just want to get the effect of it.  The First Schedule lays down certain duties which are to be charged on United Kingdom and Canadian goods instead of the existing duties.  Now, I take it, from the explanation that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has given us, that, on the ratification of this Agreement, the rates of duty in the First Schedule become operative subject to any quantitative control of those goods.  Where there is quantitative control of those goods, as I understand it, that control and the duty will remain until the Prices Commission review them.  Where that quantitative control is not to be continued, they will then substiture, for the quantitative control and that duty, a new duty, which may be the same as the existing duty, but which anyway will be minus the quantitative control.  Where there is no quantitative control on the articles mentioned, but where there is a duty, that duty will stand and come into operation, so far as I understand. Now, I should like to ask the Minister whether or not the members of the Prices Commission will or can review that in their ordinary procedure, or will they wait for some special request to review any of the articles mentioned in the First Schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has got it fairly right.  The only point is the possibility of the Prices Commission reviewing the reduced duty for which the First Schedule provides. There is of course, nothing in the Agreement or in legislation so far which prevents the commission from doing so, but I think the Deputy may take it as being extremely improbable that the commission might do so at an early date.  It is possible that the commission might arrive at some such conclusion at a later date, but I think the Deputy may take it that the concern of the commission, very probably, in <Col N="640" /> its early stages, will be related to goods which are subject to quantitative regulation. Of course, at a fairly early stage&mdash;although I cannot say when&mdash; the question of substituting a duty for quantitative control, with regard to certain classes of goods to which such control applies, will have to be considered, but with regard to other classes of goods, an early review will be a matter of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but where there is a question of quantitative control, that quantitative control remains until it is reviewed by the Prices Commission, and then the commission remove the quantitative control, but substitute a new duty, which may be the same as, or increase or reduce the duty in the First Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister some questions with regard to certain duties, and I think in dealing with this Schedule and indeed with all this Bill, we should not lose sight of Article 14 of the Agreement, which is a valuable article, and also Article 18, which provides for further consultation in the event of the Agreement working out in any unexpected way. Now, take the case of linen thread. At present linen thread is subject to a duty of 100 per cent., and here it is proposed to reduce the duty to 40 per cent.  Does the Minister propose to have recourse to Article 14 in order to protect linen thread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If necessary.  The Deputy may not be aware that the duty originally imposed on linen thread was 40 per cent., and 40 per cent. should be quite adequate protection to the manufacturers of linen thread here. It was increased to 100 per cent. only because dumping was in fact being resorted to against them and also the under-cutting of prices for the purpose of taking their market.  We have agreed to reduce the duty to 40 per cent. because we are relying on Article 14, and if dumping, as defined there, should be resorted to, then Article 14 would have to be invoked.  But on the basis of fair and normal competition, <Col N="641" /> the industry here should be well able to maintain itself on the basis of a 40 per cent. duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The next item I want to refer to is shirts.  The duty is reduced to 30 per cent., and I think at present it is 40 per cent.  We have to bear in mind that, while the Bill is part of the legislation implementing the Agreement, it is also a tariff Bill in the ordinary sense of the work, and the reactions of certain of these tariffs on the industry must be considered. I want to make one point to the Minister. We are going to let in shirts at a duty of 30 per cent., which, I think, is a reasonable duty and a generous duty even, and also shirt collars at 30 per cent.  But the Minister ought to consider at once the state of the raw materials of the shirt industry.  For instance, the type of collar which I am wearing at present is made of an interwoven material which is used by most collar-makers at present and is also used for the purpose of fronting and cuffing shirts.  It is not obtainable in this country, and there is at present being levied upon it a duty which I believe was originally put on to protect flannellette.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to make that material available at once to our shirt manufacturers.  If this duty is going to be reduced, general licences ought to be issued to them for the purpose of importing that textile.  There is this additional justification for such a course, that the textile is of such a character that it could not possibly be used for any purpose other than shirt collars, cuffs, and fronts.  You could not use it for any other form of clothes, because it is too stiff and strong.  You could not, for instance, convert it into sheets or anything like that.  The only thing it is suitable for is semi-stiff shirt collars, cuffs, or fronts.  I can assure the Minister that that is a matter of urgent importance for the shirt trade and for the collar trade at present.  Under sub-head 10, the duty on under-garments is reduced to 33? per cent.  That was something higher, but I cannot remember what it was.</P>

      <P>The duty there is going to be reduced to 33? per cent.  I think they will have a fair run for their money there.  In regard to blankets, I think it right to draw the Minister's attention to this.  I have heard loud lamentations from certain manufacturers that the reduction of the tariff to 25 per cent. is going to cripple them.  I do not believe that myself. I believe, for instance, that the Providence Woollen Mills could compete with any country in the world if they have a tariff of 25 per cent.  But it has been mentioned to me that in certain circumstances that tariff is going to cripple certain units in the blanket trade.  I think the Minister might look into that question with a view either to putting an end to talk of that kind or to find out what is the special difficulty which besets the complaining parties who are talking a great deal about the reduction of that tariff.  I also wanted to ask what is the significance of item 19&mdash;woven tissues made wholly or partly of wool and chargeable with the duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1934.</P>

      <P>Yes, of 30 and 20 per cent.  It is reduced to 15 per cent. and 10 per cent.  The effect is, not to permit of more cloth coming in and to ensure that those who get licences will in fact have an inducement to use these licences to import British rather than cloths of other origin.  On the other point raised by Deputy Dillon, I can only say that in preparing these lists of duty reductions, which were the subject of very detailed and protracted discussions, we endeavoured to ensure as well as we could that none of the reductions went so far as to endanger the prospects of the industries concerned in the production of these goods.  In order, however, to make doubly sure, we got inserted in the Agreement a clause which provides that, if the imports of the goods are so increased as a result of the reductions that the prospects of success of the producers and manufacturers of the goods in Éire would be endangered, then in such circumstances we can impose quantitative regulations.  If we do impose that quantitative regulation, we have to discuss with the United Kingdom Government the question of the quantity of these goods of United Kingdom origin that will be admitted in.  I think myself that the Deputy is correct in the assumption that with the 25 per cent. duty the manufacturers of blankets should be well able to hold the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of certain classes of cloth used by certain shirt manufacturers, there is probably nothing so difficult as the regulation of importation of shirting cloth.  There are two or three diverse purposes to be served at the same time, one to convenience the shirt manufacturers&mdash;you want to <Col N="644" /> encourage them to use our own cloth to whatever extent is possible and you want, at the same time, to give them reasonable varieties but not sufficient latitude to induce them to change over to imported cloths from those that are made here.  These matters are the subject of continuous discussions between the inserted parties and officers of my Department, but I am not sufficiently familiar with them to say precisely what particular class of cloth is allowed in under licence at the moment or what is subject to restriction of any kind.  If the clothing manufacturers have a case to make on that I am quite certain they will make it, and I may say we will go as far as it is possible for us to meet them, subject to the quantities of shirting cloth we produce within the country. I think, however, with the 30 per cent. duty against United Kingdom goods they are still adequately protected. The most dangerous competition from the point of view of the shirt manufacturers came, I think, from countries other than the United Kingdom. In recent years some very cheap goods of that class were available from Japan and certain other countries but, of course, as against these goods the old duty still operates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister free to give us any information on what the reason was for the reduction of this minimum duty from 2/6 to 1/-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the idea was to encourage whatever trade might be available by way of small parcels sent in from distributing houses.  I am not at all sure that the reduction of the minimum customs duty does in fact facilitate that particular class of trade, but I think that was the reason for which it was pressed.  The Deputy must not ask me to try to interpret the minds of the British Government in the matter.  They suggested that these changes should be effected&mdash;the abolition of this stamp duty in the case of non-dutiable goods, the reduction of the minimum duty in the case <Col N="646" /> of dutiable goods, and the modification of the package duty for which this Bill also provides. Clearly the type of trade that is affected by these imposts is retail distribution, trade by parcel post, or over the the Border or from distributing houses rather than the bulkreade that would be done by a manufacturer with wholesale distributors. Some of these reductions for which the Bill provide will undoubtedly facilitate that type of trade.  It will facilitate certainly that trade in the case of non-dutiable goods.  Of course, from the industrial point of view, in the case of dutiable goods, the protection is the amount of duty that is imposed, and it will continue to operate.  In fact, there will still be a minimum duty operating.  I think the operation of the minimum duty couveniences the importer rather than inconveniences him, because it makes a certain simple arrangement possible, whereas, without it, there might be delays arising out of the necessity for calculating the exact amount of duty in the case of single article costing 9¾d. or 8¾d. or something of duty but the effect of all the changes is, undoubtedly, to facilitate that kind of, distributive trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is a further thing that will result from this and that is the goodwill which is equally as important as anything else.  In the case of the small gifts which are occasionally sent to this country at Christmas and other times, I think it means a reduction from 3/- with the 6d. stamp off&mdash;a reduction from 3/-. It that applies it will mean, I think, in a large number of cases that people will be disposed to send gifts to this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the good will to which Deputy Benson referred and I am sure it is a valuable asset, but let us not close our eyes to what this reduction is going to mean.  It certainly is going to stimulate the postal <Col N="647" /> shopping with Selfridges, Harrods, Barkers and the other large stores that advertise in the British papers coming in here.  And, now, that postal shopping can come to a very substantial total, as those advertisements prove, because these stores would not spend thousands of pounds putting advertisements in the papers if they did not draw custom and, as a matter of fact, having worked as a shop assistant in a big London store myself and having for some time worked as the postal clerk, I know what volume of postal orders does come in to these London shops.  Now we have set certain standards of employment in shops in Ireland and they are pretty high. No such standards apply in Great Britain and I do advise the House to bear this in mind that this is just one of those cases where we have got to watch.  If we fix by law certain standards for our employees in this country we have got take reasonable measures to ensure that we will not permit competition founded on inferior standards.  We  have fixed high conditions for the shop assistants in this country and the general inclination and trend is to improve them to the best of our ability.  We ought to watch. I do not say that this reduction in the duty is going to have a disastrous effect.  I do not think we can possibly know until we see it in practice, but I think we ought to be on our guard in that matter.  If we have large distributive centres paying rates and so forth in the City of Dublin we ought to be reluctant to encourage people to pass their trade over to large stores in London, or Manchester, or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>None at all may convenience people shopping in Border towns, or the sending in of gifts, to which Deputy Benson referred, but, apart from that, I do not think it is likely to upset the packing industry. The reduction only apply in respect, of goods imported, on the one hand, for the personal use of the importer, that is if a person goes into Derry, for example, and makes purchases there and goes back again, the goods if dutiable will be liable to duty and the duty will be charged, but a package tax will not be charged over and above the duty.  A second example is that of gifts which are sent in for the use or enjoyment of the consignee and which are imported through the post.  The third provides for the case of a limited number of parcels sent in through the parcel post.  A box of half a dozen Oxo cubes, for instance, would pay only one tax on the cover and not a tax, as at present, upon each cube.</P>

      <P>The Minister has that right in respect of a number of duties. He has the right under existing legislation to grant a licence to some person to import the goods without payment of duty.  We have entered into an Agreement with the United Kingdom, however, to give them a preference in <Col N="652" /> such case.  This is a somewhat difficult section to put in understandable form, but the effect of it is that where we do issue a licence&mdash;and whether it is to be issued or not will be determined on entirely different grounds&mdash;that licence will operate only to entitle the person to free importation of goods of United Kingdom origin.  If he wants to import goods of other origin, they will be liable to a 10 per cent, duty unless the goods are not procurable in the United Kingdom.  That is what we have agreed upon and that is what we are taking power to do here, although it will be more a matter of administration than of legislation.</P>

      <P>That is quite satisfactory. In regard to the issue of licence for free imortation of tariffed articles in certain circumstances, another question arises.  In the Agreement, Schedule 2, which describes the articles on which no tariff is now to be levied, has an immensely long list, but when you come to the Schedule to this Bill setting out those articles from which duties are removed, it is a very short list.  Are we to take it that all the goods mentioned in Schedule 2 of the Agreement and not mentioned in the Third Schedule to the Bill do not bear a duty at the present time and that Schedule 2 only operates not to put a duty on these things in the future?</P>

      <P>That matter does not arise on this Schedule but I may, perhaps, explain that when the Agreement comes into operation imported boots and shoes will be liable both to a duty of 20 per cent.  and to quautitative regulation.  In fact the importation of boots and shoes is now prohibited except under licence, the issue of licences being regulated in accordance with the Control of Imports Act.  Even if a licence is issued, the person importing boots and shose under the licence will have to pay 20 per cent. That position will continue until a review has been carried out by the Prices Commission, following which quantitative regulation will cease to operate but some new duty&mdash;what it will be, I cannot say&mdash;will be substituted for the 20 per cent, if the Prices Commission so recommend.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (b) refers to &ldquo;any animal and that extends the operation of this Bill to pigs.  In the Bill which we have just disposed of, any existing tariff or restriction on the importation of pigs has been removed. In another Bill which we disposed of to-day &mdash; the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill&mdash;reference is made to certain feeding stuffs and to restrictions upon their import into this country.  All these matters will have their reaction on the general industry of pig production and I think it is right that the House should now face the crisis which threatens that great industry.  Few people realise the extent to which the pig industry has declined in this country over the last five years.  Speaking in terms of volume, and taking one cwt. of bacon exported as approximately representing one pig produced, our produce of pigs fell from 787, 491 pigs in 1931 to 574, 294, in 1937.  The decline in pigs produced between the years 1935 and 1927 is as from 627,748 pigs in 1935 to 574,249 pigs in 1937.  That is taking one cwt. of bacon to be approximately equal to one pig, and that is a reasonably accurate calculation for a rough and ready comparative estimate.  I now allege that the decline in pig production in this country during the last two years is due to the scandalous conduct of the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to circumvent or avoid your ruling, but we have been presented with an international Agreement which is of very wide application.  Our first concern must be to reject or adopt it and, if we adopt it, then to consider it in all its details.  The Minister for Finance moved Bills which implenmented his part od the Agreement; the Minister for Industry and Commerce moved Bills for his part of the Agreement, and now the Minster for Agriculture comes with his Bill to implement his part of the Agreement.  I suggest that one of the vital parts of that Agreement the free admission of live pigs to Great Britain and the free admission of bacon to Great Britain, and if we are to get value for the more material concessions we have made to Great Britain, we have got to out of the agricultural concessions that we got, the maximum possible yield.</P>

      <P>Unless we are going to take the measures necessary to get that, then this Agreement is going to be a complete farce.  My submission now is that the Minister for Agriculture is disposing of this part of the Agreement and I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, so far as pigs are conecrned, which ought to make an immense contribution to the agricultural end of this Agreement, we are going to lose the whole of that contribution if we do not take vigorous measures to put our own house in order and we are going to about the Agreement if we do not put our house in order.  I think so far as cattle and other livestock are concerned, there is very little dividing the Minister and us is our attitude towards them.  The general policy should be to get out f the Agreement everything that can be got out of it.  Unless we take definite steps here in regard to pigs I suggest we are going to lose what should be one of the most valuable parts of the Agreement.  It is for that reason I want to submit now that continued responsibility on the part of the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board is inconsistent with extracting from this <Col N="658" /> Agreement the value we ought to get out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to you.  I confess that the Minister and I, in our previous discussions on matters relating to agriculture, may have allowed a note of acrimony to creep in on occasion, which was perhaps understandable, owing to the radical differences which existed between us in the last few years on general matters of policy.  I think and I hope that it will be unnecessary for any such note of acrimony to enter into our discussions in future, because I believe we will arrive in principle at substantial agreement on what ought to be done and, if we differ at all, it will be merely a question differing as to the best method of getting it done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister is being properly supported by the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board and the I formally allege in the most public possible way that the members of the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board are at present engaged upon a conspiracy to capture for themselves a monopoly of the bacon curing industry of this country. I now allege that the members of these Boards are deliberatrely trying to wipe out the export business in live Pigs.  to wipe out all the small bacon curers and to have two large amalgamations <Col N="659" /> controlled by two of the existing companies to function as a virtual monopoly in the bacon manufcturing trade and, incidentally, in the bacon production industry.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to add this, with the fullest sense of responsibility, that sooner or later, even if the present Minister does not agree with me, there will be a change in the ordinary ebb and flow of politics.  If any such monopoly is established in the bacon curing industry, let the monopolists make that monopoly in the knowledge that on the day our Party get into office they will be expropriated for a small sum.  There is no question of confiscating any person's property. There is no suggestion of a threat to take form any man his own without fair compensation, but there is a warning that it is not considered sound policy from a social point of view to allow monopolies to enter into vital parts of the people's industries, to allow essential things such as bacon and pigs to fall into the hands of monopolists. If the attempt is made it will be met by such drastic action as may be considered necessary, even to the extent of putting the matter into the hands of the State.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that is he is able now to stop that and the he ought to fix these intending monopolists with the notice with which I fix them.  If he does that, the whole plan will be dropped because they will realise that there is nothing to be got out of it.  I ask him to go further.  I ask him completely to reconstitute the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board.  The Bacon Marketing Board is at present absolutely controlled by two bacon curers in this country, and I will name them at a later date if steps are not taken to remedy the situation.  They have deliberately&mdash;and here, I think, the Minister has mistakenly consented to their plan&mdash;discouraged the country fair for pigs.  They have urged strongly that pigs should be bought by co-operative groups and sent in direct to the factory and that the people ought to avoid the fair.  I put it more strongly <Col N="660" /> to the Minister that the result of that has been greatly to the people's own detriment.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister has enjoined upon these factories to do everything they can do to accommodate the pig producers and to help the farmers in every way they can.  In fact, they are not helping the farmers in every way they can, and the attitude of the Pigs Marketing Board has been very unhelpful.  The farmers have been left with pigs on their hands, with no factory expressing its willingness to take them.  A man rears a pig, expending his time and money in feeding that pig, but the result is when he brings it to the market he is told that the factory cannot take it for another fortnight.  If he takes the pig home he is at the loss of a fortnight's feeding for the animal; in addition, after a fortnights feeding the animal falls into a lower grade, being too fat.  So the farmer not only loses his market, but he also loses the grade price owing to the pig being allowed to get over-fat in that fortnight.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that there is not effective representaion for either the producers or the consumers on the Pigs Marketing Board or on the Bacon Marketing Board.  I submit to the Minister that unless a very drastic reform is carried out in both these bodies he ought to abolish them altogether.  They have signally and deplorably failed in the purposes which they were set up to serve.  One of their main functions was to level out the prices of the pigs all through the year.  They have done nothing whatsoever in that direction.  The price of pigs has gone up and has fallen just as mush as it did before these boards were established.  Another of their functions was to raise the prise of pigs.  If you look at world prices now, I do not believe that the price of pigs has gone up one penny as a result of the intervention of the Pigs Marketing Board.  Another of their functions was to increase the output of pigs in the country. Far from achieving hat, they have reduced the out put of pigs and bacon by about <Col N="661" /> 100, 000 pigs.  Nothing that these two boards have done since they were established has helped the pig induustry in this country.  I believe that the Minister has done himself and his Department a grave injustice by declining all responsibility for the activities of these two bodies.  I urge on the Minister most strongly either (1) to dissolve or abolish these boards or (2) to reconstitute them from the ground up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is probably beginning to suspect that himself.  Deputy Moore asked for demonstrable proofs.  Of course you cannot get proofs of these things. You never can.  These people know perfectly well that I am opposed to them.  Their first concern is to get me as far away from their activities as it is possible for them to do.  They are praying to God that I will know nothing about their activities, because they know that if I find out anything about them I will bring the matter before the House at the earliest possible moment.  It is with the greatest difficulty I get any information and it is for that reason that I am coming to the Minister asking him to help me in this matter and to intimate to those people who have those ideas in their heads that they cannot get away with it.  I know that moves are going on at present to amalgamate the bacon factories, I do not know what the Minister's attitude is to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that we want to help to get the maximum number of pigs produced in this country; that we want to help to get sale for the maximum number of pigs and we want the maximum amount of <Col N="662" /> bacon to be produced.  I want, in addition to assure him that we want to get the very best type of pig into the country.  I think  the Minister himself appreciates the point that I have never balaboured him on the question of the Ulster pig that so many of my constituents would like me to urge on the Minister's attention.  I have always held that the Ulster pigs was the right pig, but I never tried to worry or embarrass the Minister on that point.  I urge him to believe that we are earnestly desirous of cooperating with him in improving this industry and to get as large a share of the British market as it is humanly possible for us to get. I do urge on him that the really formidable obstacles in his way of achieving these things are the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Borad.  If he will either reconstitute them or abolish them he can depend on the fullest possible co-operation that he could desire from us in any steps that may be necessary in order to promote the interests of this all-important branch of agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>I did not, of course, anticipate that Deputy Dillon would raise this matter on this particular-Bill. I have not, therefore, got the facts that would enable me to say whether Deputy Dillon is right in his allegation or not. I do not think we can discuss this matter of pigs in the fall of the number of pigs in the country on the basis that anything in particular is responsible.  I have read articles, and I am sure that Deputy Dillon has read them too, in the &ldquo;International Review of Agriculture&rdquo; by very eminent statisticians from other countries.  These experts have been trying to find the basis of this rise and fall in the price of pigs. The fact is that nobody has yet solved that question.  Pigs go up and down in numbers, and nobody can say why We are no the lower end of the stick at present.  Two or three years ago there was a lot of pigs in the country, but there are not so many now.  If the would is going to go on as it has been going on in the past, we will again in another two or three years have a lot of pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> I do not think that Deputy Dillon, in comparing the numbers of pigs and pig prices in 1931 with the prices and numbers of pigs in 1937, has allowed for the imports of bacon, which were considerably reduced in 1937 as compared with 1931.  Probably we will have an opportunity of discussing this when my Estimate comes before the Dáil.  I would not have the slightest objection to discussing the general principles of the pig market and the general principles of the Pigs Marketing Board if these were now in order.  They will be in order on the Estimate.  If I have refused to answer questions in the Dáil with regard to orders made by the Pigs Marketing Board as to prices, I think I was quite right, because I could not be responsible for what a board with statutory powers might do.  Perhaps that point of view may be argued, but on general principles I do not think Deputy Dillon would agree with it.  On general principles we are going to regulate agricultural industry here as in other countries, and Deputy Dillon might argue that it should always and in all cases be kept under the immediate control of the Minister.  I think if we come to regulate the agricultural industries and put them under the control as far as possible of the people concerned, it is the best system, if we can get it to work in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be held that the board are there to destroy the export of pigs.  In tat particular case the British Government gives us a quota.  That has been the case since 1933.  Under this Agreement that will remain.  We get a quota for bacon and bacon pigs.  It is the British Government that has always insisted that the percentage of that quota of live pigs must be cut very small.  I think it is something like 3.5 per cent. of the whole.  Not more than a certain per centage must be live pigs.  The Pigs Marketing Board or the Bacon Marketing Board have absolutely nothing to do with that.  We tell them what we can permit them to export in the form of bacon and they have nothing to do with what is permitted to be exported <Col N="664" /> in the form of live pigs.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it does very much good to threaten those people with expropriation. If I had no legal powers to deal with them if they were going to do something that I thought very wrong, and I were to call them together and say: &ldquo;I have no power to deal with you now but I mean to get that power from the Dáil in the shortest possible time,&rdquo; I quite agree with the Deputy that they might not proceed against my wishes, but I cannot say if things are as bad as the Deputy fears.  A case could be made probably for the reconstitution of the boards or even for the amalgamation of the boards.  I made the case when I brought in the amending Bill that these boards were only a very short time operating and that, in fact, the time was too short to review the position in regard to them.  Of course, a time will come&mdash;the time may have arrived now&mdash;to review the working of the Pigs and Bacon Act to see if there should be any modification of the Act carried out, such as a reconstitution or an amalgamation of the boards.  I agree with the Deputy that if we can find the time we ought to get down to an examination of these matters in the near future.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Deputy could establish his point that the board is controlled by two curers.  If it is, we must put it down to the ability of these curers because every one of the seven members has an equal vote.  As a matter of fact I know that, in the beginning at any rate, the large curers had great fears that they would be outvoted by the smaller men.  Perhaps the bigger men are more able, but I do not know how the bigger men could unduly influence the smaller curers to such an extent as to induce them to carry something which they were not willing to carry and which would not be in the interests of the smaller curers.  I cannot, therefore, see the force of the Deputy's point that the Bacon Board is controlled by two curers.  Whether, again, there is anything in the point that the big curers are seeking an amalgamation or a monopoly, I cannot say. I have heard rumors, not lately, but some time ago, that there was a movement <Col N="665" /> amongst a number of curers to amalgamate, but I was told afterwards that it did not come to anything.  It was impossible anyway to find a basis of agreement on that, and I do not think there is very much in it.  I have power, as the Deputy knows, under the Pigs and Bacon Act, to refuse to issue a licence for the transfer of a factory to another person.  The reason that was put into the Act was to prevent a large curer from getting a monopoly of the greater part of the bacon trade. There is, however, a difficulty which I need not go into, this evening.  There is a legal difficulty in that clause, and it could be circumvented.</P>

      <P>That is right.  That is a matter that can be dealt with at a future time.  I think that the Deputy is perhaps right in his contention that the board has discouraged country fairs.  Whether that was their object or not I cannot say, but the effect, anyway, of the operation of the Act has been that rather more pigs are going direct to the factory and less to the fairs.  It was said at a later stage that pigs are being left on the farmers' hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegation at that time was that there were certain factories that did not fill the quota, that they were buying from some people and not from others.  In order to deal with that, we put a clause in the Act <Col N="666" /> which would compel a factory to take pigs from certain farmers when asked to do so.  The Deputy also says that the producers and the consumers are not represented on these boards.  I might remind him that when I came before the Dáil with the first Act, I said that I could not see pig producers represented on the board except through nomination.  I can honestly say that I would be very glad if any Deputy would provide me with a scheme for the selection of such producers' representatives, and leave me out of it, because it generally happens in such matters that if the Minister has the responsibility of placing three men on the board, he displeases quite a number of others.  It would be a very much better for him not to have the responsibility if he could avoid it, of selection these producer members.  If we have any revision on review of the existing legislation, I certainly will do my very utmost to see that we shall have some other method of putting these representatives of producers on the board.  Of course, consumers, as such, are not represented on the board but the machinery for seeing that consumers' interests are protected is provided through the Prices Commission which is at present examining the price of bacon and which heard evidence from curers, wholesalers and retailers. I expect that we shall have a report from them in the near future.  The Deputy says that the board was set up in order to level up prices.  I think it is not really just to say that they have not done that, because I think any Deputy who looks at the prices paid during the autumn since the board was established will admit that the are far and away better than the autumn prices before the board was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they are higher. They have not, it is true, given a level price all the year.  I do not think we ever hoped that they would. I think if we were enjoin on the board to make prices level the whole year through we would have a very much bigger production in the Autumn. <Col N="667" /> than during the other months, because farmers are more inclined to produce more things in the Autumn.  We must give a lower price then and a higher price at this time in order to induce farmers to produce pigs outside the Autumn months.  The third object, as the Deputy stated, was to increase the output of pigs.  I suppose if the Pigs Marketing Board were to fix and to give a better price for pigs in the Autumn to ensure farmers getting rid of them when fat that is as much as the board could be expected to do, and to increase production.  They may be able to do that better now.  I think they should be able to do it better now when these tariffs are removed, and that we may have increased production of pigs.  I believe we will.  As Deputies know, they went a stage by giving out young sows.  I believe that was a very good move, and that it may have very good effects.  I may say that these sows were placed where sows were very scarce before, if not altogether unknown in some parts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put to the Minister one thing I have in mind? The British Government are trying to organise their own pig production, and they are trying to do it on the basis of some kind of marketing board which would deal with units that would contract for supplies of pigs.  I know that the old scheme broke down and that they are trying now rather along these lines.  Would it be possible for <Col N="668" /> us to go to the British Marketing Board and say: &ldquo;Your primary concern is to secure supplies of pigs without having to ferry them across the North Sea or the Atlantic Ocean. If you would permit us to join your pigs marketing scheme as a unit we would be in a position at the beginning of the contract period to deliver 40,000 pigs&rdquo;?  We would have to send all the pigs through an export corporation or through the Minister for Agriculture in order to avail of the British scheme and the preference to deal in units.  Could we not get that share of live pigs in addition to the quota we are getting for bacon?  If we could do that, would not that market for live pigs enable the Minister to avail of the services of the pig-buyers and keep the live pig fairs going?  When I say live pig fairs, I mean where live pigs are still in existence throughout the country.  I am convinced, if the Minister would do that, he would greatly ease his own problem, and people who are complaining that they cannot get satisfaction from the factories would have the fairs to go to.  They would go to buyers there who would be able to place their pigs for them.  I think if the Minister were an exporter, and set up a division for that purpose, he would find a mixed lot of pigs coming forward, but with the expert advice which is readily available about the different markets in England, it would be quite easy to dispose of all the kinds of large white pigs which would reach him for export, instead of having, as at present, people harassed and distressed by inability to market what they produce. I strongly urge on the Minister that something of that kind should be done. If we got the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board properly reconstituted, and if the Minister could revive the live pig export business, we would be getting somewhere, and the pig industry would grow and become one of the richest sources of agricultural income that the people have.  There are other matters related to this, but I propose to defer them until the Minister's Estimate, when they will be relevant. They include the cost of feeding stuffs, <Col N="669" /> which, the Chair will agree, is a matter that would be more properly dealt with when dealing with the general question on the Agricultural Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think this question would be raised this evening on this Bill, but I wish to say a few words on it now.  There is no question at all but the pig and bacon curers have made considerable profits in 1935-36, 1936-37 and during portion of the year 1937-38.  Attention was drawn to that some time ago.  But the position since Christmas has been anything but right, and curers have been buying to sell at a loss.  I venture to say that there is not a curer in Ireland in the business to-day who has not been at a steady loss since Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices are much steadier since the Pigs marketing Board came into operation than before that.  If there is a slight fluctuation there is nothing like the slumps we used to have.  Slumps are not in evidence now as they were before the advent of the board.  Prices may not be at a perfect level, but slumps have been done away with.  The Minister mentioned the young sows that were sent out. He had better remember that the provision of young sows is really not the trouble.  The reason people got out of sows and ceased to breed litters was because they had not credit and the means to feed them. The cost of a young sow six, eight, or ten weeks old would be anywhere from 25/- to 35/-.  That is not the real consideration.  The main thing is that people had not the means nor the credit to buy food, costing perhaps £30, £40 or £50, to fatten a litter of pigs. That is the kernel of the situation and that is what the Minister will have to tackle.  I do not want to raise any question about the settlement, as it has been suggested by both Parties that there should be no more exhibitions here of a disagreeable frame of mind, and no snarling across the Table.  I do not propose to indulge in that way.  I hope that is ended for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> The Minister will have to realise, if he wants to deal with the situation, that it is not the provision of sows is the trouble, but the provision of credit and means.  The unfortunate people have not got that now.  I do not propose to go further now as there will be time enough when the Estimate is before the House.  The Minister, however, must know of the gamble that was entered into by some curers.  He must know of the gamble that was entered into by one particular curer in 1934, when he broke away from his organisation in order to buy and buy. Then he got a quota when the Pigs Marketing Board came into existence &mdash;because he knew it was coming&mdash;out of all proportion to what he could get eight or ten years ago.  That one curer is really responsible for the advertisements that appeared in the public Press.  We are not all fools in the country. We have our ears closer to the ground than the Minister.  I suggest that the Minister should keep his ears a little closer to the ground. There is every danger of a monopoly. It is in the knowledge of every curer that monopoly is aimed at.  Feelers were sent out long ago so as to achieve that object.  I, for one, will not be a party to that, and I hope the Minister will not be a party to it.</P>

      <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister with regard to fairs that are held in some of the Border counties.  In some cases half the supply of stock at a fair would come from the other side of the Border.  Cattle are taken along approved roads.  Can all this stock be taken now to fairs without any restriction? When the Agreement is implemented, can cattle come in free from the North?</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister... may without <Col N="671" /> prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, by such order provide for any one or more of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  for making specified infringements of such order offences punishable on summary conviction and fixing the penalties for such offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 47, to delete the words &ldquo;and fixing the penalties for such offences.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that this amendment, and amendment 8 to section 4, might be taken together.  Amendment 8 reads: &ldquo;At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any offence under any order made under this Act, other than an offence under sub-section (2) of Section 3 hereof, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under Section 2 the Minister is taking power to fix penalties for offences. That is a power which, I think, the Minister should not have.  I think penalties should be fixed by the Dáil. I do not know why the Minister wants this power.  Not long since he spoke of the responsibilities that were placed upon him in connection with certain selections.  In this matter I think he would be better off not to have the right to fix penalties.  I do not think it is desirable that any Minister should have that power.  If the Minister desires it and thinks it is reasonable that he should have it, then he should give his reasons to the House.  Personally, if I were in the Minister's position, I would not like to have to carry the responsibility of fixing penalties. With regard to the second amendment, I would like to hear from the Minister why he proposes to take to himself the right to autocratically fix what penalty ought to be imposed on people for an infringement of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very anxious, as far as it was possible to do so, not to put anything into any of these Bills <Col N="672" /> which might be considered unfair to the Dáil.  I knew that I would have to ask the Dáil to allow these Bills to go through as quickly as possible.  I did not want, therefore, to be in the position of seeming to take undue advantage of that situation.  I was anxious to know whether there was any precedent for what is proposed here: whether the principle had been agreed to before the Dáil.  I find that it has. In the Agricultural (Regulation of Export) Act, which was passed sometime in 1933, a measure which went through the ordinary stages in the Dáil and got adequate discussion, this principle was approved of.  That would seem to indicate the advisability of the form adopted here.</P>
      <P>At that time it was argued that quite a number of offences would be possible under that Bill.  For example, a man who was obliged to make returns by a certain date might fail to do so.  He would be written to, and if he again failed to comply it might be necessary to bring him to court.  The offence might be a trivial one, and hence we did not want to have a maximum penalty in the Bill of, say, £100.  If you were to have a maximum penalty it would have to be £100 so as to meet every offence. When that person was brought to court, the district justice might say that he was plainly guilty of an offence, and would then point out that £100 was prescribed as the maximum fine.  At the same time he would probably have some regard to the nature of the offence and might be inclined to say that he could not very well impose a fine of 10/- in view of the fact that the maximum was £100, and in the result might impose a fine of a couple of pounds.  On the other hand, if we were to prescribe the penalty we would probably put in £10. If the offence were a minor one, the district justice would probably say that a fine of 10/- would be sufficient to meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, having the section in this form, is really much better than to have a maximum penalty prescribed. It will be easier for all concerned. Take another example.  The <Col N="673" /> maximum penalty for a breach of the regulations in the matter of exporting pigs to Northern Ireland was only £5 per pig, but the maximum penalty for exporting bacon to Great Britain, where, of course, we knew we were dealing with bigger men, had to be substantial and was made £100.  In the same way, if we were making regulations with regard, say, to the making of returns we might put in a rather low maximum fine, but for an offence concerning, say, the importation of bacon, we might put on a fairly stiff maximum penalty.  The district justice, dealing with cases brought before him, would, I imagine, have regard to what we considered should be the maximum penalty, and would impose fines accordingly.  We are not creating a precedent in what we propose doing here.  The principle set out here has already been agreed to in the other measure to which I have referred, a Bill that went through the usual stages in the Dáil and got adequate discussion.  I cannot remember if this particular point got adequate discussion, but there was no objection raised, and that measure has been working satisfactorily for the last four or five years. I do not know if, in fact, any penalty was ever inflicted under that particular measure.  I could not possibly agree to this amendment.  I hope the Deputy believes me when I say that in putting the Bill in this form before the House it is not my desire to take any unfair advantage.  I quite admit that Deputies opposite are willing to facilitate us in letting those Bills through, and I am not taking advantage of that in saying I cannot really agree to this amendment.  As I say, I did find out that the thing has been working in connection with another Bill which was agreed to by the Dáil before, and in the interests of those concerned I think it is better that we should have it that way rather than put in what would really have to be a substantial amount.  I think I would have to insist on £100, if it were to be fixed by the Dáil as applicable all round.  It is better that the fine should be fixed by Order, so that it could be brought very much lower in many cases where the offence may <Col N="674" /> be regarded as not of so much importance.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has made a good case, because even if the principle has been embodied in a previous Bill, the Minister has certainly admitted that there was no discussion in connection with it.  There was also another factor with which I intended to deal, but I think the Minister has disposed of it, and that is whether there were any prosecutions under the Bill, whether there were any penalties fixed or any fines inflicted.  The Minister says he does not think there was.</P>

I can recollect objecting to that principle on various occasions, <Col N="675" /> but of course it had no effect.  The division bell rang when there was a proposal of that kind.  Does the House not see how fatal it is that the vital power of imposing a penalty on a citizen should br relegated to an office? That is what is involved in this matter. This is an arbitrary power to give to any Ministerial office&mdash;the power to decide what the penalty is to be, and to impose that penalty.  That is a power which should be retained by this House.  The Minister says his difficulty about this is that he foresees various classes of offences.  It has been the custom in regard to legislation in the past that those offences were always set forth in the statute, and for those various offences a maximum penalty was imposed.  The offences can be classified.  I do not think it is fair of the Minister to extend this principle.  Again, I want to warn the House that this function should not be allowed outside the jurisdiction of the House.  No Government Department should be given the power of imposing a penalty on any citizen. The House will remember that day after day we are letting our duties and our functions pass out of our hands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The principle is all wrong.  It is giving a Government Department the power of legislation. This House is not legislating at all. That is extending to every country; if is not peculiar to this State.  Eventually, we will probably pass two-line or three-line Bills giving the Minister power to make orders, and that will be the end of the functions of this House. I object to the principle.  If the Minister wants this measure now, I do not intend to delay him, but the Minister must not take it that that is an admission of the principle.  I have not admitted it in the past; I am not doing it now, and I will not do it in the future.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is obvious.  It is really to get over any difficulty that may arise in the case of importation at the time of issuing an order, where as a matter of fact the articles would be on their way here at the time the order was issued.  For instance&mdash;I think this matter was referred to last night&mdash;suppose a consignment of fish was being imported here, and that it came in after the order was issued, although it was on its way before the order was made at all, would the Minister then under sub-section (2) of Section 3 expect that the importer should export those articles again, or what extension does he propose to give in order to get over that type of difficulty?</P>

      <P>Perhaps if I just state the position I may be able to make that matter clear, whether or not I can convince Deputies in regard to it.  In the first place, I want to say what I said yesterday, that I think Deputies have in mind goods which are now unrestricted and where I might at a later stage propose to regulate them.  There might be a flow of imports of a certain commodity, and I might, under this Bill, suddenly say: &ldquo;From this minute or from this hour no more imports will <Col N="677" /> be allowed.&rdquo;  That is quite a reasonable attitude for Deputies to take up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is no bacon being imported at present.  We have agreed to allow in a certain amount of bacon, and, therefore, we would not be interfering with any trader by saying: &ldquo;We are going to prohibit the import of bacon now, but we are going to give a quota,&rdquo; because in fact there is a prohibition there by a high tariff. When the tariff comes off we say: &ldquo;We will prohibit imports, and give a quota for bacon in certain classes,&rdquo; so there is no great danger at the moment anyway of hitting any particular person who is importing.  We must do it quickly in this case, because if, for instance, the duties were coming off to-morrow on both sides, anybody here could bring in bacon to-morrow, as much bacon as he liked, free of duty. If I were to be compelled either to give notice, as is suggested here in one amendment, or to publish it first in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i>as is suggested in another amendment, while that was being done, in fact inside 24 hours, a considerable amount of bacon would come in, not of British origin at all, perhaps of Polish origin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think that everybody will agree that these powers are necessary in view of the circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;because they are not coming in.  I admit, however, that when we come to deal with such matters later on, there may be a danger with regard to certain commodities, and some grounds for fear such as the Deputies have expressed. For instance, there is the question of fish.  At the moment, fish is coming in freely.  We do not have to deal with that question immediately, but we may have to deal with it later on. Now, fish is coming in freely at the moment all right, and if I were to make an order that no more fish was to come in, it might happen that quite a lot of fish, which is a perishable commodity, might be in transit, and it would be very unjust to make such an order in the circumstances. I think, however, that Deputies may take it that, in the case of fish, or any such perishable commodity, we would give, probably, a few weeks' notice, because we would know that, without such notice, great hardship and loss would be inflicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the construction of the section as it stands gives one the opposite impression, particularly as you are taking powers to send the commodity back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we shall deal with that point later.  However, as I say, in the case of fish, or some such perishable commodity, we would give adequate notice because we could be quite sure that the merchants here would not import a large amount of fish and then sent it out later, since everybody knows that fish does not keep very well.  However, let us take another example.  I admit that it is not an example which is likely to <Col N="679" /> occur; but suppose that, for some reason or another, we were going to quota the import of sheep.  Naturally, of course, we could not give much notice in the case of sheep.  If there were any necessity to import sheep, we could not give a week's notice, but we could give at least a day's notice so as to allow of any sheep that were actually in transit being imported, and thus avoid any hardship that might be imposed if notice had not been given.</P>
      <P>I admit that, actually, as the Act is drafted, Deputies are entitled to have a genuine fear, but I am sure it will be realised, at the same time, that the moment these duties come off we must be in a position to put on whatever prohibitions may be necessary, and regulate our quotas; and from that point of view, we want unrestricted power.  However, I am quite prepared to give a public undertaking here, that, as far as I am concerned, sufficient notice will be given and that goods actually in transit at the time of the notice will certainly not be sent back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a case that, from his point of view, there were precedents existing in 1933; but I think that, to a certain extent, he gives away his own case in that respect because, since 1933, there has been a number of very arbitrary powers assumed by Government Departments. I cannot charge my memory with the discussion that took place on the particular section about which the Minister is talking, but there is no doubt that there was a general feeling that the Government asked for a whole lot of emergency powers, which were granted; and if there was the slightest discussion on these powers from this <Col N="680" /> side of the House, we were told: &ldquo;Oh, well, you are giving great heart to Jimmy Thomas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if it was not the Act, it was the same sort of thing; it was implied.  Now, we want to lay the ghost of Jimmy Thomas, as far as these arbitrary powers are concerned.  In making that statement, Sir, I do not wish the person mentioned any ill, but it is certain that his name has been invoked in this House in that connection and it is also certain that, by reason of expressions such as that, a whole lot of arbitrary powers have been sought by Government Departments, which powers, I think, it is to everybody's interest should be done away with.  I should like to say in connection with these amendments, that there is no opposition to the Bill as a Bill, but the Minister says that he does not wish, under the guise of this Bill, to take advantage of this side of the House and seek arbitrary powers.  That, however, is just what he is doing.  The Minister has taken the case of a man who makes false returns; and he says, in effect: &ldquo;Well, we must have powers in fixing very substantial penalties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we on this side of the House do not want to shield anybody who is making false returns, but the Minister has said nothing about an importer who, in all innocence, imports goods and who then finds that there is an absurd penalty fixed for the offence, and who, to add insult to injury, is told that he must reexport goods that, very possibly, may not be worth exporting at all.  What the Minister, in certain instance, is doing is convicting a person, before trial, of offences of which, very possibly, that person is not guilty at all. Now, there is a great deal to be said for the Minister's argument that 12 hours would be quite sufficient to enable the country to be flooded with a whole lot of produce that he did not intend to allow in, but between those two points of view there is surely some <i>via media</i> which can be found which will, as I say, allay our suspicions about the ghost of Jimmy Thomas, and which will give the <Col N="681" /> Minister power to deal with real infringements and cases where people deliberately infringe the provisions of the Act, and also to allow all the circumstances, in connection with an offence under this Act, to be weighed. I should be quite content to leave it to the court, having taken all the relevant circumstances into account, to fix the penalty, but the Minister seems to think that, on his own showing, there are probably offences for which 1/- would be a proper penalty to impose and other cases in which, as he mentioned himself, he would like to impose a penalty of £100. Between those two there must be some way found.  I think it was Deputy McMenamin who suggested various classes of penalties for various offences.  Certainly, I think the Minister ought to consider again how far he can meet the wishes of Deputies on this side of the House.  We do not want in any way to delay the passage of this urgent measure, but the Minister has himself acknowledged that he is seeking powers which have only been paralleled in one case, and I would appeal to him to consider how far an amendment can be made which would meet the wishes of all sides.</P>

I am putting this specific case so that he may get his mind on the matter I am putting before him.  A hardship might be inflicted in this way: a person <Col N="682" /> might place an order in Great Britain for a supply of certain goods, and before the order is executed, possibly when it is on its way here, the Minister imposes a restriction.  What is he going to do in that case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we could cover all goods bought, because we might be up against the position where something was coming in that we wanted to restrict, and if it was no great hardship on the person concerned at least to cancel part of his order, we might have to ask him to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The moment an order is given the matter is clinched and the buyer has to take delivery, or else there is a breach of contract.  Is this House going to impose on a person in that position the penalty of having to pay for the goods of which he cannot take delivery as a result of the Minister's action?  Does the Minister not see how vitally important and serious that is?  There are two classes of cases&mdash;one where the goods are in transit, and the other where they are not in transit, but have been purchased and the contract is complete.  Is the Minister going to make an order which will penalise a man in that position? Is this House going to agree to it?  I want the House to appreciate the significance of that.

I am concerned with quite a different matter here, Supposing, say, a big consignment of tomatoes comes from some continental country and we do not want to have them sold here and want them sent back because it would ruin our market if they were sold, we would not like to have to destroy them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking, Sir, on this Estimate last night when the House adjourned, and I was endeavouring to point out to the Minister and to the House that, in my opinion, there has not been any serious effort made, either by this or the previous Administration, to tackle forestry.  Now, as I pointed out last night, it is very evident from the fact that there is a carry-over of over £40,000 and an accumulation of £5,000 per annum which has not been utilised by the Forestry Department&mdash;that, in itself, is condemnatory of the activity of the Department.  I was also pointing out that the sum of £650 per annum, which is the expenditure incurred under D(1) &mdash;Grants and Advances for Afforestation Purposes&mdash;shows the absolute futility of the particular type of inducement which the Department was endeavouring to offer to people to give land for the purpose of afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the opening remarks, pointed out to us that if any person was so disposed as to give land amounting to five acres, or two persons joined together to do that, the Department was prepared to give a subsidy of £4 per acre, paid in two instalments, to these people who help them with fencing and sowing. The fact, that in the Twenty-Six Counties only £650 has been paid out <Col N="689" /> shows that that scheme has been a complete failure.  There might be some hope for a scheme of that kind if the inducements were so that this House was paying out a sum of possibly £60,000 or £100,000 per annum, because this is a very important matter and, personally, I think that some Government or some board, or some Forestry Department if we are ever going to get anywhere in forestry, would have to take a plunge in this matter.  Possibly there might be thousands lost but we will never get anywhere the way we are tackling the problem.  I think a scheme could be evolved, instead of that particular scheme of a subsidy of £4 per acre, whereby farmers and land-owners all over the country who would have five, or six, or ten acres of land that they did not really value for grazing purposes or for tillage purposes, and were prepared to give that for plenting, I think the Government Department should say to these people, &ldquo;if you give us ten acres we will plant it for you and we will pay the whole cost of it.&rdquo;  See what you would be doing in that case.  Let us examine it. In the first place the owner of the land would be forfeiting, during his life-time at least, all profits from that particular portion of the land.  The Forestry Department would be setting up all over the country a number of small plantations which would afterwards come in under the ordinary scheme of afforestation which prescribes that for every tree cut, one must be planted.  If we could get, by any means whatever, even though it cost a good deal of money, to a point at which we had a certain reasonable amount of forest cover, then, by applying the condition that for every tree cut one must be planted, we would be able to maintain it.  We will never get that by the methods we are working on at the moment.  Some people might think it a far-fetched idea that the State should say to a farmer: &ldquo;If you lend us 100 acres of land, we will plant them &ldquo;even though that land reverts to his grandchild later on, but after all, it is an asset to the State and if we cannot find some other way of dealing with the matter, we ought <Col N="690" /> to try something like that.  As I say, it might be regarded as far-fetched that the State should plant a man's land for him and then leave him in possession of the land and the plantation, but at least we would be getting somewhere and we are not getting anywhere by present methods.</P>
    <P>There are huge potentialities in forestry, and a great deal of attention has been drawn to the matter recently. I think the Minister should take the bull by the horns and set up a board, a commission or some organisation of persons who would interest themselves in forestry.  With that could be coupled, not alone the benefits which the State would derive from forestry itself, but the benefit derived from the reclamation of land in giving work&mdash; decent work and devent wages&mdash;to the unemployed.  The Minister was asked how many acres were fit for forestry, but I would not be so much concerned with the figure at all, because there is a much greater area which can be made available with a certain amount of labour, and the labour is there.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has been looking for schemes for years past, so that he might spend money in relief of unemployment and distress.  I think this is a good way out and I think that, sooner or later, it can be tackled in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mongan spoke here last night in Irish, and I suppose his speech was not followed by the majority of Deputies.  I think, however, that he accused the Minister for Lands of a very gross libel on Connemara at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  I would not say that the Minister for Lands would be deliberately guilty of a gross libel on any person or place, but I think the facts justify what Deputy Mongan said last night.  According to the report of the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis&mdash;and I am sure the Minister for Lands would not contradict the <i>Irish Press</i> report&mdash;the Minister, when questioned with regard to afforestation by some people in County Galway, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A certain district in Galway called Knockboy was planted under the old Congested Districts Board.  The scheme cost £30,000 and the scheme was a complete failure.  After 36 <Col N="691" /> years, the few trees that lived were no thicker than a man's arm.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is really time that the ghost of Knockboy was laid, and I think that Deputy Mongan went a fair way towards doing it.  He quoted, and he gave me the volume afterwards, from the annual report of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland, Volume 1. The eighth report sets out the figures expended on Knockboy, amounting in all to £8,000, and not £30,000, as the Minister said.</P>
    <P>The first time I visited Connemara, some years ago, the district was pointed out to me by a person living there as one of the great British blunders. I still think that district represents a British blunder and I still think it can grow timber.  I do not think it is fair that, at this hour of the day, the Minister and people in the Forestry Department should endeavour to perpetuate the libel on that district.  If the Minister wants proof that trees will grow, and grow well, there, let him go down and see places in which some individuals have planted trees.  I admit the positions may be more sheltered, but it is nearly half a century ago since the British Government tried that experiment, and surely we have made advances in half a century. I believe that from the scientific point of view advances have been made, and, in the matter of forestry, there are at present better ideas with regard to shelter and sheltering shrubs for the young saplings than there were 50 years ago.  As Deputy Mongan pointed out, the conditions under which this planting was carried out were entirely abnormal, and it was absolutely impossible for the trees to survive.  He pointed out, for instance, that the trees came in thousands on a steamer and were landed at a little place called Kilkevin.  At that time there were very poor roads and very few horses and carts to travel them, such as they were, in Connemara.  I believe that in all the parish there were not six horses and carts to transport the tree.  According to my information and to what Deputy Mongan said, those trees lay for weeks, and in fact <Col N="692" /> for months, before they were planted.</P>
    <P>Before a responsible Minister or any responsible officials would endeavour to pronounce judgment on a matter like that, surely they ought to inquire into it.  I have no doubt whatever that what the Minister said about it was said in perfectly good faith, but at the same time, I have no doubt, that the whole thing should be retried, or at least to some extent.  It happened in 1890, and it continued for six or seven years.  The whole report is available, and the whole expenditure is available.  There are some extraordinary figures to be found in the figures of expenditure.  For instance, in one year the expenditure on planting is shown to be £300 odd, and only a small number of trees were planted. In the following year the number of trees was about four times as great, while the cost of planting was half the previous figure.  There is something to be read between the lines.  I believe that half the trees brought there were not planted because they were ruined by exposure.  I know that district, and a good many other districts in Connemara, and I agree with what Deputy Dowdall said last night, that much of the land in Connemara and other places is more suitable for planting and growing timber than the lands of Southern France of which such a success was made.</P>
    <P>If we are going to get anywhere in this matter it must be tackled boldly. Let us not falter even at the loss of a few thousand pounds because it is better to do that if we are to make a success of it.  There is no doubt that if there was some compelling influence to force us to drain an amount of land that wants draining to-morow and make it suitable for afforestation, we would find a way. i advise the Minister to tackle this question and to tackle it by setting up some kind of board&mdash;let it be a mobile board or a commission&mdash;that will try to get to the bottom of this problem, and will try to interest local authorities and individuals in it. Only in that way, be educating the people and getting them interested, will we ever get to the position which we ought to occupy with regard to <Col N="693" /> forestry.  It is really sad to make any comparison between the forest-cover in this country and that of any other country.  It has been admitted that it would be beneficial to health, to the weather, to the State and to everybody to have the country re-afforested. That matter ought to be tackled in a way that would make it a success, if it can be done at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is supposed to be a law that when a tree is cut down it is to be replaced by a sapling.  That law is not enforced.  I should like to see a law in operation by which a person cutting down a tree would be required to replace it by two saplings.  As the law is, however, it is not observed.  Deputy Roddy, when speaking on this Vote, said that we should handle the problem ourselves and that we should not import foreigners to deal with it for us.  I think that we imported with success one foreigner on loan to this Department. During the short time he was here, he left his mark very effectively on afforestation.  In my county large tracts of land have been laid down by the Forestry Department.  The work has been an unqualified success and portion of that success is due to the work of Dr. Reinhardt.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry asked why we imported trees from abroad.  My attitude on this problem is that if we had to go to the farthest end of the world to get trees suited to this climate, it would be up to us to do so.  We should take lessons nto only from the German forests but from the manner in which problems have been dealt with the central and western America.  There they have successfully dealt with the problem of land erosion by the cultivation of undergrowth and scrub and planting when the undergrowth and scrub create a suitable holding for the forest tree.  I do not pretend to be very expert on this matter but, from observation of the work going on in County Westmeath, I propose to offer my comment and criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there are two schools of thought in the matter of forestry in these countries.  There are the Scottish school and the English <Col N="694" /> school.  The Scottish school goes in for soft woods and the English school goes in for hard woods.  It would appear that the Scottish school has had its way up to lately.  More hard wood is being grown here now and I hope that, in future, the amount will be greater than that of the other wood. Deputy Dowdall spoke about the inferiority complex amongst us in the matter of forestry as well as in other things.  It is a proved fact that Irish timber is exported in the round from here, dry-kilned in England and imported here in the form of manufactured articles.  I have it from the manager of one of these huge saw-mills in Staffordshire that Irish ash is better than any European ash, and that Irish elm and Irish beech are equal to the best products of Poland.  That being so, it is a reason why the cultivation of hard woods here should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a definite programme in planting has been in operation here since 1932.  I should like to know what cuttings have been made during that period of years and whether or not they were made for the thinning of the woods.  The Minister also spoke of saw-mills in certain areas.  I should like him to elucidate that matter for us and tell us what was done with the wood when cut-how it was utilised.  He might also tell us if these saw-mills are under the control of the forestry Department. I should like to know if, when an estate containing a considerable amount of timber is taken over, the Forestry Government takes that timber and, if they have a commercial side to their activities, does that commercial side cut the timber and sell it. Perhaps the Minister would say if any foreign firm has a monopoly of that timber or if it is put up for competition amongst the public.  These questions have arisen in my constituency and I want to put them to the Minister because we have a couple of fairly successful saw-mills in our county.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the declining number of schools participating in Arbor Day.  He ought to get into touch with his colleague, the Minister for Education, and tell him what every <Col N="695" /> schoolboy knows&mdash;that the month of April is not the month for planting trees.  Anybody reading the paper can see that the schools that have carried on Arbor Day have planted in the end of March or the month of April.  I have seen in my own county these trees planted, but they never came to anything.  I have seen them planted all over the country.  I have seen them planted in April at the new hospital in Mullingar, and they are a failure.  Everybody knows, without having expert knowledge of forestry, that November, December and January are the months for successful planting of forest trees and not the month of April, when the sap is running up the stem of the tree.  Forestry is very necessary, as we understand, from the point of view of preservation of the soil on certain heights where winds operate, but I question Deputy Dowdall's contention about the wonderful return from Forestry.  He gave us figures to show that an acre of mountain land returned 3/9 in sheep-rearing and £21 for forestry.</P>
    <P>It takes 60 years for a forest of soft wood to mature.  At that rate there would not be fabulous fortunes made. As regards the 3/9 yield from a mountainy sheep, I take it that the ordinary wool, apart from the lambs, would be represented by the 3/9.  I also take it that unless it would be on the top of Carrantuohill, an acre of mountainy land would rear at least one mountainy sheep.  Therefore my contention is that, while it may be necessary for the welfare of the nation as a whole, if we take in the cost of planting and preparation of soil and everything else, I do not imagine there is the gold mine in it that Deputy Dowdall has been advised there is.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us an idea of the working of a forestry unit.  I ask for this information because maybe in it there would be a solution to the problem as I see it.  We are told that it is only the worst land that a farmer wants to give up for forests. Very often the worst land is not able to produce forests.  Then the Department are up against the problem that they have not enough land to permit <Col N="696" /> them to go on with the work.  I understand that they want at least 300 acres within a certain radius.  They have got that in a couple of places in Westmeath, and perhaps more.  When they have planted the acreage in their possession, I wonder is it possible for them to extend their operations by planting the small pieces of land that may be available.  If a man has three or four or ten acres in the vicinity of a forest, is it possible for the forester to go out and prepare small pieces of land adjoining, and add them to the unit and care for them in the ordinary way?  This theory about millions of acres being available&mdash;</P>

      <P>Indeed it is, so far as most of the country is concerned.  There has been very effective work done in my county and I know of no work thatmen are so glad to get before forestry.  They take a deep interest in it.  It has not the drab monotony of road-making.  They like the work.  The time is unbroken and they will not go to any other work in preference. Several score of men have been employed and they are anxious when the season comes round to be employed again.  They have come to me and to other Deputies and they have got us to call on farmers who have land adjoining the area, to ask them to dispose of some of their land to the Land Commission for forestry purposes. It is healthy work, and I hope that the Land Commission will continue the work they have begun in Westmeath and that they will think well of extending it to other counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say for the House that we are all agreed on the need for a sound forestry scheme.  If we are to take this matter of forestry seriously, more money will have to be spent.  I believe we should take it seriously.  If we look back on former plantations, we will realise what a benefit they were to the country both from the point of view of shelter and of climate.  I am rather surprised that a greater effort has not been made in <Col N="697" /> the matter of planting.  The Minister told us that he has 8,500 acres planted and he intends to plant about 10,000 acres in the coming year.  I think the Minister has not taken this matter in a sufficiently serious way when he can plant only 10,000 acres in the one year. If you look at the Estimates you will find that under the sub-head dealing with cultural operations there were only 82 men employed last year and there is provision for only 85 in this year's Estimate.  I would not say that that number is sufficient for our country.  Then you come to the sub-head dealing with grants for afforestation. In the Estimates for 1933-34 there were grants to the extent of £500 given in that year, and in the current year's Estimates it is proposed to give £600.  Does the Minister seriously think we are going to go ahead under such condition?  I think the amount given in grants in 1933-34 were not at all sufficient, and now, five years after, all we have made provision for is £600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of forestry education you will find that the sub-head in 1934-35 made provision for £300, and in the present year's Estimates the amount is only £260.  How can the Minister claim that we are progressing if he does not make a better provision than that?  Surely there should be more given towards education in forestry.  There is every indication that the country needs a sound forestry scheme.  There is plenty of land available and just fancy that for forestry education we have provision made for only two scholarships totalling £260.  I think the Minister ought to devote more attention to the Forestry Department. Deputy Kennedy mentioned that the Forestry Department refused to take land under 300 acres in extent for planting purposes.  They say that any area under 300 acres is not economic. Even if it is not economic at the moment, in time to come it will be a great benefit to the country.  It may be a bit more costly at the present time, but I believe that with smaller plantations the people will derive greater benefit out of it.  I urge the Minister to give this matter further consideration.  By sticking to a minimum area of 300 acres he is certainly <Col N="698" /> not going to progress.  The Department must realise that it is a very difficult thing to find 300 acres in any county for planting purposes.  I know it would be very difficult to find 300 acres in one particular place, even in my own county.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to come along and pick out smaller areas.  He would be doing useful work in that way. I know that even in my own constituency there is a good portion of East Galway, and there are, particularly in West Galway, estates that have been offered for afforestation.  I put down questions here a few times in connection with estates that are for division in the hands of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission were waiting to see how much forestry land would be got out of that estate.  There is the French estate, which comprises about 800 or 900 acres, and at the present time 400 acres of that estate is under timber.  In a few year's time that timber will lose its commercial value.  I do not believe in leaving timber like that stand.  It may look well from the scenic point of view, but when timber is losing its commercial value it should be cut down, and the place replanted.  I have seen where a number of plantations were cut down and the land was not replanted.  I find on inquiring that the Land Commission made no order for replanting those areas.  Some of these are very small, not exceeding half-an-acre, but I hold that even where there were only 40 trees in a plantation, and these were cut down, some order should be made to replant.</P>
    <P>Last year I questioned the Minister about replanting in Connemara.  I am not going to bring in the case of Cnoc Buidhe on this occasion.  I think the Minister heard enough already about that.  I would like, however, to get some information from the Minister as to what progress has been made in the amount of land suitable for planting in Galway, and I put down a question. That was on the 25th February, 1937, Volume 65, column 1035.  The question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he has received from his inspectors a report on the suitability of Connemara <Col N="699" /> for large schemes of afforestation, and if he will state for the latest available date, the total area so far acquired for planting, together with the total amount planted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer of the Minister on that occasion was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Very considerable areas have been inspected in the Clifden and Kylemore districts, in the districts around Cashel and Rosmuck, at Seecon, south-west of Oughterard, and in the district around Costello, but none of the land so far offered for sale for afforestation has been found to be suitable for the purpose.  It is proposed to continue investigations to see whether land suitable for State forestry purposes is obtainable.  The only forest centre which it has been possible so far to establish is at Ross, on the edge of Connemara.  An area of 285 acres has been acquired here, and approximately 270 acres have been planted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On a later date I put down another question and got further information from the Minister.  I practically repeated the question that I have just read and the Minister's answer is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following lands offered for forestry purposes in Connemara have been inspected and found to be unsuitable:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  1,000 acres offered by tenants at Tiernee, Lettermore.</P>
    <P>2.  700 acres about two miles from Clifden, offered by tenants on the former Berridge estate, and 300 acres about seven miles from Clifden, at Derryvickrine, by tenants on the former estate of Richard Foreman, and a few other small areas in the same district.</P>
    <P>3.  about 1,000 acres at Kylemore, offered by the Land Commission and comprising portions of the former estate of the Benedictine-Nuns and the Talbot Clifden estate.</P>
    <P>4.  1,900 acres of the Costelloe estate at Lough Seecon.</P>
    <P>5.  3.049 acres on the O'Meara estate, between Cashel and Rosmuck.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> 6.  A very large area at Cloosh and Orid, offered by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>7.  300 acres at Athry, Recess, offered by tenants on the former Berridge estate.</P>
    <P>8.  1,000 acres at Shindilea, Maam Cross, offered by the tenant, Mr. Lyons.</P>
    <P>9.  About 400 acres at Cnoc Buidhe, Recess, offered by Mrs. Betts.</P>
    <P>The reasons for rejection were either exposure or unsuitable soil conditions or a combination of both reasons.  As the Deputy has already been informed, investigations are proceeding with a view to obtaining land suitable for acquisition for afforestation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is the answer.  Where there are 10,000 acres in Connemara available for afforestation only 270 acres are, according to the inspector's reports, fit for tree planting.  I would like to know whether the Minister is quite satisfied with the reports made by his experts who had been down there and whether these experts were aware of the difference in the climate of the countries from which they came as compared with the climate of this country?  I would like to know from the Minister if he is quite satisfied with the advance made by afforestation in Connemara?  Is he satisfied that out of 10,000 acres only 270 acres are fit for tree planting?  I have been waiting a long time to get an answer on that point from the Minister.  If that is the progress that we are going to make on this matter I think it is just as good for us not to waste any further time on it.  On the other hand if we intend to go ahead with forestry let us spend the money usefully and let us get land that is suitable.  I know Connemara well and a number of Deputies in the House know it as well as I do.  Deputy Bartley knows that in the Cloosh valley a scheme is going on at present and in the progress of that scheme the roots of trees tat grew there some years ago have been rooted up.</P>
    <P>If trees grew there then, why should <Col N="701" /> they not grow now?  There are areas close to Clifden which are exposed to the sea.  There are such areas as Ballynahinch and Ballyconneely where trees have been grown.  How did these trees grow?  I would like to urge on the Minister to consider the taking up or smaller areas for planting and make more money available for education in forestry.  He might give more money in grants to people for planting their own land.  A sum of £600 per annum is of no use in the way of tackling that question.  If he people of the country are given and inducement to plant, they will plant.  The best way to induce them to do so is to get them to plant small areas, for which they might be given a reasonable grant.  The Land Commission give money for the reclamation of land.  If the Forestry Department came along and dealt in the same way with the people as the Land Commission is doing in the matter of reclamation, a great deal of planting could be done at a very small cost.</P>

      <P>I never listened to so much unenlightened opinion since I came into the House as I have listened to in the course of the discussion on this Vote.  A great many Deputies appear to be possessed of the idea that the Minister for Lands had only to suggest: &ldquo;Let us put under forestry so many thousands of acres of land.&rdquo; and that the job would be done.  Last evening we had a speech from a great star on this Vote.  I notice that star is now absent.  However, I am chiefly concerned with the want of knowledge displayed by so many Deputies who advocated the using of certain areas of land in various parts of the country for forestry purposes.  I heard the word &ldquo;true&rdquo; from some of the Labour Deputies, but I should like them to indicate where these lands are to be found in County Cork, having regard all the time to the suitability and the adaptability of these lands.  Anybody who has any experience at all must know that the Minister for Lands is right when he says that there are many areas in this country which are not suitable for re-afforestation.  When the Land Commission begin to examine these areas, they find that the soil for <Col N="702" /> some reason or other is not suitable for plantation purposes.</P>
      <P>I have a very intimate knowledge of Cork County and portion of Kerry.  I am not a theorist.  I am not one of those people who will tell you that you can re-afforest the whole of Ireland, because I know you cannot.  I have experience of very many portions of Cork, portions of Kerry, and even portions of Clare, where I could find many areas suitable for re-afforestation, but there are many other areas in these counties which are not suitable.  The only fault I have to find with the Land Commission is that the areas which they think fit for re-afforestation are too large.  I know the areas about which I am speaking.</P>
      <P>It may happen that possibly 100 acres in a particular area are suitable for reafforestation, for the planting of young trees such as larch and other native varieties, but the planting of these 100 acres will completely exhaust the potentialities, as far as afforestation is concerned, of that area.  Persons who are engaged in horticulture will understand that some trees take a longer time to develop than others. We find common agreement on this, at any rate, that there are certain areas in which one would require, as the Department does require, to have a continuous streak of land on which you must grow trees.  For a moment, let us forget the class of trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am personally aware of some useful experiments carried out by the Department.  I know of one experiment at least that has been highly successful.  That is the scheme carried out by the Department in the Ballyhooly area of Cork.  I had some regrets in connection with that scheme because it was an area over which I had shooting rights for many years. Quite contiguous to that area was another portion of land which the Department very properly took over, but they discovered quite early that it was not suitable for the growing of trees indigenous to that part of the country.  After all, you must admit, and I think no member of the Labour Party will disagree with me, that the cobbler should stick to his last. <Col N="703" /> Every man should stick to his own job.  There are experts in the Forestry Department and they, I presume, know their job.  When the Department of Lands came to that portion of the scheme their experts said: &ldquo;These lands are not fit for reafforestation.&rdquo; I know the lands myself and I talk by the book.  I shot over these lands for 18 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>I must say that I never heard more ignorance displayed in any debate than I have heard in the debate on this Vote.  In my opinion the Minister for Lands and his officials have done the very best thing under all the circumstances. Let us face up to the facts.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the acreage for forestry contemplated by the Department. I saw plantations on two different estates 35 years ago and when they grew up they liquidated the debts on these estates.  That was a big thing in those days.  I want to pay a tribute to the Department, because it is doing its best to implement what has been talked about regarding reafforestation. I know that Deputy Dowdall does not agree with me or with anyone else in that respect, because he talked of the abysmal ignorance of the Department. He also spoke about a certain book.  We could all talk about books.  I could mention books, but some of them would not be passed by the censor.  I feel that there is room for a lot of enlightenment in matters of this kind. The Department is doing its best for reafforestation but all the time it is &ldquo;cribbed, cabined and confined&rdquo; to a certain acreage.  I do not want to cast any aspersions on officials, who are there to implement and to carry out the policy of the Department.  If the Department says that it is agreeable to plant 100 acres, 200 acres or 300 acres with trees, it will certainly be done by the officials as servants of the State. I want Deputies to understand that the fault does not lie with the officials or with the Department, but with the Minister.  If it is his policy that the work is to be done, it will be done. If the Minister declares that it is the policy of the Government and of the Department to reafforest, say, 100 acres <Col N="704" /> of land and then another 100 acres, if that could be done it would get rid of a lot of objections raised to reafforestation. There is a great deal to be said for reafforestation and for carrying out that policy in a grand way.  I believe the Minister is in entire sympathy with any move that will tend to create more employment and tend to benefit the country, and for that reason I am going to support this Vote which, I hope, will pass without any division.</P>

      <P>Before I deal with the question of reafforestation I wish to call attention to what I consider to be a very regrettable happening and to contradict statements made by my colleague from Leix-Offaly, Deputy Davin, upon a previous Vote.  Speaking in this House on the 7th April, the Deputy said that when a vote was called, on a motion regarding wages paid on reafforestation work, Deputy Finlay, Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Donnelly&mdash;how he brought Deputy <Col N="705" /> Donnelly into it I do not know&mdash;did not take part in it.  The Deputy said that these Deputies were out smoking in the hall.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin seems to excite himself about Leix-Offaly.  At the present time his excitement has been curtailed, as far as I can see, because of the disagreement about what I call the London Pact.  It appears that he was not in the running, so he wants to get some other platform.  I think I am quite justified in quoting what the Deputy said on the 7th April. The Deputy was under fire last night at the hands of the Minister for Lands.  I would not like to see my own representative under fire, but the Minister for Lands had Deputy Davin under fire last night.  This is the quotation from the Deputy's speech on April 7th.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Following that debate and the division which was taken on that occasion, in which the Minister escaped with the narrow majority of two votes, we had other interesting developments inside a short period. On that particular occasion two of my colleagues, representing the Fine Gael Party, made eloquent speeches in support of my motion to refer the Vote back, but when the division bells rang they smoked with a Fianna Fáil Deputy outside, and they prevented my motion being carried by their deliberate decision not to take part in the division.</P>

Why did not Deputy Davin and the Labour Party take advantage of their position here during the last five years to defeat the Government?  The AngloIrish war is settled now and they have to take some other line.  Last night a <Col N="707" /> division was taken on Deputy Davin's motion to refer back the Land Commission Estimate.  Deputy Davin complained that he was only beaten here on a previous occasion by two votes, but what happened last night?  The Deputy's motion was defeated by 18 votes, and there were only seven members of the Labour Party to vote for it.  Were the others in the Lobby or else having cocktails in the Restaurant?

They have done that on every issue that Fine Gael has put to the country, and we are back now to where we were in 1931.

      <P>After the enlightening shafts that we had from such an expert as Deputy Anthony, much does not remain to be said on this Estimate.  This expert regretted the abysmal ignorance of all those who had spoken earlier on the Estimates and differed widely from his colleague.  Deputy Dowdall; so much so that apparently no one dare say that anything could possibly be wrong with the Department which is dealing with forestry.  The Deputy who has just sat down gave us <Col N="709" /> forestry in abundance.  I am sure that after his eloquent peroration members of the House know as much about forestry now as will do them for the next twelve months.</P>
      <P>I agree with many of the strictures which have come from all parts of the House as to the way in which the Department of Lands is dealing with this question.  The Department, unlike the representatives of the country, does not seem to regard forestry as a question of national reconstruction, or to take it seriously.  That is eloquently borne out by the fact that we have a reduction in the Estimate at a time when those who regard this as an important national question would be expecting that the tendency would be in the other direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions have been asked by Deputy Roddy, Deputy Dowdall and others as to acreage available for forestry.  I think that, in addition, we should have information as to the amount of land that is unsuitable for division for tillage and agricultural purposes generally and the amount that the experts in the Department consider that it would be wise and useful to have planted.  I find that in the County Limerick there is one particular area there which cannot be held to be sand-swept or exposed to coastal winds and, consequently, is considered worthy of being planted by the Department.  But I was told by the late head of the Department that I should not look for forestry schemes in the County Limerick because, he said, the land there is too rich to be used for afforestation purposes.  When I made representations to have some afforestation work done in the west of the county they were turned down because it was said the land was too poor.  To use a vulgarism the Department wants jam on it.  Their attitude seems to be &ldquo;We will take land gilt-edged to produce the maximum timber in the minimum time&rdquo;, but can we afford the luxury of playing up to the fancies of those experts of the Forestry Department?  We have not available the millions of acres necessary for that purpose, so I think we should experiment and take a chance on it. <Col N="710" /> There are places in East Limerick where plenty of good timber has been grown, and the tree trunks and stumps are there as evidence of it.  The area has been visited by one of the forestry inspectors within the past couple of years.  I have gone to the trouble of getting hundreds of acres offered voluntarily by the owners, but when the expert came down he decided that the place could not grow timber.  How did the timber grow before the Department of Lands and Forestry took charge at all?  Deputy Kennedy said he should like to see more hard woods grown.  I suggest that there is room for the two schools of thought, the one which recommends soft woods and the one which recommends hard woods.</P>
    <P>I have not had very much experience of forestry, but I had sufficient evidence during the couple of years I was purchasing timber in this country that there has been grown here some of the finest resinous and non-resinous wood that could be found in any country, Montana pine, larch, Scotch fir, and spruce, apart from ash and oak and beech.  Montana pine is a pretty rare wood to have grown in this country.  I remember speaking to a representative of the firm which was cutting it down, and he said that if he was doing the same thing in his own country he would be put to jail, because there was no question of replanting.  Some of the places I have in mind are still as bare as they were when the cutting operations were finished.  In East Limerick, where hundreds of acres were offered to the Department, they have all been rejected.  It is vitally necessary that trees should be planted in those places, in order to supply shelter, and preserve and encourage agriculture in the area. Adjacent to those low-lying lands are hillsides on which there are tree trunks which serve as evidence that those places were able to grow both hard and soft woods, and still they are rejected by the Forestry Department.</P>
    <P>I think every Deputy in this House would desire to see an increase in the acreage of forestry, but how can that be achieved if the Department persists in its present attitude?  Deputy Anthony said that the Department <Col N="711" /> officials will plant as much as the Minister tells them.  I do not think I am going to accuse the Minister to that extent.  I do not think I would accuse him of being a person who says to his experts: &ldquo;You will not plant more than so and so.&rdquo;  I myself believe that a wrong line of thought has been adopted in the Department generally, and each year we do exactly the same as was done last year.  There does not seem to be any development, or any new outlook.  As I have said already, the Department seems to want a guarantee in advance that they are going to get the maximum amount of magnificent timber in the minimum number of years.  I would suggest to the Minister that if forestry is to be treated with due regard to the important place it holds in this country, there has got to be a change of outlook by the experts and by the officials generally, and by the Minister himself. It has been suggested to-night by some of the Deputies that in addition to the 300 acres we ought to be able to fit in smaller areas adjacent to that.  I myself think that we should be able to do with something less than 300 acres, provided that we can get small lots in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>I certainly would ask the Minister to make careful inquiries from his experts as to what reasons they can advance for alleging that places on which there are tree stumps, as evidence of considerable growths in the past, are not capable of growing timber at the present time.  I can produce evidence in regard to some of the places I have in mind.  Deputy Corry mentioned some of them last night, and I am sure that every Deputy can point to places in his area where a considerable amount of useful timber was grown in the past, and which are now held to be useless for forestry purposes.  I do not know whether it is the march of science which convinces us that we cannot grow timber in those places, or perhaps it is true, as expressed last night by Deputy Dowdall, that we have an inferiority complex in that regard.  The matter should be carefully looked into, and there should be a wider adoption by the Department of the general opinion held <Col N="712" /> throughout the country that forestry operations should be extended.  I trust that, by this time twelve months, instead of a reduction in those activities we will have an increase.  I am sure the Minister and his Department will have the support of all Parties in this House if they can show an expansion in the matter of forestry development, which is of considerable national importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>As this debate has been rather long drawn-out, I do not wish to detain the House very much longer, but I feel so deeply on this subject that I am forced to speak.  I quite agree with Deputy Keyes in his viewpoint that the experts of the Department seem to be rather hard and fast about the quality of the land which is suitable for growing trees.  It seems rather strange that we in this country are the exception to any race of people in Europe.  Every country in Europe seems to be increasing the acreage under forestry, while we are just marking time.  I admit that the Minister has acquired a certain amount of land in the past four or five years, but to all intents and purposes there has not been any advance from the point of view of plantation.  If wood were taking a backward place in industry, if it were being ousted by substitutes, I would say that we need not pay any serious attention to wood, but the fact of the matter is that wood is taking a very important part in industry, a more important part than it did ten or 11 years ago.  The number of articles made from wood, wood-pulp and cellulose is increasing by leaps and bounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be true to say that a large part of our dictionary at the present time is composed of the names of articles made from wood and wood substances.  That shows the importance which must be attached to the matter of forestry.  I hold that the present is the most opportune time for development.  It is opportune, in the first place, because the Government is giving very serious attention to reclamation, and you cannot isolate reclamation from forestry; the two go hand in hand.  Along the foot of the <Col N="713" /> mountains and in the marshy areas you have got to get a reclamation scheme first and a forestry scheme afterwards. For that reason I think that when the Government are undertaking reclamation they should dovetail it with forestry.  The other reason why I suggest that the time is opportune is that many of the areas which are suitable for planting coincide with the areas where there is a fair percentage of unemployed. We have almost reached the end of our tether from the point of view of making roads, drains, and so on in the line of minor relief schemes in our efforts to absorb the unemployed in the rural areas.  I suggest that the best way of absorbing the unemployed in areas which are suitable for tree planting is by a forestry scheme.  I would also suggest to the Minister that, considering the fact that it takes 30 or 40 years before trees mature, rates should not be charged on the land while it is not producing any benefit for the proprietor.  I make a very strong plea for that, because I think it is one of the factors which are telling very much against forestry schemes carried out by private individuals apart from forestry schemes carried out by the State.</P>
    <P>Again, I make a very earnest plea to the Minister that the time is opportune to migrate a number of farmers who have holdings on large stretches of land at the foot of the hills and running into bogs&mdash;perhaps not exactly bogs, but very poor areas at least&mdash; and make these large stretches of land available for forestry purposes.  I mention that point because we are now reaching the end of land division, and if you do not take this opportunity to acquire land for forestry purposes, there will be great difficulty in acquiring it in five or ten years' time on account of the legal difficulties that will arise.  I agree with Deputy Keyes that a block of 300 acres is rather large. If the Minister could agree to four or five links in a chain, so to speak, of 50 or 60 acres and then hopping over to another 50 or 60 acres, and so on, I do not see what difficulty there would be in linking them up until you reach the figure of 300 acres.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by making an <Col N="714" /> earnest plea for the planting of large tracts with forestry and also creating shelter belts in exposed townlands and along bleak and barren roads.  Some people who travel in the West and certain parts of the country know what it is to travel along a bleak, shelterless and windswept countryside, and I think that, in acquiring land, provision might be made for shelter belts along such roads.  I do not want to sit down without supporting Deputy Dowdall's plea for a forestry society.  Certainly, I must say that I have been surprised at the general lack of knowledge of forestry, and I think that the only way to arouse interest in the matter is by starting a forestry society and thus creating discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most of the Deputies who have spoken, I am not very satisfied with the progress that has been made in forestry in this country.  Having regard to the backward and denuded condition of this country, owing to the spoliation that took place at certain times in the past, without much regard to the wealth of this country, the condition of the country is very bad from the point of view of afforestation.  Another thing is that the schemes that are in operation are unsuitable for certain districts and counties where suitable schemes are most necessary.  For instance, this scheme of finding 300 acres contiguous, so to speak, simply means that in counties such as Cavan and Leitrim, where you have a large number of small farmers, there will be no planting done at all, and yet these are the very places where afforestation is most necessary.  This question has been dealt with from two angles, principally, by previous speakers: one, the advantage afforestation gives in the way of providing employment, and, secondly, the commercial value of the timber when grown, which will take a long term of from 30 to 60 years, according to the nature of the land and the class of the timber grown.  As between these two extremes, however, there are other advantages not less important&mdash;in fact. I should say, more important&mdash;and <Col N="715" /> among these are the beneficial effect on the climate of our country, the value of shelter belts, and&mdash;a not unimportant matter, in certain districts &mdash;the effect upon the scenery of the country.</P>
      <P>These are three advantages which, I am afraid, have been lost sight of, although they have been highly and deservedly praised by Deputy Anthony. I am not sure that Deputies have given full consideration to these other points. For instance, we have the greatest and the most beautiful river in the British Isles&mdash;I think it is the greatest &mdash;the Shannon.  I do not know how it stands, from the point of view of forestry, along its main shores&mdash;I think it is fairly well provided for&mdash;but I think the Minister, who I am sure is proud, as every Roscommon man is proud, of that river, would be ashamed that at the end of at least 20 years of a native Government, this river&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at it from my point of view, I think the Minister would be ashamed to bring a person from an outside country and let him see the river as it is there, because there is not a canopy over its cradle. Yet there is no doubt that that district is endowed by nature with every advantage from the point of view of scenic beauty, and would be about the most beautiful scenery in Ireland if the people had done their part the same as Nature has done hers.  The river is rising in a plateau in the midst of the mountains, above a beautiful lake &mdash;Lough Allen&mdash;and yet nothing has been done to improve this scenery, which so lends itself to improvement. Then, upon the other side of the river, there is no scenery in Ireland to surpass it, I am sure.  You have a valley there in West Cavan of about ten miles, with mountains abounding on each side, all studded with small lakes.  There are 30 or 40 lakes from the ridge of the mountain, and if there were a proper forestry scheme there, you would have some of the most beautiful scenery in <Col N="716" /> the country, which would be a great attraction for tourists.</P>
      <P>I am not pretending that it would be a great success immediately, or that you would have the maximum production of timber in the minimum of time, but having regard to the value of shelter belts and the advantages from the point of view of scenery, as well as the relief that would be given to the people who are unemployed in that district&mdash;it is a very poor district, like a Gaeltacht district&mdash;I think the Minister would be well advised to consider some scheme that would be suitable for that part of the country.  I have been referring to West Cavan but I do not want to pass over other parts of the county.  I think that the Minister should extend these schemes to West Cavan and other parts of that county, and I hope he will give careful consideration to the matters I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Before I speak on the subject of afforestation, Sir, perhaps you will allow me to say that I object strenuously to the remark made by the last speaker in referring to this country as being portion of the British Isles. I am not a bit squeamish on the matter, but I think it is time that Deputies here should refrain from referring to this country as being attached to the British Isles.  It may have been attached to the British Isles at one time, but I think that this country should now be given its proper name.</P>

      <P>Well, perhaps Deputy McGowan and Deputy Hogan wish to agree with Deputy McGovern, but I certainly object to constant references to this country as being portion of the British Isles.  I do object to this constant reference to this country as being portion of the British Isles.  Deputies to-night have been apologetic for delaying the House and the Minister in connection with this Vote.  I do not intend to take up that attitude.  I am not at all apologetic in the matter. This Vote should have been discussed <Col N="717" /> much more fully than it has been, and I think that Deputies should have taken the question of reafforestation much more seriously than they have done.  I have listened to all the speakers in this debate and I must congratulate Deputy Crowley, who made the most constructive speech, and also Deputy Keyes.  Deputy Dowdall gave a lot of information from the book he was referring to last night, which I myself have read.</P>
      <P>My feeling about the general policy of re-afforestation is that unemployment should come under this Vote, and that the moneys allocated now for unemployment, which are being squandered in some areas on useless piers and roads, should be spent on re-afforestation.  I also think that roads going where bogs have been cut away should be extended to help the re-afforestation scheme of the Government. I did hope at one time that, according as a bog was cut away, the area would be planted, and that in these bog areas, where there is most unemployment, and where money is being spent by the Office of Public Works on employment schemes, the money now being spent in some cases in a very undesirable way would be spent first of all in building roads to the bogs, and secondly, as the bogs were cut away, in having those areas enclosed and made fit for re-afforestation so that we would have a settled scheme for the relief of unemployment and, at the same time, help re-afforestation. Apparently, that scheme does not fall in with the views of the experts consulted by the Government in connection with re-afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Government expert has been described as a man who is called in to tell a Government that a thing is impossible if they do not want to do it. That is a very good definition.  A Government expert apparently came to my constituency and advised the Government that re-afforestation was not feasible in that area.  I could have shown that official or expert and the Minister or anybody else concerned a number of plantations in that area very successfully planted by certain people, some of them English people who had hunting and fishing lodges there.  I <Col N="718" /> cannot see why if trees can be grown in places like Kylemore, Camus, Screebe, Derrynea, Spiddal, and Ballynahinch, they cannot be planted successfully throughout the western Gaeltacht. I hold that if they were planted there we would get a good return for the money expended, and that the money could be far better expended on planting in that way than giving it out in doles.  There are areas there which it is stated are not able to produce trees.  I have seen trees grown there by people who are interested in their production, and I do not believe in the report of the expert sent down there, who reported back to the Minister that the place was not fit to grow trees, and I have good reasons for not believing it.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I must say that Deputy Mongáin gave a very good account of what happened in his district in a place called Knockboy.  That was the one experiment in reafforestation undertaken by the British Government, and it failed very badly.  Every expert or official sent down either by the present Government or the previous Government was handed the report made on the failure of the reafforestation scheme in Knockboy, and, when they read that report, they said to themselves: &ldquo;If that has been a failure, I am not going to put my foot in it, and I am going to report that that part of the country is not fit to grow trees.&rdquo;  What happened in the case of Knockboy?  Thousands of pounds were spent by the British Government in an experimental scheme to grow trees in the West of Ireland. The young trees when they arrived were left lying on the quay at Kilkerrin for several weeks.  Anyone who knows anything about trees knows that when young trees are exposed to salt water for two or three weeks they are no use afterwards.  Notwithstanding that, the phlegmatic, dogmatic, positive officials that we always have proceeded to plant these trees.  The fact is that the trees were all dead before they were planted.  They were a fortnight or three weeks lying at the quay at Kilkerrin exposed to salt water and other elements.  They were carted ten miles there in an ordinary horse and cart and left exposed there in frosty <Col N="719" /> weather.  When they failed to grow, we were told that trees would not grow in that district.  But, extraordinary to relate, in that same plantation apple trees have been grown since, and there is a factory there for manufacturing jam.</P>
    <P>I want to explode once and for all the fallacy started by this Knockboy scheme and to tell the Minister and anybody else concerned that this scheme, started by the British Government and destroyed by its officials, was not a failure owing to the unsuitability of the land, but was wholly due to the <Col N="720" /> incompetency of the people dealing with it.  We have heard a lot about the unsuitability of the land there, the lack of shelter and the poor soil.  Any man with ordinary intelligence who went round to see whether trees could be grown in the west, could see that the reasons we have been given by the Minister do not hold.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
