      <P>We approve of the Grant-in-Aid set out in this Supplementary Estimate, but on the occasion of its being granted it is proper to raise an analogous matter.  The Inter-Parliamentary Union is a body to which members of any democratic Parliament in the world can send representatives, and this State has <Col N="174" /> authorised the members of our Parliament to join it and to send members to it.  There is also a similar organisation which is restricted to the Parliaments of the Commonwealth of Nations to which we belong.</P>

The occasion for replacement took place at various dates depending on when members of the preventive staff were sufficiently trained to drive the original cars.  It was thought at the date when this particular service was inaugurated that the average life of cars engaged in patrolling the frontier would be 66,000 miles, but the very severe nature of the work and the bad roads &mdash; as Deputies understand they are mostly by-roads &mdash; over which they are frequently required to travel caused wear and tear, so that the necessity of renewing them has fallen earlier than was anticipated.</P>

    <P>This sum is required to meet expenditure and additional allowances and gratuities in respect of established officers under the Superannuation Act, 1909.

      <P>Would the Minister say if he is making any provision in the Estimate for pensions for unestablished service in the Civil Service?  The Minister <Col N="178" /> is, no doubt, aware that in a great many cases officers in the Civil Service have had long periods of unestablished service prior, to their establishment. The Minister has power under the existing superannuation regulations to allow such service for pension purposes. I should be glad to know if the Minister proposes to use that power in the case of the officers concerned, and whether any provision has been made in the Estimate for it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is some factor that has not yet been disclosed or explained by the Minister?  I take it that these superannuation and retiring allowances are made up each year from statistics that must, more or less, be following along well-established lines. The original Estimate in this case was £38,000 and now we have a revised Estimate of £62,000, an increase of roughly 50 per cent.  This is a matter that ought to be fairly well established according to averages.  The discrepancy between the two Estimates seems to me to be extraordinary.  I suggest to the Minister that there must be some factor that has brought about such an extraordinary difference on a question that ought to be fairly calculable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £5,950 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1938, for Rates or Contributions in lieu of Rates, etc., in respect of Government Property, and for Contributions towards Rates on Premises occupied by Representatives of external Governments.</P>
    <P>The need for this Supplementary Estimate arises out of the fact as indicated here in Part III that first of all there has been an extension of premises in the occupation of several Government Departments notably, I think, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defence and the Department of Local Government and Public Health; but, in addition, it also arises very largely by reason of the fact that an increase in the Dublin City rate took place after the Estimate had been prepared.  It will be understood that this Estimate in general is based upon the rate current at the time at which the Estimate is prepared.  The Estimate was prepared last year.  In view of the desire to bring in the Budget at an early date, the Estimate was prepared before the rates for the city had been fixed and, accordingly, when, due to numerous causes, there was an increase of 1/- in the £ in the Dublin City rates the amount provided for payments in lieu of rates was insufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say when this sum of £5,950 was disbursed because the House will observe that it was disbursed from the Contingency Fund.  A well established rule is that, in the event of disbursements from the Contingency Fund, a Supplementary Estimate to replenish the fund should be introduced at the first available moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that only applies to a case where the payment is not being made for a well established <Col N="180" /> service.  This is a service which the Dáil has already approved of in principle, and accordingly as the demands of the rate collectors were made, when it was found that we had an insufficient amount available, the sum required was taken from the Contingency Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that as a general principle it would be a very much more satisfactory arrangement if it was acknowledged to be the general practice that the Contingency Fund should not be turned to without the resolute intention of introducing the necessary Supplementary Estimate on the first available occasion, because even where the service is approved of, as in this case, the moment the rates were increased it was possible for the Government to forecast at once what the increase in the rates would involve them in.  In addition, they could have had resort to virement if it were necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at least the Government could have foreseen at once what the accumulated liability was going to be, and there would have been time to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to meet the increased charge. It is not a matter of grave consequence in regard to this particular Vote, but on principle it is a matter in which the Minister himself, particularly, ought to give good example to other Departments which may be tempted to turn to the Contingency Fund, or to ask him to permit them to turn to the Contingency Fund when in fact they ought to ask him to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in this House.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £1,504 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch <Col N="183" /> an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Costaisí Príosún, na Fundúireachta Borstal, agus coinneáil-suas na nGealt gCuirpthe a coinnítear in Ospidéil Mheabhar-Ghalar Cheanntair (17 agus 18 Vict., c. 76; 34 agus 35 Vict., c. 112, a. 6; 40 agus 41 Vict., c. 49; 47 agus 48 Vict., c. 36; 61 agus 62 Vict., c. 60; 1 Edw. VII., c. 17, a, 3; 8 Edw. VII., c. 59; agus 4 agus 5 Geo. V., c. 58).</P>
    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £1,504 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1938, for the Expenses of Prisons, the Borstal Institution, and the Maintenance of Criminal Lunatics confined in District Mental Hospitals. (17 and 18 Vict., c. 76; 34 and 35 Vict., c. 112, sec. 6; 40 and 41 Vict., c. 49; 47 and 48 Vict., c. 36; 61 and 62 Vict., c. 60; 1 Edw. VII., c. 17, sec. 3; 8 Edw. VII., c. 59; and 4 and 5 Geo. V, c. 58).</P>
    <P>This sum of £1,504 which is asked for is due to additional sums required under the following headings: victualling, £500; electric light installation, £24; manufacturing department, £1,600.  These amounts will be set off by Appropriations-in-Aid, £300 and savings on other sub-heads, £320.  The increase in victualling is due to an unexpected increase in the cost of food as compared with last year.  As to the electric light installation, provision was made in the Estimates last year for £200 to carry out certain electric lighting in the prison warders' quarters attached to Mountjoy.  A sum of £164 was expended and a sum of £24 for materials became due for payment within the financial year which was not anticipated at that time.  The increase in the manufacturing department is due to unexpectedly large orders from the Post Office and from the Army.  There were 4,000 palliasse cases for the Army and 2,200 mail bags for the Post Office.  The sum will be recouped to the prison service, but it will not come in this financial year; it will not come until after the 31st March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote covers equipment <Col N="184" /> for Borstal institutions.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the Borstal equipment of the country is not proper or adequate and that these moneys should not be voted unless and until it is made adequate.  We have a Borstal institution in this country for youths, but as yet we have no Borstal institution for young women.  The result of that is that in a considerable number of cases a district justice has a young girl brought before him and he is satisfied in his mind that that girl ought to be removed from the surroundings in which she is living at the time of the prosecution.  But she is too old to send to an industrial school and, accordingly, the district justice has no place to send her unless he sends her to prison.  He may feel that, bad as the existing surroundings are, to put her into the company of prison inmates would be even worse. He has open to him the alternative of exacting an undertaking from the girl that, if he deals with her under the Probation of Offenders Act or remands her, she will go into a certain selected home.  His difficulty is that if he deals with the case under the Probation of Offenders Act on the girl giving that undertaking, the girl can go into the home on Monday and leave it on the following Tuesday.  The district justice has no means of compelling her to carry out her undertaking to stay in the suitable place for a reasonable length of time and only too often that girl comes before him again in even more deplorable circumstances and winds up by going to jail.  If we had a suitable Borstal institution, girls so circumstanced could be put there and given some kind of training which would equip them for earning their living when they come out and they would be delivered from the very special dangers which usually wind up in disaster for girls of that type.</P>

    <P>The sum asked for arises out of what is known as the free beef scheme which was in operation a few years ago.  This Vote is intended to meet expenditure in connection with the scheme for the supply of beef to necessitous persons.  The scheme came to an end on the 31st March, 1937.  Since that date there were outstanding claims to be dealt with amounting to a total of £11,060.  The Estimates for the current year provided for an expenditure of £5,000 under this head. The Estimate set out, however, that the money would be expended by way of grants to local authorities.  The scheme was, however, continued on <Col N="187" /> lines similar to the scheme formerly operated from the Department of Agriculture, and the victuallers who supplied the beef were paid direct from my Department instead of through the local authority.  To rectify this error and to obtain authority for the expenditure incurred during the year, namely £11,060, the concurrence of the Dáil is sought to this Estimate.</P>

      <P>In regard this Estimate, I should like to know if it is intended to make provision for such an increase in the number of attendants as will enable a reasonable working week to be given to the attendants in Dundrum. The recognised working week in the ordinary mental hospitals throughout the country is, I think, 48 hours.  The Dundrum attendants work 62 hours per week and it is fairly evident, I think, that the nature of their work is objectionable and of such a character as would require as short a working week as possible.  I should like to know if these extra attendants will enable the working week in Dundrum to be shortened.</P>

It is true, as the Deputy says, that in the ordinary mental hospitals, like Grangegorman, the attendants' hours are 48 per week but in the case of mental hospitals such as Grangegorman each attendant has to look after, on the average, 7.2 to 7.4 patients.  Under the new arrangement in Dundrum the staff work will be considerably lightened because with the considerable addition which is proposed each attendant will have only two patients to look after.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister explain the proposal to publish Irish music under the Vote?  I understood that those moneys were intended for the provision of Irish texts so that pupils might have adequate texts on which to work, and that scholars might be facilitated in publishing manuscripts which it would not be an economic proposition to publish on commercial lines.  What do we mean by Irish music?  Surely we are branching out into a very much wider sphere now than the publishing of ordinary Irish texts?  Is it proposed to collect traditional airs which have hitherto been unrecorded, and set them down, or is it suggested that we are to publish slip jigs in convenient form?  I do not think really that it is proper use of public money at all to publish modern music such as is habitually played by dance bands or the like.  I think everyone would be sympathetic with a proposal to collect traditional music on the lines on which Béaloideas is working at the present time, but I have heard of no such scheme, and I did not understand the Minister to outline any such scheme in the course of his observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be glad to know also from the Minister if this money will be mainly used in the preparation of books which in his judgment are suitable for schools, or is it proposed to design something more on the lines of library books, or will the bulk of the money be used in the preparation of manuscripts which up to date have not been transcribed?  If he proposes to spend most of the money in the transcription of manuscripts, I should be glad to know from him whether he <Col N="191" /> does not think that the best way to expend money of that kind would be to make grants-in-aid, without liability to account for them, to the Royal Irish Academy.  So far as I am aware, that body is continually seeking an opportunity to publish valuable manuscripts, and valuable matter relating to the Irish language, and the historical culture of this nation, such as it is, and so far as I am aware, they are constantly embarrassed by the scarcity of money.  If we are going to spend money on this kind of work, surely disinterested persons who have been cheerfully working in this cause without any thought of reward, persons who have behind them a long tradition of unselfish service, are the best kind of people for doing work of this kind? Recently it has become the practice to delegate those functions to civil servants. I yield to none in my admiration of the zeal and energy of our civil servants, but I do not think that their particular vocation pre-eminently suits them for this kind of work.  When we have an institution such as the Royal Irish Academy there to our hand, and when we know that they are greatly harassed and handicapped through want of money, surely we would be very much wiser to pass this money over to them, and tell them to carry on the work in the same spirit in which they have been doing it for the last 150 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I should like to call the attention of the Minister.  I notice that this vote amounts to £61,000 odd.  The provision for the purchase of specimens is I think somewhere about £1,500.  That is something in the nature of 2½ per cent., so that for every £1 spent on science and art, we spend between 6d. and 9d. in the purchase of new specimens. Of course, it is undoubted that in some years there may be a dearth of specimens, and in other years quite a glut of specimens, which it would be desirable for the authorities to purchase, may come on the market.  I should like to ask the Minister if there is any restraint placed upon the museum authorities as to what sum they will spend in any given year?  It is <Col N="192" /> quite obvious that it would be very difficult to work according to the results of an average over a previous number of years if something very rare and choice came on the market.  We have recently heard of the purchase of articles which probably it would have been desirable for the National museum authorities to secure.  Of course, in many cases the museum authorities may not hear that those articles are on the market until after they are purchased.  At the same time, it does seem that £1,500 is a ridiculously small sum, and the position is still more absurd if any restraint, within narrow margins, is placed upon the sum which the authorities can spend on new specimens in each year.  If that is done, we will come to think of the museum as a place in which they have ceased adding to their store, and where they merely preserve what has been handed down to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word of appreciation of the valuable service rendered by the Gúm to Irish literature in the publications that have come from it, but I fancy that more than proportional attention is paid to the school reader &mdash; that is to the pupil. We have a flood of books for school children; that is very desirable, very useful and very valuable.  On the other hand, we have English classical literature translated into Irish, while there is no interest taken in what one might call the average run of readers.  Most people who have passed their school days are not anxious to go back and read what is prepared for the students. Everyone does not want to read classical literature.  Some of it is very dry and uninteresting, and has not very much of the human touch about it.  I am asking the Minister if he has ever considered the man who buys a magazine and reads it on the train?  Has he ever considered the man who buys a 6d. magazine, reads the short story that is in it, reads the good or bad piece of poetry that is in it, and reads the article that is in it?  Is there not a vast body of people not touched by the Department's publications?  Before now I ventured to suggest that the Minister ought to engage in the publication of a 6d. monthly magazine, which would <Col N="193" /> give the usual short stories, the usual serial or full novel, the usual piece of poetry and the usual article on current topics.  Would not that be a desirable thing?  You would get the average traveller, the average man and woman, the average boy and girl to read it, and bring the language into the ordinary life of the people.  I would like the Minister, therefore, to consider that matter in regard to the expenditure of this money.</P>

      <P>I should like to be quite clear as to what exactly is meant here by Irish music?  I cannot say that I am sufficiently versed in the Irish language to follow the Minister fully through his whole statement, but I should like to know what is meant by the preparation and publication of Irish music &mdash; whether that means the publication of existing Irish music, publications put into cheap form, of old airs and old collections of Irish music that are not easily available to the public, or whether the phrase &ldquo;Irish music&rdquo; would cover some such case as that of somebody here in Dublin composing a tune in the latest &ldquo;swing&rdquo; style, called something like &ldquo;The Moon Rising Over the Pillar?&rdquo;  Would a composition of that kind come under the heading of Irish music?  The increase in the Estimate represents a pretty substantial amount, £11,500, and I should like to be clear as to what is meant by Irish music.  Then there is the question of An Gúm.  As far as I can see, the Gúm publications do not reach the ordinary individual at all.  As Deputy Hogan says, there are the school readers and the classics.  Now, the classics published by An Gúm were books that are already well-known to people generally in the English language, and unless it were merely a matter of improving one's knowledge of the Irish language, the ordinary individual would not want to read the book over again in Irish.  I suggest that some publications in Irish that would be of interest to the general public would be of far more value than anything like that.  I would even suggest to the Minister that if he had power to compel the daily Press to put their racing tips into Irish, he would <Col N="194" /> get far more valuable results for the Irish language in three months than the Gúm has achieved so far.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Dillon must not be aware that since the Gúm, as it is called, was established, its chief function has been the publication of works of general literature in Irish.  I have here a list of these works and an account of the sales during the period up to 30th September last, and I find that 162,445 books of general literature have been sold.  In addition to that, an important function of the publications branch is the preparation and publication of text-books in Irish for the use of secondary schools, and under that heading we have sold up to the date I have mentioned 99,781 books.  So that, although much remains still to be done in securing a wider market for books published in Irish, I think the results so far have been fairly satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The number is 307. With regard to music, the intention is to publish arrangements or settings of original Irish airs as far as possible.  I dare say that if a new composer swims into our ken, who is capable of doing for native Irish music what has been done in other countries by composers like the Hungarian composers of the present day or the Russian composers of some time back, it would be a question whether such a composer would be passed as being really true to the Irish genius or whether he had forsaken the native music for modern modes: but that circumstance has not arisen.</P>

      <P>However, as things are at present, we are confined to arrangements by comparatively few composers, such as Carl Hardebeck. I think most of the work that has been published up to the present has come from him, and the public is familiar with it.  I am quite satisfied that any work that is submitted and <Col N="195" /> eventually accepted and published will be of a good standard, because we have a committee of experienced musical experts, gentlemen of high repute in this country, and submissions have to be passed by them before they can be published.  I do not know that this Estimate refers to the matter to which Deputy Dockrell referred.  It is confined strictly to the question of publications in Irish.  I am grateful to Deputy Hogan for his words of appreciation in regard to the work of An Gúm.  Nobody except a person who is closely in touch with the work, like myself, can appreciate the tremendous amount of work that the staff of that branch of the Department of Education have done in preparing manuscripts for the Press, in correcting them and going over them, and in giving advice to the authors, who are not very experienced writers and who require a good deal of assistance before their works can be passed eventually.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be feasible to publish a monthy magazine.  It would not have that freedom of expression, nor that freedom to discuss public matters and controversial subjects, if it were under Departmental control, that an independent organ would have, and therefore I do not think it would be a success.  I hope that Deputies will do what they can, as the service is an expensive one but is, nevertheless, very essential in the revival of the Irish language, to secure wider recognition for the work of An Gúm, and a better sale for the books that are published by them.</P>

I am sure that any proposals put up by the academy to the Government for <Col N="196" /> further assistance in doing the very valuable work that it was intended the academy should do for the furtherance of Irish scholarship will receive sympathetic attention, and of course I shall be only too happy to give all assistance possible if any proposals are made.</P>

      <P>In connection with any money that may be made available for the Royal Irish Academy, I suggest to the Minister that it would simplify matters immensely if the Minister would get from the Academy an outline of their plan and then leave the academy with a wide discretion for carrying that plan into operation.  I have no experience of the relations actually existing between the academy and the Government, but my experience of similar transactions is that the Department of Finance regulation require the Minister to make all sorts of stipulations and get all sorts of undertakings when it is a question of spending Government money.  Of course, we can very well understand that, ordinarily, that is the proper course to pursue, because the accounts must be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, but there are exceptional cases where the Minister concerned comes to Parliament and asks leave to hand over money to a trusted body and deliberately exempts that body from the obligation of accounting for that money in detail. Might I suggest to the Minister that he should invite the Royal Irish Academy to submit schemes to him with a view to having the required amount provided by the Department of Finance without the stipulation that every penny must be accounted for in accordance with the usual Department of Finance regulations?  I think that if he does that and gets the cooperation of the Department of Finance in coming before the House to ask for money on these terms, it will be readily forthcoming from all sides.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to press the Minister on the point I mentioned previously, but I should like to know whether he could help me on that point in connection with modern music.  I am quite serious on the matter.  The <Col N="197" /> Minister says that at present we are confined to arrangements by comparatively few composers, like Carl Hardebeck. The possibility I want to put to the Minister is that the term &ldquo;Irish music&rdquo; might be interpreted in many different forms.  It might be music by an Irish composer, or music in the Irish traditional line.  The point is that, supposing in the near future we have a composer in this country who composes popular music, not of the Irish traditional style, but rather of the modern style, any of the popular types of modern music, will the Minister say whether the works of that Irish composer would come under the head of Irish music and would be permitted for publication by An Gúm?  If the composer composed that type of popular Irish music, would it be published under this heading?</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £50,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1938, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased provision here is necessitated mainly by increased staff, a higher cost-of-living bonus, higher cost of material, extended provincial postal facilities and telephone service developments.  The specific reasons for the increases in the various sub-heads are shown in Part III of the Estimate. Roughly, the amounts assignable to the causes mentioned are, staff increases, £19,000, including increases due to telephone development; cost-of-living bonus, £29,000; increased postal facilities in the provinces, £16,000, and increased cost of materials, £7,000. Smaller items are £2,580 for the acquisition of sites, £445 for the purchase of an accounting machine and the payment of certain accounts from the 1936-37 account, and £675 for defalcations by a sub-postmaster.  Offsetting the total gross amount of £74,680 are increased Appropriations-in-Aid, £4,615 and savings on other sub-heads amounting to £20,065.  The savings are mainly due to a lower payment than anticipated having to be made from sub-heads E (1) and E (2) for the conveyance of mails by rail and road, and to the expenditure on the installation of equipment for and operating <Col N="199" /> and maintaining civil aviation, and meteorological services being less than provided.  That was £14,200.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to part of this Vote being required for the meteorological service.  In that connection I would like to afford him an opportunity to-day of explaining something which has given rise to considerable surprise.  That surprise may be due to a misunderstanding and, therefore, I would be glad if the Minister would clear up the misunderstanding now.  I understand that experts were recently employed to assist in the meteorological operations which the Minister has in mind, and these experts were brought from Germany, or from the Continent rather, while there were a number of young scientists in this country eminently suited for the position. I do not by any means take up the position that no foreigner ought to get employment in this country, or that no man, Englishman or German, ought to be able to earn his living in Ireland.  If every foreign country applied that doctrine to us there would be a queer army of people out of jobs sent back to us.  On the contrary, I would like merit to be the sole criterion in granting a position in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like positions of that kind, involving a knowledge of science, or art, or literature, to be thrown open to the whole world, and let an Englishman, American, Pole or Greek, if he is superior in scientific learning or in the particular branch of learning required for the position, get the job, if he is better than the Irish candidates, just in the same way as Irish candidates go up for positions in Great Britain, Germany, America and elsewhere, and, if they are superior, they get the job. What I do object to is the filling of positions of this kind without any preliminary test, and under those circumstances, going abroad and bringing in strangers who have given no evidence whatever of their superior ability. Therefore, I would like the Minister to tell us if it is true that, without conducting any examination or test, two gentlemen were brought from somewhere in middle Europe to fill two positions in connection with the meteorological <Col N="200" /> service in this country, and, if it is true, how can he defend it?</P>
    <P>The other matter is a matter of detail.  I see the estimate for uniform clothing comes up for review.  I am sure all Deputies have noticed the uniforms of the postmen and the telegraph messengers in this country.  All will readily recognise that the contract for supplying that clothing is very considerable and valuable, and we ought to use that great buying power in the hands of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to help in the production of some desirable product. If you notice the textile from which a postman's uniform is made, it is a hairy, disagreeable kind of cloth that you could not imagine anybody using for anything else but a postman's uniform.  Why should we not attire our postmen in a navy serge, I cannot imagine.  Such a uniform would last longer, would look better, and would provide our manufacturers of navy serges and black serges with an increased volume of output which would enable them to bring their methods of manufacture up to a higher level.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties of the woollen industry in this country is to get navy serges, black serges with a proper finish.  I think one of the reasons why that difficulty exists is because our mills cannot hope to have as great a market for that commodity as the competing English mills have.  Oddly enough, there is only one texture in which Great Britain completely wipes us off the map, and that is in the navy serge or the black serge. I do not think that either of these made in England are intrinsically superior to ours.  It is only in this matter of the finish; and the difficulty of installing machinery to get the right finish arises from the want of an adequate market.  Now, here is an opportunity to get a market at least for one mill or for several mills.  I now suggest to the Minister to consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce to know whether a change-over to navy serge would not be a useful change and a very helpful one in improving the production of that particular commodity in our woollen mills. <Col N="201" /> I am certain it would very much improve the appearance and comfort of the servants of the Post Office, and that is no small matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to item D&mdash;purchase of sites, etc., postal and telegraphs services only, £2,580. There is a note that this is due to the acquisition of new premises at Carlow and a building site in St. Andrew Street, Dublin.  I do not know what the premises at Carlow are worth, but assuming that they are worth nothing and that the whole £2,580 is paid for the site in St. Andrew Street, Dublin, I have nothing but praise for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he has purchased that site for £2,580. At the same time I would like to remind him about a previous discussion in connection with that site which I raised on these Estimates last year. I was anxious then, as St. Andrew Street is more or less a traffic artery, that the entire roadway should not be blocked up by post office vans being left outside the premises, and I was anxious that the Minister should make arrangements that provision should be made for having the post office vans taken inside and the thoroughfare left clear.  When I raised the matter last year I was told that someone else had purchased the site and was going to put up a building there and that the post office were really only tenants in the new buildings.  But they cannot be tenants if they have purchased the site.  I would like the Minister to tell the House whether proper notice has been taken of the suggestion made last year, namely, that provision should be made inside the site for the vans to come in out of the way of the through traffic.  Also, I would like some explanation as to whether the Minister has obtained that site for the sum which has been put down here.</P>

      <P>As to the question raised by Deputy Dillon, that is in respect to the meteorological officers I cannot definitely say if the statement made is correct because in the first instance I did not come armed with that type of information.  That question would be more in keeping with <Col N="202" /> the general Estimate rather than with a Supplementary Estimate, so I cannot give any definite information with respect to that.  With reference to the point raised about the uniforms there would, of course, be the question of the additional cost that may arise therefrom.  I do not know that the difference between the cost of the change would be such as to make it impossible to get ahead with that style of uniform.  However, I will undertake to have that matter explored in the Department.  With respect to Deputy Dockrell's remarks I have no doubt that in these modern times care will be taken with respect to having some kind of a well within the building in which cars will be brought in loaded and sent off again.  That area is very congested and I do not know if it will be possible, in view of the traffic problem, to have the suggestions made carried out.  The matter will be given serious consideration. The site in St. Andrew Street is, I think, the property of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

I am glad to hear from the Minister that the site has been purchased by the post office.  In this connection might I suggest to the Minister that he should set a good example to other people by setting back that site somewhat so as to add to the width of the thoroughfare.  The Minister might remember that the throughfare is between that building and St. Andrew's church and it will be possible to widen the road only by setting back the post office or the church.  I suggest to the Minister before finally making up his mind that he will consider the points I have put before him.</P>

      <P>Although this particular Estimate is confined to moneys for pensions for members of the Defence Forces, there are one or two points which I should like to make.  They may not be strictly relevant but this would appear to be a suitable opportunity to obtain an answer regarding it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  There seems to be a tremendous amount of doubt and confusion, which I consider nationally unhealthy, as to what becomes of a person's claim for an Army pension when that claim is lodged.  So far as the ordinary Deputy or the ordinary applicant can ascertain, there is no regular procedure.  Cases are not taken in the order in which they are lodged with the Department.  They do not appear to be taken according to rank.  They do not appear to be taken according to geographical units. Cases seem to be taken in the order in which, I might say, influence brings them to the top.  Within the past week, I had occasion to inquire with regard to the position of one or two applicants whose applications had been made about three years ago.  The answer I got from the Department of Defence was to the effect that the application had been received but that no information could be given as to when it was likely to be dealt with.  What the views of any of us were when that particular piece of legislation was passing through the House, does not <Col N="206" /> matter.  I opposed it and would oppose it again to-morrow.  At the same time, I stand for a person getting his full rights under the law when a measure becomes law.  It appears to me that there is some undue delay or, at least, some delay that has not been satisfactorily explained, in dealing with these claims.  I am aware that there is a recognised tribunal to deal with these applications, outside the Department of Defence, acting in the name of the old I.R.A.  That appears to be an ideal type of machinery for dealing with the claims of those who are members of that organisation but there are many people entitled to pensions and thousands of people entitled to claim pensions who are not members of that organisation.  It appears to me that these people are shoved out and that their claims are delayed in consideration because the other body is semi-officially recognised. I am not claiming to make statements of fact; I am speaking as a person who is puzzled, as a person who is meeting a great number of people who ask &ldquo;Would you do something to get my claim considered; it was lodged three or four years ago?&rdquo;  The only manner in which a Deputy can get information is by writing to the Department.  If he gets a reply from the Department to the effect that they cannot say when a claim will be considered, where on earth are we?  If we had information as to what decides priority, we should be, able to come to some judgement of our own as to when a claim would probably be considered. I suggest to the Minister that when dealing with poor people &mdash;and most of these people are poor &mdash;it is unreasonable to pass an Act in 1932 or 1933 entitling them to pensions and to state in 1938 that the Department concerned cannot say when a pension claim will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to another matter in order, if possible, to get his influence directed towards investigating it and discussing it with a colleague in the Ministry.  In connection with the moneys that unemployed people are entitled to under <Col N="207" /> the Unemployment Assistance Act, there seems to be a procedure at the labour exchanges that is very unjust to the Army pensioner.  I shall mention one case which I happened to inquire into within the past week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the case to which Deputy O'Higgins is going to allude. He has already raised one matter which does not come within the Vote and I do not think that he should now raise a matter for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible. I cannot amend regulations passed under the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced the subject by asking the Minister if he would be good enough, out of consideration for ex-Army men, to use his influence with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with this matter.  If the Minister desires to prevent me from making such an appeal to him, then the appeal will not be made but, surely, if there is one person in Dáil Eireann who is responsible for using any influence he has to ensure that fair play will be meted out to Army pensioners, it should not be inappropriate to ask the assistance of that individual.  Just to illustrate the point, which I will not develop&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a point on which the Chair has something to say.  The Deputy realises now that the first matter he mentioned does not arise on this Vote.  The procedure on Supplementary Estimates has always been that Deputies are confined to the amount in the Supplementary Estimate and the purpose for which it is required.  The Deputy now desires to go outside the Department of Defence and appeal to another Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am appealing to the head of the Department of Defence to listen for three minutes, or for one <Col N="208" /> minute, to a situation in which a pensioner of his finds himself and, after that, to do what he thinks best, or to do nothing as apparently he thinks is the best thing to do.  I will raise it no further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins has been stopped from talking about unemployment assistance, I will not talk about it.  The Deputy raised another matter which does not belong to this particular Supplementary Estimate &mdash; the whole procedure in regard to applications for military service pensions. The procedure, roughly, is that an applicant sends in his form of application which is referred to the referee. The referee and the board advising him have done their utmost to get representative committees together in the old brigades to advise and assist them.  Those local committees have given the referee, where they worked properly, lists of the personnel and the offices held on the two critical dates, and they have also given lists of people who, in their opinion, have qualifying service.  I look on it as important that we should try to clear up the really deserving cases first &mdash; the cases of people who have a clear claim to a pension. There are all told about 50,000 applications in hands and already over 5,000 have been dealt with.  The majority of those were dealt with in the last year.  It was very difficult in the first year or two to get the proper information from the various localities that would enable the referee and the board to make up their minds as to what service an applicant had and what his rank was on either of the critical dates.  Three years sounds a long time to deal with 5,000 cases, but I have indicated that the rate of dealing with them has gone up considerably in the last year, over half of the 5,000 cases having been dealt with in the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, I am sure, had some experience of the 1924 Act and will remember that it took over four years to deal with 3,000 people who finally got pensions out of a total of about 30,000 applications.  At that time, they were much nearer to the period for which the service was claimed and the board had written information <Col N="209" /> about one period of service that was necessary for qualification.  They had written documentary evidence, official records.  In this case, no such records exist and in a situation in which some time has elapsed since the service was given and written records are absent the referee has, in three years, done almost twice as much as was done in four years under the 1924 Act.  I am not satisfied; I wish to goodness we had some method by which we could clear off all these cases at once, but it is impossible to do it.  There is no mathematical rule, no fixed standard by which we can get these pensions assessed overnight.  The thing has to be centralised at some point in order that there may be a fixed standard, so far as is humanly possible, applied to the service of those who put forward claims.  That means finally that the cases have to go to the board and the referee and that prevents us from expanding the staff to deal with them much more quickly.  I have expanded the staff within the last 12 months to the point of maximum efficiency.  If we go beyond that point, we shall be getting inefficient results.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked a question as to members of the old I.R.A. and where they come in.  They come in the same as anybody else.  The cases taken first are those of people who have, on the face of their claims, made a decent case for a pension.  There are 50,000 applicants and one can see, on looking through them, that vast numbers of them did not claim even to have the service required.  They can be turned down without examination because they did not make even a <i>prima facie</i> case to entitle them to a pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not yet, but arrangements are being made to notify them. The principal work I asked the referee to do was to sort out the applications that showed a fair case for a pension and to deal with the people who were genuine applicants first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be desirable, in <Col N="210" /> the case of persons whose claims he has referred to, which on the face of them have not the service necessary, these people should be notified that their claim is not allowed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and arrangements have been made over the last six months to do that; but I do not want that, or anything else, to interfere with the work of the referee or the board in dealing with the legitimate claims.  That is one of the reasons why we cannot give a particular answer to the thousands of letters we are getting of the type to which the Deputy has alluded: &ldquo;Why cannot the Department say when a claim is likely to be heard?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I could follow the Minister, his claim was that each case fell into one of two classes &mdash;the bogus class or the genuine class. The bogus class had not been dealt with because there was nothing to deal with, but they had not yet been notified, and the other class, the genuine class, would be dealt with.  If you cut them down by half and a man happens to be in the genuine class, surely it is possible to give an estimate as to when his case will be reached?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible in an individual case to do so, but there are such numbers of that type of inquiry coming in that, if we were to go through all the work necessary to answer them in detail, the work could not go on and nothing could be done. We have to close down on the giving of detailed answers to that type of question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not.  We are making arrangements as quickly as possible to notify those who have not made a <i>prima facie</i> case for a pension.  We are going to notify them that on their papers they have not made <i>prima facie</i> cases, and that they are turned down.  As I stated before, I would like if we could deal with them all over night.  That is impossible.  Having regard to the difficulties of the situation, I think the referee and the staff have made good progress, particularly within the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a snag here that I should like to mention.  In the last Pensions Act there was a special provision that, where it was established that the statutory requirements were not complied with by the tribunal that considered claims, these people would be entitled to have their claims reopened and re-examined.  Prior to that, once the tribunal had dealt with a claim, it was not open to the claimant to make any further representations with regard to it.  I gather now from the Minister that a cursory examination has led his officers to conclude that a very substantial number of claims had no merit, and had not made even a <i>prima facie</i> case.  I want to sound a note of warning, to ensure that the Minister will insist on all statutory requirements being complied with in arriving at the conclusion that a claim had no merits.  Otherwise, assuming that he rejects categorically 10,000 claims, unless the statutory requirements are complied with, every one of these 10,000 claims can bound backwards under this section, and every one of them can produce fresh evidence.  I need hardly say that if 10,000 claims go out to the country with <Col N="212" /> a note that they have not made a <i>prima facie</i> case, and that they can come back, they will then make a very convincing <i>prima facie</i> case.  That is something to be closely watched, because very serious embarrassment might arise.  I propose to add a word to that which will not please the Minister so well.  We are engaged in distributing pensions to a percentage of 50,000 odd people.  Sooner or later this House will have to put itself this question &mdash; and we ought to set up a Government inquiry into it&mdash;&ldquo;How many citizens of this State are living on the Government?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister said that a cursory examination showed that a very large number of the claims fell because a <i>prima facie</i> case was not made out. He also mentioned that the Act of 1924 provided pensions for a number of persons who were entitled to draw them.  Two cases came under my personal observation that would have been debarred under the original Pensions Act.  These were pensioners perfectly qualified who were subsequently <Col N="214" /> granted pensions, but they would have been included amongst those not having <i>prima facie</i> cases.  I should like to know if any special effort is made to help persons who are not competent to fill up the forms?  Is there anyone to give them information necessary to substantiate their claims?  In one of the cases I refer to references were asked for.  It was quite clear to anyone who has experience of public documents that the persons concerned could not possibly give the evidence required in favour of the applicants.  They pointed out that it was a different sort of evidence was required.  In another case there was very much more than a <i>prima facie</i> case made, but the pensioner would have been refused but for assistance that was afforded him.  I want to know whether there is anyone attached to this Department to perform duties somewhat analogous to those performed by the Soldiers' Friend in the British Army, or whether any help whatever is given to applicants to aid them in getting the information required to make their case?  I am not making any case in respect of persons who would not be qualified.  I say that in the case of every person who is qualified, and who has not the means at his disposal to make it, assistance should be given to him to do so.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessitated principally on account of the payment of the bounty on fat cattle. It was found that the value of good store cattle that were being exported from this country was almost as high as the value of fat cattle on account of the operation of the subsidy given by the British Government to the feeders of cattle in Great Britain and, in order to try to maintain our position even with regard to fat cattle, it was necessary to bring in the subsidy. It is estimated that £50,000 will be required for this, and about £37,000 during the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain excesses under certain items under sub-head G.  The export of potatoes, including seed potatoes, was higher than was anticipated, and something like £15,000 will be required to cover that excess.  In the case of rabbits £25,000 was provided, but now we find that the amount required is £50,000.  Also, under sub-head G, £4,000 was provided to cover claims which were outstanding on 31st March, 1937, and not payable until the present financial year. It has been found that considerably more than £4,000 is required &mdash; perhaps about £14,000.  There was also a <Col N="216" /> slight excess on the export of fish, all of which in the aggregate mean that the original Estimate of £49,000 under sub-head G will have to be increased to £117,800.  The excess Vote under sub-head G is £68,800, and with the bounty on fat cattle the total is £105,800.  Savings under other subheads can be found to meet that and, therefore, I am only asking for a token Vote of £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And, if so, what was the rate of bounty paid on them?  There was a time, two or three years ago, when it was worth while for a man to fill a boat with potatoes in the Cooley area, collect the bounty on them and heave the potatoes overboard, go back and take out another load.  I believe that practice was overcome by refusing to pay the bounty until the customs clearance docket from Great Britain was produced.  I do not know whether that is in operation or not, but I would like to be assured by the Minister that no bounty is paid on the export of potatoes until the customs clearance docket from Great Britain is produced for his inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of bounty is 17/6 per ton on potatoes, and it is not payable until the customs receipt is produced.</P>
