      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if on the following dates, viz., 8th June, 1936; 9th November, 1936; 30th November, 1936, and 21st December, 1936, sanction was requested for the adoption by the South Cork Board of Public Assistance for certain scale salaries for certain officers who are carrying out duties of a responsible character at standards of remuneration commensurate with a subordinate position; and if he is now prepared to sanction the scale salaries adopted by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that solicitors are complaining of delays of as long as three months in the issue of maps by the Land Registry; that these delays are due to a considerable reduction in the number of draughtsmen employed in the Central Office of the Land Registry; and if he will take immediate steps to provide that all arrears will be cleared up, and that maps will be issued immediately, as heretofore, on receipt of requisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there have been complaints of delays in the issue of maps by the Land Registry.  These delays are due to the fact that an exceptional number of vacancies have arisen in the staff by the death or retirement during the last year or so.  Steps have already been taken to fill the vacancies. One appointment was made within the past week, and I anticipate that three further appointments will be made in the very near future.  I am hopeful that with these appointments the cause of complaint will rapidly disappear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention was directed to the statement of a county council elector under the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act at a meeting of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland in Galway, that he had been offered a bribe in connection with the last Seanad election; and, if so, whether, in view of the statement of the Taoiseach in the Dáil on October 26th, he invited the Attorney-General to investigate this allegation of corrupt practices in connection with the election; and if he will state what is the result of the investigation, and what further action he proposes to take in connection with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The elector referred to was invited to give the information necessary for further action, but he declined to do so, saying that the words of which he complained were used by a close personal friend, whose name he would not disclose, in the course of a jocular conversation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of writing assistants (general service) in the Civil Service who were appointed at a time when a knowledge of the Irish language was not a necessary qualification; whether these officers accepted conditions of employment which provided for an avenue of promotion to the clerical grade, and whether he is prepared to provide such an avenue for senior officers who cannot be expected to compete in examinations with their junior colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest date for which particulars are available is the 1st January, 1938, and on that date 46 writing assistants were serving who entered the Service before a knowledge of the Irish language was a necessary <Col N="381" /> qualification.  Promotion depends now as always on merit and no right to promotion has ever been recognised. The officers referred to in the question had several opportunities of obtaining promotion before limited competition was adopted as the best means of testing merit.  This method provides equality of opportunity for the whole class and I am not prepared to modify it in favour of a particular section.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether, having regard to the large number of writing assistants employed in the Service and the relatively limited opportunities at present available to them of securing promotion to the clerical grade, he would give sympathetic consideration to the question of making further outlets for them to that grade available?</P>

      <P>The position of writing assistants has already been considered very sympathetically by the Minister for Finance.  The first consideration in the Minister's mind is the general standard of the Service, and those who come in by open competition seem to be better qualified than those who come in otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the resolution referred to by the Deputy.  It was <Col N="388" /> found that owing to the relatively low price at which seed wheat was being imported in the present season, persons purchasing the wheat from importers were, in some instances, selling it to millers as home-grown wheat.  It accordingly became necessary to require all imported seed to contain a proportion of grains stained a distinctive colour so that it could not be resold as home-grown wheat.</P>
      <P>As the quantity of wheat for seed imported through the port of Limerick in previous seasons would not justify the expense of having an inspector at the port to examine consignments which might arrive there it was not included in the list of ports through which imported seed wheat would be admitted under permit.</P>
      <P>If, however, an importer is prepared to arrange for the importation through Limerick of a substantial consignment of seed wheat I will arrange to have it inspected on arrival and a permit issued when the requirements are complied with.  One importer has already been informed of this arrangement in regard to a quantity of seed which he is about to import.</P>

      <P>the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; includes any person and the legal representative of a deceased employer.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the term &ldquo;employer&rdquo; is not defined and if the Bill is to be read in conjunction with the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, it does not appear to me that the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in that Act quite fits in with the definition which &ldquo;employer&rdquo; is intended to convey in this Act.  It seems rather unusual that the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; for the purpose of this Act has been omitted and I put down this amendment, therefore, so that we could have a comprehensive definition of what &ldquo;employer&rdquo; is, because the term &ldquo;employer&rdquo; is mentioned in a later section of this Act and there is no precise definition of who &ldquo;employer&rdquo; is in the Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), page 2, to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where work to which the provisions of this Act apply is done in any establishment wholly or partly by persons who do not receive any salary or wages in respect of their work, the person carrying on such establishment shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be the employer of such persons and such persons shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be workers in the employment of such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as submitted it would appear that a person who is not getting salary or wages will not be entitled to the benefits of the Bill but, of course, we know from experience that many persons get work and do not receive salary or wages.  For instance, the papers occasionally quote for our edification a most disedifying spectacle of young persons being discharged from an industrial school and securing employment with a farmer, probably at no wages whatever, board and lodgings being provided by the farmer.  If a situation of that kind arises&mdash;and, of course, we <Col N="398" /> know it exists to-day&mdash;the position is that that person, although a worker, working for board and lodgings, but receiving no wages or salary, would be excluded from the provisions of this Bill, and it would appear that it is intended to exploit that person still further by depriving him of the benefits which this Bill would provide. That is the situation which the amendment aims at meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy again to the definition of the term &ldquo;employed&rdquo; in Section 1, which is given a very wide meaning there. There seems to be little doubt that a person who is working and receiving no wages or salary as a worker is, nevertheless, in the employment of the person who carries on the establishment. Of course, straightaway you can see it is very hard to say what benefit any such person can get from this Bill.  The payment they would receive for annual leave or public holiday leave would be nil.  Although I think it is quite clear from the definition of the term &ldquo;employed&rdquo; that such persons are included in the Bill, I do not know that it is going to make a lot of difference, if that is the point the Deputy has in mind.  I am not clear as to what point he is striking at in his amendment, but that is my answer to it.  Persons who are employed within the definition of the term &ldquo;employed&rdquo; in sub-section (1) are covered by the Bill.  A person who is employed but who gets no wages would not get much advantage from the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed the view that they were included.  I am not so sure that the definition in <Col N="399" /> Section 1 would include them in the circumstances of a case of that kind. If they are included I am quite satisfied, but I would like the Minister, since he admits he does not know the point to which I refer, to kindly undertake consideration of the matter before the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Shops Act is in existence for only a short time and we have not had very much experience of it.  The persons who would be in employment as shop workers would be in a different position from the workers whom I am seeking to have covered by this amendment.  I think the Minister will agree that there is a considerable difference in the relative standing of the persons concerned.  A shopkeeper, for instance, does not take in persons from industrial schools and employ them under the same conditions as apply to many people who are employed in agriculture.</P>

      <P>Not in relation to this Bill.

      <P>It not infrequently arises in the case of boards of health <Col N="401" /> when a vacancy occurs, say for an attendant in the institution, that the job is given to an inmate who is capable of doing the work.

      <P>I said that inmates of an institution are not employed, but if they are employed, then, to the extent that they are, this Bill covers them.  Under the Conditions of Employment Act of 1936 we had to deal with inmates engaged in certain forms of industrial work.  Certain points arose with regard to hours of work, conditions of employment, certain safety provisions, and so forth, which had to be applied to all persons, no matter whether they were under contract of service or not.  Here we are dealing only with the holidays of employees.  We are providing that persons employed under certain contracts of service would have certain rights.  Inmates, in so far as they are not employees, are not affected.  In so far as they are employees, they come under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, what happens not infrequently is that an inmate of a public institution is made, for instance, assistant porter, and given an allowance of 5/- or 10/- a week.  Whether that constitutes a contract of service for the purpose of this Bill, I do not know, but suppose it does not, the fact that the public authority could enter into that kind of arrangement with an inmate and avoid the obligation to allow that inmate to take holidays with pay, whereas if they employed an ordinary employee they would be required to <Col N="402" /> give holidays with pay, might act as an inducement to the local authority to retain the services of the inmate on this quasi contract rather than employ an outside person.  I think that would be an undesirable thing.  It is a matter the Minister can look into&mdash;I just mention it now.  Sometimes you may have an inmate doing a job and being given an allowance instead of wages.  That type of person ought to be brought specifically within the terms of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;domestic worker&rdquo; means a worker who either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is entitled under his contract of service to free lodging either in his employer's house or elsewhere, or</P>
      <P>(b)  does work of a personal or domestic character in or about the dwelling-house of his employer;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;five-day worker&rdquo; means a worker who under his contract of service normally works for five days only in a week;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;non-working day&rdquo; means in relation to a five-day worker a day on which such worker does not under his contract of service normally work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> (3)  The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order declare that any particular class (defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Minister thinks proper) of employed persons shall be an excluded class for the purposes of this section, and whenever any such order is made then so long as such order is in force, the class of employed persons to which such order relates shall be an excluded class for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may revoke or amend any order made under this section (including this sub-section).</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), page 4, line 5, before the word &ldquo;lodging&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;board and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In Section 2 the expression &ldquo;domestic worker&rdquo; means a worker who is entitled, under contract of service, to free lodging in his employer's house or elsewhere.  It refers to a person doing certain work of a personal or domestic character.  As it stands, the section will extend the category of domestic workers, in my opinion.  For instance, if a workman has a cottage free from his employer under his contract of service, he becomes a domestic worker for the purpose of this section.  The person might not be a domestic worker at all, but the fact that he occupies a free cottage on his employer's land is capable, in my opinion, of making him a domestic worker under this section.  I hardly think that that is the intention of the Minister.  It looks as if once you put an employee into the cottage you make him a domestic employee, and as such he is not entitled to holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that as domestics they are entitled to 14 days, but the Minister knows that under other sections of the Bill you cannot get the 14 days unless you are in almost constant employment.  I think the omission of the words &ldquo;board and&rdquo; in this section is going to enable a lot of people to be described as domestic workers who are not, in fact, domestic <Col N="404" /> workers.  There can be no purpose in drawing the section as it is unless it is intended to enable persons to be described as domestic workers merely because they are living in their employer's house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has fully appreciated what the effect of his amendment would mean. For the purpose of framing the administration of this Bill we have divided the workers into two classes and to these two classes we applied the terms domestic and non-domestic workers. That is purely for the purpose of clarification and not for the purpose of any special distinction except that we are to distinguish between the two classes by a reference to the conditions under which they were employed.  The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to provide that the worker, who was employed under conditions that secured for him lodgings only, would not get compensation in respect of that particular lodging during his holidays.  As the Bill stands the worker who gets board and lodgings or lodgings only is entitled to compensation of a sort in respect of that board and lodging during the holiday period.  If the Deputy's amendment went in, only the worker who got board and lodging would be entitled to get compensation.  We must take it that the board and lodgings provided by the employer were taken into account when the wages, which the worker was to get, were fixed.  The worker's wages were fixed lower because of that compensation paid.  The Deputy's amendment is to restrict the payment of that compensation only in the case of the worker who gets board and lodgings and to exclude from the benefit of the compensation the workers who get lodging only. There is also the further problem that the workers whose conditions of employment secure for them board and lodgings or lodgings in the house of their employer might find it a great source of loss and personal inconvenience to leave the employer's residence for the holiday period.  It might happen that that would be something that they would not wish to do. Consequently, we have made special provision for workers in that category. <Col N="405" /> The inclusion of the terms board and lodging would restrict the compensation to a narrow class.  I think the benefits of the clause should be extended to that class whether or not they get board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister has not adverted to the case of the man who is normally entitled to holidays and is described as a domestic worker because he has free lodgings.  That free lodgings may mean the tenancy of his employer's house and it may mean that as a domestic worker he is not entitled to holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy should deal with the problem which I mentioned.  First of all can you, in every case, insist on that man taking his holidays and put him out of his lodgings; and if you do put him out of his lodgings must you compensate him for the loss?  Those lodgings were taken into account when his wages were fixed.  The term is a term applied to two classes of workers but 95 per cent. of those whom the Deputy has in mind will, in fact, be domestic workers. The problem in relation to all these workers who have these conditions of employment is the same, namely provision for the special circumstances in which lodgings are provided in order to ensure that compensation is to be paid if the lodgings are to be given up. This section is to provide an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I am afraid that the Minister has not adverted to the situation that arises where a person is a tenant of a residence in a cottage owned by his employer.  The mere residence in that cottage where a person pays no rent makes that person a domestic worker.  A domestic worker is entitled to no holidays.  The Bill ought to ensure that mere residence in a cottage owned by an employer does not deprive the person of his right to public holidays to which as a non-domestic worker he is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy means by a holiday is that the worker must not be allowed to work on that day.  Here are workers who get payment <Col N="406" /> in two forms, partly wages and partly free lodgings in dealing with these workers we must make special provisions.  We cannot say that on St. Patrick's Day they will not be allowed to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the Minister say that arises?  I ask the Minister to remember that the whole family is living in that cottage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In 99 cases out of 100 the lodging is in the dwellinghouse of the employer.  It would be unreasonable to think that the employer would give a week's holiday to a person living in his own residence.  That would be asking an undue concession.  We have to make precisely the same conditions for the class of workers under the Shops Act.  The same consideration arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have submitted the amendment if this section limited the contract to free lodgings in the employer's house.  I can appreciate the conditions with which the Minister was confronted.  Then the word &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; arises.  It seems to me that if the employer provides the worker with accommodation on his land, the providing of that accommodation makes the worker a domestic worker for the purpose of the section. Is it not possible for the Minister to meet the case I have put to him namely, not to provide that the occupation of a cottage on his employer's land or elsewhere will make the person a domestic worker for the purpose of the Act?  I am with the Minister on the point that you cannot give a person holidays while he is in his employer's residence and walking about the place, asking somebody to get him his breakfast.  I can quite understand that point.  But the Minister is going much further when he says &ldquo;elsewhere.&rdquo; What I want to ensure is that mere occupation of a cottage on the employer's land will not make the person a domestic worker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the disadvantage? The Deputy has misread the Bill.  The employer is entitled to give days of annual leave in lieu of public holidays.  As far as public holidays <Col N="407" /> are concerned, there is no difference between the domestic worker and the non-domestic worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a harder qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but the Bill deals with the circumstances of the two cases we are considering. We have to deal in the Bill with the general type of worker we have in mind.  So far as public holidays are concerned, this Bill does not give a right to a holiday on a public holiday to anyone.  It provides that an employer can substitute an additional day's annual leave for any worker whom he desires to have working for him on a public holiday, other than industrial workers, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easier to qualify for the public holiday under the Bill, and, consequently, once you qualify, you can get the substitute leave, but you are depriving the person of qualifying for a public holiday under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say so.  I should say that, having regard to the circumstance that free lodging is provided, the longer qualifying period is necessary, and it will probably work out quite fairly.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (3), page 4, to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) A worker to whom the provisions of this Act apply who normally does work for two or more employers shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act and of the Act of 1936 to have completed eighteen hundred hours or such other number of hours as is mentioned in either of these Acts for the purpose of determining his title to annual leave if in any prescribed period the total number of hours during which he has worked for all such employers amount in the aggregate to eighteen hundred or such other number of hours as aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> This amendment was put down to deal with a situation which may arise under the Bill.  It is necessary, in order to qualify for holidays, to have 1,800 hours' work, and a situation may arise in which a person may be employed by one employer for 1,000 hours, and by another for 800 hours.  By reason of the fact that he has not rendered the 1,800 hours' service to one employer, although he is working as long as any other worker who is entitled to holidays, he may not, in fact, be entitled to holidays under the Bill.  I agree that it is quite a difficult situation to meet, and I put this amendment in for the purpose of having the matter discussed here in the hope that the Minister, with the aid of his draftsman, can devise an amendment to meet such a situation.  You have the case of workers employed in part-time employment and working a certain number of hours for one employer and a certain number of hours for another.  They might be in regular employment with both employers and so employed for a long period of years, but it does not appear to me that they can get holidays because they do not qualify in respect of one employer in particular, and there is no means by which they can aggregate their total service for the purpose of qualifying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem which the Deputy has in mind arose early in the preparation of the measure, but no satisfactory solution has been thought of, and I doubt very much if a satisfactory solution is possible at all.  It would, in my opinion, be impossible to act on the proposal in the amendment for the simple reason that nobody will say who would pay in the circumstances contemplated.  In the case of a worker who works for a number of different employers during the week&mdash; a charwoman, for instance, who works for a different employer every day of the week&mdash;it would be unreasonable to expect any one employer to pay for holidays.  The position is, and, I am afraid, must remain, that unless a worker qualifies in respect of a single employer, he cannot get holidays at all. If there is any other solution which Deputies can suggest which is practicable, <Col N="410" /> I am prepared to consider it, but I think they will have difficulty in devising one.  The matter was the subject of prolonged consideration, and I came to the conclusion that there was no other solution of the problem possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The State, by the absence of the provision of the kind I have endeavoured to make in my amendment, will be able to evade its responsibilities to quite a large number of its employees.  The State employs, I think, 1,100 persons who are described as allowance deliverers in the Post Office who work not more than 18 hours per week.  That represents 900 hours in 50 weeks.  These persons may be employed for another 900 hours by an outside employer and they would qualify for holidays under the Bill, if their two periods of service were aggregated; but if they are not allowed to calculate their two periods of service, they get no holidays, and the State, which ought to be setting good example in a matter of this kind, will be in the position of employing a very large number of persons and giving them no holidays whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a difficulty all right, but it is not the same kind of difficulty as that I have just mentioned.  Many of the persons I have referred to have been employed by the State for 20 years and will be probably continued in the employment of the State for another ten or 20 years.  There is no question of interchangeability of employer so far as the State is concerned.  They have long periods of service and are likely to have long periods of service in the future.  There is a very difficult situation to be met and something should be done in cases of that kind to ensure that the State, at all events, would pay its proportion of its liability.  They are not casual employees.  The Post Office could tell you that they have some of them in employment for 20 years and hope to keep them for another 20 years.  It ought to be possible to deal with such a situation and to put on the State the obligation of paying some proportion in respect of its employees. It could be done, I think, by a provision which would ensure that entitlement to <i>pro rata</i> holidays would be guaranteed or recognised in the cases of persons who had a certain minimum period of service with an employer, but it is quite unfair that a private employer must give 14 days' holidays to a worker if he employs him for 1,800 hours, and that the State can employ him for half that period and pay nothing.</P>

      <P>That is a great hardship too, but there is much more interchangeability of employer on the docks than in the case I have quoted, and the Minister does not answer the case I have made by quoting the dock labourers.  Here is a case where the State employs a substantial number of persons for 900 hours per year.  It has been doing that since 1900, and many of these people have 20 or 30 years' service and will have more.  It is easy to recognise them as normal employees of the State.  No private employer employs part-time workers on the scale on which the State employs them.  The State resorts to a disgraceful scale and appears to be hopelessly incompetent in dealing with the situation.  We have got a position, therefore, where you have regular part-time employees in the service of the State, and I think it ought to be possible for the Minister to devise an amendment to this Bill whereby such employees would get a <i>pro rata</i> period of holidays in respect of their part-time employment with the State.  If they can produce evidence of continuity of part-time employment with an outside employer, let them also get from that employer whatever they are entitled to, but the State ought not to be allowed to get away with circumstances under which the State may be able to ride away from its responsibilities in connection with a person in such circumstances as I have described.  I recognise, of course, that there is difficulty in this connection, but I hold that that difficulty is not insurmountable, and I should like the Minister to undertake to examine the matter with a view to devising an amendment to meet the situation between this and the next stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The matter has been very carefully examined, but I do not think there is any practical solution of the difficulty.  If the Deputy thinks he can devise a solution, I should be glad to have him try his hand at it.  There is provision for reducing the period by <Col N="413" /> order if a case can be made for it, but I doubt very much if any reduction, which could be seriously contemplated, could be made for the person working 1,800 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a safety valve in connection with the matter in sub-section (3) of Section 10, which says that the Minister may make regulations varying in respect of all or any particular class or classes of non-domestic workers, all or any of the periods of 1,800 hours, 300 hours or 150 hours mentioned in sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 10 by substituting for such period or periods either such other number of hours or such number of days as the Minister thinks proper.

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the reason he gave for that section in the Conditions of Employment Bill, which was that you might be up against a situation whereby the working week might fall below 48 hours or 44 hours to 40 hours, and therefore the qualifying period for holidays is an inordinately high standard for people to attain if the working week is 40 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

I see the difficulty in the case of a private employer, but that is no reason why the State should not grant the worker some holidays in respect of the work he does for the State.  In effect, it means that the State will pocket what the man is entitled to.  I am only trying to meet <Col N="415" /> the normal situation.  I am not trying to deal with an extraordinary situation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sub-section enables the Minister to declare that any class of employed persons shall be excluded from the provisions of the Act.  That means that persons now normally entitled under the Act to holidays and annual leave may be deprived of these rights by an order of the Minister.  We have got to bear in mind that in certain respects this Bill replaces certain provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act of 1936, and if a particular class of persons is excluded from this Bill that class will be also excluded from the provisions of the 1936 Act.  I do not think that the Minister should have this power, and the Minister has not been very consistent or, I think, wise in the use of powers which have been given to him under similar legislation. <Col N="416" /> For instance, he had powers under the Shops Hours and Trading Act to make orders and to revoke orders, and we all know the vacillating way in which these powers were used by the Minister recently.  It was intended that there should not be Sunday trading, but there was an agitation over the matter just before the election and the Minister availed of his powers under the section to revoke the prohibition on Sunday trading.  Then we have had another example in respect of the portion of the Act relating to holidays, where the Minister made another order effectively weakening the position of workers in respect of weekly half-holidays.</P>
    <P>If we intend, as a general principle, to give workers the rights enshrined in the positive sections of this Bill, I think it is quite unfair to give the Minister power to revoke, not merely sections of this Bill, but of the previous Bill enacted in 1936.  He ought not to be given powers of that kind, which might be used in a way, such as that in which they were used in connection with the Hours of Trading Act, that would inflict hardship on workers.  It was intended to have prohibition on Sunday trading, and yet we have the Minister making an order permitting Sunday trading&mdash;and all done hurriedly and excitedly just in advance of an election.  It is actions of that kind that raise questions as to the propriety of giving the Minister authority to use those powers in such a capricious manner, and I want in those two amendments to deprive the Minister of those powers, because I think the rights in the legislation should stand, and should not be changeable by the Minister as they may be if there is another agitation. We may, for instance, be confronted with a situation such as that envisaged by Deputy Gorey on the Second Stage, when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why give holidays to a domestic servant employed by a farmer's wife when the farmer's wife cannot get holidays?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That point of view may develop, and it may generate into a storm.  We may find that, although it is the intention of the Bill to give holidays to domestic <Col N="417" /> servants, an agitation may develop, and the Minister elected by popular franchise, conscious of a possible loss of popularity, may be driven into a position in which he will use the power in this particular section to revoke the general intention of the Legislature to provide holidays for persons of that kind.  The Minister is in a stronger position if he has not those powers. He can tell all the folk who generate those agitations that he has no power in the matter, that the Oireachtas passed legislation, and there it is.  If those people knew that the Minister had no power of that kind they would realise that there is no purpose in generating such an agitation in the hope of getting the Minister on the run in this instance as they were able to get him on the run in the case of the hours of Sunday trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy chose a very good illustration. So far as the Shop Hours Act is concerned, I think we tried to move too fast in the matter of restricting Sunday trade.  The Deputy is entirely wrong in suggesting that the conditions of employment of shop assistants were affected by the amendment of the provisions of that Act which the order made.  The hours of work of shop assistants were restricted by another Act which has not been amended.  I have no very strong recollection of any violent demand from members of the Labour Party for revocation of that order during the election.  On the contrary many members of the Labour Party were canvassing votes on the grounds that the Government were introducing legislation contrary to the workers' interests.  That applies not merely to the Labour Party but to every Party in the House other than the Government Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the example which the Deputy has given is a very strong argument in favour of the creation of safety valves of this kind in respect of this type of legislation, which is new legislation, the full effects of which we cannot appreciate <Col N="418" /> in advance.  We had a safety valve. When we found we had gone too fast we were able to go back, reconsider the position, and then move more cautiously.  I think we should have the same power here.  I want to suggest to the Deputy that there may be cases where the use of this power would be of benefit to the workers.  We have had cases in the past where the workers could contend that the existing privileges which they enjoyed would be interfered with by the Bill, and who could ask on that account to be exempted from the Bill.  If such a case did arise we should have power to deal with it.  It is true that any Minister administering this Bill would have to take into account and act in accordance with the intentions of the Legislature in passing it.  Clearly if the Dáil passes this Bill, and it becomes law, it is the intention of the Legislature that all workers of the classes covered by the Bill are to get annual leave, that is seven days' annual leave plus public holidays, or in the alternative 14 days' annual leave. That is what the Bill provides for, and the powers conferred by this section can only be operated where it is more in the interests of the workers affected that they should be excluded from the Bill than otherwise, although there may be special types of employment which cannot be easily defined and in respect of which those powers would also have to be used for exclusion purposes, such as the worker one hears of occasionally who is employed say at an annual fee of £1 to do certain minor duties of one kind or another, which might involve a couple of hours' work in the week or in a month.  That type of employment might arise, and some exclusion may be necessary in respect of it, although it would be clearly impossible more minutely to define those workers by class.</P>

      <P>I am merely justifying this section on the grounds that it is necessary to have a safety valve.  If we can devise safety measures now and put them into the Bill I say we should do it, but we have to recognise&mdash;and <Col N="419" /> experience justifies us in assuming&mdash; that cases will arise which have not been foreseen, and in respect of which those powers may have to be exercised. If we can foresee the difficulties now and safeguard against those difficulties by positive provisions in the Bill we should do it, but although we spent a very long time on this Bill and tried to make it as watertight as possible, I <Col N="420" /> am satisfied that experience will show that the powers in this sub-section will have to be availed of in some cases, generally in the interests of the classes of workers who will find that existing privileges may be jeopardised if they were not excluded from the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section a worker is defined as &ldquo; a person of the age of 14 years or upwards who is employed other than,&rdquo; and then you have a series of exceptions extending from paragraph (a) to paragraph (o). But it appears to me that after one has allowed for all these exceptions the apprentice in a country shop may be included.  I want to know if it is intended to include him here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because he is specifically excluded from the Conditions of <Col N="421" /> Employment Act as not being a person in receipt of wages.  I raised that point with the Minister on the Conditions of Employment Act and it was agreed that an apprentice, resident in the house of his employer who was receiving board, lodging and perquisites but no wages, was not a worker within the terms of the Conditions of Employment Act because he was not in receipt of wages.  He is, therefore, not saved by paragraph (c) and I want to know if it is intended to include him?  If it is intended to include him, is he to be included as a worker or as a domestic worker&mdash; because paragraph (a) says&mdash;and there is obviously a mistake here because there are two paragraphs (a) in sub-section (1)&mdash;that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression `domestic worker' means a worker who either is entitled under his contract of service to free lodging either at an employer's house or elsewhere, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that an apprentice living in would be a domestic worker. We ought to clear our minds whether it is intended so to describe him or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on the Deputy's point.  The Deputy's point is whether a person who is a member of the staff, a worker who is not receiving wages, is within the scope of the Bill.  I refer the Deputy to the terms of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act in which the expression &ldquo;member of the staff&rdquo; is defined.  The same terms are used in this Bill.  The term, as defined in the Act means&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;when used in relation to a shop, any person who does for the proprietor of such shop, any work which is wholly or mainly performed within or in the precincts of such shops, and is wholly or mainly in connection with the serving of customers, the receipt of orders or the dispatch of goods.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is not industrial work.  Then, in the middle of it, it is clearly stated&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;whether he does or does not receive wages for his services.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no ambiguity whatever <Col N="422" /> about the scope of the term.  If he is a member of the staff of the shop he is excluded from the Bill.</P>

We have not automatically covered other forms of mining which are not being carried on but which may be carried on at some future date.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>I think the section which deals with the five-day worker is the one blemish in this Bill.  It is certainly the one serious blemish in the Bill, because although this Bill is introduced for the purpose of providing holidays and allowances in lieu of holidays for certain classes of workers, when it comes to the five-day worker, the Bill is definitely reactionary when compared to the present position.  The rights of the five-day workers are more definitely acknowledged, and more generously satisfied under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, than they will be when this Bill passes.  The section dealing with the five-day worker is a very definite effort on the part of the State to take away from him rights which he has at present under the 1936 Conditions of Employment Act.  The section deals, of course, with the five-day industrial workers.  He is brought into this Bill, which generally deals with non-industrial workers, only for the purpose of depriving him of a right which he has at present.  The section provides that where a public holiday falls on the off-day for such workers, it shall not be regarded as a public holiday for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how this provision will operate in practice.  Take the case of railway shop-workers.  They work a five-day week commencing, let us say, on Tuesday.  Easter Monday, Whit <Col N="428" /> Monday and the first Monday in August will not be public holidays for them if this Bill passes in its present form.  Consequently, they will get no payment for Easter Monday, Whit Monday or the first Monday in August, although under our present legislation, passed less than two years ago, they are entitled to payment for these public holidays.  The effect of this section will be that in future such workers will not be paid for these public holidays, and will not be entitled to days in lieu of them.  I cannot understand what induced the Minister to include this section in the Bill unless he wants to indicate that, if you are going to have industrial workers on the basis of a five-day week, he is not going to give his imprimatur to that, and is going to impose hardship on the five-day week workers which were not imposed under the 1936 Act.  If, for instance, trades unions, on the one hand, and employers, on the other, make an agreement by which the working week is spread over five days it has been the practice when a bank holiday fell in the week in which the worker was off&mdash;when it fell on the sixth day &mdash;for the worker to be paid, or to get a day in lieu of that day.  That has been the accepted position up to now. Why should we not allow that position to continue?</P>
    <P>The State is not generous in the provision which it makes for holidays. Under the 1936 Act, the worker has only a legal right to six days' holidays, and to six days in lieu of public holidays.  That is not very generous provision for workers, considering that other people in the State get holidays in excess of that number.  The holidays for workers are low enough at present.  They are at the minimum, and we should not have this invasion of the rights which five-day industrial workers have had under the 1936 Act. I do not know whether any representations have been made to the Minister by employers to do this.  If so, I think the Minister has been unduly sympathetic in listening to that kind of representation.  He surely ought not to deprive industrial workers who work a five-day week of the rights <Col N="429" /> which they have at present and which enable them to get the advantage which accrues to them, due to the particular manner in which their working week is spread over.  I hope the Minister will not press this section: that he will recognise that to do so would be to weaken the provisions of the 1936 Act.  In my opinion, he should not insert Section 7 in this Bill.  I hope that on reconsideration of the matter he will indicate that he does not propose to insist on the insertion of this section.  Frankly, the purpose of it is to take away a right which the five-day worker has at present. That, so far as I see, is the only purpose of amending the 1936 Act&mdash;to invade the existing rights which these workers enjoy and to worsen their position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter on which the Deputy should not be too dogmatic.  There is, at least, very grave doubt as to whether, under the 1936 Act, any five-day week worker, or anyone who works less than the normal working week, is entitled to payment in respect of a public holiday which falls on a non-working day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But they have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite possible, but whether, in fact, the law clearly gives them that right to payment is a question of doubt.  Now, we are dealing here with a revision of the corresponding sections of the law in the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, which deal with public holidays and annual leave.  These sections are being repealed and re-enacted here with such amendments as experience has shown to be necessary in order to give full effect to the intentions of the 1936 Act.  What was the intention of the 1936 Act?  Prior to its enactment a very large number of workers in this country suffered a loss of wages by reason of the fact that a public holiday occurred in certain weeks of the year.  In a week in which a public holiday occurred, they got less in wages than they got in an ordinary week, and it was felt to be undesirable <Col N="430" /> to allow that position to continue. Therefore, the Act of 1936 provided that when a public holiday occurred, workers, who in consequence of the fact that the day was a holiday did not work, got, in respect of that week, a full week's pay.  That is what the Act was intended to provide, and it may be that the Act did in fact provide that even though full advertence was not given to the unusual position of workers who worked less than six days in a week normally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the worker who works a five-day week is not affected by the fact that a public holiday occurs if the public holiday falls upon the sixth day upon which he does not work.  He has not lost anything by the fact that it was a public holiday.  He has got the amount of wages which he would have got if the public holiday had not occurred at all.  Therefore, the five-day week worker was in precisely the same position as the 1936 Act put the six-day week worker.  I am dealing now with workers working a full working week.  There may be a special case to be made for workers who are temporarily on short time, and I do not want to confuse the issue by reference to their circumstances.  The Deputy referred to railway-shopmen&mdash;the Inchicore workers.  Their position is that they are working less than the normal working week by reason of the scarcity of work.  That position occurs periodically in various industries where short time has to be worked for one cause or another.  Some case could be made for a special provision in relation to these workers, but where it is the normal practice to work less than six days in the week&mdash;say five days or even four days&mdash;and where the worker gets for the four or five days' work his full week's wages, then that worker is clearly not entitled to get further payment in respect of public holidays when the public holiday falls on a non-working day.  Otherwise, you would be putting him in a better position than that of other workers covered by the Bill.  In the case of the six-day week worker, in the week in which a public holiday occurs he gets his six days' pay.  The Deputy's interpretation of the 1936 Act seems to be that the five-day week worker in a week in <Col N="431" /> which a public holiday occurs should get his full week's wages plus a day's pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is leaving out a very important consideration there, namely, that the six-day week worker gets his full week's pay for the five days worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said his full week's pay, but he has only worked five days that week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit that.  The intention was to ensure that the public holiday should not mean a loss of earnings to the workers.  We are providing for that, even though we are legislating to ensure that the five-day week worker does not get additional payment in respect of a public holiday falling on a non-working day.  I submit for the consideration of Labour Deputies certain considerations which might be kept in mind in this regard. I do not know to what extent they regard the institution of a five-day week desirable.  If they do regard it as desirable, it is obviously not wise to make it unprofitable for employers to resort to a five-day week.  Clearly, when we instituted a 44-hour week in particular industries and prescribed by order in 1936, that the maximum number of hours would be 44, it was open to an employer to work 44 hours, either by means of a five-day week, or a six-day week.  He could have a shorter working day for six days, or a longer working day for five days.  There are many who think that the five-day is the better one.  If we adopt.  Deputy Norton's suggestion in the amendment, we are putting an employer in the position that if he decides to work five days instead of six days, he is going to have to pay an extra day's pay upon every occasion that a public holiday falls upon a non-working day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But no more than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  It has to be recognised in practice that the situation does not often arise.  In the ordinary way workers are employed six <Col N="432" /> days in the week, but the sixth day is Saturday, and it is rarely that a public holiday falls on a Saturday.  There are only one or two of the public holidays movable, and they only fall on Saturday once in seven years.  The problem is not as serious as was suggested. Many of the public holidays are fixed for Mondays, and would not affect the position of a great majority of the workers.  Some holidays, like St. Patrick's Day, fall on different days of the week, and once in seven years would fall on Saturday.  Therefore, workers working from Monday to Friday would be only affected once in seven years.  There arises for consideration the question whether one class of workers working ordinarily five days are in a better position than those working six days.  I am prepared to admit that there are special considerations which apply in the case of workers temporarily on short time. That is a special problem.  In the case of workers getting a full week's wages, I do not think they can complain if they get a full week's wages in the case of any day a public holiday falls on a non-working day.  These are considerations that arise here.  If the possibility arose, and was fully adverted to when the 1936 Act was framed, I think no one would have questioned the equity of making special provision for five-day workers.  The only point Deputy Norton questioned was that, in so far as the employers have interpreted it as putting them under an obligation to pay for public holidays, they have paid, and that we are taking from these workers something which they got.  When we come to revise the Act, and revert to the fact that there is an obligation to pay these workers, which might easily be removed by a decision of the courts, it is better to set out what we designed to do.  We designed to ensure this, and no more, that workers would not lose money any week in which a public holiday occurs by reason of the fact that they had not worked.</P>

This is the appropriate time for dealing with clauses in the Act concerning public holidays and annual leave.  We are now re-enacting these clauses with certain amendments, and clearing up difficulties which have been discovered.  We may have to come here with another Bill to remedy the other parts of that measure.  Deputies will note that most of the defects remedied are defects which operated to the detriment of the workers concerned. In this particular case it is of no advantage to the workers to give them the right to something it was not intended they should get, as in that way it might be an illusion.  I submit that Deputies should approach this matter, not in the way that Deputy Norton has approached it, that here is something workers got by accident, and that we should not take it. Deputies should approach it on the grounds, whether, having regard to the general intentions of the measure, the limited benefit conferred on a section of workers should be continued and they should get better treatment than others.</P>

      <P>In 1936 the Minister laid down the specific grounds on which holidays would be given, 1,800 hours being the basis for a 48-hour week.  The Minister cannot suggest that we should depart from that basis now.  He agreed that certain circumstances might arise but the principle was to stand.  Since then workers have been enjoying certain holidays under the Act, and no complaint, as far as I know, has been made by employers.  For the first time I heard to-day that it is doubtful if in law these workers are entitled to payment in certain circumstances. They have been paid and that was not challenged.  It was the feeling of the House when the Act was passed that six days' annual leave should be given as holidays, plus six days' public holidays. <Col N="434" /> It was felt that that was a reasonable amount of holidays for industrial workers who had to put in the qualifying period of 1,800 hours. Is not this an attempt by the Minister to worsen their position by lessening the number of holidays?  Again, for men who are working five days a week it would be difficult to find out whether they work normally for five days. Deputy Norton spoke of one section that works abnormally, the railway-men. They are working five days. They are going to lose the three days' holidays of which Deputy Norton spoke &mdash;Easter Monday, Whit Monday and the first Monday in August.  These three Mondays are taken.</P>

Their conditions of service entitle them to six days but, because of continued depression, they have been working five days over a number of years, For a long time the section I belong to have been working only four days&mdash; from 1925 on&mdash;and it was argued in the House here in connection with that that those people ought not to be penalised further, that they were suffering enough because of industrial depression.  We are coming back now under this Act, called a Holidays Act, the effect of which is to take holidays from somebody who has got them already.  I cannot see the logic of the Minister's argument in connection with it.  He has some particular section of workers in his mind whom I cannot determine, but in regard to the normal workers, I know that the majority of people working five days in the country are working abnormally, apart from the railway.  Deputy Dockrell has given another instance of the worker who works five days for the convenience of himself and his employer, going a long distance, and they spread their work over five rather than six days, but that does not mean that he is not a six-day worker.  We might have more light on the subject if the Minister would indicate clearly who are the particular workers he has in mind.</P>

      <P>If we are going to get any further amelioration in regard to shortening of hours in order to make provisions for the unemployed we will have to have another Act.  We will have to have another Act to make the five-day week some people are working at the present time the <Col N="436" /> normal working week.  We should get a shorter working week and hope for it. The Minister is running in advance of himself and we will have to keep on chopping holidays, although we decided in the 1936 Act that 12 days' annual leave&mdash;with the six public holidays&mdash; was reasonable recreation period for industrial workers.  I suggest that there has been no case made by employers or anybody else to warrant this early intervention to the derogation and detriment of the workers who benefited under that Act.  There has been no demand for it, and the Minister ought to be very slow in taking with the right hand what he has given with the left such a short time ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us on this section, when we asked who were the authors of the amendment, that, although the employers, who have been paying, have not complained, and although the workers, who have been getting the benefit of the Act, have not complained, his Department felt bound to step in and suggest an amendment of the Act in such a way as to deprive workers of rights which they have at present.  That is an amazing attitude for any Department of Industry and Commerce to take up.  The employers did not complain; the workers did not complain; both are satisfied with the provisions of the 1936 Act.  I could understand if it was the Department of Finance, but the Department of Industry and Commerce, of all Departments, which ought to be concerned with promoting high standards of social legislation, comes along and tells the Minister, &ldquo;This is too generous. You are doing something here you should not do,&rdquo; and now we get an amending Bill of this kind, the purpose of which is to deprive workers of rights they have at present.  If there has been no complaint from the employer and no complaint from the worker I cannot understand by what process of reasoning the Department of Industry and Commerce, which ought to be concerned with raising standards, comes along to suggest a worsening of the position of the five-day worker under this Bill.  That is a role in which I did not expect to see the Department of Industry and Commerce, <Col N="437" /> which is under the Minister's control.  Apparently, one's expectations can often be doomed to disappointment in that regard.  Certainly it does not at all square with the Minister's speeches at Geneva on this question or on social legislation generally.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that one of the reasons for not wanting to give the five-day worker payment for the bank holiday for his off-day is that that would possibly retard employment for the five-day week.  I do not believe that is likely to happen at all.  An employer considering the question of changing over from a six-day week to a five-day week will bear in mind the fact that he is liable now to pay his worker a day's pay for a bank holiday which falls in the six working days, and if he changes over to the five-day week, he will realise he is still carrying that responsibility. That type of argument has never before been used as a reason for not changing over to the five-day week. Every enlightened employer in this country, and in Britain, America, and New Zealand, who has felt bound to air his views on the question of the five-day week, has acknowledged that it has been an instantaneous success, and that enormous benefits have accrued in the improved standard of health and improved output in the places where it was resorted to. Ministers of State, notably in New Zealand and in the United States, have given public utterance to their approbation of the five-day working week in the benefits which it makes available to the workers, and the consequential beneficial reactions on their family, on industry, and on the State generally. I think that the movement towards the five-day week is not likely to be impeded by the puny type of argument that, if you change over to five days, in some week you will have to pay a worker for a bank holiday on which he does not work.  I think the sheer momentum of economic events will overcome tiny little difficulties of that kind, on the issue of whether it is desirable economically and socially to change from a six-day to a five-day working week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, apart from these major considerations <Col N="438" /> which arise when approaching the problem of whether the six-day or five-day week is the better economically and socially, let us get down to an examination of the intrinsic merits of the Bill which the Minister is asking the House to adopt.  Under the 1936 Act, a worker who worked for six days, let us say, who was being paid at the rate of £3 a week, received £3 even though he only worked five days. Normally he was liable to work six days for £3, but if a bank holiday fell in that week on a Saturday, he got £3 that week for working five days.  Therefore, he got a definite gain under the Act of one day's pay for a day he did not work.  For the six-day worker there was a gain of one day's pay.  Now let us state that, so that we can see what is the gain for the six-day worker, and then change over to the five-day worker.  The five-day working week has often been accomplished by spreading over five days work which would normally be spread over six days.  It is just a matter of adjustment of hours and adjustment of the factory technique. In many cases it does not mean that the worker works less than he would if he were working six days, and in many cases it does not matter to the worker from the point of view of his output whether he is working five or six days per week; his relative output is the same.  When you are thinking of the matter, therefore, you must think more of output and organisation than you do merely of days in the calendar.  Even if we were to ignore that consideration, let us state the case of the five-day worker at present. This worker gets, let us say, £3 for five days' work, and, on the sixth day, if it is a bank holiday, he gets paid as well for that bank holiday.  But what does the five-day worker get in that case?  He merely gains one day in a particular week.  If he is paid at 10/- per day, the six-day worker has a gain of 10/-, inasmuch as he gets £3 for five days' work.  If the five-day worker has, let us say, £3 for the five days' work, in that particular case the worker gets a gain of one day's pay for the bank holiday on which he did not work.  But, relatively, the position of the six-day worker and the five-day <Col N="439" /> worker is essentially the same.  What is going to happen under this amendment is that the Minister is going to definitely discriminate against the five-day worker.</P>
    <P>The six-day worker in the week in which the bank holiday falls will get, let us say, wages of £3 for five days' work and will thus gain payment for one day, but the five-day worker will get the same week's wages for the five-day week and he would be giving the same normal output and there is going to be no gain in his case; he will be worse off than the six-day worker.  I think it might pay workers under this Bill to get back to the six-day week in order to avoid the penalty which the Minister is imposing on them.  I think the Minister is definitely putting the five-day worker in an unfair position compared with the six-day worker. I do not think it is quite correct to say that this can only happen in certain years.  Deputy Keyes has quoted the notorious case of railway-shopmen who have been on a five-day week for years.  If the statement made recently by the railway company before the Railway Wages Board is correct, it looks as if the shopmen will spend the rest of their lives on a five-day week.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious problem for them.  They are going to be deprived very definitely of any advantage. They are going to be the class hardest hit.  They are not in receipt of a full week's wages for a five-day week, and on top of that they will be deprived under this Bill of rights which have been given them under the 1936 Act. Deputy Keyes tells us that they will suffer heavily under this Bill.  The Minister may say that it is impossible for an employer to substitute a Catholic holiday for a public holiday unless in a certain cycle of years, but I suggest that there are loopholes opened up under this measure for employers to substitute Catholic holidays for public holidays so as to avoid their responsibilities.</P>

If there is any doubt in regard to existing legislation, let the courts decide. Nobody has expressed any doubts except the Department and nobody has suggested amending legislation except the Department.  There is absolutely no reason for asking the House to amend the 1936 Act in a way that affects provisions of that Act very seriously.

      <P>The five-day workers I have in mind work 45 hours in the week.  We have another group working 47 hours in a six-day week.  If Christmas Day, Saint Stephen's Day, or St. Patrick's Day falls on a Saturday, the five-day workers will still work 45 hours and the other men will work only 39 hours.  In that position the five-day workers will be victimised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We set out to ensure that the worker would not lose wages by reason of the fact that a public holiday on which he was not allowed to work occurred.  The five-day worker does not lose any wages.  The six-day worker working 47 hours would lose wages if we did not legislate to secure for him payment for the public holiday. We are out to secure a normal week's wages.  The six-day worker will be in a position, in a week when a public holiday occurs, to get a full week's wages.  Deputy Norton wants to put the five-day worker in a position in which he would get a week's wages plus a day's pay, which is more than the six-day worker would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="441" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there would be one set of men working 45 hours a week and that would mean six hours longer than the other section, who would normally work 47 but, because of the holiday, would work only 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an argument and I am not prepared to deny the force of the argument.  I submit that Deputies are losing sight of what we set out to do by placing undue importance on certain aspects.  We set out to protect people against loss. We may have given to certain workers something more than we intended. Deputy Norton is proposing to take it back from them, although the employers have not complained about giving it to them.</P>
      <P>There is a very serious doubt in mind as to whether we would proceed with this Bill as it stands at all or not. That doubt does not, I must say, arise as to the equity of the proposal in relation to the class of workers whom I have in mind, those who ordinarily work four or five days in the week and get a full week's wages for doing so.  The doubt is in relation to the class of workers Deputy Keyes has referred to, the workers already hit by temporary circumstances in industry and who are not getting the full week's work, men working five days and getting only five-sixths of a week's pay in consequence.  I think there will be a very substantial practical difficulty in securing for such workers payment in respect of a public holiday that falls on a non-working day and, at the same time, not securing that benefit for the other more normal classes of workers I have referred to.  Therefore, it may be that we will have to drop this provision because of the practical difficulty which I have referred to, which prevents the finding of an equitable solution.  That being so, I would rather err in favour of securing the benefit for the workers on a five-day week than in the other direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation might be met in another way.  It might be met by prescribing a longer number of hours to be worked in the qualifying period. <Col N="442" /> Deputies will have noticed that in this Bill we are moving in the other direction. We are making the number of hours less because we have found individual employers who could take advantage of the existing law to avoid the payment of holiday pay to their workers.  The only way to check that evasion was by moving in the other direction.  The consequence is that we are bringing within the class of workers entitled to payment in respect of public holidays workers who are doing substantially less than five or four days' work, even workers doing less than three days.  That is rather a serious thing to contemplate, because as the normal working week goes down, the burden of providing holiday pay is increased upon the employer.  There is this to be said in respect of the class of workers working a short week by reason of depression in industry, or some similar cause, that the employers of these workers will find it most difficult to make the extra payments.  If trade is good, and workers are employed fulltime, the burden of the extra payment for holidays is lighter than in the case of industries which are depressed and in which full output cannot be made.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to balance the equities in the position.  My inclination at the moment is to resist the amendment with a view to leaving it possible to attempt to divide into two classes those workers who work less than a six-day week, the two classes being those who are losing nothing by working five days and those who are working five days by reason of industrial depression or some similar cause which has prevented them working their normal working week.  I do not want to make this a contentious matter because it is something concerning which I have myself very grave doubts. I am not even certain that I fully appreciate the effect that the section, as it stands, will have.  I have given the matter very careful consideration, and I have some apprehension that the section may have, in practice, a somewhat different effect from what was intended.  Therefore it was my intention to have it reconsidered in any event, because it was difficult to follow and may give rise to unusual interpretations <Col N="443" /> if cases were taken to the court for decision.  I, therefore, suggest that the Deputy should agree to leave this debate stand over.  He can keep his amendment on the Order Paper and get a decision on his amendment if he chooses.  I may have an amendment which would in part or in whole meet it.</P>

      <P>There is an amendment, amendment No. 24, in my name, It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything in this Act, except where a worker is working short time, whenever an employer pays a worker a normal week's wage (exclusive of pay for overtime and deductions for short time) for any week and the worker does no work on any public holiday which falls within such week the employer shall be deemed to have allowed the worker a whole holiday on such public holiday and to have paid the worker for such public holiday.</P>

      <P>Yes.  But I thought the Deputy might have in mind another point about the necessity of defining what constitutes a day's pay.  I do not think we should do that.  If the Deputy were dealing with the point of making special provision for five-day workers I would prefer it would stand over.  But if he is dealing with the question of what constitutes a day's pay for a worker, it would be as well we should deal with it now.  It is impossible to give a satisfactory definition of what constitutes a day's pay.  We define a day's pay as what a worker would have got if he worked upon that day.</P>

It should be noted that the view has been <Col N="451" /> expressed that the worker is now allowed a holiday on a day he normally does not work.  That view was expressed here.

      <P>Acting on the assumption that sub-section (2) of Section 7, as amended, carries on into the Act, how does that compare now with sub-section (1) of Section 9 as amended? Sub-section (2) says that if a public holiday falls on a non-working day, the day is deemed not to be a public holiday. I take it that the object of that is not that it shall not count as a public holiday, because the Conditions of Employment Act says they must have a holiday on certain days, but that, for the purpose of pay, it shall not count as a holiday.  Now this sub-section, as amended, to my mind, reverses that and says that they have to be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a non-domestic worker is in the employment of a person on a public holiday, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such worker has worked for such person for not less than 150 hours at any time during the period of five weeks immediately preceding such public holiday, and</P>
      <P>(c)  such worker has worked on such holiday for such person, and</P>
      <P>(d)  such worker has not received pay in respect of work done on such public holiday at a rate not less than the amount payable under his contract of service in respect of a normal full working day increased by 25 per cent,</P>
      <P>the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e)  if such worker remains in the employment of such person for a period of one month after such public holiday, then&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  such person shall allow to such worker a whole holiday on a working day within such <Col N="454" /> period and shall, if he so allows such holiday, pay to such worker in respect thereof one day's pay,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if such person fails so to allow such worker such whole holiday, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in the Schedule to this Act, and shall (whether proceedings for such offence have or have not been taken) pay to such worker one day's pay in respect of such public holiday, but proceedings for such offence or to recover such day's pay shall not be instituted until the expiration of the employment year of such worker within which such public holiday falls or the cesser of his employment (whichever first happens);</P>
    <P>(f)  if such worker ceases to be in the employment of such person before the expiration of such period and has not been allowed a whole holiday on some working day between such public holiday and such cesser and been paid one day's pay in respect of such whole holiday, such person shall upon such cesser pay to such worker, in addition to any wages then due him, a sum equivalent to one day's pay.</P>
    <P>In this sub-section the expression &ldquo;working day&rdquo; in relation to a worker means a day which is a week day and is not a public holiday nor a day within which any part of a period of 24 consecutive hours of rest allowed to such worker under any other enactment falls, nor a non-working day.</P>
    <P>This is the other half of the amendment. It deals with the case of a worker who works on a public holiday and re-enacts, in different words, the provisions of Section 9 in relation to such workers.  It sets out that where a worker works on a public holiday and does not get the 25 per cent. increase in wages, but has worked 150 hours in the preceding five weeks, he shall get a day in lieu within the <Col N="455" /> month.  It deals also with the case of a worker whose employment ceases within the month of a public holiday and provides that he shall get a day's pay.  I mentioned the three possibilities&mdash;payment for a public holiday, substitution of a day in lieu, or extra day because he has to work&mdash; and this section deals with two of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (e) of this amendment provides that if an employer fails to allow a day in lieu of a public holiday to a non-domestic worker within a month after such public holiday, proceedings may be instituted against the employer.  The relevant portion of the sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>but proceedings for such offence or to recover such day's pay shall not be instituted until the expiration of the employment year of such worker within which such public holiday falls or the cesser of his employment.</P>
      <P>Suppose a non-domestic worker works on a public holiday in January.  A month passes and the employer offers no day in lieu and shows no disposition to pay the worker for the day. The Departmental inspectors discover, in March, that the employer has transgressed the Act.  He may admit in cross-examination that he has no intention of taking any notice of the Act, and say that he thinks it unfair and that there was no mandate to pass the Act.  Is the position to be that until the end of the year no proceedings will be instituted against the employer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You must have it that way.  Remember that it is open to that employer either to give that public holiday or to substitute instead an additional day's annual leave at any time during the employment year. Clearly you cannot say whether an employer intended to defy the Act or to observe it until the employment year has concluded.  If the worker leaves that employment in the interval cesser pay must be given.</P>

Let us assume then that that person goes on holidays in July and no additional day's pay is added. If the employer chooses to give such holidays as have accrued in the middle of the employment year and not at the end of it, or if there is an intimation from him that he will not pay and does not intend to pay, can proceedings then be instituted or must you wait for either of two things, a cesser of employment or the end of the employment year?</P>

      <P>(1)  Every person who employes a non-domestic worker shall, in every employment year of such non-domestic worker during which he has been continuously in the employment of such person and has worked in such employment for not less than eighteen hundred hours, allow at such time as such person thinks fit to such worker seven consecutive whole holidays (in this Act referred to as annual leave).</P>

      <P>(a)  a non-domestic worker employed by a person ceases, at any time other than the end of an employment year of such worker, to be in the employment of such person, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such worker has been in the employment of such person during not less than one month in such employment year and has worked not less than one hundred and fifty hours in such month, and</P>

    <P>(3) The Minister may, whenever and so often as he so thinks proper, <Col N="461" /> make regulations varying in respect of all or any particular class or classes (defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Minister thinks proper) of non-domestic workers all or any of the periods of 1,800 hours, 300 hours, or 150 hours mentioned in sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section by substituting for such period or periods either such other number of hours or such number of days as the Minister thinks proper, and whenever any such regulations are in force the said sub-sections shall have effect, in respect of the non-domestic workers or the class or classes of non-domestic workers to which such regulations apply, as if the said period or such of them as are affected by such regulations were varied in the manner stated in such regulations.</P>

    <P>(b)  if such employer has before such commencement allowed to such person in such employment year one or more whole holidays which would be annual leave for the purposes of this section but for the fact that such whole holidays were less than seven or were not consecutive or were both less than seven and not consecutive, the said whole holidays so allowed shall be deemed to be annual leave for the purposes of this section and such person shall only be entitled in respect of such employment year to such number (if any) of consecutive whole holidays after such commencement as is equal to the number (if any) of days by which the number of whole holidays so allowed is less than seven.</P>
    <P>(7)  if the employer of a non-domestic worker fails to allow annual leave to such worker in accordance with this section such employer shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in the Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where a person who employs a non-domestic worker proposes to grant such non-domestic worker annual leave in pursuance of this section&mdash;</P>

    <P>The sub-section, as it stands, reduces the qualification in respect of workers under 18 years of age.  The amendment confines that provision to workers who are industrial workers.  In effect, it re-enacts the relevant provision of the 1936 Act.  Workers brought within the scope of the Bill, who are not industrial workers, have not their hours of work determined by statute.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (5) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  Where any non-working day or any two or more consecutive non-working days falls or fall immediately before or immediately after a day on which an employer has allowed a non-domestic worker a whole holiday, such non-working day or each of such consecutive non-working days (as the case may be) shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be a day on which such employer has allowed such worker a whole holiday.</P>
      <P>This is a new sub-section.  It relates to annual leave only.  The legal view appears to be that an employer cannot allow a worker a holiday on a day when normally a worker does not work. A worker doing normal work on a four-day week would get two days' annual leave in a second week.  Non-working days must now be counted as holidays.  The worker will not lose by this because, under Section 13, he will get a normal week's pay.  He gets no pay for the non-working day.</P>

    <P>(b)  if such employer has before such commencement allowed to such person in such employment year one or more whole holidays which would be annual leave for the purposes of this section but for the fact that such whole holidays were less than fourteen or were not consecutive or were both less than fourteen and not consecutive the said whole holidays so allowed shall be deemed to be annual leave for the purposes of this section and such person shall only be entitled in respect of such employment year to such number (if any) consecutive whole holidays after such commencement as is equal to the number (if any) of days by which the number of whole holidays so allowed is less than fourteen.</P>

    <P>(b)  such employer shall (whether proceedings have or have not been taken under paragraph (a) of this sub-section) pay to such worker a sum equivalent to the amount which, under the provisions of this Act relating to payments in respect of annual leave and semi-annual leave, he would have been liable to pay to such worker if he had in fact allowed such worker such annual leave and such annual leave had been allowed during the last 14 days of such employment year.</P>

    <P>The whole of the section is deleted and a new section is substituted.  The principle underlying the original section is that a domestic worker shall get seven days' holidays in each half year, with the option given to the employer of granting 14 consecutive days in respect of a whole year.  The amendment adopts the principle of 14 days' holiday in the worker's employment year, with the option of giving seven days in respect of each half-year. In practice the two systems will work in the same way for the employer and the worker, but we think that this is an improvement on the original section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3) provides that where a domestic worker is employed by a person on a contract of service which <Col N="476" /> includes board and lodging, and such employer has given notice to such worker of his intention to grant such worker holidays during a certain period, then such worker may, with the consent of the employer, remain at work during that period of holiday, provided that in respect of every day the worker remains at work the worker will get an extra day's pay.  In other words, we set out in this Bill to provide holidays for domestic and non-domestic workers, and in the section we propose to enact a provision whereby, if a person is given double pay for the period of holidays, no holidays whatever need be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the consent of the worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is a particularly pernicious section.  You can understand the way in which it will operate.  An employer may say to a worker: &ldquo;I cannot allow you to go on holidays for a fortnight, as it would seriously inconvenience me,&rdquo; and a timid worker, perhaps a maid working on her own, nervous as to what the consequence of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; will be, may say: &ldquo;Very well, I will consent to forgo my holidays if I get double pay for the period of the holidays.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that is cutting at the whole principle underlying the Bill.  What you are doing is, you are giving that person 54 weeks' wages for 52 weeks' work.  That is all you are doing.  If you think holidays are desirable, you should insist on that person getting holidays.  There is no case at all for giving a person 54 weeks' wages for 52 weeks' work.  You might say to the person, &ldquo;You ought to have more wages for the 52 weeks,&rdquo; but there is no case for giving 54 weeks' wages for 52 weeks' work while the person remains at work.  If we are passing a Bill described as a Holidays Bill and it is advantageous to promote legislation whereby persons will get holidays, we should insist on their getting holidays. There is no reason for making this extra provision at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would rather approach the whole problem of holidays from the point of view of insisting that the worker must take holidays and not allow a worker <Col N="477" /> to compromise himself or herself by accepting an arrangement to take pay in lieu of holidays.  In an earlier Bill we provided that it shall not be lawful for any industrial worker during any period of annual leave to do, for reward, any industrial work.  If we go to the extent of proscribing the right of an industrial worker to do, let us say, a half day's work for wages during the period of his holidays, and if we think that offends so seriously against the principle of compelling him to take his holidays, why do we, with our eyes open, provide that a domestic servant may cancel her whole holidays once she gets double pay for the period?  A situation may arise by which a maid for reasons of her own, may decline to take holidays year after year.  You are not passing a Bill in that case to give holidays at all, but to give her an extra two weeks' pay in the year.  It is not a Holidays Bill. It may be described as a Wages Bill, but it is not a Holidays Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the scheme of allowing a worker to cancel holidays for a cash payment is cutting at the whole principle of providing holidays for workers and is contrary to all the provisions which we made in the Conditions of Employment Act. If a number of workers are allowed to compound their rights in this fashion, it is taking from the case that it is desirable to provide holidays for workers.  I think the Minister is saving up for himself a storm which may develop from certain sections in this Bill by his admission in this section that there is no need to provide holidays for workers at all, and that all you have to do is to give extra pay.  I do not know what case can be made for the section, but I certainly think it is a complete contradiction of the whole principle of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is a very satisfactory arrangement, but it is the only one I can think of to deal with the particular problem of a domestic servant who has no home to go to.  I do not know what the Deputy's solution is for that type of worker.  It is easy for the Deputy to say that we should insist on the worker taking a holiday.  But the employer <Col N="478" /> of the domestic worker who has no home and no place to spend a holiday would be put in a rather peculiar position if bound by law to say: &ldquo;Your holidays start to-morrow; you must get out for fourteen days; I know the amount that I am going to pay you for wages and board and lodging will not provide a decent lodging for the period; I know you are not going to get that lodging free, but you have to make the best of it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Some provision must be made to deal with that particular case.  That case will happen and does exist to the knowledge of Deputies.  Therefore, an arrangement must be made to enable that domestic servant, who cannot in fact take holidays in the circumstances of her life, to remain at work.  But, at the same time, we want to institute some safeguard which will prevent an employer taking advantage of that arrangement to deprive, by pressure of one kind or another, a domestic servant of her holiday period.  Therefore, we put in this provision, that if the worker consents and wants that arrangement she can remain at work; but if she does, the employer must pay double wages.  That ensures the consent of the worker, in the first instance, and is a very direct inducement to the employer not to put pressure on the worker to secure consent in the other instance.  However, possibly the Deputy may be able to suggest some better arrangement and, if he does, I am prepared to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that there is a problem there which we cannot leave alone.  If we are going to provide for annual leave for domestic servants we must deal with the particular problem with regard to the type of servant who has no home, or does not want to go home for some reason, and who cannot take a holiday in the sense that she can rent a room or go to the seaside or provide board and lodgings for herself outside her employer's house on the amount of money at her disposal.  Something must be done for that particular type of worker if we are going to include them in the Bill at all.  This is the only arrangement that has occurred to me, to say that such worker need not take a holiday, but in order to prevent her being put in the position of being <Col N="479" /> forced by her employer to give her consent we insert this provision for double wages as a deterrent to the employer in that particular way.  I am prepared to consider any alternative arrangement which the Deputy can suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Minister says carries great weight as the difficulty does exist.  There is, however, the other side of the picture.  In so far as this Bill is designed to operate effectively, it is directed against the house which has not been in the habit of giving domestic servants any holidays at all.  In the vast majority of well-run houses, domestic servants do get holidays.  This Bill is designed to get at the house where they do not receive holidays.  I apprehend that in such a house, if the option is left to the servant of remaining at work and receiving additional pay, she will, in fact, get neither holidays nor pay and it will be perfectly impossible to secure that she gets either one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reluctant to suggest that the Government should be poking its nose into everybody's domestic circle. Nevertheless, it occurs to me that a somewhat analogous position arose in connection with one of the Conditions of Employment Acts.  It was there pointed out that there were certain persons who could only get certain types of casual work owing to their special circumstances.  They were entitled to apply to the Minister for a certificate exempting them from the provisions of the Act so that they could work under somewhat different conditions from an ordinary able-bodied person.  If they had that certificate, their employer was excused from certain concessions which he was required to give to the ordinary able-bodied worker.  I do not know whether it would be administratively possible to arrange that, if a domestic servant wished to avail of the provision of taking double pay instead of holidays, she should apply to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and get an analogous certificate entitling her to do so.  That would provide the Ministry <Col N="480" /> with an opportunity of inquiring into the question as to whether a girl was without any home really to which she could go or whether it would be hardship to require her to take holidays. An inquiry having been made, she would be furnished with a certificate, and no difficulty would arise.  If an inquiry has to be made every year, I think it would give rise to a very undesirable situation, inasmuch as a household would be continually trespassed upon by Government inspectors. I make that suggestion as one way out of the difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The big difficulty is that we estimate there are about 90,000 domestic servants who will be affected by the Bill, and if a substantial proportion of them wanted to get a certificate, it would require very elaborate machinery to operate that system.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see a case where a domestic servant employed in Dublin whose home was in Cork might say, &ldquo;I cannot go home to Cork, because the travelling expenses will absorb all the money.&rdquo;  But the same domestic servant employed in Cork would not be in that position.  You would have to relate your decision to the particular circumstances of the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the fact that there are 90,000 persons engaged in domestic service will give rise to some difficulty, at first.  Until the Bill has been some time in operation, you would have an immense volume of work to determine the facts arising in each application but after the first impact of regulating the situation in the early stages of the administration of the Act, the number of applications coming forward would be very small. It would not be a recurrent problem. The big problem would occur when the Bill was first brought into force.  After that, the number of applications coming in should not exceed 100 or 150 in 12 months.  That, of course, is only one way out of the difficulty but I think it does provide a way which would guard against evils from both sides.  I make the suggestion for the consideration of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be in favour of trying to get certificates in a number of cases.  It has been suggested that certain servants would be browbeaten and such people might possibly be compelled to accept their employer's view.  Even in such cases, I think if the matter were followed up, the employer would be induced to see that the servant did get her holidays. One other point which makes me rather agree with the Minister's view is this.  In the case of a certain number of domestics, if they return to their own homes their conditions would be much worse than if they remained in service.  On that account, I think probably a certain percentage of domestics would be anxious for one reason or another to remain at work. The proportion would probably be even higher than the Minister suggests.  I agree with Deputy Norton that the ideal arrangement is that they should take their holidays.  They would be the better for them in every respect. At the same time I think that no matter what Act you are administering, so far as you can make the provisions fall in with the ideas of people generally, you will find the Act can be administered more easily and will give greater satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have merely stated the problem.  The particular solution which I submitted has nothing to recommend it except that it may work&mdash; I mean work without difficulty.  It puts the obligation of making the decision on the worker herself.  She has to decide whether she is going to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill or not, and it therefore reduces to a minimum the administrative action that would be necessary for the purpose of enforcement.  In the ordinary course, I should imagine the Department of Industry and Commerce will not act to enforce the provisions of this Bill in relation to domestic servants except on complaint being received.  It would be impossible to contemplate our proceeding towards enforcement of the provisions of the Bill to the same extent as is necessary in connection with the enforcement of the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act where you <Col N="482" /> have inspectors on the road going into every employment, inspecting records and so forth.</P>
      <P>Of course, domestic servants are not covered by that Act, but I presume some similar arrangement is made by the Department of Local Government and Public Health in connection with the enforcement of the National Health Insurance Act.  It will be impossible to enforce this Act in that way.  It would involve a huge organisation and, what Deputy Dillon has rightly objected to, Government interference with private domestic arrangements. Therefore, we have provided that an inspector under the Bill will have no right to enter into a residence or make any inquiries unless the Minister has certified that he has good reason to believe that an offence has been committed.  That in effect means, unless the Minister has received complaints, sufficiently specific, in his opinion or in the opinion of his officer who will be dealing with the matter, to justify action.  Therefore, we have got to rely on this section of the Act being enforced by the workers themselves, by the workers taking measures to see that they get their rights.  The particular arrangement which I have suggested of dealing with the difficulty of a domestic servant who does not want to leave the residence of her employer for the purpose of holidays conforms to that general idea.  If Deputies can suggest a more effective system I am prepared to consider it. I do not care for the system myself. The only thing it has to recommend it is its simplicity and the probability that it may work effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this provision in the Bill is by no means satisfactory.  It will open the way to widespread abuses and to evasion of the whole Act.  I know there is a difficult situation to be met, but I am not sure that in the method chosen in this section we are trying to meet it in the most satisfactory way.  We are providing that if the employer pays the maid double pay for the period of <Col N="484" /> the holidays, then he or she is deemed to have complied with the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy must not skip over the essential part of the Bill, namely that if the maid so desires she can get this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the employer pays the maid double wages for the period of the holidays he or she is deemed to have complied with the Act&mdash;that is, once he or she gets the maid to say that she is satisfied to take that. Surely, we all know what happens in the case of domestic servants.  Young girls come out of institutions&mdash;timid, quiet, fearsome, unprotesting girls&mdash; and go into domestic service.  An employer sees himself or herself up against the possibility of the maid going away on a fortnight's holidays, and of being seriously inconvenienced during her absence.  He or she will say to the maid: &ldquo;If you insist on going away for this fortnight's holidays I am afraid I will have to dismiss you beforehand, and get in somebody who will agree to take extra wages in lieu of the holidays.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the employer takes that line, the maid will, rather than be thrown out of employment and of having the trouble of looking for another situation, consent to that course, even though she does not like it.  Having got the maid's consent under economic, or any other type of pressure, the employer is held to have discharged his responsibilities once he or she pays the maid two weeks' wages.  One of the additional difficulties caused under this section is that you are putting a premium on the maid's consent by giving her double pay if she does consent. I think the section might work better if you were to say to the maid that if she consents to work during the holidays the employer has the right not to pay her for a fortnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be better to put the obligation on the employer to give the maid holidays. There is no use in giving the maid an extra two weeks' pay in lieu of holidays because by not accepting the holidays she is indicating that she does not want holidays.  There is no case for neutralising the desire for holidays by giving her the extra payment. I think that in this section you are opening the door wide to an evasion of the provisions of the Act. Although it is administratively difficult, I do think there is something in the point made by Deputy Dillon: that employers who want to avail of this arrangement should be compelled to get a certificate of approval from the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that it should be made difficult for them to get it in these cases.  If employers knew that there were difficulties to be encountered before they could get a certificate and be immune from prosecution, I think they would be less likely to avail of this section.  I think it would be much better to insist that every maid has a right to her holidays and that she must take them.</P>

It would be probably better to insist that the employer must grant holidays and provide some inexpensive court of appeal before which the employer must give reasons why he did not allow the maid on holidays &mdash;to make it a defence before some inexpensive court of appeal that the maid consented to forego her holidays in circumstances which made it impossible for her to avail of them.  One can readily understand the position of a maid who has got no home to go to. Rather than be turned out, she will agree to accept the extra wages.  I think that this provision is likely to <Col N="486" /> lead to a wholesale evasion of the Act. It would be better, I think, to insist that there should be a certificate of approval before the holidays can be nullified by the double payment of wages.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not make it too difficult to get over this matter.  I am satisfied that 50 per cent. of the domestic servants have not homes to go to.  A very large percentage come from institutions, convents and orphanages, and if it is made compulsory on employers to pay these people double wages, or some other alternative, it will simply mean pushing these girls out on the roads.  That will be the ultimate effect.  I do not think we should do anything to make that possible, even for only 10 per cent. of those concerned.  This is a very serious question.  If we force employers to put even 10 per cent. of domestic servants out on the roads&mdash;because that is what it will amount to, owing to a great deal of red tape that will have to be gone through&mdash;we will be adopting a very dangerous principle. I think the Minister's scheme is the best one to meet the situation, and he should be very slow to change the section.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Acting Minister for Defence (The Taoiseach) Acting Minister for Defence (The Taoiseach)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Defence (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act, of which this is an amendment, was passed on the 16th December, 1932, and empowered the <Col N="490" /> Minister for Defence to draw up a scheme of pensions and gratuities for officers, other ranks, and the nursing services of the Army.  The scheme made under the Act was approved by the Dáil on the 27th October, 1937.  In the interval a number of cases occurred which the Order made in the scheme, immediately after the passing of the Act, would have covered.  The Bill now before the House is intended to cover these cases.  For example, the Act and the scheme enabled pensions to be granted to officers of the forces who were transferred to the Gárda Síochána, and who held posts in the Gárda on the passing of the Act; that was on the 16th December, 1932.  After the passing of the Act, and before approval of the scheme on the 27th October, 1937, one officer with 13 years pensionable service in the Defence Forces was, in the interest of the public service, transferred on the 15th July, 1936, to the Gárda Síochána, and was not, therefore, entitled to any pension for his services in the forces.  To remedy this defect, Section 2 (a) of the Bill has been introduced.  It is to meet the case of an officer who was transferred, in the public interest, in the interval between the passing of the Act and the making of the Order, to the Gárda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Again, the scheme provides pensions for the widows of officers who died while serving after the appointed day, 27th of October, 1937.  In four cases officers died while serving in the Forces before the appointed day and after the date of the passing of the Act.  Their widows were not, therefore, entitled to pensions under the scheme.  Section 2 (b) is intended to remedy that defect. Deputies who look at it will see the cases referred to are covered by 2 (b).</P>
      <P>Again, in one case an officer resigned his commission on the 11th January, 1935, and died the following day.  As, therefore, he did not die while serving on or after the appointed day, his widow was not entitled to any pension. Section 2 (c) deals with this case and now the widow is entitled to a pension or will be if this Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>Those are the six cases in Sections 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Principal Act gives the Minister power to amend previous <Col N="491" /> schemes, schemes that are made and have been made already, but it appears that any amendment of any scheme could only operate from the date of the resolution approving of the scheme so that any amendment could not have retrospective effect.  Section 4 of the Bill remedies this defect and allows the Minister to give retrospective effect to any amendment.</P>
    <P>Article 36 of the scheme vests in the Minister an absolute discretion in the granting or refusal of pensions. Doubt has arisen as to whether this article of the scheme is <i>ultra vires</i> in that no such discretion is vested in the Minister by the Principal Act.  Section 5 of the Bill removes this doubt.</P>
    <P>I might add that the five widows for whom the Bill provides pensions have already received gratuities under Regulations made in accordance with the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts.  The gratuities so paid vary from £441 to £911.  Section 3 of the Principal Act empowers the Minister to condition the grant of pensions and the scheme which will eventually implement the present Bill will provide for the recovery of any gratuities so paid from the grant of pension.  This recovery will take from five to eleven years, so that the present Bill does not involve any immediate commitment on public funds.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Second Reading to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection from this side of the House to this particular Bill in so far as, quite evidently, it makes provision for hard cases that were unfortunately not provided for on account of the delay between the Bill and Regulation.  This Bill makes provision for five specific cases, probably five cases that are of the type that should come in under the Regulation but I want to take this opportunity to remind the Taoiseach that there is a considerable number of cases of men who died prior to 1932 while serving with the Forces and who are not covered by any Bill whatsoever. The previous Pensions Bill to provide a pension for a widow where the officer or soldier died only made provision for such widow if the disease from which <Col N="492" /> the officer or soldier died was acquired prior to October, 1924.  If the disease was acquired at any later date and the officer or soldier died before 1932 then they are not covered by any regulation or any Bill.  There was a number of officers and soldiers who died between October, 1924, and October, 1932.  They are covered by no Bill and that was the deliberate policy of the Department of Defence and approved and agreed to by the Army representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What was that&mdash; that it should be granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That the Act which pensioned disabilities would only apply to disease acquired prior to 1924, the date of establishing the forces.  That was agreed to by all on the grounds that, if all those cases were covered partially by that Bill, there would never be an Army Pensions Bill, and the agreement was that such cases were to be covered when a regular Pensions Bill was produced for the Army.  It so happened that continuity was lost and there are, for eight years, soldiers and officers uncovered by any Bill or regulation in the event of their death.  There is a list in existence in the Department of Defence showing every officer and soldier who died between those dates.</P>
      <P>If we are to make special provision for officers and soldiers who died subsequent to 1932, there is an urgent case for making provision for the widows of those who died between 1924 and 1932 and, if there is to be any normal order of priority, such officers and soldiers should have come first. The fact that there is a new Administration since 1932 is no justification for forgetting or overlooking the widow of the officer or soldier who died prior to 1932.  I do not know whether this Bill provides for amendment so as to cover cases that were not dealt with in the previous Bill.  In fact, I take it that it would be impossible to do it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am offering no opposition to this Bill, quite the contrary; I welcome it, but I am merely utilising this Bill in order to call attention to cases on a par with the cases covered here, with this difference, that the widows and <Col N="493" /> children have been seven or eight years longer in want and destitution.  I would like to get an assurance from the Taoiseach that, without any further delay, the cases I refer to will be covered in some other Bill, or either extending that pensions scheme backwards to cover retrospectively deaths that occurred so many years before.  The fact of the matter is that between 1924 and 1932 officers and soldiers were dying from illness.  If that illness was not acquired on Army service prior to the date of the establishment of the forces, there was no way of giving them a pension.  There is no way at the moment, and medical officers had got to sit by the bedside of the dying officer and, as the Taoiseach knows, the very minute you rid a patient of hope of living you kill that patient.</P>
    <P>Our position was that we had to watch at the bedside until we felt certain that that man was going to die, and then we had to say to him: &ldquo;You will never see to-morrow, and, if you are a serving officer, when you die to-night there is nothing for your widow.  Sign that bit of paper and resign, and, if you resign, there is a year's pay for your wife, who will be a widow to-morrow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a very hard position to put any doctor in, but it had to be done in order to get one year's pay for the widow, because there was no provision made to pension her.  There was a form of promise from the Executive Council and the Department of Finance that whenever an Army pension scheme would be introduced, all such cases would be covered.  They were omitted from the pension scheme.  There is a new Bill now to cover cases that arose since.  I am merely urging, and I think I am pushing an open door in urging, that similar cases that occurred in the same Army in similar circumstances prior to 1932 will get the same treatment as those are getting who died subsequent to 1932.</P>

Unfortunately, I am not in the possession of information that would enable me to know what would be the number of cases that might be <Col N="494" /> covered.  I do not know if such a promise was, in fact, made, or if there is any record of any such promise by a previous Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that there would be a record.  It was in Committee, and it was purely a verbal agreement made in Committee.  There was a Joint Committee representing the Army, Finance and Defence, to draft that disability pension Bill. Deliberately we anchored that back prior to 1924, on the understanding that if there was a regular Army Pensions Bill all such cases would be covered.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether, when previous Bills were discussed here&mdash;for instance, in connection with the Principal Act of 1932&mdash; that matter was pointed out at the time.  The Deputy will appreciate that I shall have to look into all those matters before I can form a definite judgment as to the full merits of the case he has put forward.  It does seem from what the Deputy has said that there is a gap which has to be examined.  I promise I shall have it examined and, when we come to the Committee Stage, I hope to be able to tell him what is the attitude of the Government in the matter.  I do not think I can do anything further at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say also that a short while before I came into the House there was a case brought to my attention of another officer who died while serving and who left a widow.  It happened within the period that we are dealing with in this Bill, but it is of somewhat a different character from those which we have here.  I told the Deputy who brought it to my notice that I would have it examined, and if it came within the terms of the Bill or was a case the Government thought should be dealt with, that I would examine it and, if it were possible to deal with it under this Bill, I would do it by way of an amendment; if it was decided it was right that it should be dealt with, every effort would be made to deal adequately with it.  It occurred to me in that connection that possibly that particular case could be dealt with under the powers given here to the Minister to amend a scheme and <Col N="495" /> to amend it retrospectively to a certain extent.  I suppose I may take it that there is no opposition from any part of the House to this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Red Cross Bill, 1938, be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of an Irish Red Cross Society.  I think that at the moment we are the only State in Europe without such a society.  I suppose that, in the main, Deputies understand the nature of the work done by such societies.  The origin of these societies was that in 1863 there was a conference at Geneva representing 16 European States.  These representatives met with the idea of working out a scheme for the coordination of the work of societies and groups that had for their object the relief of the wounded in war.  That particular conference had no power to give effect to their recommendations, but a second conference was immediately called by the Swiss Federal Council, and accredited representatives of different Governments came to that conference.  That conference resulted in the signing of the Geneva Convention of 1864.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal articles of that convention provided for the acceptance of the principle that the sick and wounded, the medical and auxiliary services of armies, ambulances, hospitals, and so on, were to be regarded as neutral at all times and in all circumstances.  The red cross on a white ground was adopted as the international emblem of this neutrality, and it was agreed that this emblem should be used not only by the army medical services, but also by duly recognised relief societies constituted to act as auxiliaries for the army medical services.  These societies came to be known generally as Red Cross Societies.  The Red Cross Societies are linked up in an international <Col N="496" /> organisation governed by the International Red Cross Committee.</P>
    <P>National Red Cross Societies are affiliated, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled.  Societies seeking recognition must themselves be recognised by the Governments of their own countries as an auxiliary to the army medical services, and only one such society is accepted from each country. The society must accept the principle of moral union with the International Committee and moral union with the other societies linked up by the International Committee.  Each society must undertake to maintain a continuous relationship with the other societies and the International Committee. Each society is free to adopt the organisation most suitable for its own country.  It must be formed so as not to exclude any appropriate branch of medical work in connection with the fighting forces, and it must be open to all the nationals of the country without any distinction, and in particular without distinction of sex, religion, or political opinions.</P>
    <P>Since the adoption of the first convention, two other conventions have been signed, one in 1906 and another in 1929, and they were intended to supplement and bring up to date the agreements of the first convention in 1864.  We are parties to the convention of 1929, which we signed with certain reservations to which Section 5 (3) of the Bill relates.  These conventions aim at protecting the use of the Red Cross symbol.  The States parties to the conventions undertook to legislate to make it unlawful and to penalise any unauthorised person or body using the symbol, and also to forbid the use of the Geneva symbols themselves, that is, the white cross on the red ground. The red cross on the white ground was adopted as a compliment to the Swiss Federation, whose national emblem was the white cross on the red ground, Either set of symbols is forbidden by these conventions; the use of them for any other purpose excepting for the purpose of the Red Cross is forbidden. The object was to prevent any imitation, and to protect the emblem of the Swiss Federation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> Besides, its work for the sick and wounded in war and for prisoners of war, the Red Cross has many peace-time activities.  The States members of the League agree to &ldquo;encourage and promote the establishment and cooperation of duly authorised voluntary national Red Cross organisations having as purposes the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world,&rdquo; and these latter objects may be said to be the normal peace-time activities of Red Cross Societies.</P>
    <P>Reference to the reports of National Red Cross Societies indicates how magnificently these peace-time activities are being pursued.  In America following on the Ohio-Mississippi Valley flood of 1937, the American Red Cross sheltered over 1,000,000 persons in refugee centres while their homes and personal belongings were inundated and whose belongings were destroyed, and at the same time a National Relief Fund amounting to 25,000,000 dollars was quickly raised by the Red Cross to carry out the necessary emergency measures of relief and rehabilitation. The Swedish Red Cross operate throughout the entire country a child welfare organisation.  The British Red Cross Society have a special clinic for rheumatism and a blood transfusion service.  The Canadian Red Cross Societies have organised first-aid posts on the highways, maintain hospitals in remote districts and conduct-nutrition classes.  The foregoing are only a few examples of the works which the various Red Cross Societies of the countries quoted undertake and have been selected mainly to indicate the diversity of activities of National Red Cross Societies generally.  In our own country we have had in recent years disasters which, relatively speaking, caused much loss and suffering to some of our own people.  I have in mind the Arranmore disaster and the Scottish Bothy disaster for which it was necessary to establish <i>ad hoc</i> committees to raise relief funds.  Disasters of this nature would fall to be dealt with by our Irish Red Cross Society if such had existed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to stress an aspect of the Red Cross organisation and that is, that each national <Col N="498" /> society is a voluntary organisation and must rely on public support for funds. Deputies will appreciate that there is in every country a vast field in the alleviation of human suffering which cannot possibly be covered by Governmental services.  The establishment of a Red Cross Society will go a long way to supplementing the Government's efforts in this direction.  We expect that when the society is established there will be a generous response from our people both in regard to subscriptions and voluntary service.</P>
    <P>The details of the Bill can be better examined in the Committee Stage.  The marginal headings give the substance of the several paragraphs.  First you have the establishment of the Red Cross Society.  Powers are given by Order to establish such a society.  Secondly, you have the provision that grants and loans may be made to this society.  You have power to authorise voluntary aid societies to render assistance to the ordinary medical service.  That is a recognition which really constitutes and gives the fundamental character of the Red Cross Society.  Then there is the paragraph providing for restriction on the use of the Red Cross and on the use of the arms of the Swiss Confederation.  The next section provides for penalties for offences and disposition of forfeited goods.  One of the penalties is forfeiture of the goods. Finally, there is the repeal of the Geneva Convention Act of 1911, and there is the establishment of the society here.  I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I would have liked to have heard the Taoiseach, when introducing this Bill, pay some little tribute to the work that has been done in this country for the last 18 years by the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Irish Red Cross Organisation, though not officially recognised, receiving no loans and no grants and having no Government Committee.  All that time it has been acting as a purely voluntary organisation, and, as far as it could, doing work of the type done by the organisation which we propose to establish under this Bill.  In the various countries associated with and recognising the Convention of Geneva, <Col N="499" /> there are many countries that call their organisation the Red Cross organisation of that particular country.  The St. John Ambulance Association is an association recognised by the Geneva Convention and is the official organisation of very many countries.  It has been doing work of this kind for 15 or 16 years mainly in and about the cities.  It is not wide-flung; it is not known as far as I know in the rural counties.  But at least we have it as a very healthy framework on which to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know, if this Bill is passed, what is the intention of the Government?  Will it establish a completely new organisation or does the Government intend to build on the organisation that is here at the moment?  It would strike me as being an act of national ingratitude, if we were to throw aside the organisation that has been functioning without grant and without official recognition, without loans, but as far as it can with the voluntary assistance of workers in factories, and in the bigger type of business, of workers, male and female, who give their time to take out lessons in first-aid and give their services helping the other members of the community.  It would strike me as being base ingratitude if we were to throw them on one side now and establish a new organisation under completely new auspices.  I would like an assurance on that particular point. I think that the work done in the purely voluntary field without looking for any aid or assistance, has been well and competently done.  The St. John Ambulance Brigade has held the field and done the job when there were no Government loans or Government grants.  Doubtless now, with Government patronage, Government grants and Government loans, there will be hundreds of volunteers anxious to do the work, none of whom were anxious to do it when there was no kudos attached to the work.  I do not know the persons who constitute the managing committee of that organisation. But at athletic fixtures, in the streets of the capitals, at large race meetings and assemblies of such character, there were continuously available the voluntary <Col N="500" /> services rendered by that organisation. Now that we are officially to recognise, nationally and internationally, an Irish organisation, and with Government assistance, extend it throughout the Twenty-Six Counties, I strongly urge that it be an extension of the organisation which has been doing the work when there were no grants or loans or patronage available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy O'Higgins has repaired an omission of mine by paying a tribute to the work being done by the St. John Ambulance organisation.  Those of us who have been living in the cities know the work done by that organisation, but, on the other hand, I am not sufficiently acquainted with the work done by the Minister up to the moment in foreshadowing the way in which this new organisation is to be formed, to be able to say definitely on what basis he is going to found it.  All we are concerned here with at the moment is the power to establish such an organisation.  I take it that he will, like anybody else who is going to build up an organisation, have due regard to what exists, to the nucleus of the organisation which exists.  It is possible that that may not be found sufficiently wide for the purpose we have in mind here, but I feel confident that, in examining the situation, due regard will be had to the existing organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the organisation is formed for certain work, I do not think they will mind very much what form it takes, provided the work is being done.  I do not know that they are out for credit, so to speak.  I believe that the organisation is designed for humanitarian work, and so long as their opportunities for carrying out that work are not restricted in any way, I do not think there will be any complaint if the particular scheme suggested by Deputy O'Higgins were not actually operated.  I am not quite sure whether his suggestion is that the organisation should be called straight off &ldquo;The Irish Red Cross Society&rdquo; or not; but if the Minister were to work on a broader basis, having due regard to the work being done by this <Col N="501" /> organisation, I do not think that either the members or the directors of the organisation would have any ground for complaint.  Their purpose is to get certain work done, and so long as they are not denied the opportunity of getting it done, and if a wider field is opened to them and to others, it seems to me that it should meet their deepest wishes.  However, I am unfortunately not in a position of knowing enough about the preliminary work, and it is only preliminary work at this stage, which the Minister has been doing to be able to say exactly what is the basis on which he proposes to establish the society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will agree that it leaves Deputies in rather a difficulty.  We are asked to pass a Bill to give powers to the Minister to do certain things, either, as I suggest, to carry on and extend the organisation which is already there, or to abolish that organisation and to place something new in its place.  It is a perfectly legitimate question in discussing such a Bill to ask which is to be done and what is the intention.  The Taoiseach says, and I accept it, that he himself does not know what the intention is, but the Department over which he is presiding temporarily must have a record of the intention behind this Bill.  It would not introduce a Bill without having made up its mind what it was going to do the day after.  The intention must be there in black and white, and it is reasonable to ask that the full intention be disclosed to the Dáil before we are asked to commit ourselves to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure that there are Deputies like myself who would very heartily welcome official recognition for, and extension of, an organisation which has done highly valuable work and, on the other hand, would strongly oppose the throwing aside of that organisation in order to start a brand new organisation, no matter what it was called.  A change of name is not in any way necessary under the Geneva Convention. The organisation recognised by the Geneva Convention as the organisation of Éire could be the Irish branch of the St. John's Ambulance Association.  It is not necessary even <Col N="502" /> to change the name.  A change of name means more in most cases than just a change of name and, personally, I would never subscribe to putting through a Bill that was going to brush aside and repudiate an organisation which had done such work under such conditions and without any assistance, in order to replace it by some new organisation that starts under quite different circumstances with official support, financial and otherwise.  I think we are entitled to know what is the intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is my fault that more information is not available to the House on the matter. I may say I am largely responsible for pressing that this organisation should be formed in my capacity as Minister for External Affairs.  I was approached two or three times in my visits to Geneva and asked when was Ireland going to come into line and establish an Irish Red Cross Society. I was reminded of the convention to which we were a party back in 1929 and to which we did not seem to have, so far, given any effect.  I urged the Department of Defence that they should follow up their signature to the convention of 1929 by establishing here a Red Cross society.  The details of the basis on which the organisation should be built for the moment did not concern me.  Even as Minister responsible for bringing this in, I did not deal with it because I felt that, assuming we were prepared to establish such a society, and I did not think we were going to have any objection to its establishment, the Dáil was safeguarded by the fact that the Order establishing the organisation, its powers, its personnel and constitution, would have to be laid on the Table of the House, and if any Deputy, or Deputies, objected to the character of the organisation which it was proposed to establish, they would have their opportunity of getting the matter discussed again by the Dáil.  However, Deputy O'Higgins has approached it from a point of view I did not anticipate, that is, a fundamental objection to founding the society at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it can be sent back.  The Dáil can compel an amendment or alteration.  If the Deputy objects to the Order, as laid before the House, he can point out the reasons for his objection and what points he has to put forward in support of his objection, and if he has the support of a sufficient number of Deputies, then it would be a quite clear indication to the Government or to the Minister who made the Order that the Order has to be amended in that respect.  Therefore, I think it is not a pig in a poke; but I certainly did understand him to say&mdash;and that is a point on which we should have to have division, I am afraid&mdash;that if there were any intention here of forming a Red Cross society independent of, or other than, the St. John's Ambulance Organisation, he would oppose it.  I have said to him, and have given the only guarantee I can give, that the existing organisations and what they have been doing, and their equipment for the work, and what the Red Cross Society will do in the future, will all be examined; and must be examined by anybody who is going to establish an organisation of this kind, and that due regard will be had to that.  I do not <Col N="504" /> know enough at the moment about the organisation&mdash;its type and so on&mdash;to satisfy myself that it would in fact, as it stands, by some slight extension, be the proper basis on which to build a new society.  I could not commit myself&mdash;at any rate, at this stage&mdash;nor could I commit the Minister for whom I am acting, to such a course, but the Deputy will have his opportunity of pressing that case when the Order is made.  I will go further in that connection and will try to get further information on that particular point before the Committee Stage of the Bill in order to try to see what advance has been made in designing the new organisation. Very often, however, an enabling measure of this sort is passed without the intention to follow it up next day.  By the establishment of the organisation you can take things in order, and this is necessary no matter what organisation is going to be founded.</P>

      <P>This amendment has been moved by Deputy Norton.  It proposes to increase the allowance to be made in respect of board and lodgings to a domestic worker during the holiday period.  This is a matter of very considerable difficulty, and I should like Deputies to approach consideration of it with due regard to all the circumstances that may arise.  It is proposed in the Bill that a domestic worker&mdash;that is, a worker who gets, in addition to wages, either board and lodging or lodging only from an employer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, it is proposed in the Bill to allow to workers who are entitled to get as a reward for their labour board and lodging free from their employer, certain payments in addition to the wage agreements during the holiday period. It is almost impossible, I think, to apply general principles in a case of this kind for the purpose of determining the amount which should be allowed, because the circumstances of these workers vary considerably as between male and female workers, as between classes of workers, and even in respect of some classes of workers, according as to whether they are employed in urban or rural areas.  At the same time, I think it is much preferable to fix some definite sum in the Bill and leave it at that rather than try to vary the allowance between classes of workers or areas of the country. The allowance fixed in the Bill is 1/- per day in the urban areas or 7d. in <Col N="506" /> the rural areas.  I recognise that that is not a very generous allowance, but I recognise also that many employers of these domestic workers will find it very difficult to pay more.</P>
      <P>We have had the question of domestic servants in agricultural households raised here before.  If we are going to give these domestic servants in agricultural households the right to annual leave and provide that they must get some payment from their employers in lieu of board and lodging, then I think we must have regard to the circumstances of the agricultural householders themselves and consider the amount which could be paid in cash by such people to their domestic servants during the holiday period.  As most Deputies are aware, it is a much more difficult matter for certain types of agriculturists to make any payment in cash than to make payment in kind. They would find it a harder matter to provide 5/- or 6/- a week in cash than to provide board and lodging.  That factor must, I think, influence Deputies in their decision as to the amount of the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decided to propose the amount set out in the Bill recognising that in some cases it may be regarded as inadequate but feeling that it is the most that could reasonably be imposed.  I had thought of alternative systems, of setting up tribunals, of allowing the district courts to be brought in, of having some form of external authority to determine the amount to be allowed in individual cases, but I think that would be a cumbersome and undesirable arrangement.  We had an arrangement of that nature in relation to the Shops Act, but I am not sure that we were wise in that.  I am certain that it would be unwise in the case of domestic servants.  Therefore, the principle of fixing the amount in the Bill should be accepted by the Dáil. What the amount is to be has to be determined by our joint wisdom.  I think the amounts in the Bill are reasonable, though by no means generous.  They probably do not represent the actual cost of purchasing board and lodging which domestic servants receive in the average case, but at the same time we must have due regard to the circumstances <Col N="507" /> of all the cases that must be covered by this part of the Bill.  I am, therefore, disposed to resist Deputy Norton's amendment to increase these amounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied, but I ask the Deputy to consider the case of the small agricultural householder who has to provide a holiday for his domestic servant.  In the case of that householder, I think most Deputies will recognise that to provide a sum in excess of that would be a substantial hardship on the farmer, something that he would object to far more than the mere provision of the holiday in accordance with the general provisions.</P>

Surely any farm labourer is in a worse position than a person who is able to keep a domestic servant.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to answer that question straight away.  The section as it stands merely gives the Minister power to prescribed the keeping of records.  I would, naturally, try to utilise that power as little as possible and only where the circumstances proved it to be necessary to avoid evasions of the Act.  In the case of householders it may prove to be necessary to have some positive step taken to make domestic servants aware of their rights.  Apart from that, I do not think it would be necessary to prescribe <Col N="509" /> records, but it may be that something like that will have to be done.  However, my inclination would be against doing it unless the necessity for it were clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The evil inherent in such a proposal is that, if the Minister required certain notices or schedules to be exposed in a place in the domestic circle where they will be readily available to domestic servants, there will flow from that regulation an obligation on the Minister to enforce it, which means that inspectors will have to be rambling into persons' kitchens to see whether the notice is displayed or not. There is a provision that no inspector will have the right to enter your house unless the Minister certifies that there is good reason for it, but how is the Minister going to satisfy himself that these regulations are exposed, as he may ordain they shall be exposed under this section, unless he sends in to see? I think the Minister himself has recognised the danger of treating the domestic servant as you would treat the factory worker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  I am urging that we should except domestic service for the simple reason that you cannot make regulations without taking steps to see that these regulations are enforced. How you are going to make regulations concerning what is being done in my kitchen or the Minister's kitchen, without giving access to the inspectors to see that these regulations are going to be carried into force, I do not know. I think the Minister was wise when he indicated his unwillingness to trespass on the domestic circle under this Act.  I think he should be reluctant to take power here to require householders, as he is requiring factory owners, to expose notices, because representations will be made to him that these regulations are not being enforced, that they are not being carried out by the householder and he will either have to say to the person making these representations: &ldquo;It is impossible to enforce the regulation,&rdquo; or else take steps to enforce it.  I do <Col N="510" /> not think he will be able to say: &ldquo;I cannot enforce my own regulation.&rdquo;  If he takes steps to enforce it, he must authorise inspectors to enter a householder's premises and I think that is a very undesirable arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the Minister is vested with power to authorise an inspector to enter on private premises but an inspector would only have power to enter a private dwelling-house on a certificate from the Minister in each individual case that he has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been committed.  National Health Insurance inspectors have to deal with domestic servants.  They have a much more onerous task, I imagine, than the inspectors under this Bill would have, and I do not know that the public have suffered much inconvenience in consequence of the activities of the inspectors of the Department of Local Government and Public Health in that connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Whether it is administratively necessary to have this power or not I am not in a position to say, but I do take this occasion to remind the Minister that it might lead to very grave abuse.  If he does prescribe that certain notices must be displayed on the premises, a discontented domestic may complain on her being dismissed that the notice was never displayed, whereupon the duty devolves on the Minister to enforce the regulation.  A complaint has been made and he is practically coerced into sending an inspector into the house.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to confirm and give statutory effect to an Agreement made between certain assurance companies for the transfer of their life assurance business and their industrial assurance business to a single company, to make provision for divers matters arising out of or consequential on the said Agreement, including the making of similar agreements by other assurance companies, and to amend the law relating to assurance business, it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the issue and payment out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of all sums payable by the Minister for Finance under such Act to the Terminating Company defined in such Act in respect of &ldquo;the deficiency&rdquo; referred to in such Act;</P>
      <P>(2)  the Charge on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of the principal of and interest on any securities issued by the Minister for Finance under such Act for the purpose of borrowing to meet payments as aforesaid; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> (3)  the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of the amount of any stamp duties authorised by such Act to be refunded to the said Terminating Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Norton, I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (1) to delete the words &ldquo;issue and payment out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think the reason for the amendment is obvious.  The aim of it is to preserve the right of review by this House of the payments that have to be made. If the payments are made out of the Central Fund we will not be in a position to ascertain the amount, or have any method of exercising a check on them.  I think in view of everything that has arisen in connection with this transaction, there is a special case for maintaining the power of this House over the payments to be made.  It would be well that, from time to time, we should have the fullest information on this matter, and have an opportunity in this.  House of expressing our opinion as to how the amalgamation was working, and, above all, of ascertaining the exact amount of the liability in connection with the amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely on the grounds stated by the Deputy that, I think, the amendment must be refused. The one thing the House cannot do is to put itself in a position to reconsider its decision by taking power to refuse to vote the moneys contemplated.  If the House wants to reject the scheme, now is the time to do it, but if they do not reject it now they cannot keep themselves in the position of being able to change their minds later.  If the Bill is passed before the 31st December, the agreement, which is the Schedule to the Bill, will have statutory force and become binding on each of the four participating companies and on the Terminating Company.  It will also be open to other insurance companies to adopt its provisions and <Col N="516" /> to be bound by those provisions, subject to compliance with the procedure laid down in the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>It would be unreasonable to ask that any of these companies should incur expenditure, or undertake other obligations or liabilities in connection with the agreement, unless it was clear beyond doubt and beyond question that the sum required to make good the deficiency would be forthcoming from State funds.  The Oireachtas has its opportunity now of accepting or rejecting the proposed scheme of amalgamation, but if it does accept it, it must bind itself to contribute as laid down in the agreement.  It must, in fact, divest itself of the right to change its mind hereafter, just as after the passing of the Bill the interested companies are deprived of the right to change their minds.</P>
      <P>On the narrower ground of financial procedure, there is no question that the sum involved should be charged upon the Central Fund.  Although the payment is not exactly a subscription for shares in the company, yet shares will be issued to the Minister for Finance in consideration of his having made the payment.  It has always been the practice to charge on the Central Fund any payment made for shares. That was done in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Corporation, the Irish Sugar Company and other similar organisations.  The amount to be paid out on account of the deficiency is not a variable amount but a definite sum to be ascertained in accordance with the explicit procedure laid down in the agreement.  On these grounds I am afraid I must oppose the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has very skilfully evaded the reasons that have been advanced in support of this amendment.  In effect, what he asks is that we should assent to shoulder a liability the extent of which we do not know.  I think that very good reasons have been advanced for the amendment.  We are not even sure that the liability on the State and on the country will end with this particular payment.  Possibly, further payments will have to be made.  Is it suggested that we should remain entirely <Col N="517" /> in the dark as to the extent of the sums to be voted to subsidise this company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the case.  We cannot give the precise amount, but the Dáil knows that it will not exceed £500,000, because there is a limit prescribed in the Principal Act. It knows the procedure by which the amount is to be determined.  If Deputies object to that particular provision in the agreement, now is the time for them to voice their objection and to reject the agreement.  If they accept the agreement and enact the Bill, they cannot change their minds later after the consequences which flow from the enactment of the agreement have begun to be felt.  They can make up their minds now as to what action they are going to take on the agreement, but having made up their minds they must divest themselves of the right to change their minds, just as the companies who are concerned with the agreement will also be deprived of the power to change their minds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on this. Every one of the operating companies concerned in this agreement was opposed to the passage of the Insurance Bill, 1936.  They wanted to be let carry on.  They still want to be let carry on. The Bill was carried by this House in the teeth of the opposition of every insurance company in this country. The insurance companies had two alternatives.  One was to obstruct the Oireachtas and to refuse to operate in any way, or to tell the Minister that he would have to amalgamate them compulsorily because they did not believe in the policy that the State was sponsoring.  The other line was, having made their representations to Dáil Eireann and having had their representations overruled by An Dáil, to take the Bill and do their best to give effect to it.  They did consult the Minister and the officers in the Minister's Department.  They sat down and drafted the scheme which the Minister now recommends to Dáil Eireann.  The critics of the companies cannot have it <Col N="518" /> both ways.  The Oireachtas would not let the companies alone, but insisted on the companies drafting a scheme. Now the companies have drafted a scheme.  They would much prefer if they had been allowed to carry on on their own.  The Dáil having forced amalgamation on the companies, there is no use in anyone getting up and saying that the insurance companies are making a good thing out of it.  They never did want an Insurance Bill.  If the Dáil is prepared to repeal all the legislation relating to insurance passed during the last twelve months, the insurance companies will be delighted. It is ridiculous for their critics to want both ends of the stick, having forced an Insurance Bill on the companies, and to suggest that this scheme contains some hidden privilege for the insurance companies.</P>
      <P>This scheme is the logical consequence of the Insurance Act that was passed.  The House passed that in the full knowledge that money would have to be found to make up the actuarial deficiency which existed at the moment.  The position of the insurance companies is that if you leave them alone the actuarial deficiency will disappear.  The companies will become not only actually solvent but actuarially solvent.  If you want to interfere now, you do so in the full knowledge that you are dealing with a situation where there is an actuarial deficiency, which must be made up if you want to secure actuarial solvency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this occasion to underline the fact, that if you interfered with the strongest English companies in the insurance business, at the same stage of their careers, as you are interfering with the Irish companies, you would find that the actuarial deficiency was far greater in the great English companies than exists in the Irish companies to-day.  The great English companies were not interfered with in the early stages, and they became some of the wealthiest corporations in the world.  The Irish companies, if left alone, would become as wealthy as the circumstances of this country would permit.  It is the choice of this House &mdash;not of the Irish companies&mdash;that Oireachtas Eireann should interfere <Col N="519" /> with their business, and at this stage, take upon itself willingly, the liability for actuarial deficiency, which the insurance companies say would have disappeared if their business was allowed to go on in the normal way. There is no use saying now, because Oireachtas Eireann wanted to insist on doing so, that Oireachtas Eireann has something to complain of.  If Oireachtas <Col N="520" /> Eireann wants to repeal the Insurance Act, and to let the insurance companies go on as they were, they consent.  If not, it is Oireachtas Eireann's own choosing if it wants to take on the actuarial responsibility at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of this section, the striking part of the discussion on this Bill has been the apparent inability of the Minister to give us any indication as to what sum of State money will be necessary to financially rehabilitate the companies and to restore solvency to them.  We have been repeatedly told that this is <Col N="521" /> a Bill designed to protect the policy holders, although the more one reads the Bill the more it becomes apparent that other people besides the policy holders, and chiefly the directors, have been very adequately protected. So far, however, we have not been able to get from the Minister any indication as to the amount of State money which it will be necessary to utilise in order to prop up whatever solvency exists in these companies.  I would like to know from the Minister now whether he can give the House any approximate idea as to what amount of State money will be required to do that, and what the position relatively is of each of the participating companies who are parties to this agreement. Can we have any precise information from the Minister as to which of the companies are solvent, which of them are insolvent, and what is the degree of insolvency measured in terms of cash?  That is information we ought to have, and the House ought to be in possession of that information in order that it will know to what type of cheque it is signing its name when it passes Section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to make reference on the Bill, and that is the agreement proper. I notice on reading the scheduled agreement that it has been negotiated by a number of persons representing the participating companies.  The persons who have negotiated the agreement are directors and, under the terms of the agreement, are going to receive very substantial compensation.  I take it that all the participating companies have capital, and that all the capital has not been subscribed by the directors, that there are individual shareholders and that, under the articles of association of the company, the directors have some responsibility to the shareholders.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he is satisfied, before asking the House to ratify and give legislative effect to this agreement, that the directors are not doing anything in negotiating this agreement which is in conflict with their duties and responsibilities to the shareholders, and whether they are being given any immunity from litigation at the instigation of a policy <Col N="522" /> holder or at the instigation of a shareholder, litigation to which they might be liable if it were not for the fact that the State gave statutory authority to this agreement.  These are considerations upon which the House should be informed.  We ought to have some information on these points, namely, the degree of solvency of any of the participating companies and whether the directors are entitled to negotiate this agreement and whether, in doing so, they are acting within their articles of association, and with due regard to their responsibility to the shareholders and the capital of the participating company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the Second Reading I raised the question of what amount the State was being asked to put up in connection with this transaction.  I find that the Minister stated that the sum would be approximately £500,000.  This particular clause that we are now considering is to validate the agreement.  There is a very large sum of money involved and, presumably, the Minister is fully aware of the importance of having on the Board of this terminating company directors on whom a very great responsibility will rest in future years, in fact, from the inception.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered, in connection with this matter, that the names that were before the public in connection with the directorate included two, one of whom had experience of fire and accident and the other, if I am not mistaken, was an insurance expert.  In what manner his expert knowledge is specially directed, I am not in a position to say.  This insurance company will have very large sums of money to invest and it is quite clear that the persons appointed should be persons having more of a knowledge of insurance business than the country has had experience of in connection with Irish companies during the last 20 years.  Has the Minister considered appointing a person fully experienced in life assurance and industrial insurance, or is there any such person in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the history of the most successful undertakings of all kinds, particularly <Col N="523" /> in the older-established countries, individuals were largely responsible for the earlier operations of successful companies.  In our experience here in recent years we have gone in for the synthetic type of director rather than the natural growth of a director.  Having regard, first of all, to the importance to policy holders of the revenue that is going to be collected, the premiums that are going to be collected in future years, and the large amount of money that the State is putting up to facilitate and make a success of this undertaking, I think the House is entitled to some indication from the Minister as to the type of directors he intends to appoint, whether they will be merely part-time directors, whether any one of them will be a whole-time director and, generally, the steps that be proposes to take to ensure that there will not be more money lost.</P>
    <P>During the last 20 years we have been told about the great advantages that Irish insurance was conferring upon the country.  It is quite clear from this measure that people more or less recognise that Irish insurance was not a success during that period.  However, we can let that pass.  But steps ought to be taken now to ensure that, so far as it is humanly possible, the management and the directorate of this new company will be composed of persons qualified to do the work, competent to look after the moneys that are being entrusted to them, efficient in management and careful to husband the resources, not only of the policy holders, but of what is left of the shareholders and the money that the State is going to put up.  If this is going to be merely one of those nominations to public companies that we have seen during the last few years, then I think it would be better for us to vote against the measure now than to allow it to pass.  I am quite sure that the Minister is fully aware of the grave responsibility that rests on him and the Government in this connection.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton made reference to what he described as my inability to give, in his own words, any indication of the amount required to be furnished by the State to make good <Col N="524" /> the deficiencies of the amalgamating companies.  I do not think that is a fair description of what I said here on the last occasion.  I cannot give, for obvious reasons, a precise figure, but I gave an indication which I think was reasonably good in the circumstances. The Deputy said I gave no indication, but that is not true.  It is anticipated that the amount required to be furnished by the State will be approximately £500,000.  But the amount of the deficiencies of the companies will be calculated as at the transfer date, a date several months ahead, and nobody can say now what precisely will be the position of these companies at that date.</P>
      <P>There has been a fall in security values recently.  That is going to affect the position of the companies and it might increase the deficiencies, if there are deficiencies.  If that fall continues between now and the transfer date, it will further increase the deficiencies.  If, on the other hand, the security value should rise, then the assets of the companies will appreciate in value and the deficiencies will be less.  It is not possible to say now what the precise figure will be, nor will that be possible until the transfer date itself.  The valuation of the assets and liabilities of these companies could not have been started until the agreement was signed.  It is now in progress. It will not be completed for some time to come.  Therefore, more definite information cannot be given to the House at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to be clear as to what precisely we are talking about.  These companies will have between them an actuarial deficiency amounting approximately to £500,000.  The State is going to furnish £500,000.  It is not throwing in £500,000 to make good a deficiency; it is not money which the State is going to lose.  The State is going to get for it shares in this company, shares which will have a definite value, an appreciating value, shares which may in the course of time become a real asset, an asset valued in excess of the amount which the State will contribute.  In so far as these companies are concerned, because of the existence of a deficiency, the amount of shares in the Terminating Company <Col N="525" /> which will be transferred to the amalgamating company will be reduced. The shares instead of going to the amalgamating company will go to the Minister for Finance.  If the company has no deficiency, if it is able to transfer assets instead of liabilities, then the shares will become the property of the shareholders of that company. On the other hand, if the company cannot transfer assets equivalent to its liabilities, the deficiency will be made good by the Minister for Finance who will get the shares.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the compensation payable to directors.  In so far as compensation is payable to directors or members of staffs or for any other purpose, the assets available for transfer will be reduced and, because they will be reduced, the number of shares to be transferred will be less.  The policy-holders will not be affected by that.  They will gain in so far as they will be going to a company about whose solvency there will be no doubt; whereas doubts might reasonably be entertained in respect of a great number of them at the present time.  We protect the companies adequately against the possibility of legal actions being taken against them later by policy-holders or shareholders. We set out to ensure that the companies will have full power to enter into the amalgamation.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  These directors are acting for the shareholders who elected them.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the directors of the new <Col N="526" /> company.  This Bill and the agreements contemplate the establishment of two companies.  One of these is being constituted the permanent company. The board of the permanent company has not yet been constituted. Deputies must not come to the conclusion that because certain people have been chosen to act on the board of the permanent company, that those persons are not as competent as any persons in life insurance business to look after the type of business that the permanent company will have to do. The company will have very large resources. It will have a large amount of money at its disposal for investments. The amount of business to be done will be very big.  The main business of the company will be to see that its resources are properly invested.  It is not contemplated that any director other than the managing director will be whole-time.  The arrangement that we contemplate is that the managing director of the permanent company will be a person associated with life insurance business in this country in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the position in which the British and other foreign companies were when they were at the same stage of their development as the Irish companies are now.  Those British and foreign companies amassed large fortunes, but they amassed them by methods which we could not now allow to be practised. Deputy Dillon said that if the Act of 1936 had not been passed, Irish companies would amass large fortunes in the same way as those British and foreign companies did.  But it is because the public suffered in the process of the amassing of those fortunes by insurance companies that legislation of that kind to protect the public was introduced here, following similar legislation in other countries.  We cannot allow the conditions under which British and foreign companies amassed great fortunes to be reproduced here. That is what the 1936 Act tried to secure, and that is what this Bill seeks to implement.  The element of competition, which was the originating cause of the abuses in the working of the insurance companies, can to a large <Col N="527" /> extent be eliminated.  We have got a board of directors that are not merely competent to carry on life insurance work, but to do so on the lines I have indicated.  I have no doubt they will be successful in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister what is to be the guiding principle in the investment of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Security, actual security in the assets of the company in which the money is invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on this matter.  There have been a great many flotations in this country in recent years and I presume we will have many more of them.  In the event of this board of directors being faced with the prospect of getting shares in one of these companies whose prosperity depends upon legislative facilities being granted to them, is the money to be invested in such companies? One of the great advantages which the British companies had was that their investments could be made in connection with industrial and other activities which were expanding in such a way that they were of considerable advantage to the insurance companies. In this country a certain amount of money has been lost.  The Minister said that I had made a mistake in saying that the policy holders' money was lost.  Well if it was not lost it was in grave danger <Col N="528" /> and difficulty until this measure was introduced.</P>
      <P>We need not have debating points about this Bill.  I was quite aware that there were two companies, the terminating company and the permanent company.  As far as I know there is no statutory power to appoint the members of the permanent company yet nor does the Minister's name appear on the agreement though he is a party to it.  I would like the Minister to give the House some assurance, in connection with the investments to be made, that they are not going to be investments which will arise out of flotations within the next three or four or five years.  In other words that the money will be invested in something in which there is more than reasonable security of its being there when required.  I am inclined to disagree with the Minister in regard to the valuation of the assets.  It is quite true that there has been a fall in the market value of some securities.</P>
      <P>Take War Loan as a case in point. It may go to 106, but well-managed companies write it down in their balances as 100, even though it might be at 106, and if they do that when it is 106, they have a right to do it when it is 99.  It is more than likely that, when the valuation is made, it will be made when the crisis is not so pronounced as at present, and, in any case, it is a small sum&mdash;5 per cent. or 6 per cent. at the most.  That is one point on which I would like some assurance&mdash;that the money is to be invested as if it were the property of the directors themselves, as if they were entirely dependent on it, and that it is not a speculative investment. Secondly, I should like to know, in connection with the distribution of shares, what will happen in the case of broken amounts.  The shares are valued at 2/- each.  It might happen that there was a company&mdash;there is no such company but let us assume there is&mdash;with £20,000 of present capital.  If it happens that the actual valuation of the company turns out to be £1,000, it is not possible to divide £1,000 amongst £20,000 worth of shareholders with 2/- shares.  What is going to happen if each share were valued at 1/1?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The assets are the insurance funds of these companies. They have not merely their subscribed capital, but the accumulated funds which have been constituted out of the premiums paid by policy holders. These funds may not be equal to the liabilities they have to policy holders, but they nevertheless represent amounts substantially in excess of the subscribed capital of each company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand, but surely if there is a deficiency which the Minister estimates at £500,000, the paid-up capital of those companies must be very small.  It must have disappeared. There is a paid-up capital in the whole lot of them of about £90,000.  Obviously, if the Minister is going to put £500,000 into the deficiency, the £90,000 must have disappeared. I can give the Minister the figures from memory.  There is one company with £45,000, a second with £17,000, a third with £16,000, and a fourth with £12,500.  The sum total is round about £90,000.  Now there is a deficiency.  Surely the first call on the deficiency, unless we are all mistaken, is whatever capital has been paid-up. The second, then, will be the Minister's. I do not want to take any one of these companies so as not to give any indication of what my view is as to the relative solvency of any one of them, but it could so happen that there was but one-sixteenth of the capital of any one of them still available as a result of this formula, and, in that case, what is to be done where the shares, assuming the whole of the share capital is distributed among the shareholders, will be worth, say, 1/4 a share?  Is there any provision made for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy asked me what was to be the policy <Col N="530" /> of this company with regard to the investment of its funds, I answered in one word: &ldquo;Security.&rdquo;  That is the answer I must give him now.  I want to make it clear that this company is not being constituted, with a large fund available for investment, for the purpose of creating that fund, with the ultimate idea of having that money made available for Irish industrial enterprise or any other purpose, however beneficial or desirable.  That fund is the property of the policy holders.  It is their security that they will be paid the amount they have insured when their policies fall due and, therefore, the primary policy of the company must be to protect these funds.  Its sole purpose will be to see that these funds are so invested that they will not depreciate in value, but, on the contrary, will appreciate, or, at any rate, to ensure that the funds will be available when the policies issued by the amalgamated companies fall due for payment, so that the policy holders will get what is due to them in full.  It is not possible to contemplate a company operating on any other basis, and if there was the slightest suggestion of funds being used for the purpose of speculation, or any other similar risky purpose, the immediate intervention of the Government would be called for to check that tendency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not assume that people are all going to go suddenly mad.  That is the essential idea behind the whole scheme&mdash;to ensure that this separate company will be set up which will operate a closed fund to which the policies of the amalgamated companies will be subscribed, and against which policies there will be put, either from the assets of the amalgamated companies or the State, funds which will enable these liabilities to be covered in full. That is the primary purpose of the scheme, so that policy holders of the amalgamated companies will be secure, irrespective of what else may happen. Another company is being set up which will carry on the business of industrial <Col N="531" /> insurance in the country.  It will issue no policies, but will act as agent for the terminating company and do the actual business of collecting premiums, dealing with policy holders and so forth.  Only the permanent company will do new business.  The terminating company will do no new business whatever, but it will continue in existence until all these policies which have been transferred by this agreement have been discharged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will continue in existence so long as any of its liabilities continue in existence.  As soon as the last claim on the last policy has been met, the company will have no further reason for remaining in existence and it will terminate at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the Minister's statement on that point, although I have not got that impression from my interpretation of it.  I want to bring up the particular point again.  Apparently this terminating company will get a huge slice of funds, a considerable sum of money, into its hands.  The Government is going to put up some money, and, if it is going to put up some money, the directors and management must come into possession of very considerable sums. That money will require to be invested. Could the Minister give the House any information as to the anticipated interest upon which the scheme is based?  Is it 3½ per cent.?</P>

    <Col N="532" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I think 3½ per cent. is mentioned.  In that case, presumably, it ought not to be impossible to invest the money.  Now, could the Minister point out any clause in the agreement which shows that these investments have got to be reported, in some way or another, to some Government Department?  The Minister of Finance is putting in some very considerable sums of money.  He has nominees, but there is no direct contact between his nominees and himself, nor is there anything to show that there is any further contact between them, once he has appointed his nominees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Of course, that is the function of the company.  The Deputy's question, in a sense, amounts to asking whether there is any danger of a company, in connection with which the Minister for Finance has nominees and so on, engaging in, say, the manufacture of boots and shoes instead of engaging in the manufacture of cement, which it was the purpose of the company to manufacture. There is, of course, in the 1936 Act, full provision for the submission of returns by the company to the Minister for Finance, and also, I think, for the publication of the returns to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the question of bringing in cement or boots or shoes.  All I want is to be assured that the money is not going to be lost.  It does not matter whether a company is producing either one or the other as long as these particular spheres of activity depend upon statutory privileges that are given by the law.  What I am concerned with is this.  We have at the present moment, by our statutory enactments, probably approached more nearly to the totalitarian States as regards regimentation, inspection, and so on, than any other country in Europe.  We have it in local government in connection with the local authorities.  We watch everything they do.  We send down inspectors to watch what they are doing and to see how they are doing it, and whether they are acting according to the Minister's desires, and so on.  The Minister appoints a nominee in this case.  There is no provision in this measure, either in the agreement or that portion of the Bill which gives statutory authority to the agreement, to ensure that those people will report to the Minister on what they are doing or how they are doing it.  Having lost <Col N="534" /> all this money or, if the Minister objects to that particular terminology, having found that by reason of what has happened in the last 20 years, we have now got to put up £500,000&mdash; I want to ensure that that money is not going to be lost, or any part of it. That is not unreasonable.  I am sure the Minister will not say that that is unreasonable.  If there is anything which qualifies the Minister or entitles him to get a report regularly, week by week or month by month, whenever investments are made, or according to whatever suits the convenience of the administration either of his own Department or the Department of Finance, I want information to be given to them as to what is being done with regard to the money or the investment of the money.  I think the Minister will agree that that is not unreasonable. That is not here, however, and I am concerned about that.</P>
      <P>I suppose the quotations of our own Stock Exchange can be regarded as reliable.  We have further the question of the approval that is being given to the flotation of loans by local authorities.  Take the case of the two most important local authorities in the country, the City of Dublin and the City of Cork.  There is a four per cent. investment there.  It has only one danger which is that, by reason of the Government's policy, these two municipalities now have got to borrow that portion of the indebtedness, for which the State is responsible for a proportion, and consequently their liability is increased, but other than that, and the difficulty of cashing that particular security, assuming that large sums were acquired, there is a four per cent. investment there.  Now, presumably, the Minister will agree with me that an investment of that sort is safer than putting the money into a business which has to endure all the ups and downs that are inseparable from commercial activities.  I want him first of all to assure the House that he will amend this Bill to the extent that the nominee in each case will produce a monthly return of the investments made by the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is suggesting that the responsibility for all decisions with regard to investments is going to be taken by the Minister for Finance and not by the board of the company.  I think that the people responsible must be the board, and I think that it would rather tend to weaken the sense of responsibility of the board if they were to be subject to constant supervision of the kind the Deputy suggests, whether by the Department of Finance or the Minister. I think that there would be a tendency to attach responsibility for bad investments to the shoulders of the Department or of the Minister. You have the obligation of the Minister to select persons in whom he has confidence and to appoint them, and if at any stage the Minister for Finance is not satisfied that the business of the company is being properly conducted, the resultant remedy is to get new directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, when the damage is done.  We appoint professional men all over this country.  We have them appointed by local authorities, and, not even that, but by the Local Appointments Commission.  Not satisfied with that, however, we send around other professional men to examine and report on what they have done, to check them in every respect and to point out, week after week, and month after month, certain things which the Minister thinks should be done in a certain way.  Now, here we have a matter concerning our money to the extent of £500,000, and the objection is that the Minister would be saddled with responsibility for bad investments, supposing they are made. Why should he not be?  What are we asking?  We are asking that, if £10,000 worth or £50,000 or £100,000 worth of Dublin Corporation stock is purchased by this insurance company, the Minister should be informed about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> Further, if the Port and Docks Board has an issue of £50,000 at 4 per cent. that the Minister will hear about that.  Does not the Minister know, or has he not learned even during the last couple of months, that certain activities have been examined by an expert commission and that there has been a severe judgment in respect of them?  We have put up this company or that company, or this body or that body, and if the only objection to making the members of that body report what they are doing is that it is putting the responsibility on the Minister, are we only to hear about the damage when we have to meet the bill?</P>

      <P>There is a Department of Finance.  I do not regard that as a political entity, although it may be used as such; any Department of State can be used as such.  I am not regarding it as such when examining these investments.  What I am concerned with is this: that once the Minister puts his hall-mark on a man, no matter where he gets him, the Minister says to us: &ldquo;Do not interfere with him; the Minister discovered him; he must not be criticised; he must not report to the Minister; we are not entitled to hear anything about what he is doing; he is the Minister's appointee; if he loses every penny we have, that is his loss; we will kick him out when it is lost, but until it is lost, he will remain, he will be immune from criticism, immune from examination, and immune from giving any information to the people who are the custodians of the money put into this.&rdquo;</P>

Does he think that these shareholders go to the annual meeting and say: &ldquo;I am going to vote for John Smith and Patrick Burke to be directors of the company, but they must write me a letter every week telling me what they are buying and what they are selling and how many gallons of oil they have in stock; I must have the right as a shareholder to say, `You must not buy this or sell that'; I must veto your decisions&rdquo;? Does he think any company could be carried on in that way or that it is a sound method of business?  The Minister for Finance is in the position of a shareholder in this company.  He appoints the directors who are responsible to him as a shareholder, but the day-to-day activities of the company must be directed by them.  If you are to have a system in which you say to <Col N="538" /> the directors: &ldquo;We do not trust you; you must not do a thing with the assets of the company without prior sanction&rdquo;, why have any company at all? Why not transfer the assets and liabilities to the Department of Finance and let the officials of the Department deal with them?  It would be a much simpler arrangement.</P>

      <P>What the Minister said is correct, with this difference, that if I had money to invest, the first thing I would do before investing it would be to have a look at the balance sheet and at the previous one, if I could get it, and the one before that, if I could get it.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us about certain circumstances.  These are not comparable circumstances at all.  I told him what I would do and would recommend anyone to do.  I have very little money to invest and that would not concern me very much. I would look at the last three balance sheets and then at the directors, and if I were satisfied with both and were asked for my advice I would say &ldquo;Yes, you can invest there&rdquo;.  What are we doing?  We have not got that company at all yet.  There is an untried, inexperienced and uninitiated directorate that exists only in the Minister's mind at present.  We are asked, before we know anything about their competence or experience of management or their usefulness on a board, to put our entire confidence in them.  In other words, in one case I look at something that had got a natural growth and had years of business behind it.  In the other we are asked to accept this synthetic company about which nobody knows anything.  Into its hands are going to be given £300,000 or £400,000, possibly £500,000, and once the Minister's hall-mark is on them as directors nobody will say a word.  He is to get no information about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would advise the Minister in this case to talk to people who have some experience, who know something about business-he is not speaking now in Thomas Street or any place in his constituency&mdash;or, <Col N="539" /> alternatively, to his own Ministry who know nothing about business. I want to know has the Minister any objection to getting a return made to the Ministry of Finance regarding investments made, and, if he has, let him ask the Ministry of Finance whether it would not be a good thing to do.  If they are not politically minded they will tell him.</P>

      <P>I want to get some further information as to the precise commitments under this Bill.  We are told by the Minister that the approximate amount of the insolvency of the four companies is £500,000; it may be more or less at the date of the transfer, according to actuarial examination.  Is that £500,000 of money to be utilised solely for the purpose of making good the existing deficit on the four companies? Are we to take it, therefore, if the State raises £500,000 and hands it over to the directors of the new terminating company that that is going to be used immediately only to restore the solvency of the companies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us assume that three of them are&mdash;that may satisfy Deputy Dillon.  I take it that the capital of the three insolvent companies is gone and, if a dividend is being paid to-day, it is being paid on notional capital and not actual capital. How can an insolvent company have capital?  How can an insurance company, transacting business still, have capital while having a deficit?  Surely the capital has been utilised long ago in trying to get business or to prop up its existing financial basis.  I understand <Col N="540" /> the position is that in valuing the assets of an insurance company the actuary sees what are the liabilities of the company under the policies which it has written, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, what are the assets. An examination of the policies may disclose that the liabilities of the company amount to £1,000,000.  Then he looks at the other side of the account to see what there is against the £1,000,000.  After totalling these up, he may discover that they have £900,000 on the other side.  That includes the capital.</P>
      <P>In that set of circumstances, the company is insolvent to the extent of £100,000.  When you put £100,000 into that company you have nothing more than the solvency of the company.  The £100,000 which you inject into the company does not create an asset.  It may create a lien on the company in the form of shares.  But what assets are there against the £500,000 capital which the State is going to put up seeing that, in fact, the £500,000 is going to be utilised to make good a deficit?  Does the Minister hope ever to get back this £500,000 which the State is putting up?  Does he ever hope to get dividends on it?  What makes him talk in such eulogistic terms of the investment in this company?  Is all the £500,000 to be utilised to make good the deficit or is any portion of it reserved as capital for the terminating company or the other company mentioned here?  That is information which has not yet been given to the House.  We are entitled to know what is the position of the State in regard to this investment.  I regarded the 1936 Insurance Act as a desperate remedy for a still more desperate disease.  The companies were in danger of insolvency and unless the policy-holders were to be dealt with in an unfair manner something had to be done.  To what extent are we now committing the State in investments in the new companies and what are the prospects that the State will ever retrieve any portion of the money which it is now going to invest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last evening, in the few moments that were at my disposal, I dealt with some of the difficulties with which the agricultural community had to contend, in the last few years.  The amendment which has been tabled, I think, provides for the first time the fullest possible scope of inquiry into the difficulties which beset the agricultural community and provides a means of exploring various avenues to effect some remedy for these difficulties.  When land has been denuded of stock, almost the first thing that a farmer does is to try to skim the cream off his land by resorting to tillage.  There is no question but that while in the two crops, wheat and beet, our farmers have succeeded, perhaps, in providing a temporary remedy for some of their difficulties, these crops have exhausted a good deal of the fertility of the soil.  One of the surest means of providing for future production of wealth is to maintain the fertility of the soil.  Any farm that has been maintained at a reasonable degree of fertility was able, perhaps, to meet difficulties which beset it at lean periods or periods when a slump occurred.  Our difficulties, however, have been accentuated by the fact that almost every article, whether it be manures or feeding-stuffs, was at the very highest possible price at a period when the agricultural community were least able to provide the means of purchasing it.  If the commission which is to be set up did nothing else but devise some means of providing cheap fertilising elements and cheap feeding-stuffs, it would certainly fulfil a very important function in the agricultural economy of this country.  Not alone can the commission explore the means of helping our farmers, it can also investigate the agricultural policy of the Government during the past few years and possibly the agricultural policy of <Col N="543" /> the previous Government and express an opinion as to which was the better means of helping the farmers.</P>
      <P>We see driven to our ports large droves of well-bred heifers, bred by the experience and the enterprise of some of our best stock-breeders in this country. That is one element that we have to regard as an asset for the agricultural community.  It is one that has enabled our farmers to stand up to the difficulties with which they have had to contend.  The price which our farmers had to pay for feeding-stuffs in consequence of the maize-meal mixture and the high milling charges which accompanied the production of that particular form of feeding-stuff, and also the very heavy impositions by way of tariff on agricultural machinery which resulted in some cases in doubling the price of that machinery, formed another phase of the difficulties with which the farmer had to contend. The fertility of the soil is one of the chief sources upon which we have to depend to maintain the agricultural output and the wealth of this country.  Without a sufficient supply of manure for the soil, whether that be farmyard manure or artificial manure, our whole agricultural economy collapses. I have succeeded myself in almost doubling the stock-carrying capacity of my farm over a period of 35 years as a result of heavy manuring and top dressing and laying down land with a high-class mixture of grass seed.  That is a form of agriculture which it is necessary to pursue if the most is to be made of our agricultural land which forms the chief wealth of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Great War an Agricultural Bill was introduced in Great Britain which, while providing various facilities for farmers, including agricultural credits and various other means of helping the farmers, provided also a penalty for bad farming.  That penalty was to take away the farm from the bad farmer.  In this country we have a different system.  The bad farmer usually collapses and becomes bankrupt, and eventually the farm becomes derelict.  There are more of these derelict farms in this country to-day <Col N="544" /> than the Minister for Lands can afford to regard with any degree of pleasure.  That is a problem to which the Minister will be required to give his attention in a very short time.  The provision of credits is also a very great necessity for our farmers.  That matter has been mentioned in the motion, and it will also form part of the inquiry that is to be held by the commission. There is a very urgent and great need for that inquiry.  A credit-worthy farmer can probably get accommodation at a bank, but such cases are few and far between.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation has done good work at a time when the joint stock banks refused to accommodate certain sections of the agricultural community.  There is no question but that the experience which that particular body has gained will be a valuable asset when the commission comes to investigate credit facilities for our farmers and to devise a comprehensive scheme of agricultural credit.  Agricultural credit is an urgent problem to-day, particularly in cases where a small farmer carries on a system of tillage and where he would not be able to accommodate many cattle on the small amount of grass land he has at his disposal. If he has a large quantity of straw, hay and root crops, a little accommodation in the shape of cash will help him to fatten a larger number of animals, and he will be able to repay that accommodation in a very short period.  Such a system would add materially to the wealth of our small farmers, and would be an important factor in promoting the welfare of the country.  But more than all must be considered the man who has been placed on land without capital.  I represent a tillage area where a very large number of cattle used to be fattened. That system of farming has, more or less, ceased to be carried on, and the loss to the agricultural community and the fertility of the soil has, as a result, been very considerable, because the means of making manure is undoubtedly lacking.  I consider that anything that would help the farmer to re-stock his land and enable him to carry on so as to fertilise the soil constitutes an urgent problem which the <Col N="545" /> commission will have to consider seriously. In that respect, the usefulness of the commission will be considerable.</P>
    <P>We have in this country to-day a tremendously valuable asset in the intelligence and industry of the farming community.  They have borne the stress and the trials that have beset their path for more than half a century.  They have come out on top from the late economic nightmare which perhaps has left many of them in an insolvent state, but still they are carrying on and working their farms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>With the aid of this commission, and with the intelligent evidence that they will be able to put before it, they will I hope be able to rise again to the position in which their fathers placed them, and the position in which their industry and enterprise placed them.  I feel that the setting up of this commission is a vital matter.  I hope that it will get to work as quickly as possible and explore every avenue likely to help the agricultural community out of the difficulties in which they find themselves. Difficulties beset their path in almost every direction.  Their requirements for production are highly tariffed.  The cost of all their requirements has increased.  That is particularly so in the case of manures, feeding stuffs and agricultural implements, while worse than all is the huge increase in local and national taxation.  It will be the object, I hope, of this commission to inquire into all these matters with a view to giving immediate relief to the agricultural community.  There is an insistent demand among the agricultural community for immediate relief, and I hope that Deputy Davin and his active party will assist us in obtaining that relief.  That matter is referred to in the final paragraph of Deputy Dillon's amendment, and I may say that this immediate relief is eagerly awaited by the farmers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable time may be occupied by the commission in hearing evidence on the various matters which affect the agricultural community, some unknown and unthought of perhaps by members of this House.  Take, for example, the <Col N="546" /> policy carried on by the Minister with regard to the division of land over the last two or three years.  That is a matter that will have to be seriously considered by the commission-the wisdom of the Land Commission in dividing land.  The division of ranches amongst experienced and educated farmers is a praiseworthy object, but the handing over of land to inexperienced and uneducated men, who are not even agriculturally minded men, is a matter for which the Minister for Lands will probably have to answer when the findings of the commission are laid before the House. Men are being put into the possession of land who are neither able to pay rent or rates on it.  Some of them are getting public assistance.  That is happening in my own area.  They are not able to pay rents or rates on that land so that their immediate object is to let it.  They are not even able to pay the rent for the labourers' cottages and acres they occupy.  That has been reported to the Land Commission by the South Cork Board of Health, and if the Minister wishes I am in a position to prove it up to the hilt.  The Minister will have to be taken to task for the policy he is pursuing.</P>
    <P>Agricultural education is another urgent problem.  When we were boys agriculture was taught to all attending school.  It is very questionable if the agricultural labourer who has been put into the possession of land is capable of working it.  Even though he may have worked on a farm as a labourer it is doubtful if he has the knowledge and the business experience to enable him to work a holding economically. I happen to be a member of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture. We have on that committee men of the highest agricultural knowledge, men who are stock breeders and whose names are household words in the stock-breeding world.  They are men who will be able to give very valuable evidence before this commission.  Comparison was made by the Minister with regard to Northern Ireland.  He said that the funding of the arrears and the halving of the annuities, with the payment of rates, put the farmer here in as good a position as the farmer in <Col N="547" /> Northern Ireland who has to pay his full annuity and no rates.  I beg to question that.  The Minister overlooked one important factor, namely that the burden of rates is becoming heavier year after year.  The rates are increasing, probably with the consent of the local bodies because when a Government subsidy is given for various services, road schemes and so on, the condition is that the local body has to make a contribution so that it may not lose what it regards as a grant.  But the fact is that the grant and all other moneys made available come out of the pockets of the people of this country.  The derating of land is the one thing that is going to give immediate relief to our farmers and to compensate them for the trials that they have gone through.  Think of the trials that the farmers have gone through.  In order to meet their liabilities men have had to sell perhaps five or six beasts during the period of the economic nightmare to which I have referred, whereas before that the sale of one beast would have been sufficient. In addition, every beast exported to an English port carried a £5 note on its horns.  That sum was deducted from the price paid for the beast irrespective altogether of the fact of whether prices had slumped, due to an over-loaded market.  All these factors will have to be taken into consideration by the commission.</P>
    <P>We ask the House to give urgent and immediate relief to an overburdened agricultural community. They are insistently demanding it. Shopkeepers in the towns helped the farmers by giving them credit and are now at a loss.  The urban population also felt the distress under which the farmers laboured, and the repercussions on the towns will continue unless farmers are given relief.  As relief is very urgent for the agricultural community I urge the House to accede to the final clause in the amendment, asking the Government to forego the collection of any further rates until they have received the findings of this commission.</P>
    <P>The halved annuities were talked about by Ministers, and it was stated <Col N="548" /> that, with the funded arrears, they amounted, during the period of the economic war, to £17,000,000, in addition to the £26,000,000 collected by Great Britain.  The Minister stated that the value of the halved annuities was £2,000,000.  He compounded the whole amount of £4,000,000 for £10,000,000 with the British Government, and surely out of that bargain the agricultural community should get derating.  It has been stated that the Minister for Finance cannot find the money for derating.  It was found for many other things.  Money has been found to the extent of £30,000,000, apart altogether from the amount collected at the ports.  Seeing that the agricultural community has suffered so much, whatever sum is necessary for their relief should be provided.  The present form of taxation is inequitable, because it imposes charges for local services based upon the poor law valuation of land.  That position cannot be sustained.  It has not been sustained in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  This is an agricultural country, and the agricultural community should not be asked to bear further charges for local services while a multitude of other people who are financially better off escape free.  When our Class I exports were highest in 1931, this House voted £750,000 for the relief of agriculture, and the Fianna Fáil Government increased the amount by an additional £250,000.  In the following year, however, they reduced the amount by nearly £500,000 because the economic war was continuing.  The agricultural community cannot continue to bear the burdens imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>The period of depression that farming went through requires immediately a special form of relief, and derating is one form that could be given.  Shopkeepers and people in the towns also want relief, because they have suffered in recent years owing to the decreased spending powers of farmers.  Farmers had to meet the situation with which they were faced in various ways&mdash;by exhausting the fertility of the soil and by denuding the land of stock in order to try to keep the wolf from the door. They can no longer continue to do that. <Col N="549" /> I do not think that anyone would suggest that the agricultural community are in an affluent state at present.  The land is bankrupt of stock, and the owners are laden down with debts to shopkeepers, so that the situation requires serious consideration by this House.  I ask Deputies, whether they be connected with agriculture or with business, to realise that this matter is one of vital concern to all.  One question that will have to be faced dealt with the payment of minimum wages. I am sure the Labour Party realise that when labourers are employed at the minimum wage it is the very worst type of labourer, because the better class type requires to be paid at a higher rate.  If the farmers are not able to meet their liabilities and to face overhead charges, such as rent and rates, they cannot pay wages.  Back through the ages of the land war high rents were imposed and farmers fought for a reduction and won it.  At that period the rates that they had to pay were very low.  Now when they are laden down with debt the rates have reached unheard of proportions.  The time has come to spread the charges for local services over other sections of the community that are better able to bear them than the agricultural community. Beef is subsidised in England. It is not subsidised here.  It is very urgent that it should be if farmers are again to stall-feed.  I suggest that a matter of consideration by this com-commission is the giving of subsidies, so that intensive stock feeding could be carried on.  That is a policy that would add to our national wealth and would, I believe, bring a relief to farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that it is a source of much gratification to me to realise, with the Minister's acceptance of the principle of my amendment to Deputy Cogan's motion, that even in the sphere of economics light is beginning to dawn where I thought Stygian darkness would for ever obtain. I looked back with somewhat exhausted amusement at the six years of hard labour that we put in to hammer some glimmer of sense into the solid heads of Fianna Fáil.  These were six weary years, during which we <Col N="550" /> heard &ldquo;sabotage,&rdquo;&ldquo;West Briton,&rdquo;&ldquo;traitors to the country,&rdquo; and &ldquo;enemies of Irish Ireland.&rdquo;  After all the denunciations, they are trailing after us so rapidly that, if we do not put on the brake soon, they will pass us out.  It is an interesting progress and, mind you, in order that we may see where they are heading now we have got to look at the course they have pursued in the past.  They have buried the republic; they are all good members of the Commonwealth now on the constitutional sphere.  Once they have got going in the constitutional sphere they are going so fast that we have to hold them in check.  There was a time when we told them Partition was the most important consideration, and now they are making such a row about it that they have the country roused.  There was a time when we told them that agriculture was the most important thing in this country, and now they have suddenly awoken to the fact that it is true.  I doubt whether I should be so optimistic as to take it that Deputy Tom Kelly has awoken to that fact.  If he has, the only thing about which I am terrified is that he will start growing turnips in his back yard.  There is no necessity to do that.  There is no necessity to rush to extremes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note with satisfaction and amusement that the maize-meal mixture scheme has gone up the spout.  Do you remember the time when it was high treason to say in this House that it was a rotten scheme and a scheme that could only have been conceived in an imbecile's brain?  That was high treason 12 months ago.  That was sabotage of the historic Irish nation, and yet the Minister proclaimed over the radio a few days ago that the maize-meal mixture scheme has gone up the spout, and he regretted to say that it could not go up completely for the next nine months, and the only word of apology he had was that he could not put it up the spout quick enough.  I welcome that sign of&mdash;I will not say returning sanity&mdash;I will say of coming sanity in the Fianna Fáil Party and, encouraged by the prospect of some grain of sanity, I recommend to this House that the Minister's acceptance in its principle of our amendment, <Col N="551" /> should meet the matters raised in the original motion and the amendment standing in my name because, when that commission sits, it is bound, if properly constituted, to consider certain matters and, just as the Banking Commission, which was an efficient body, nominated and established by the Government Party, having heard the evidence, produced in its report substantially the policy of the United Ireland Party, so we may rest assured that, if this commission is properly constituted, it will produce in its report the policy of the United Ireland Party, because that happens to be the right policy.</P>
    <P>In regard to derating, to which Deputy Brasier has referred, it seems perfectly clear to me that the commission must recommend that and must recommend it combined with a recommendation for an exhaustive reform of the system of local government in this country so that, at one stroke, we will be able to relieve the agricultural community of this country of a very substantial item in their overhead charges and, at the same time, by the establishment of a more efficient system of local government than at present obtains in rural Ireland, we can lighten the burden that is to be passed over to the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The next and most important thing for the agricultural industry in this country is that the cost of production should be reduced.  The abandonment of the maize-meal mixture scheme is going to reduce the cost of Indian meal to the farmers of this country by 2/6 a cwt.  That should have been done four years ago and there is no reason why it should not be done to-morrow morning.  It would be a very good bargain if the Minister for Agriculture indemnified or took over the entire cereal crops of every farmer in this country with which he regards himself as having a quasi contract and, having taken them over, put an end to the maize-meal mixture scheme, made maize-meal available to the farmers of this country at a reasonable price and disposed of the cereal grain for feeding-stuff of one kind or another and debited any loss on the transaction to the Exchequer.  That would be a <Col N="552" /> substantial contribution to the reduction of the costs of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The next item to which the commission must turn its mind is the cost of artificial manure.  At the present time every farmer who buys a bag of artificial manure is paying a tariff or an excessive price behind the protection of a tariff on the manure he buys, with the result that a great many farmers are not buying manures at all and no farmer in this country, in my judgment, is putting out enough manure. The reduction of the price of manure is an urgent matter and I have no hesitation in saying that so essential an ingredient of our agricultural industry as superphosphate of lime should be admitted to this country duty free from the cheapest source of supply. Every bag of &ldquo;super&rdquo; that we keep out of this country is an injury not only to the farmers but to the State as a whole because it is an injury to the only real source of wealth that this nation has&mdash;the land.</P>
    <P>The price of agricultural machinery is at present maintained at an altogether artificial level and ought to be brought down and any steps, up to the removal of all tariffs on agricultural machinery, should be taken so as to make available to the smallest farmer in this country the best machinery that his money can afford at the lowest price at which he can get it.  It is the small farmer of this country upon whom everybody in this State ultimately depends and, unless we make available to him the most efficient methods for exploiting his land to the greatest advantage, this State cannot prosper.  If we deny him the opportunity to get efficient machinery to work his land, if we deny him the opportunity to get cheap fertilisers to improve his land, if we deny him the chance to get cheap feeding stuffs to develop his live stock, we are denying him the opportunity of extracting from his holding the maximum return that he ought to be able to get and, if we do, we deny our people the opportunity of accumulating the maximum wealth that this country could yield and, in denying them that, we deny them the standard of living that the Lord Almighty intended them to have.  And <Col N="553" /> remember this, that if we deny these things to the farmer we injure not only the farmer but we injure every section of the community and not least the poor because, ultimately, the social services of this country depend upon the capacity of the farmer to pay for them. If you destroy his capacity to pay for them the first person to suffer will be the poor who depend upon the social services for their existence.  If we are to maintain and develop these social services we have got to maintain and develop the land.  If we deny the farmers who live upon the land the means of developing it we injure not only the farmers who live there but every individual and primarily the poor.</P>
    <P>I see another ray of light finding its way into the Minister's brain.  I hear the Pigs Act is to be amended.  Do you remember when it was sabotage and treason to the State to suggest that the Pigs Act was an instrument in the hands of the pig curers for the purpose of plundering the consumer and producer in this country?  Would it surprise the Deputies in this House to know that I invested £200 in a pig factory five years ago?  I got £900 for my £200 last week.  We took it out of your hide and I told you we were taking it out of your hide and I asked you to stop us and you said it was high treason to ask you to do that, and that it was all nonsense, that everything was high, wide and handsome, and that the pig consumers and producers were getting a square deal. Every time you are prepared to pay me £4 10s. Od. for every pound I put in a factory I will be glad to take it. If you are such fools as to allow yourselves to be plundered and trampled on, you deserve nothing better.  But, remember this, that you were warned from these benches that that was being done.  You were asked from these benches to stop it while it was being done, and you had not the intelligence to do it.  But, now that the horse is gone, now that you have been well soaked, you are going to try to close the door.  They do not give two fiddle-dee-dees now.  You may close the door: they have got away with the swag and all you can hope to do now that they are well fattened with your blood is <Col N="554" /> to try to prevent them from bursting by consuming your bones as well.  You are going to amend the Pigs Act. More power to your elbow!  It is nearly time you woke up to it.  It took us six long years to teach them the very little that they now know, but it was worth it.  They were a public danger in their ignorant condition. They are now at least harmless, if they are not much good.</P>
    <P>I put this suggestion, not to the Minister for Lands, because it is not his responsibility, but to the Minister for whom he is deputising now, that, seeing that the maize meal mixture scheme has been very properly sent up the spout, immediate and urgent measures should be taken to promote propaganda in the barley-growing areas for the introduction of an adequate pig population to consume the grain that will be available.  Barley is one of the most suitable foods for pigs and there is no reason why a large proportion of the barley produced in this country which is unsuitable for malting or in excess of the maltsters' requirements should not be used on the farms where it is grown for conversion into pigs and bacon.</P>
    <P>There is a market in Great Britain for far more bacon than we ever will or can produce and, with the dawning sanity that is beginning to manifest itself, we may hope that the Government, the inefficient Government that we have got, will get us a greater share of that bacon market than we have had.  This much is certain, that we cannot produce too many pigs in this country and the more pigs we produce and feed on home-grown grain, if it is efficiently and sensibly grown as the farmers of the Midlands can grow it, the more profit we will make; but now is the time to impress upon the farmers who have been traditional barley-growers for generations, that the best way of disposing of barley in the future will be to feed it to pigs on their own holdings.  Steps should be taken to organise that regime without delay.</P>
    <P>One of the great obstacles to the agricultural recovery which we must get in the course of the next few years is the inability of the farmers <Col N="555" /> to get credit.  Hundreds of farms were stripped of their live stock during the five years' insanity that obtained up to the time of the recent agreement with Great Britain.  We have got to get the live stock back on to these lands if the lands are to be made up, and the only way to do it is to provide the farmers with money to purchase live stock.  There are some antediluvian creatures who will immediately answer: &ldquo;What is the use of giving one farmer money to buy another farmer's stock?  It is only transferring stock from one farm to another.&rdquo;  That is pure balderdash. There are going out of the country to Great Britain hundreds of cattle and these are to be reared on English farms.  I want a percentage of these cattle to be purchased and retained on Irish farms.  I want the British purchasers coming to our market to experience the competition of Irish farmers out to buy the cattle against them.</P>
    <P>It may raise the price of cattle a little.  Part of that raised price will be paid by those men who are purchasing to restock their lands and part by the English buyers; but in the meantime we will be getting back on to the lands of farmers, who have nothing now wherewith to use the land, heifers on which to build the stock of the country in the future.  We have got a great chance if we go the right way about it and the method of financing that is a matter which this commission must take into consideration.  I am satisfied that there is a method of financing it which will avoid making loans to the type of person to whom Deputy Brasier has referred, which would be bad debts, and at the same time making sufficient money available to the really honest farmer who only wants an opportunity of earning his living, getting on his feet and repaying any money he borrows.</P>
    <P>This country has been notoriously and deplorably backward in veterinary research.  Any Deputy with an experience of rural Ireland knows that the losses that annually accrue to our people through sterility in cattle and mastitis in cattle are immense.  There <Col N="556" /> are thousands of cows which have a calf only every two or two-and-a-half years, because there is abroad in this country a sterility not only of the kind due to contagious abortion, but of another kind, the exact nature of which has not been identified.  I believe that considerable progress has been made in Denmark, and it is high time that something was done here.  I have no doubt we could save millions to the farmers if we could provide against the recurrence of sterility in cattle.  All of us know that mastitis is a disease only too common in our herds, and it attacks the best, the heaviest milkers we have got.  I am informed that that disease is due to a special type of bovine streptococcus.</P>
    <P>All of us know that very striking advances have been made in the last two years in the treatment of streptococcal infection in human beings.  It is also well known to those who take an interest in these matters that the two germs are not identical.  One of them is of the bovine and the other of the human type, and the methods of treating such an infection in the human being cannot be identical with the treatment of such an infection in a cow.  But the knowledge of such progress in the sphere of human therapeutics should stimulate veterinary research so as eventually to save the best cows in our herds that are afflicted with that type of infection.  Anyone who lives in the country knows how great a source of loss it is to the farmers, and along these lines work can and should be done at once in order to increase the productivity of the agricultural industry by saving it from the losses that are at present unhappily a normal occurrence.  Let it be remembered that in the five years' insanity, in that period of Irish history which will be known as the five years' madness, we were skipping around the world trying to sell cows in Algiers and chickens in Persia.</P>

      <P>I was talking of our agricultural surplus.  I was talking of what remained over and above what we can consume ourselves.  We cannot control prices in Great Britain.  We have got to sell our agricultural produce in Great Britain for whatever it will fetch.  But we can do something just as effective as if we could control prices in Great Britain.  The profit on our agricultural industry is the difference between the price we get for the surplus in Great Britain and the cost of production at home.  If the cost of production is 2 and the price in Great Britain is 4, our profit is represented by 2; that is, the difference between 2 and 4.  We cannot raise our price in Great Britain to 5, but by the exercise of common sense we can reduce our cost of production to 1.  If we do that we can provide our farmers with a profit of 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy in this House who, if he knew, by passing a resolution here, we could raise prices in Great Britain by 25 per cent., would forbear passing that resolution?  It would be passed unanimously.  Here you have a method of doing that by resolution.  Here is a method by which the farming community will get the same advantage as if you could raise the price in the British market by 25 per cent.  You can do that to-morrow by reducing the cost of agricultural production in this country. There is ample scope for that reduction. The reason this reduction is not made is because the Fianna Fáil Party is sitting on those benches opposite. The reason the farming community cannot make a profit is because the Fianna Fáil Party have had placed upon them big overhead charges that are running away with the profits of <Col N="558" /> the farmers' business.  The reason this is happening is because they are blind and because they are so easily deluded by vested interests who use them as their pawns.  They consent, for the benefit of a few selfish manufacturers, to grind down their own neighbours and to trample into the dirt the people who live upon the land in this country. They do it to fatten gentlemen who are prepared to give me £4 10s. for every £1 I invest in their factory.</P>
    <P>When is the Fianna Fáil Party going to wake up?  They have been brought in here and told that it is patriotism to grow wheat.  Do Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party know that growing wheat is being made the excuse to-day by Irish millers to charge the people of Ireland 16/- a cwt. for flour when the world price of wheat would enable them to sell it at 8/- a cwt?  The price to-day of household flour is 40/- a sack. The price of Irish flour, if manufactured from Canadian or Australian wheat, would be 20/- a sack, that is 8/- a cwt.  A large part of that difference is going into the pockets of the millers.  Deputies sitting on the Fianna Fáil Benches are parties to that transaction which is grinding down into poverty their own neighbours in order that Joseph Rank and other millers in this country may grow rich at our expense.</P>

      <P>They do not like to hear the truth.  There is one part of this commission that is very important. That relates to the evidence and the personnel.  The Banking Commission was of a peculiar character because the evidence was of that kind that it was not advisable to publish unless accompanied by the reports of experts. This commission being set up now will hear a very important body of evidence which will be digested by the public.  The evidence given to-day will evoke evidence for to-morrow.  I suggest that the evidence as the commission gets it should be made available in instalments to the public.  In this way, very valuable evidence which might not otherwise be offered at all would be forthcoming.  The people might be afforded an opportunity of satisfying themselves that every relevant matter was brought to the attention of the commission and the commission could consider that evidence at leisure and furnish this House with its report.  I have no doubt that it would be well that, while the commissioners themselves were digesting the evidence, the public at large would be afforded an opportunity of also doing so.  Then there is the question of the personnel.</P>
      <P>I foresee that the agricultural community itself could very well go wrong in a matter of this character because they might be obsessed with the idea that the important thing was to get a commission composed largely of a number of practical farmers.  Now, in my judgment, it is far more important that the practical farmer should feel that he has an opportunity of giving evidence before it than that there should be a majority of practical farmers on the commission.  We want a commission composed of men whose skill, whose integrity and whose independence will place their report beyond question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No; my argument is that the best possible and the right kind of commission would be one from which people like Deputy Victory would be excluded.  At the same time, I think it is useful that the obscurantist ideas of people like Deputy Victory might be brought before it.  Deputy Victory never learns anything, never forgets anything&mdash;and never will.  We have such people in the country.  I think it is important that as good neighbours we should bear with them.  Deputy Victory, being a good citizen, is of course entitled to consideration.  On the whole, we are fond of him.  What I want to get on the commission are expert farmers, expert veterinarians, expert scientists, economists and persons who will look upon this whole question both from the point of view of the farmer and from the point of view of the State as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let no farmer get into his head that he is the whole State any more than any other section of the community is the whole State.  We have got to ensure the prosperity not only of the farmer, the agricultural community, but of every other section of the community as well.  And just as I protest against the subsidisation of one section of the community at the expense of the farmers, so I would protest against the subsidisation of the farmers at the expense of other sections of the community.  The function of this Parliament is to hold the scales evenly between all sections of the community and to secure the prosperity of all sections of the community.  It is a complete chimera to imagine that we can secure prosperity for one section without securing it for all. It is a commission on those lines that I should like to see constituted here.  I tried to set out a draft personnel which would achieve that object.  We are not bound to that, nor are we wedded to that idea. <Col N="561" /> It was merely a guide as to the general lines upon which our mind was going, but what I say is that it is immensely important that when that commission sits and when its personnel is constituted so as to command universal confidence, farmers even of the kind of Deputy Victory should give evidence before it.  I should like the enlightened farmers to come, too, but the important thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is that every type and every class concerned in the agricultural industry, primarily and secondarily, should put their views before that commission, so that the commission may get a picture of what our agricultural problems are.  I should be glad to think that we would invite an expert from a country like New Zealand whose climate and agriculture are very similar to ours; I should be glad to see an expert from Great Britain or from Denmark joined in the deliberations of that commission.  I think their detached and objective view would be very valuable because they would look at our problems quite free from any kind of prejudice and delivered absolutely from the influence of any vested interests.  I should like to see some of our own distinguished economists and some of our well-known agriculturists on it, but, above all, I should like to see every class of farmer, large and small, giving his evidence before that commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully know that one of the reasons that dictated the Minister's acceptance of my amendment was that he wanted to pass the buck to somebody.  He is frightened out of his life of the mess into which he has got and he is anxious to pass the responsibility over to somebody else.  That does not surprise me and I do not blame him.  He is not competent to handle the problem himself and he at least has the wisdom to realise that.  I congratulate him on that developing good sense.  I only hope that he will choose a body of men who will be able to give him the kind of help he wants, and, if he is fortunate enough to get that kind of body, that he will surrender his judgment completely to them.  That would be the best thing he could do.  I am <Col N="562" /> beginning to hope that he may.  There was a time when I would not have thought he had the wisdom to do it, but I am beginning to hope that he may, and when he does, we shall give him full credit.</P>

      <P>I cannot follow the Deputy, but no doubt he will intervene at a later stage and perhaps furnish the commission with evidence.  I am sure they will put great value on it, which is more than I would.  It is good that this new departure should come upon us; it is good that Fianna Fáil should be waking up at last; it is good that they should realise their own incompetence; and it is good that they should pass the buck.  It is the best thing they can do in the circumstances. I quite realise that the problem is beyond their capacity to deal with, and I sympathise with their complete bewilderment in face of it.  I have no hesitation in assuring them&mdash;and I am beginning at last to realise how high a value they set on my opinion, even if it is two years late&mdash;the wisest thing to do is to hand over all responsibility in this matter to somebody capable of dealing with it, and when they have done that, they will get riding orders from a body of men competent to examine the problems that are at present overwhelming them, and, with our assistance, will get legislation through to implement their findings and get the country back on the road off which Fianna Fáil drove it disastrously six years ago.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say we were going to have a commission, but I have grave doubts about commissions.  From my experience of them I am beginning to think <Col N="563" /> they are only a means of putting things on the long finger, and the state of the farmers being what it is, they will not be able to wait for the result of a commission.  Their position is serious, and I am glad that the Fianna Fáil Party are beginning to realise it.  I come in contact with many Fianna Fáil people in the country, and they admit that the farmers' position is serious.  I am glad that a realisation of that has come to the Government at last, and that they appreciate that the people in the country are not all living in a land of milk and honey like the people in the City of Dublin.  The trouble with this Government, as I am afraid the trouble with every Government, is that they believe that everything in the country is as it is in the city.  I hope this commission will sit soon, and that it will give, as the Minister half promised, some report within a month or so on derating, and I should like to see a report on loans to farmers, because their position is intolerable, and everybody knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that he would not be in favour of derating and he tried to show that the farmers in Northern Ireland are not as well off as we are because they have to pay full annuities.  He did not point out, however, that for every supergrade beast reared by himself which the Northern Ireland farmer brings into the market, he gets 7/6 per cwt. from his Government and if he buys the beast here, he gets 5/- per cwt.  If the beast is not of supergrade, he gets 5/- for a beast of his own rearing and 2/6 if he buys it here.  If the farmers here could bring their fat heifer or bullock weighing 10 cwt. into the fair and get 33/- per cwt. for it and if, then, when they go home, they could send in a return to the Government and as a result get ten sums of 5/- each, would it not pay their rent?  How can you compare the farmers here with those in Northern Ireland when they are getting those allowances?  The position here is that we cannot make beef.  If we send over beef to the British market we get from 36/- to £2 per cwt., while the English farmer can walk in and sell for 38/- or <Col N="564" /> 35/- and get 5/- or 7/6 per cwt. from the English Government.  We cannot make beef here to compete with that. There is no comparison whatever between the farmers of this part of the country and the farmers of Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  That is only one example.  They have other facilities such as manures and other things that we do not get.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Government that if this commission sits, their findings should not be put on the long finger, but that we should have some interim report to give immediate relief to the farmer.  In my county and, I think, in numerous other counties, the farmer is in a bad way as a result of arrears of annuities.  They had got into arrears with their annuities, some of them being two and two-and-a-half years in arrears.  They all paid their rates, as you can see, and the farmers of Westmeath have been paying them as well as, if not better than, any county in Ireland.  At the present time the position is that the sheriff has got instructions to give no more facilities, but to collect the last pound of flesh. Up to the present he could take so much and give some latitude, but now he has to collect the last pound.</P>
    <P>Here is the case of a small farmer in my county who got into arrears during the economic war through no fault of his own.  In the last twelve months he lost eight of his cattle, two of his cows, and a horse, and he was trying to pay his rent all along.  He has three or four half-years in the sheriff's hands, and the sheriff has instructions to bring in all he owes, although he has done his best to pay all along.  It was asked in the fair of Castlepollard why there were so many cows and calves. The reason is because those warrants are out and the sheriff had instructions to give no more facilities but to gather in all arrears.  As a result the farmers brought in their cows and calves and sold them, and stripped their farms.  I know of several farmers who, because of this thing coming down on them&mdash;two and three and four half-years coming on them&mdash;are selling every beast they have in order to keep their homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> It may be asked why these people have got into arrears with their annuities. Whatever may be the reason, the fact remains that they are in arrears, and these people tried their best to pay their way during the economic war. Whatever may be said about other counties, our county was badly hit by the economic war because we were a cattle-raising county.  It has been said that we are a grazing county.  We are not.  The farmers of our county always made their living by rearing calves, and the economic war hit them badly. That is the reason why they are in the position in which they now find themselves. Some of the letters we are getting are heartbreaking. I have a letter from a man here, and I shall read portion of it for the House.  Naturally, I do not like to give this man's name now, but if the Minister wishes to have it I shall give it to him.  This is what he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The commissioners don't seem to care what they do.  I owed £2 12s. 3d. on a small piece of land where I live.  I sent it by registered post on the 15th August last.  After about a week the money was sent back, saying the case was in Mr. Ross's hands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, the sheriff.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The result was that I never felt until two bailiffs and Guard came and put 19/11 costs on me.  No man would say, I think, in a terrific bad season like this, that to put £1 expenses on a small amount of £2 12s. 3d., making it £3 11s. 9d., was fair.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That man sent his rent in a registered envelope and it was sent back to him, and the bailiff came to his yard and put 19/11 on him.  Another man wrote last week, and here is what he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>Last August I got a 15 days notice for three half years rent, £21 6s. 6d. My wife went in on the 8th of August to pay a half year and the cost, which was £7 14s. 6d. and asked till October for the other two halfs.  He gave her a receipt I am sending you, balance £14.  When she went in on <Col N="566" /> yesterday he first said he would not take it, to post it to the I.L.C.  She said he had the Receivable Order. Then he demanded 14/- extra.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When this woman went in in August, she was only given to October, but a new rule came in in the meantime, on 1st September, as a result of which a 1/- in the £ extra was put on all those people.  This woman had not the money to pay.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;She had no more money.  He told her she would have to go and borrow it which she did.  Is it lawful to heap on that cost, as there was nothing about it when paying the first half year?  I paid three half years in, say, two months; had to sell a cow I wanted badly when I could not get to thresh my corn for to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is the position of hundreds of farmers in my county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the shop bills in addition to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the shop bills are enormous also.  However, I should like the Minister for Lands to look into this matter.  A new cost has been put on these people in our county at present. If you get a 15 days' notice for, say, £20, and when your 15 days are up, you go to the sheriff and tell him you are not able to pay, he may give you a fortnight or three weeks; and he will immediately tell you that, along with the 7/6 costs which are legally put on by the Act of this House, he will put on another shilling in the £.  As far as I can see, that is nowhere in the Act.  I want the Minister to take note of that shilling in the £ extra which has been put on in Westmeath since the 1st September.  There are many people in the country who, when they get that 15 days' notice, do not go to a Deputy or write to the Land Commission.  They get the wind up, so to speak, and they have to sell everything about their farms and strip their land and their homes in order to be able to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something should be done to fund these annuities.  I think that is the only thing to be done, and I agree with the part of Deputy Cogan's motion which asks for the funding of the <Col N="567" /> arrears of annuities, because that would help the farmers very much. When a man is two or three years in arrears, and if he has nothing on the land, his land is derelict.  Nobody would take that land, even on the 11 months' system, because he would not know the day when the sheriff would walk in.  We all know that people who could pay their annuities have paid them up to now, and the only people who are left in arrears are those who are unable to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister, therefore, should look into that matter and bring in a scheme to fund the annuities so as to let these people start off anew.  I would also suggest that, with the help of this commission which I hope will be set up, loans should be given to the farmers at a small rate of interest.  The Minister for Agriculture did not agree with that, and maintained that it would raise the price of cattle.  It will not.  Nothing will raise the price of cattle until the Englishman wants the cattle.  I know that from experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be a good thing to raise the price of cattle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; but the Minister maintained that that would be a false way of raising it.  The people cannot compete with the shipping men. I ask the Minister specially to look into this matter.  As things are in Westmeath at present, the fact must be faced that the people have got into arrear, whatever may be the cause.  You cannot get over the fact that they are in arrear, and there is no use in making them pay three or four years off before the 1st of February, which I know he is trying to do in order to balance his accounts.  Some of these people have four or five half-years to come on them in three or four months.  Something should be done immediately to help these people and we ask the Government, when this commission is set up, to lay stress on the question of giving loans at a low rate of interest to the farmers immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to derating, all our Party and everyone who spoke, as far as I could see, made a good case for <Col N="568" /> derating.  Some Deputies pointed out that it will not affect the grazier or anyone else.  Whatever may have been the case in the past, there is no such thing now as big ranches, and if there is it is the fault of this Government and of the previous Government.  There was machinery to do away with the ranches, and if people are working their land properly this Government is not going to touch them.  I want, however, the Minister to pay special attention to this matter of the arrears of annuities and derating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I should like to intervene to clear up about the sheriffs.  I am sure that no order has been sent to the sheriffs to squeeze the last ounce out of the farmers.  What is happening apparently is, and I think he admitted it, that the people get these notices and they simply ignore them. They do not even write to the Land Commission; they make no effort. What is the Land Commission to do but presume that they do not intend to pay and proceed at once?  Once the thing goes to the sheriff it is out of the hands of the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>A new order came down to Westmeath and everybody in arrears got a typewritten notice so that after the 1st September, if you owed £20 and you paid in instalments to the sheriff, there was 20/- added on to the amount.  It is the Minister for Justice's Department that is responsible. A man came down to the office in Mullingar about a fortnight ago and three or four people went to pay rent.  They were brought before him and he threatened them and frightened the life out of them.  If the Minister inquires into the matter he will find that every word I have said with regard to the pressure being brought to bear on the people is true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>After the able lecture which Deputy Dillon has given Fianna Fáil there is very little left for me to say.  However, I am glad to say that the Fianna Fáil Party led by the Minister for Agriculture, after spending six years bringing the country into a bog of bankruptcy have now realised where they were going.  No doubt the fact that a commission on <Col N="569" /> agriculture is to be set up will bring some hope to the agricultural community. It is not now that that commission should be set up but 15 years ago when we were starting government in this country.  We all know that the source of our wealth is in the soil of Ireland.  But we are in the unfortunate position that for the last six years a city mentality has dominated the Fianna Fáil Party which has bowed to the opinions of men like Deputy Thomas Kelly who does not know the first thing about agriculture. We had a great cry for the industrialisation of the country which was said to be teeming with mineral wealth.  We have had industrialisation during the last six years and what do we find to-day?  Nothing but stagnation in that industrial drive.  Why would there not be stagnation seeing that the purchasing community, the farmers and the country workers, are denuded of their means of living?  I know that the Minister has now realised that he must look to the agricultural community if he wants to save the country and that Deputy Kelly will have to say &ldquo;For six years I had the Minister in my hands; I will now go down the country with the Minister and help to raise up these people whom we want to buy the products which the industrial concerns in the cities are producing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a county that is supposed to be the premier couty as far as the land is concerned.  I have been in that county for the last six or eight years and I am glad to say that I have seen the land confiscated from our forefathers being given back to the people. But I say that it is being given back in a mean and degrading way.  The unfortunate small farmers and their sons have to go out begging for a small piece of land.  They are getting ten or 12 Irish acres to live on.  These unfortunate people, who have no means or capital to work the land, are being left there unprovided for, with the result that that land which could be producing wealth and helping to rear families is still let on the 11 months' system as it was for the last 50 years. The small farmer who has not the means to stock the land has to go back <Col N="570" /> to the rancher from whom the land was taken and give him back that land on the 11 months' system at a cheaper rate than the rancher had it when paying the annuities himself. That kind of thing must be put a stop to immediately if we are to save the country.</P>
    <P>I have often heard it said that the late Mr. Hogan, when Minister for Agriculture, intended that the lands of Meath should be kept in a preserved condition so that Meath would be the natural market for the other countries, because on County Meath depended the big fairs of Ballinasloe, Athenry, Roscommon, Longford, and other places.  What is to become of these now if the Minister goes on in the same reckless way in Meath that he has been going for the last six years?  We will have new rural slums, not in the west of Ireland, but on the plains of royal Meath.</P>
    <P>I hope the Land Commission will think twice before dividing any more land in Meath and that it will be divided into definite economic units and given to people who will work it themselves for the good of the country. It is a terrible thing to see that land given to men who have not any outlook as far as the working of land is concerned; who do not give one jot whether it has to be set or taken off them again.  They get all they can out of it for a few years, and when there is a pile of debt on it they will throw it there and walk away and go into the labour market.  I want to see the right type of people placed on that land.  At present we have nothing but unpaid land annuities and unpaid rates.  At present these men can set their land and get work from the different local councils at the expense of the unfortunate unemployed men, who have neither land nor any other means of living and who are left to draw the dole, whilst these new farmers on the plains of Meath can get work all the year round at 35/- a week on the roads and set their land to the rancher from whom it was taken.</P>
    <P>Apart from the poverty of the agricultural community, there is something else which concerns us, and that is the national spirit of our people.  Where <Col N="571" /> is that national spirit to-day&mdash;the national spirit that we had from 1916 to 1921?  It is gone.  Why has it gone? It has gone because of the poverty of the people.  Ireland in every generation fought for her rights when prosperity was at its peak point.  Will she raise her head to-day?  No; because she has nothing to raise it for.  She has now had is 16 or 17 years of self-government, and what has it brought? Nothing but desolation, despair and poverty.  Is it not time that the Fianna Fáil Party, who call themselves the great Republican Party, realised that, instead of leading our country forward, they are driving it back?  The cry to-day is: &ldquo;We will wipe out the Border.&rdquo; They ought to realise that the Six Counties will wipe them out if they do not wake up.</P>
    <P>What we want is prosperity for the people who drove the Saxon out of the country&mdash;the country worker and the small farmer; the men whom Fianna Fáil have trampled in the mud.  As sure as the sun rises Fianna Fáil must repent or else go down in the mud themselves.  They must try to save their faces this year, as this is the last year in which the agricultural community can be left in the condition in which they are.  There was never any compulsion needed for the farmers in the past.  Before either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael was heard of, when asked to pay their annuities and rates they paid them on the day they were due. Why are there hundreds of hundreds of thousands of unpaid annuities to-day?  Because the people are unable to pay them.  There are men in the Fianna Fáil Party all over the country <Col N="572" /> who say that it is the dishonesty of the farmers which has produced the present position.  It is not the dishonesty of the farmers.  The farmers were never dishonest and never will be.</P>
    <P>As to this commission which is to be set up, I am glad that the Minister said it will have power to make a very early interim report.  Perhaps it will be able to report in two or three months.  To do its work properly a commission like that must sit for two or three or perhaps four years.  I hope it will its for three years, anyway, in order to find out how to make the country prosperous.  At the same time, I hope it will be able to make an interim report in three or four months' time so as to relieve the agricultural community from some of the burdens at present on their shoulders. In my county the biggest relief that could be afforded at present would be that the Government should not deduct anything from the agricultural grant paid to the county council. This year a sum of £63,000 was deducted because of unpaid land annuities.  It is unfair to make the farmer who has paid his annuities pay for the men who are not paying; it is unjust and dishonest.  If the Government gave us that £63,000, which is ours by right, it certainly would take a great burden off our shoulders.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
