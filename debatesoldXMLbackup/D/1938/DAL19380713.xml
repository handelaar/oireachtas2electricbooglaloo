      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will have inquiry made into the hardship caused by the inability of labourers in Kerry to secure loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts in addition to the grants made available under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1937, to enable them to build houses on plots purchased by themselves for the purpose; and if he will renew his sanction to bring into operation the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts in Kerry to facilitate the erection of dwellings in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>An inquiry of the nature referred to would not serve any useful purpose.  The suspension of the issue of further loans to the Kerry County Council for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts was rendered necessary by the failure of the council to secure the prompt discharge of their liabilities by persons to whom advances under the Acts had been made. Despite warnings to the council the position has grown worse since 1936 both as regards percentage of borrowers in arrear and percentage of amount in arrear.</P>

      <P>The proposal submitted by the Dublin Board of Public Health for extension of the burial ground included the acquisition of two separate plots of land.  The site plan showed these plots to consist of 1a. 0r. 6p. and 2a. 1r. respectively. The board proposed to pay £150 for the smaller plot (subsequently increased to £180) and £50 for the larger plot.  Only the smaller plot was intended to be used for the extension of the burial ground.  It appeared that the larger plot of 2a. 1r. when acquired by the board was to be transferred by them to the owner of the smaller plot of 1a. 6p. in addition to a payment of £180.  No adequate reasons were submitted to warrant my according sanction to the proposed transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure of the board of health and public assistance to proceed with the provision of a new county hospital and a new fever hospital at Carlow will entail the withdrawal of the offer of the grant for these institutions. There are hospitals required in other parts of the country to which grants cannot be allocated owing to the present commitments of the Hospitals Trust Fund and unless the Carlow Board of Health quickly change their <Col N="626" /> attitude the course I have indicated will have to be adopted.</P>

Does he propose to exercise that statutory duty in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>These works in Carlow are admittedly desirable and urgent, but there are other counties in which such services are required, where it has not been found possible to start hospitalisation work and where the problem is equally urgent.  There are so many counties remaining in which these works are required that it is not intended to compel the Board of Health in Carlow to proceed.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, will he arrange with the Minister to enable local elections to be held in Carlow so that the people of the county will have an opportunity of putting into office a board of health which will proceed with this work?  Surely the Department of the Parliamentary Secretary have a special responsibility to exercise their statutory powers in this matter, seeing that they are preventing the people of the County Carlow from electing a board of health which will carry out this necessary work.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to questions Nos. 17 and 18 together. Contracts for the printing of ballot papers and other election forms of a general nature are submitted to competitive tender in the usual manner, and quotations are invited from all firms who have applied to be registered as Stationery Office contractors. In addition, advertisements giving notice of tenders required are inserted in the principal morning newspapers, and tender forms are issued to firms who subsequently make application following the notice of tender appearing in the Press.  In connection with the present contract, tenders were received from three Waterford firms, and the quotation of the Waterford News, Ltd., being the lowest received for the Waterford area, was accepted.  The individual quotations are regarded as <Col N="630" /> confidential, and it would be contrary to practice to disclose them.  As regards advertising and the printing of election notices and posters for the constituency, the method of publication of notices in regard to an election is under Rule 44 of the Fifth Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1923, vested in the returning officer, to whose orders advertisements are placed by the Government advertising agent.  Payment is made at the approved rates applicable to Government advertising. Arrangements for the printing of any necessary posters and notices are made directly by the returning officer, the cost of the work, to such extent as is considered fair and reasonable, being defrayed from public funds.</P>

Petitions for drainage schemes are dealt with by the Commissioners of Public Works in the order of priority, and it has not yet been found possible to arrange for an engineering examination of this proposal.  In view of the decision to set up a drainage commission to investigate the whole question of arterial drainage in the country, the further investigation of petitions for drainage schemes under the 1925 Act has been deferred pending the findings of that body.  Consequently no progress can at present be made with the Camlin River petition</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £54,074 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which <Col N="640" /> will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    <P>The total provision for External Affairs for the year 1938-39 amounts to £81,124, as compared with £84,512 for the year 1937-38.  The reduction is mainly due to the provision of only a half year's contribution towards the expenses of the International Committee for the application of the Agreement regarding non-intervention in Spain.  At the time the Estimate was prepared it was hoped that a half year's contribution would be sufficient to meet this country's liability under the non-intervention scheme.  It may, however, be necessary to make provision for a full year's contribution at a later date.  The receipts in the current year are estimated at £15,000, leaving the net expenditure at £66,124. The receipts of £15,000 are made up in the main from moneys collected for passports, visas and consular services. £10,000 of the £15,000 is made up in that way.  The remainder is made up of fees for the issue of home passports, £3,004; Imperial communications, £500, and the Advisory Committee for services of representatives of Saorstát Eireann.  In past years I drew attention to the assistance given by our representatives abroad in regard to estates falling to Irish citizens.  Since the financial year 1932-33, the amount received from American estates in which the Consuls have been concerned is practically £250,000.  Those figures do not of course represent the total amount of money accruing to Irish persons each year from American estates, nor the extent of the Department's work in regard to estates moneys, as well as giving advice and guidance in regard to securing the best legal advice and helping in tracing the next-of-kin.  The Department's activities in the matter of estates though mainly arising in are not confined to the United States.  Enquiries have been received and advice given in respect of estates in Canada, the Argentina, Colombia, South Africa, New Zealand <Col N="641" /> and Australia.  The total number of estates handled in the past six years approximate to 4,000, at about two a day, involving sums varying from £10,000 to £20,000.  In a few cases the estates were for even larger sums. During the year 1937-38 the number of new estate cases dealt with in the United States was: In New York, 263; in Boston, 200; in Chicago, 229, and in San Francisco, 90.</P>
    <P>During the last year we have had the pleasure of establishing full diplomatic relations with Italy and Belgium. We were very glad indeed to be able to do so.  Everyone in this country knows the friendly relations that have existed between Ireland and those two countries for many centuries.  We are happy that those new relations have now been instituted, so that the former friendship and friendly intercourse between ourselves and those two countries may be the more firmly established.</P>

      <P>That is an untruth, a falsehood &mdash; a falsehood which is known to be a falsehood by every member of this House as well as by the Irish people.  This Government has continued the policy of endeavouring to take part in promoting friendly relations between peoples.  As a country with widespread racial affiliations with the peoples of other countries, we feel that we have a special duty, and a special influence in that regard, and we have never ceased to exercise them when the opportunity presented itself <Col N="642" /> As Deputies are aware, a very large proportion of the population of several countries is of Irish descent, the largest proportion being, probably, in the United States of America, with which country we have closer relations than with any other country.  We have there not merely a Legation at Washington, but four Consulates, a greater number than we have in any other country, and the work carried on, any more than the work of any of our other representatives, cannot be judged by what appears on the surface, with purely material results.  A Department of External Affairs in most countries like ours, and particularly in small countries, is apt to be judged in a narrow way, by looking to the material results, forms of trade, etc., which cannot, in any sense, express the full value of what has been achieved by having representatives in these countries, because they not merely safeguard the interests of any of our citizens that may be in them, promote trade relations, but promote relations of a cultural nature, which are also of fundamental importance.</P>
      <P>Besides the United States we have also a considerable proportion of our population in States of the British Commonwealth which have been uniformly friendly with us.  We have a considerable proportion of our population in Australia, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand, and we have special relations of a friendly character with the people of South Africa.  It is the policy of the Government to try, as far as possible, to extend our representation, so soon as may be practicable, with these countries.  We have not had an opportunity so far to examine the question of expense, etc., in detail, so that I have no immediate proposal to make to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion the principal part of this debate was taken up with our relations with Britain.  On that occasion I pointed out that there were three main obstacles to the good relations which, I think, most of the people in both countries desired.  There was the question of the continuance of Partition; there was the question of the retention of certain points in our <Col N="643" /> ports of defence, and there was the financial dispute.  The recent Agreement, which is fresh in the mind of every Deputy, has removed two of these obstacles, and, I think, the people of both countries can be satisfied that the removal of these two obstacles has, in fact, had a considerable effect in improving these relations.  This Government intends to proceed on the line which it has been pursuing, to try to get on a firm foundation the relations between the two countries, by removing the obstacles to these friendly and good relations.</P>
    <P>As two neighbouring countries we have &mdash; by our position and, to a certain extent, by the fact that for centuries there have been relations of one kind or another between them, relations of trade and so on &mdash; interests in common. We have always held that the full effect of these common interests would never show itself in the relations between the two countries until certain obstacles were removed.  Two of these have been removed, and we shall certainly do our utmost to see that the third is removed.  On the last occasion I was speaking in relation to the ports and the position of this country in regard to defence, and the anomalous position in which we found ourselves in that regard as long as these ports were being held.  Now that, as far as this part of the country is concerned, the British garrison will soon be completely removed, and that the whole of it will be under the control of our people, we will be in a position to approach this whole question from a new angle.  I indicated in general terms during the debate on the Agreement certain considerations which must be fundamental in our approach to that subject.  We have not yet considered the Estimate for Defence.  Perhaps that would be a more appropriate place to deal with the whole question than this particular Estimate.  But these are considerations that I suggest Deputies should review, to see whether they are not sound.</P>
    <P>In the past the main aim of our people was to try to win freedom. Until complete freedom is won that <Col N="644" /> must still be the aim.  According as we more and more secure our freedom there is placed upon us the obligation to make right use of it and to defend it.  It would be a very foolish policy, indeed, and quite unworthy of our past if, having got it, we seemed to think it of very little value, as something not worth making a sacrifice for. I do not think the majority of our people are likely to approach it in that manner, and, consequently, when we consider, as we will in a day or two, the next Estimate, we will have to approach it from a somewhat different angle from that in which we approached it in the past.  We may not all be able to reach agreement as to the extent we can afford assurance or insurance with regard to the future, to see that our freedom is not taken from us, and to see what we are prepared to do in order to secure it.  I do not think we are likely to sanction a policy of remissness taking place for its attention.  If there are any questions Deputies wish to raise I shall be pleased to answer them.</P>

      <P>On the general position with regard to the Department of External Affairs I do not think any of us will subscribe to the Taoiseach's statement that the Department in the past has done a terrible lot for the country.  During the last six years this country has been acting on a policy that was entirely contrary to the type that we would like to preach in an international assembly, and if many opportunities have been let pass during the last five or six years for helping other countries, either by sound advice or by foresight and advice, that fault lies entirely with the fact that we were pursuing policies here that absorbed us too much and absorbed us too much in quite a different direction.  Now, happily, the Taoiseach is able to tell us that all that is past and that, in so far as our relations with other countries are to go in the future, there is going to be nothing but peace and harmony and particularly so far as ourselves and Great Britain are concerned; that there is only one problem now between the two countries likely to create any difficulties and that is <Col N="645" /> the problem of Partition.  When the Taoiseach was dealing with the question of events in the discussions in connection with the recent Agreement with Great Britain in the Seanad he said that he himself had introduced the question of defence in the Dáil but it was with a clear indication that it was not the time or the place to discuss defence policy.  I quite admit that the Taoiseach is perhaps not in a position to discuss every detail of defence policy.  I particularly agree that the Minister for Defence may not be in that position, but I do think that now is the time and the place to talk clearly as to what are the things in our political or in the international situation that dictate to us that we have a defence policy which will cost money even to the extent that the Taoiseach has already indicated that certain aspects of our defence policy in connection with the modernisation and equipment of the forts will cost. I think as I say this is the time and this is the place.  I know of no other place than the Dáil where the broad aspects of defence policy should primarily be discussed and I know no better time than now to discuss the broad aspects of defence.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has particularly stressed, when he was dealing with the Agreement with Great Britain, that there were certain considerations to be kept in mind in our consideration of these things now. I do not know exactly what he refers to, but at any rate there are certain things I would like to be clear about. I put aside the suggestion of the Taoiseach that having won our freedom we ought to be able to make sacrifices for it.  So much has been lost in life and resources during the last 16 years in this country unnecessarily for the flag of freedom without any very clear examination of what it meant, or with perhaps little understanding of what it meant, that I do not want to discuss defence now from the freedom point of view.  If we are going to talk about freedom, what are the things that are likely to be attacked here; what are the things we would be likely to be required to do here, that we would like to have freedom to do, and what is the extent to which they are likely to be attacked?  I would particularly like to ask the Taoiseach what his policy is with regard to these things.  There was a time when he used to talk about the desirability of this country being neutral during a war in which Britain was engaged.  One of the things that most dominate our foreign affairs now is the statement made by the Taoiseach when he was discussing this matter on the 29th April, when he said the truth is, of course, that in modern <Col N="647" /> war there is not any neutrality.  So that with that change in the outlook of the Taoiseach on the question of neutrality I would like to turn to one paragraph of his statement here which I think embodies all the things that I want to deal with.  In column 422 of 29th April, 1938, the Taoiseach asked: &ldquo;Is it likely that we could escape if there was a major European conflict at the present time?  If there is such a condition, will we continue to export cattle and food to Great Britain? Will the export of food be regarded as contraband of war or will it not? If we are going to send food from our ports to Britain when Britain's enemies, let us say, will be trying to starve her, will our position be respected by other people?  Will our ports be free?  Will we be immune from attack?  I do not know if it was in the House that someone asked: `Could we have the audacity to have our neutrality recognised by foreign Governments?  Would any foreign Governments think we were neutral when our ports were occupied by Britain, or if a Government here gave the facilities which might be asked for by Britain under Articles 6 and 7?' &rdquo; Then the Taoiseach puts his own idea:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I suggest that our people would be living in a fool's paradise if they thought anything of the kind.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach if it is part of the freedom that he speaks about that if Great Britain were at war with any other country we should still be free to export our produce to Great Britain.  Personally I think it is of vital interest that we should be free, and it is of vital interest to us if any attempt was made to interfere with the export of our agricultural produce to Great Britain that we should then use all the resources in our power to see that our agricultural exports were allowed to go to Great Britain, because the economic wellbeing of our people depends on it.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach if, in the event of any attempt at interference with our export of goods to Great Britain during time of war he is going to co-operate in the fullest possible way with Great Britain to protect our <Col N="648" /> exports.  I quite accept his statement that there are no definite commitments for co-operating defensively with Great Britain.  I quite accept the constitutional position here that only a declaration of this Dáil can formally place our people at war with any other people.  Assuming no declaration on our part of war, but assuming that Great Britain was in conflict with another country, threatening its trade routes, threatening the import of food to Great Britain whether from this country or any other country, I would like to ask the Taoiseach whether our ports at Berehaven and Swilly are going to be placed for refuge or other purposes at the disposal of vessels bringing food or other commodities to Great Britain, whether they are going to be at the disposal of the British Navy for refuge or for security purposes. That is a question that, I think, we should be perfectly clear about, if the situation in Europe is in the dangerous condition that we are given to understand it is.  Many Ministers have stated that it is so.  The Minister for Finance, at Ringsend, stated that nothing they ever heard of in their lives would compare with what might happen some day or another down at Ringsend when the new war which is threatening in Europe breaks out.  If we desire on our part, by our declared voice at any rate, to keep out of such a war, we ought to be clear whether we are going to allow Great Britain to have the use of our ports in order to protect seaborne traffic.  We ought to be clear, too, whether the modernisation of our ports at Lough Swilly, Berehaven and Cobh is a modernisation that is being carried out for the purpose of affording security to seaborne traffic or to the British Naval Forces, if the British Naval Forces require it.</P>
    <P>So many questions of deep importance have been dragged into the arena of politics during the last 16 years, damaging to our people's political intelligence and damaging to the resources that the people have for the betterment of their own lives, that if there is any question more than another that ought to be kept out of the region of being made a question <Col N="649" /> of party politics it is the question of defence.  Arising out of many things that have been said and many actions taken in the past, I suggest that no aspect of our activities from the political party point of view is going to be more liable to misrepresentation. Our people will have to face the facts of the situation and those who can make the greatest contribution towards clearing up the situation are those who form the Government at the present time.  We deserve clear answers from them on some of these questions. There is no purpose served by endeavouring to mix up a discussion of this kind with a discussion as to the number of men, aeroplanes or anything else that the Army should have in respect of its strength or equipment. Before we approach any consideration as to what the size of the Army should be, or what its equipment should be, we should be told whether the country is able to meet the cost.</P>
    <P>There is one other question that I should like to ask.  Apart from any commitments that we may have in our relations with Great Britain for defence purposes, are the relations between our Government and the Government of Great Britain such that it has been arranged that our military authorities will be in close touch with the British military and naval authorities so that, whatever be our attitude within our constitutional rights as to participation in any war in which Great Britain is engaged, we shall at any rate know what the broad outline of the defence policy of Great Britain is so that, if it is necessary to co-operate, we will be in the fullest possible position to do so?  There is no aspect of our foreign affairs policy, both from the point of view of our own security and from the point of fair and good relations with other countries, that it is more important to be clear about than that which arises out of these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to say that the Taoiseach's remarks as regards the consular services, particularly in the United States, in dealing with the estates in <Col N="650" /> which Irish nationals are interested, are a compliment to those services and that compliment is very well deserved.  I think the consular services, from the speed of their operations dealing with those matters in the United States, are an example to some Government Departments here.  On the Vote for the Board of Public Works I raised a question on a token vote of £10, making provision for the Legation in Madrid.  The Chair referred me on that occasion to the Vote for External Affairs.  I would now like to ask the Taoiseach for some explanation of the provision in the Estimate for £3,215 in respect of the Legation in Madrid.  It appears to me that the position as regards that particular service is peculiar at the moment.  First of all, I doubt very much if there is any Government to-day in existence to which the representative of this State is accredited.  It is perfectly obvious to anybody who has been observing the trend of affairs in Spain for the last 12 months that whatever may have been the position two years ago as to the then Government of the Spanish Republic, which claimed to be elected by popular vote, that argument does not hold good now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is absolutely no justification for continuing our legation service with them, because anybody will see that the personnel of the Spanish Republican Government has been changed five times in the last 12 months without any reference to the popular method of selection.  We intend to spend £3,215 on a legation for that Government.  That money is being provided by our taxpayers.  I say it is money wasted, money for which no return can be given.  It is being spent on a legation for which there is no justification.  There is no earthly reason why the Government of Éire should continue to have relations with the Government of the Spanish Republic, as they call themselves.  The position, so far as I understand it, is that the envoy of this State is accredited to the head of the Government of the Spanish Republic.  The Taoiseach is not even certain of the name of that gentleman.  Replying to <Col N="651" /> a parliamentary question some time ago, he was not definite about the name of that individual.</P>
    <P>Are there at the moment any officers of that service resident in Madrid? Are there any officers resident in the area covered by the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican Government, or is the entire staff somewhere beyond the frontier in France?  I do not believe there is any popular demand for this representation.  There is no use in saying that this matter was an issue in the last election, because it was not. I do not believe there is any popular demand in this country for the continuation of representation to what I call the Red Government in Spain.  The position is that we are one of the few countries recognising the Republican Government in Spain.  A great number of bigger and smaller States have recognised the Burgos Government, but this country has not taken that step, although it should have done so long ago.  Other countries are recognising the Burgos Government as <i>de facto.</i></P>
    <P>The British Government, which does not grant belligerent rights to either party, has a <i>Chargé d'Affaires</i> who is in direct contact with the Burgos Government; they are as much in contact with Franco as they are with the Government that call themselves the Government of the Spanish Republic. There is no justification for the continued expenditure of £3,215 for representation to the Red Government.  I do not see what necessity there is for the continuation of that representation.  I do not believe there are very many nationals who need the services of that particular legation.</P>
    <P>I say that if there are Irish nationals who have chosen to go out and take the part of the Red Government in Spain and find themselves in trouble because they have taken the part of that Red Government and the Communists, the money of the taxpayers of this country should not be used to get these people out of their trouble.  We have not any great pity for anyone who is in danger because he has taken part in the Civil War in Spain on the <Col N="652" /> side of the Reds.  I do not believe there is any justification that the Taoiseach can advance either on moral, political or economic grounds for continuing to pay that money to meet the cost of the legation with the Red Government.  I say it is due to the people of this country who have very definite ideas as to the rights and wrongs of this war in Spain that a very definite statement on that matter should now be made by the President. It cannot be held either <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> that the junta in Spain that calls itself the Government of Spain is the Government of Spain.  They control a little less than one-third of the territory of Spain and a little less than one-third of the population of Spain, while General Franco is controlling two-thirds of the population and two-thirds of the territory of Spain.</P>
    <P>It is General Franco's Government that the people of this country want to recognise.  Is there any reason, good, bad or indifferent, why this particular legation to the Red Government should be continued?  Is there any reason at all why this expenditure should be continued?  Is there any reason that can be advanced against the recognition of the Burgos Government?  Is there any reason to believe that our recognition of the Burgos Government would interfere in the slightest with the position of this country, nationally, politically or economically?  I believe myself that there is no earthly reason for the continued recognition of the Red Government of Spain except that the Government of this country are merely carrying on the same soft pedalling they carried on when they supported the Non-Intervention Agreement and that they will not take steps to realise what the position in Spain really is. I see no reason why the Government of this country should not, once and for all, withdraw the representatives of this country from the Red Government. If you are going to have any representation in Spain that representation should be attached to the Burgos Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Taoiseach when replying would justify two cardinal points of the foreign <Col N="653" /> policy of his Department.  In his brief statement in introducing this Estimate he said in a rather boastful tone that we have cordial relations or that the cordial relations that always existed here in this country on the one hand with Belgium and with Italy on the other hand have been restored. I resent very strongly that the sanctions introduced by his Government against the Italian nation were introduced at the dictation of Britain.  It is very strange how the coincidence arose.  It is very strange how when the British Government realised the mistake it had made and the damage done to British interests that they sacked the Minister responsible for those sanctions and changed their policy.  Concurrently, with Britain's change of policy the Taoiseach changed his policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the good relations that always existed between this country and Italy are now restored, and if the position is now what it was before these sanctions were introduced against Italy, there is no credit due for it to our Government.  What has Italy done that we, a little nation, should set out to help in imposing those sanctions against her?  Why should we take part in such a thing? Why we could not stop a packet of Woodbines going into Italy.  Yet we showed what we would do if we had the power to do it.  Great Britain found out its mistake.  Why did not we on that occasion look at that matter not with British eyes or as following in the wake of Britain? Why did we not look at it with Irish eyes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely criticising the policy of the Department of External Affairs on this Vote.  I would like the Taoiseach to inform the House what those sanctions have <Col N="654" /> cost the people of this country.  Then we come along afterwards and interfere in the foreign policy or I should say the domestic policy of Spain and we incur a large expenditure for non-intervention. As the previous speaker has pointed out we refused to recognise what the world knows is the Government of Spain, the Government that the Spanish people overwhelmingly desire.  We are spending money keeping up an accredited representation with the Communistic Government of Spain.  It cannot be even pretended now that that is any longer the elected Government of Spain.  I doubt if there is a single member of the present junta that forms the Barcelona or Valencia Government who was ever elected by the Spanish voters. We know what were the issues in Spain.  We know them beyond doubt. Yet our Government instead of falling in behind Britain, waiting to see what Britain will do with regard to Spain, are attaching themselves to the Red Government.</P>
      <P>We should be using our influence and influencing the British Government towards the recognition of the Burgos Government of Spain, instead of, as we are doing, standing behind to see what Britain will do.  That is what we are doing.  We should be, as far as we could, influencing Britain to take the steps she should take.  We have not been doing that.  We do not propose, apparently, to do it even now.  As a matter of fact, the Minister for External Affairs and the Department of External Affairs closes its blind eye while we are feeding the Communistic forces in Spain.  The Taoiseach may smile at that.  Very well.  Let the country know that the Taoiseach smiles at it.  I do not know your ruling, Sir, on the question of whether we in this debate are debating the broad principles of defence.</P>

Absent Deputies may be interested in defence, and desire to raise these questions of <Col N="655" /> defence on that Vote.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On that I wanted to make a few remarks more or less by way of query.  It is strange that, as far as I have been able to interpret the London Agreement, and quite apart from the question of our national defence, it is the intention to defend these ports.  Whether any obligation to do so was undertaken or not, I do not know; I have not seen it anywhere, and I have read where it has been refuted by the Taoiseach that he or any of his delegation undertook any responsibility for the defence of those ports, but what strikes me as strange is that those ports were fortified and garrisoned by Britain, not for the defence of this country, but for the defence of the trade routes for Britain.  Because of that I do not look upon their continued defence as being primarily for the national defence of this country, and it strikes me as strange.  Of course, the question of other defences around the coast will arise on the Defence Vote, and I do not want to go into that, but unless we have other points around the coast which will be indicated when the Defence Vote comes up for discussion it seems strange to me how Spike Island and places around there could defend Limerick, or Galway, or Sligo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where you could land on any part of that stretch of the Western coast with a sailing yacht, so far as the guns or fortifications of Spike Island or Lough Swilly are concerned.  Those ports, however, fortified and properly equipped, would be invaluable in defending the trade routes for Britain along the north coast of Ireland and the south coast of Ireland.  If it is undertaken that we are to pay for those ports I say that it is wrong that we should be asked, as one unit in the Imperial array, to pay for what is obviously an Imperial system of defence and for what should be the concern of all the component parts of the Empire.  We should get down to it now and talk about the Empire, for that is really where we are heading &mdash; head, neck and heels within the Empire &mdash; in defending the Empire, and with the Taoiseach leading us in its defence.  I should like to see how he relates those ports to a system of national defence as distinct from Imperial defence.  I do not want to suggest that if we are to take responsibility for the defence of this country we should not do everything in our power to defend it, and I agree with the Taoiseach when he says that we or future generations of Irishmen and Irishwomen would be unworthy of the freedom that any generation of Irishmen has won if we failed to defend that freedom.  Let not the Taoiseach think, however, that he will get away with an appeal to national sentiment in order to put over Imperial defence on us and ask us to pay 100 per cent. for that Imperial defence.  Personally, I see that if Britain goes down we will go down with her.  And if she has to be defended imperially I believe we would not only be justified in contributing our share, but we would be foolish if we did not contribute to Imperial defence in order to defend these islands, but we should only contribute our share and we should not be called upon to bear the whole cost of it.  I think the Taoiseach or the Minister for External Affairs is asking too much from this House if he asks for the full cost of the defence of those forts as first-class forts to be voted by this House, because, in my opinion &mdash; and I <Col N="657" /> am only going on what British strategists have followed for centuries &mdash;when they fortified those forts, they fortified them in the interests of Great Britain, and we are only continuing that same system of Imperial defence that generations of Englishmen have followed before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, of course, the Minister for External Affairs says that there were three outstanding questions between this country and Great Britain, and that two of them have been settled. The financial dispute has been settled, and the question of the ports has been settled.  I think that a broader view would accept it that those questions had been settled when the citadel of British power in this country was taken over by the National Government of this country.  I well remember the day in Palace Street when I met Collins and Griffith coming out of Dublin Castle, and Collins said to me: &ldquo;We took over the ould Castle to-day.&rdquo; That was the day when our liberty was established in this country and the citadel of British power broken down.  It was only the farthest outposts, and the scavengings and leavings of that power, that the Minister was dealing with the other day when he went with horse, foot and artillery to Spike Island to take over one of the farthest outposts of all. Let us give credit where credit is due and realise that it was in 1922 the real citadel was broken down.  If we have not given due credit in the past for that, let us here to-day unanimously give it.  As for the economic dispute, that was an act of madness which should never have taken place, and if we were able to realise our charter of liberty in 1922 as we have been able to realise it in 1938, the economic dispute would never have arisen, at least in the form in which it arose in the last few years, because, when the apportionment of the accounts after the transaction was being settled, all Irish representatives would have been there at the settlement, and, with a united front, we would have said to Britain: &ldquo;This is what is due to us; will you pay it?&rdquo; If we said that with a united voice in either 1922 or 1926, we would have got a better settlement than we have got <Col N="658" /> now, and perhaps the third big question &mdash; what is, perhaps, the only surviving question, that of the North&mdash; would also have been settled.  That is what might have happened if we had spoken with the same united voice in 1922 or later.</P>

      <P>I shall be interested, and I am sure the country will be interested, to know what has been the cost and what justification we have for sanctions against Italy, and also to know what this non-intervention business in Spain is costing us.  We all know the policy that is behind that non-intervention in Spain.  I heard the policy behind non-intervention discussed there two years ago.  The policy behind it is to create two Spains, and the appeal for peace is an appeal by nations who want a weak Spain and a partitioned Spain.  We have heard, through the mouth of the Taoiseach&mdash; the leader of this House and the leader of this country and of the Government of this country &mdash; that the big outstanding question in Ireland to-day is Partition.  Are we going to be non-Partitionists in our own country and Partitionists in Spain?  Anybody who knows the issues at stake, the bitternesses engendered and the atrocities that have taken place, must realise the situation there.  I have seen a good deal of these atrocities.  I have travelled all the battle fronts in Spain and have seen them, but being there only a few weeks, I never said much about them because it would be presumptuous for a person visiting a country to go and write about that country.  But I can easily say that I know a lot more about it than people who have made good money writing about it.  However, I was not there commercially, and I am not speaking on behalf of nationalist Spain commercially. I want to emphasise that this non-intervention policy in Spain is dictated and has been dictated with the idea of partitioning Spain, and I challenge contradiction on that.  Our support of that policy is supporting the partitioning of Spain.  It has been <Col N="659" /> suggested that we are not in step with those countries; that we are following blindly behind; that what they will do we will do.  Those countries have appealed very speciously for the stopping of bloodshed in Spain.  Let there be peace!  There cannot be peace in Spain until one side wins, because the atrocities have been so terrible. Everything that old Spain stands for, everything that Christian Spain stands for, has been outraged by the Government which we recognise there.  Let us not get away from that.  We should have thought of that when we went down to Marlborough Street for the Votive Mass.  When we asked God to direct our actions in the coming Dáil session we should have laid emphasis on our foreign policy.  Our foreign policy is supporting a Government that has wiped God off the face of the land of Spain where they had the physical power to do it.</P>

      <P>Surely the Taoiseach is not ignorant of the history of the Spanish conflict since 18th July, 1936, when the revolution broke out.  He is not ignorant of the source from which non-intervention emanated.  He is not ignorant of the fact that the authors of non-intervention took steps, made soundings, for peace in Spain.  Peace in Spain means partitioning Spain.  I know first-hand that there were no illusions in the Franco Government about what was meant when an appeal was made for peace and the cessation of hostilities in Spain.  I was in company with two of General Franco's Ministers one night when that was discussed, and they mentioned a certain country which was responsible for promoting it.  I am afraid the Taoiseach has been influenced by the policy of that particular country.  Their outlook was that while a Spaniard in Franco territory lived there would be no peace with the church burners of Communist Spain.  I do not want to labour that aspect any further.  The Taoiseach can be better advised than any Deputy in this House.  He is paying a Minister over there, and he has a direct source of information.  I hope he will justify his keeping of that Minister accredited to the Madrid Government, while he is not accrediting any Minister to the Burgos Government.  It has been said here before that the Vatican had not recognised the Franco Government, so why should we?  Should we be more Catholic or Christian than the Vatican?  I think a big change has come about in the relations there since then.  Also, the Burgos Government controls about threequarters of the national territory of Spain, so that from every point of view the very least that should be expected from this country, not now but for the last year and a half, would be that we would not recognise the Madrid Government. <Col N="661" /> That is the very least that should be expected from us.

For the national honour I should be glad if the Taoiseach would convince me that there are good, sound and sufficient reasons for continuing to recognise the Communist Government.  I cannot see them, but for the national honour I should be glad to be shown them, and I hope that when he is winding up this debate the Minister for External Affairs will explain them to us.  Personally, I am satisfied beyond doubt that the Taoiseach is influenced by Britain's policy in the matter.  I hope that is not so, but that is my opinion, and I am sure the Minister will not quarrel with me if I give my honest opinion here.  I hope he will be able to show that I have been wrong in forming that opinion.  I hope the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;who happens to be the Leader of this House and the Head of the Government&mdash;if he had difficulties in the past in making a decision on this matter on what I consider were the proper lines, will be able, some time in the future or when some event happens, to take steps to recognise the national Government of Spain.  We should not be left in the dark any longer.  We should not continue any longer to recognise the Communist Government, seeing what the position is in Spain.  The country, I am sure, would welcome an indication by the Head of the Government of Éire as to when he will feel justified, in the national interests and in the national honour, to change the policy that he has carried out up to the present.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, as Head of the Irish delegation which signed the recent Agreement with the British Government in London, took responsibility for the taking over of certain forts, and for the future defences and protection of this State.  This is the occasion and this is the Estimate upon which all the implications of his signature <Col N="662" /> to that particular section of the Agreement should be explained to the House and to the country.  The Minister for Defence was not a member of the delegation and, therefore, had no responsibility for signing that Agreement but, undoubtedly, there was collective responsibility for carrying it out as a whole.  The Taoiseach, as head of the delegation, took responsibility for the Agreement which, for the time being&mdash;and I hope it will be a short one&mdash;recognises the might and the right of the British Government to control in the Six Counties.  In his brief introductory remarks the Taoiseach very properly claimed credit &mdash;as he was entitled&mdash;for the work being done in States where we are represented and where our representatives are looking after the interests of Irish nationals.  I think it is much more important that the Taoiseach should explain who is going to look after the interests of the Nationalist minority in the Six Counties as long as Partition remains a part of the problem that the Government has to face.  Deputy Belton spoke about the position of Catholics in Spain and compared their position to that of the Catholics in the Six Counties.  The Deputy stated that in Catholic Spain the people were prevented from practising their religion by a Communist Government.  I submit that if the Catholics are allowed to practise their religion in the Six Counties they have to pay a very high price for professing Catholic principles there.  As one who has been a member of the House for many years, I am anxious to ascertain from the Taoiseach what progress was made in the recent negotiations with the British regarding the future position of Six-County citizens, particularly the Nationalist minority, who are living there under very peculiar conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested to know if any attempt was made during the negotiations to secure the ordinary rights of citizenship for the Nationalist minority in the Six Counties, and, if so, what steps were taken by the Minister and his colleagues for the purpose of having Proportional Representation restored for Parliamentary and local government purposes.  Proportional <Col N="663" /> Representation was provided for in the Treaty, but was subsequently abolished by the Six-County Government.  Proportional Representation here and everywhere else gives minorities certain rights of representation to every citizen, man or woman.  I am anxious to know what advance, if any, was made in that respect during the recent negotiations.  I hope the Taoiseach will agree that, wherever this Government has rights, they should be exercised on behalf of Irish nationals.  Surely it is more necessary to do that on behalf of Irish nationals inside our shores than to do it in Belgium, Italy, or anywhere else where very few Irish nationals reside.  A little more light on the position will be welcomed by every person who is prepared to support the Taoiseach in his desire to see the Boundary removed in our time.  We are also entitled to know what is the policy of the present Government in connection with the removal of the Boundary. No one is prepared to suggest that it should be removed by ordering the National Army to march over the Border, or that we should make any attempt to remove it by economic pressure.</P>

      <P>Six counties in this country are being controlled by an extern Government, and not as they should be by the Government of the people of Ireland.  That matter was under discussion during the recent negotiations, and if we could have an assistant Minister in London, or if we could send a suitable Minister to Sandy Row to look after the interests of Northern Nationalists, I would be quite willing to sacrifice one of the Ministers and to send him back there for that purpose.  I was amazed to read the speech which one of our warlike Ministers made recently in which he referred to most of us as Unionists now.  I am sure, if that is so, that he would be very acceptable in Sandy Row as a representative of this Government to look after the interests of Northern Nationalists in that area until the boundary is removed.  I hope the Taoiseach will take that into consideration when he is thinking over the question of the most suitable means of safeguarding the minority in the Six Counties.  I am sure Lord Londonderry and people of that type would be willing to receive any Minister even if he had to go to the Falls Road for one. Deputy Belton and Deputy Mulcahy <Col N="665" /> referred to the question of defence.  I submit that the Taoiseach is responsible for the defence policy so far as it concerns the taking over of the ports which came into the possession of the Irish Government within the past few days, and for the cost of protecting these ports in the future.  Subsequent to the London Agreement £600,000 was provided for in this year's Budget, presumably for the purpose of indicating to the British Government that we were serious in our desire to maintain these ports, and to modernise them, if necessary, at the expense of Irish taxpayers. While everyone was glad that these ports were handed over to the Irish Government, and that the Taoiseach had taken them over, we are entitled to know what is the defence policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>What do they intend to do with the forts they have taken over?  Do they intend to modernise them?  If so, have they given any consideration to the cost of modernising these forts and if and when the forts either at Berehaven or Swilly or elsewhere are modernised what ships, battleships, submarines, or seaplanes or other implements of war are going to protect these forts when they are modernised?</P>

After all, it is a matter of external relations which does arise out of defence, and will arise in that connection.  I have no objection to dealing with it.  It is only a question for the Chair, whether the Chair thinks this is the best place to discuss it or that it should be discussed on another Estimate on the specific Vote for Defence.  In regard to the question the Deputy has asked, I can only say that he is using phrases that have come out of his own head and that there is no basis for them in anything we have said here.  In regard to the introduction of the Estimate for £600,000, that was, I think, an additional sum provided for defence and had no relation to the ports or anything else.</P>

      <P>Sir, references were made by Deputy Belton which I do not want to follow up in connection with the position of our representatives in foreign countries.  I am not taking any exception to the provision which has been made in this year's Estimate for the cost of a section of an exhibition&mdash;the Empire Exhibition&mdash;in Glasgow.  I would like to hear from the Taoiseach, who is Minister for External Affairs, why it is that when international exhibitions are held in places like France and other foreign countries nothing whatsoever is done to advertise the position of this country in places of that kind.  Why, for instance, is a large sum of money being spent on the international exhibition which is being held in Glasgow this year and nothing at all spent in France the previous year?  I would like to hear that explained. I asked for an explanation of that in another place, but I did not get it.  I am sure the Taoiseach is the only one that can give that explanation. France is a country where there is a good deal in common with the people of this country and I think it was a great blunder when there was an international exhibition in France last year that no steps whatsoever were taken for the purpose of advertising this country and the conditions of this country at the time.  I believe the Irish Government should, wherever it is possible&mdash;everywhere it is possible&mdash; advertise the existence of this State in every exhibition, national or international, wherever they are held, provided the cost of doing so is not prohibitive. Those are the few points I want to make.</P>

      <P>Listening to the speech of the Minister on this Vote, one wondered really whether it was the head of the Civil Service Department of External Affairs was speaking or a Minister.  The statements of the Minister point to the fact that he had no definite line of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know, before we get on to a definite line of policy, what information <Col N="670" /> the Minister has in regard to compensation for the death of Miss Boland who lost her life, I think, at the hands of the Red Government in Spain some time ago.</P>
    <P>Speaking from my own point of view, I must say that I was impressed with Deputy Belton's statement that the Government appears to have followed British foreign policy and to have been almost directed in their policy by whatever happens to be the British policy of the moment.  It does not by any means follow that British policy is always wrong but it is a mistake for this Government or for any Government merely to follow the policy of another Government in connection with foreign affairs or in fact in connection with any affairs. The policy, for example, with regard to sanctions was not only a mistake on the part of the British Government but a mistake on the part of this Government and of all the Governments who took part in it.  I believe that it was stated at that time that if sanctions were to be a success they would require to be supported by military operations.  If you are going to impose peace by means of military operations, then it is no longer peace.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear, in connection with this Estimate, what is the policy of the Government with regard to foreign affairs generally, what action they would take, if any, in connection with the international situation.  The only information which people in this country can get in connection with matters affecting international politics, or relations, or peace, is from the radio or from discussions which take place in the British House of Commons.  Most people in this country were uneasy during the last six, eight or 12 months at the turn of events in connection with international affairs. It certainly seemed as if war were imminent.  The Minister's statement in connection with the policy of external affairs this evening indicates that they are in favour of peace, that they are doing all that is possible towards contributing to that end.  I do not know that there was ever a more popular time in the world for peace. Everybody is speaking about it.  Every Government addresses itself to the <Col N="671" /> desire to maintain peace and every Government is spending more and more on armaments in order to preserve peace.</P>
    <P>Has there been a change in the international situation during the last six, eight or 12 months?  Is there such danger of war to-day as there was, say, 12 or even six months ago?  If there were, our policy with regard to defence would naturally be different to what it would be if we were likely to have peace and our contribution towards defence in this country will at all times be a relatively small one, as it is in the case of countries of small populations, limited means and restricted resources.  It is quite true that at the time negotiations were opened with the British Government last January the international outlook was quite different to what it is to-day. At that time, mainly owing to the mistaken foreign policy of the principal Governments in Europe, a war situation was almost imminent.  They have seen the error of their ways, and I think one of the leading agents in that respect was the Prime Minister of Great Britain.  Just at the precise moment more sane counsels seem to prevail and efforts were made to correct that mistake made in connection with foreign policy that had been pursued for so long.</P>
    <P>It is a strange recurrence of history that the country, perhaps the most peaceful on the Continent, Spain, the country which was a remote cause of the Franco-German war, was likely to be the cause of a war during the last few months.  The situation in Spain, according to the newspaper reports, has improved.  I should like to know from the Minister if he has any reports from our accredited representatives out there as to what the situation is in the area under the control of General Franco, or the Burgos Government, as it is called, and the area in control of what is popularly, and I believe correctly, styled in this country the Red Government.  If my information is correct, the area of the country under General Franco is peaceful and orderly, the prices are within the capacity of the people to <Col N="672" /> pay, and there is full and free practice of religion allowed in that area, whereas in the area of the Red Government there is practically no religion practised.  Some relaxation in relation to religion has been in evidence, I am told, within the last few months, but prices are high and there does not seem to be ordered Government in the place.</P>
    <P>I would like to know whether, in view of these circumstances, and in view of the very strong opinion of our people in favour of what is generally known as the Catholic Government there, it is the intention of our Government to withdraw our Minister from being accredited to Dr. Negrin, or whatever is the name of the Prime Minister there, and have him accredited to General Franco.  Generally, I would like to hear whether or not there has been an improvement in the international situation, whether there is a danger of war now and, if the war clouds have passed and there is less danger of war, if our Estimates for defence are going to be reduced.</P>
    <P>On that question of defence, I would like to know whether it is intended to co-operate, in the event of attack, with the forces of the British Government and, if so, what will be the general lines of co-operation.  Of course, it would be impossible to explain in the House every item of detail, but at any rate the House is entitled to know what the general policy of the State is with regard to them.  I think that if there had been no agreement whatever during the last few months with the British Government there would be a general acceptance on the part of the people of this country to provide whatever money is necessary for national defence.  The disposition of the people is to maintain what they have got and it is not to-day or yesterday they have got it and it is not to-day or yesterday that they have made use of what they have got.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that I felt disappointed at the explanation of the Minister in connection with external affairs.  I think the House is entitled to learn direct from our own Minister what the international situation is and we should not have to look to reports <Col N="673" /> of discussions in foreign Parliaments in order to find it.  There is every reason why the matter should be explained fully and completely here and the people should be taken entirely into the confidence of the Government with regard to the situation.  We are not pressing for details, but we think we are entitled to hear about the general lines of policy.</P>

      <P>I intend to confine myself to a few matters.  I am glad that in the past year the Taoiseach thought fit to realise that the great war which he was engaged in with Britain should come to a close.  He began to realise that the Irish people were not fit to beat the British Empire.  He cut his stick and he came out of the struggle as best he could.  I am glad to say that he came out in a fairly satisfactory manner. One of the chief subjects with which I would like to deal is connected with the Legation in Madrid.  I am satisfied that we, a Catholic nation, seeing what is going on in Spain for the last two years, should now place ourselves definitely on the side of General Franco and the Catholic Government. We should withdraw our Legation and not spend one penny on keeping a Minister attached to the Red hordes of anti-Christ in Spain.  It is a poor thing for the people of this country to realise that our Government will not even now do the right thing in this matter.  They are recognising the godless beings who have destroyed the churches, murdered priests and nuns and wiped out so far as they could the Catholic religion in Spain. It is a sad thought that the Catholic Government of Ireland is standing by seeing these things happening and that they will not make a move to end them.  We in this country suffered for nearly 700 years national and religious persecution.  To-day we see our Catholic friends in Spain suffering, aye, suffering far worse than we ever did.  I now ask the Taoiseach, in the last year of the Spanish War, to declare that we stand for Franco and the Catholics in Spain and that we withdraw our Embassy from the Red Government.  We are in the Commonwealth <Col N="674" /> of Nations, the only Commonwealth in the world that to-day stands for Christianity.  It is due to ourselves to give a lead to the other members of the Commonwealth, to Canada, Australia and South Africa, as well as to Great Britain, and to say that we recognise Franco and that we recognise that the Christian religion is at stake and that we will stand with Franco on the side of Christianity.</P>

      <P>In the old days when the Catholics of Ireland were in trouble the people of Spain came to our aid.  Spain calls on us to-day not for military aid but to recognise that General Franco's fight is a fight for Christianity.  I ask the Taoiseach now to give us a clear indication that he will do the right thing.  I think it is a terrible thing that we, who call ourselves a Christian people, should stand idly by and allow the Jews, the Gentiles, the Freemasons and Communists to dictate the policy of the world.  We stand for Christianity. We stand for it against the Jews, the Gentiles, the Reds and the Freemasons of the world.  Let our Government show that it stands for it.  Let us show the world that we will lay down our lives before we will cow before the Red hordes of this world.  I now put it to the Taoiseach to tell us what he is going to do, and to give a clear indication that he is a Catholic Leader of a Catholic country and that at last he will do what we have been asking him to do for years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of External Affairs is in many respects the most important Department in this country.  I say that because it is the Department which is to control and look after our external interests and to a great extent safeguard the freedom and interests of the nation. To a great extent the progress of this <Col N="675" /> country will depend upon how its external affairs are managed.  We know that we are living in a world in which there are great dangers of international conflict, and it will require the utmost vigilance and the utmost intelligence on the part of those who are dealing with our external affairs to guide this country safely through the many perils facing us on every side.</P>
      <P>If we look back on recent history we know that in 1914 this country was rushed headlong into the European War.  That was done through the action of its elected representatives. Whether the course they took was right or wrong, we have to realise the tremendous effect which the action taken in 1914 had on the history of this country.  We must realise the tremendous losses which have been imposed on this country by the action taken at that time.  In order to avoid being rushed into a similar situation in the future, our leaders ought now take council together and should, as far as possible, insure that the policy in regard to external affairs will be a wise and prudent one.  It is for them to see that the policy will be directed towards preserving the freedom of this country and, at the same time, saving it from international conflict.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that there always will be grave danger of this country becoming aligned with one or other of the groups of conflicting nations on the Continent.  We know that a few years ago the question of Italy's intervention and Italy's invasion of Abyssinia came before the League of Nations.  This country through loyalty to the League of Nations became almost involved in an international war with Italy.  We are now entitled to know if it is the policy of our Government to continue the same attitude of loyalty to the League of Nations which they displayed at that time.  Are they prepared in their loyalty to this so-called League of Nations to plunge this country into international conflict?  We are entitled to a fair reply to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement has been made by the <Col N="676" /> Taoiseach and some of his Ministers that there can be no neutrality in modern warfare.  It is necessary to point out that in the last Great War there were certain nations that were neutral.  Certain European nations&mdash; and very small nations, too&mdash;managed by some means to escape being dragged into the vortex of that international conflict and so being sacrificed. Have the Government abandoned all hope of this country being dragged into the next European war? As I have said a number of nations like Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland succeeded in keeping aloof from the last war.  The most important question that faces this country at the moment is the question of our neutrality in the next war.  That is a question that concerns every citizen of this country.  We must realise that becoming involved in a European war would be a calamity&mdash;a disaster such as this country has perhaps never experienced, at least not experienced in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is one question which has been discussed to a considerable extent here to-day.  It is the question of the mistakes that have been made with regard to the attitude of our Government on the Spanish civil war issue. As far as it was possible, without actually intervening in a military sense in that war, our country has identified itself with the Communists in that country.  That is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.  It should not be continued. It should be rectified immediately by a withdrawal of the Minister accredited to the Communist Government of Spain.  We are entitled to have from the Taoiseach a very definite assurance that that course of action will be taken&mdash;that the Minister accredited to the Red Government will be immediately withdrawn.  It is along these lines that this country will avoid aligning itself with either side in the next European conflict.</P>
    <P>We must remember that countries are drawn into war, not at the moment when war is declared, but by their actions immediately preceding the declaration of war.  It is by emphasising the neutrality of this country, as far as possible, by ensuring and <Col N="677" /> making it clear to the world that this country is not bound up in a system of defence with any foreign nation and that it is a free country and an absolutely neutral nation&mdash;it is on those lines that we as a nation can escape being involved in the next European conflict.  If, as has been stated, there is any understanding with Great Britain in regard to defence; if there is any definite understanding that this country is to co-operate with Great Britain in defending her trade routes, in using the ports which were recently handed over, for the purpose of facilitating the British Navy&mdash;if there is any understanding of that kind it will make it absolutely impossible for this country to remain neutral in the next European conflict.  It is essential, therefore, that it must be made clear to the people of Ireland and to the people of the world that there is no such understanding of any kind and that as a nation we will hold ourselves aloof from any military measures adopted by any other nations and, by holding ourselves aloof, preserve the citizens of this country from the calamities which, everybody realises, participation in an international war will involve.</P>

      <P>There are some questions I should like to raise on this Estimate.  Some of them are matters of detail, but I should like to have a definite answer when the Minister for External Affairs is replying.  Is there any change in the form of a passport that is issued at the moment to the citizens of this State?  What is the precise form of the passport issued? I am asking the Minister for External Affairs what is the precise form of the passport that is issued at the present moment to citizens of this State.  To whom are foreign Ministers to this country accredited, and in whose names are our Ministers to other countries accredited at the present moment?  Is it in the name of the President, or is it in the name of King George?  As I said, these are matters of detail, but I should just like to have the position clarified and to have a definite statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker was referring to a question that, I have no doubt, has <Col N="678" /> exercised the mind of the Minister and his Government, namely, the question of neutrality.  There are two things, I think, to be borne in mind so far as that is concerned: the policy we would like to pursue, and the policy we can pursue.  I gathered from the statement that the Taoiseach made on the 29th of April&mdash;I think it was when summing up the debate on the Agreement, here in the Dáil&mdash;that he regards it as practically impossible for any country like ours to be neutral in any big European conflict: that even if we were to take no further overt part in a general European war than, say, supplying foodstuffs to Great Britain, that would almost automatically involve us in a war.  I think that was then the opinion of the Taoiseach&mdash; I do not want to stress, or to shove or force, words other than those actually used, but I think it was his opinion that there was at least a very grave danger that we would become involved in a war.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to ask the Taoiseach, or the Minister for External Affairs, whether he and his Government have fully considered all the consequences of that position, especially so far as the general question&mdash;I am not now going into particular questions&mdash;of defence is concerned. Situated as we are here&mdash;it is quite true that we are pretty far off the Continent of Europe&mdash;we might hope to escape many of the forces that might compel this country into a European war.  But I gathered from the speech to which I have already referred that there is a particular danger of our being involved in a war owing to one particular reason, namely, our position as regards foodstuffs being supplied to Great Britain. I am not referring now, indeed, so much to the foodstuffs being supplied directly from this country across the Irish Sea to Great Britain.  Our position could be of extreme strategic importance so far as the protection of foodstuffs, coming either into this country or into Great Britain, is concerned. Situated as we are here, with ports that could be eminently useful&mdash;&mdash;and possibly air bases also&mdash;so far as the routes approaching Great <Col N="679" /> Britain, either via the North of Ireland or the South of Ireland, are concerned, is it the opinion of the Government that we would be allowed to be neutral?  As I say, I gathered from the speech made on the 29th April by the Taoiseach that whatever our wishes might be, and whatever our constitutional position might be, in practice it is his opinion that we could not be neutral and that we should be forced into a major European war&mdash;at least one in which Great Britain was a party &mdash;with or without our will.  I do not think I am misrepresenting the Taoiseach in any way when I gather that as the legitimate conclusion from his speech on the 29th April.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach has had any reason since to modify that particular view.  But, that being so, and accepting that position as they must accept it&mdash;I suppose, he would say, as after all he could easily say: &ldquo;It will be taken out of my hands; it is not a matter that, ultimately, will be decided by the Government of this country, but by outside forces, probably,&rdquo;&mdash;I think we ought to be told to what extent the Government has fully realised the consequences of that position, and whether or not they are shaping their external affairs policy and their defence policy with the full realisation of all that that involves.  I think that the Minister for External Affairs will admit that these are matters on which the country is entitled to as much information as he can possibly give.  The plea cannot be put forward that by giving this information he is weakening the defences of the country in any way.  As I say, it is a matter not of the details of defence; it is a matter of general policy.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, as far as we were able to judge at the time&mdash;and everything I have heard since from any quarter, from Continental and other newspapers, bears it out&mdash;we were on the edge of war; we were very close to it. That being so, I take it for granted that the Government must have considered the matter, and considered what their attitude and the attitude of <Col N="680" /> this country would be in cases of that kind.  It is not purely an academic question any longer.  Anybody who is acquainted with the forces that are operating at the present moment on the Continent of Europe knows perfectly well that the difficulty is not to find a cause for war or to start the trouble going.  The difficulty&mdash;and it requires the greatest possible effort on the part of everybody interested in it &mdash;is to prevent war.  It is quite true that the situation may be a little easier now than it was, say, two or three months ago, but the forces that made the situation dangerous three months ago are still very much alive.  Certain policies may have received a set-back. I do not know that we have any guarantee that it was anything more than a set-back.  Nobody living in this Continent, nobody living even in one of the islands off the shores of this Continent, can have any guarantee that within the next couple of months a similar dangerous situation will not arise.  Therefore, as I have said, the questions that I put to the Minister for External Affairs are very far from being academic.  I have considered the full difficulty, and in this I have great sympathy with the Government.  It is not an easy question.  It is not an easy matter for anybody who is entrusted with the destinies of any country in Europe at the present moment to shape the external policy of that country.  At the moment, however, we are interested only in our own particular country, and seeing, as I say, that the Taoiseach realises the practical impossibility&mdash;or what may very easily become the practical impossibility&mdash;of neutrality, we should like to know whether he is shaping his policy, both from the point of view of diplomacy and from the point of view of defence, with a full realisation that neutrality will probably be impossible.</P>
    <P>There is a certain number of other matters that we have discussed in this House before.  I bring them up now rather with a feeling of despair, and not with any hope that the Government will act, but I feel it my duty to refer to them.  There has been in operation now for the space I think of about eighteen months, so far as we are <Col N="681" /> concerned, this policy of non-intervention in Spain.  We read, according to the particular paper that we read, about the failure of that policy of non-intervention.  The failure, as I say, according to the colour of the paper we read, is ascribed, on the one hand, to one set of forces operating in Europe and, on the other hand, to the other set of forces operating in Europe.  In that connection, would the Minister be able to tell us whether he has any information as to how far that policy of non-intervention has been a success and whether he anticipates any particular danger?  Quite recently, within the past couple of days almost, a certain plan for implementing the policy of non-intervention was put by the Government of Great Britain before the other signatory powers.  As this Government is a party to it, and as there are issues involved which we have already dealt with and which I do not intend to deal with now, I should like to have the Government's view as to what attitude we are taking up in this new proposal as regards the withdrawal of volunteers from both sides in Spain.  How far can it be done?  How far is it a practicable proposition?  Technically, it may be much easier for instance in the case of one army to say: &ldquo;Those are all foreigners; they are all brigaded together; out they go.&rdquo;  Is that possible on the other side?  Is the segregation of the foreign elements fighting on one side as easy as that segregation on the other side?  We are a party to that non-intervention agreement. We are a party now, I presume, to the modification of it.  Has the policy of non-intervention been a success?  Has it been carried out?  Is there any prospect that the new policy will be any more successful?</P>
    <P>The last speaker, and I suppose other speakers as well, raised the question&mdash;the matter has often been dealt with and I merely mention it now&mdash;as to why it is any longer necessary for us to keep our Minister accredited to the particular head of the particular republic to which he is accredited.  I do not see the necessity for it.  Whatever excuse there was, say, 12 months ago, that excuse has diminished day by day, it seems to me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> Apart from matters of detail, the main question I was anxious to raise was the general question of policy.  I think it is a matter deserving the gravest attention, not merely from the Government but from everybody interested in the future of this country. What I should like to be sure of&mdash; perhaps the Taoiseach will enlighten us when he replies&mdash;is whether the Government really have a carefully thought out policy in that respect.  I am not now wishing to press the Taoiseach too far.  I recognise that there are many matters of detail which will have to be considered when the actual question arises, but I think the country is at least entitled to know the general lines of the policy which the Taoiseach proposes to follow.</P>

      <P>While listening to the speeches that have been made by members of the Opposition, I took a few notes, and I will try to deal with them.  I think, first of all, I should deal with the objections which have been raised with regard to our representative in Spain.  Now, I have to repeat what I have said on previous occasions in that regard, and that is, that it is not to Governments that representatives of States are accredited. They are accredited to States, and in the main it is to peoples.  In the policy of Governments, the accrediting of a Minister is neither an expression of approval nor of disapproval.  The position in which we found ourselves in regard to Spain was that we had a representative to Spain.  We were very glad indeed that diplomatic relations had been opened up between us and the Spanish nation, just as I expressed my pleasure in saying that diplomatic relations had now been fully entered into between Italy and ourselves, and between Belgium and ourselves.  Our general policy is, and ought to be, so far as possible to have representatives to the great States and the great peoples of Europe, particularly to those States and peoples with whom we have special interests, because of historical reasons.  The Spanish Civil <Col N="683" /> War began, and within a short time a proposal was made that there should be non-intervention in that country by outside States.  We had to make up our minds whether we were in favour of that policy or not.  At the time I explained why our Government was in favour of it, on the ground that we believed that policy was best from the point of view of the general preservation of peace in Europe.  We saw that any other policy, if generally adopted, was going to lead to participation by outside States, when it would be almost impossible to avoid an extension of the area of conflict.  On that account we were glad to see the States of Europe adopt that policy, and so far as it was possible for a small State to encourage that policy by becoming a party to the general agreement, we became a party to and encouraged it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked by Deputy O'Sullivan whether that policy in general has been successful or not.  I am not going to pretend that, over the period of a couple of years during which that policy obtained, I am satisfied that all that was hoped for from the point of view of keeping outsiders from interfering on one side or the other in Spain was successful.  The truth is you have participants on both sides.  At any rate, this has been achieved by that policy, that, so far, it has not led, as was greatly feared, to a wider European conflict.  The only thing I can say in favour of that policy is, that by getting States that might have interfered on both sides very actively, to meet, and by trying to induce them to be favourable to that policy, it has been successful to this extent, that what we thought was inevitable, if the policy of non-intervention was not accepted, has not happened so far.  I was asked by Deputy O'Sullivan if I have greater hopes for the latest agreement than I had in the past.  I am not a prophet, and I can only judge the future by what has happened in the past.  All I can say is that I hope it will be a success. As I explained to the House when dealing with the reason of the Government's adoption of that policy, I believe it is better, in the general interest of peace, and also in the <Col N="684" /> interest of Spain, and of the Spanish people, that other nations should not become involved in the conflict.  Civil war in all conscience is bitter enough without making it still more bitter and more terrible by having on each side people not belonging to the nation.  I have supported and urged the House to maintain the policy of non-intervention on two grounds, namely, that it was in the interest of European interests generally, and, in my belief, also in the interest of the Spanish people themselves.  The fact that we have done that cannot fairly be interpreted as approval of the action of any one side.  From the fact that our representative was originally accredited to the Barcelona Government&mdash;I put it in that way because it was originally that party formed the Government in office&mdash;it is not to be taken that we did not change.  To change at the time, in my opinion, would be a form of active intervention.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on one or two occasions when the matter was before the House, the fact that we did not change is not to be taken as approval of the action of the Government to which he was accredited, or rather to the head of the State to which he was accredited.  It is to the head of the State he was accredited.  I think it is wise that we should continue that policy.  I do not propose to change it, unless circumstances so change as make it seem to us that the policy we have adopted so far is a policy that should no longer be continued, namely a policy of trying to forward non-intervention. If circumstances so change, and if that policy seems no longer practicable, or does not make for the aim we have in view, we may have to change.  Change in cases like that, unless there is definite need, is not wise.  The Spanish people will settle their own difficulties ultimately.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what Deputy Belton means by the policy of non-intervention making for the partition of Spain.  Perhaps I am wrong and that he is right in adducing any argument that seems to him to have weight.  It seems to me that the intervention of a foreign State in that conflict was much more likely to lead to the partition of Spain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> My belief and hope is that the Spanish people will ultimately settle the conflict, that we will again have a united Spanish people, and that we can continue our representation to the united State through the chosen head of the State.  How soon that may happen I cannot tell, but I believe it will be the case and that we will be in the position of continuing our representation to the Spanish people when they have definitely changed their State, if they do change.  If they have a new head to the State our representative will automatically be accredited to that head.  It is suggested that our present representative is not able to do the work of representation in Spain. I believe he is able to do it better from where he is than if he were attached to one of the two conflicting States.  As a matter of fact, he is in the position of being able to make representation to both sides, and we do not feel that there is any necessity to send a <i>de facto</i> agent as, for instance, other Governments have done.</P>
    <P>We are able to do whatever it is possible to do under the circumstances in the way of protecting the interests of our people on one side or the other. I cannot, therefore, say to the House that I see any prospect of an immediate change in our policy in that regard.  I think that, on the whole, it is the wisest and the soundest policy and that having adopted and adhered to the policy of non-intervention, we should not change from that attitude unless it becomes clear to us that the policy is a complete failure and I fear if that day should arise then we should be faced with the dangers that I anticipated when I spoke of a general European conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put a question to the Minister on the point he has just made which was not followed in his opening statement.  He says that the accredited Minister to Spain or to the head of the Spanish State can do his work better by not being in direct contact with either of the parties at war.  Has the present accredited representative ever made representations or ever had direct contact with General Franco on any occasion about any subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="686" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On more than one occasion we have been able to make contacts.  In fact, there has been more communication with representatives of the Franco Government, if I may put it that way, than with the other. Representations have been made on both sides.  He has been in a position in which he has been able to make representations where these were necessary.</P>
      <P>I have been asked&mdash;I think it was by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;whether any compensation has been demanded in the case of Miss Boland.  As is usual in these cases, demand was made on both sides because we did not know which side is going ultimately to have the responsibility for the actions and for the liabilities of the State to an external power.  We want to do what is usual in these cases and that is to make our demand on both sides.  That has been done.  So far there has not been any acceptance of liability so far as I am aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter was raised on the score that I had mentioned Italy and our former friendship with Italy. There was a hearkening back to our attitude at the time of sanctions and a remark was made which I resent.  I do not care whether it comes from a Deputy in an important position in the House or not, I resent very much the suggestion that our foreign policy is being dictated by Britain.  That has never been true as far as I am aware and certainly it has not been true since I came into office.  The external policy in so far as I have anything to do with the direction of it and for which I can directly and immediately account and any actions we take in external affairs are taken from the point of view of our interests alone. If it happened that our interests were the same as those of Britain, then our policy was the same, but it was the same because of common interest, not because one dictated it to the other. Repeatedly we have taken different views and different sides from the sides taken by the British representatives, and this policy of sanctions at the time was taken because of our commitments under the League of <Col N="687" /> Nations to protect the independence of one of the State members.  I was surprised to find the Leader of the Opposition following Deputy Belton's line in that direction, because my recollection was that when we had the question of sanctions under discussion in the Dáil the Opposition did not go into the Lobby against the proposals at the time.  I think there were two Deputies who asked to go on record in disapproval.  Deputy Belton was one and I think Deputy Kent was the other.  But that policy was not adopted by us as the national policy because Britain was following on those lines.  You might as well say that we adopted it because any one of the other 50 nations had agreed to that policy.  The policy was adopted because we regarded it as being in accord with our obligations under the League of Nations, and as we were one of the States whose independence we hoped might be protected by combined action in that way, we felt that we, at any rate, should not be one of the nations who would refuse to fulfil their obligations.  The whole question of the League of Nations can be raised on the next Estimate.  Deputies if they wish to discuss it can do so, but, merely with regard to the past, our action was taken at that time for the reasons I have stated.  It is easy to be a prophet after the event, but even if we could have prophesied what might have resulted, still, so long as we are members of the League of Nations, with those obligations, we propose to carry out our obligations under the terms of the Covenant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton, I think, tried to make out that when the British changed their policy we changed ours, and tried to use that as an argument in favour of his contention that we followed Britain and that Britain dictated foreign policy to us.  He did not follow his line of argument by giving any facts that supported it.  As a matter of fact, the facts to which he appealed prove quite the contrary because our attitude in regard to Italy was not following up any action taken or any changes made by Britain.  We had anticipated these long before and <Col N="688" /> they were taken because of our view that a new set of circumstances had arisen, new conditions had arisen and we were satisfied that we had fulfilled our obligations to the League of Nations and that there was a change inevitably coming about and as long as there was not going to be combined action in a certain direction we did not see that it was serving our interests or serving the general purpose which we have at heart by continuing to refuse as it would have meant, to have diplomatic relations with Italy.  So that the very facts to which the Deputy appeals in support of his argument prove not that he is right but that he is wrong.  This question of foreign policy we had before.  I mean the question of our foreign policy and its relation to British foreign policy.  We had it before and we have had people talking very foolishly about a common Commonwealth policy.  As far as I know there is no such common foreign affairs policy.  Each individual State decides its foreign policy in accordance with its own interests.  In deciding that policy it will naturally take into account what other States with which it is closely associated may be doing, but ultimately the decision is taken on the grounds of the interests of the particular State and there is no such thing then as a general common Commonwealth policy.</P>
    <P>The same thing is true in regard to defence.  There is no such thing as a common Commonwealth policy of defence.  I have never heard of it. Each individual State, just as in foreign affairs generally, in regard to that vital matter of defence, makes up its mind as to the policy that is best in its own interest.  Naturally, in coming to a conclusion as to what is best in its own interests it considers what is going to be the policy of States which may have interests in common, and in so far as considerations of that kind affect it, to that extent, but only to that extent, is the policy of one State determined by that of the other States.</P>
    <P>Before I go any further into the question of defence&mdash;I raised it myself; I mentioned it at the outset, and I have <Col N="689" /> no objection at all to talking in general terms about it&mdash;we may as well deal with it on this Vote; in fact, there could be considerations put forward as to why it is better that we should discuss it on this Vote rather than on the Vote for Defence itself.  Nearly all Deputies followed me in referring to it, but I would like to emphasise at the very beginning that any defence policy which this State adopts, or which the Government proposes for adoption, is a policy which it will adopt in its own interests.  In deciding its policy, if it is wise it will take all the factors into consideration.  The extent to which the State or the Government proposing the policy neglects to take account of any particular factor, to that extent the whole policy may be faulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It involves anything which the Government which is responsible for the time being for the protection may think wise or valid&mdash;not necessary, but wise; what is wise at any particular time.  We can discuss that at some other period, but what I want to stress at the moment is the fact that we will have in a short time the whole of the territory of this part of Ireland ours.  It will be ours to defend or to neglect.  There are no commitments of any kind, either on this Government or a future Government, with regard to what we shall do.  What we shall do will be done purely from the point of view of what we consider right and wise in our own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before consultation, if necessary.  If we do have consultation, it will only be because we consider it wise.  I have not committed myself, this Government has not committed itself, and far less is any future Government committed to the question of consultation.  That will be done in accordance with our own interests.  We have plenty of time to discuss this. There is nothing of greater importance, perhaps, for our people at the present moment, nothing which would so justify a discussion, as this whole matter.  I <Col N="690" /> am only anxious at this stage not to have misunderstanding or misrepresentation. I want to make it clear that we are perfectly, completely and absolutely free to adopt any policy we choose.  The moment that is done, then we will be arguing on right lines. There are no commitments, consultations or anything else.  Anything we may do, or any steps we may take, we will be perfectly free to take.  Those steps will be taken only if we consider it wise in our own interests to take them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should again refer to the smaller question asked by, I think, Deputy Davin with reference to the £600,000.  The sum of £600,000 was not introduced into the Estimates for the defence of the ports.  There is no justification from anything I have said for such a belief.  There is nothing that I can remember having said that would justify anybody saying that this £600,000 was for the defence of the ports.  This additional sum of £600,000 was put into the Estimates because of the fact that we wanted to increase the allowance made for our defence. And why?  For the reason that Deputy O'Sullivan has been talking about.  We are living in a time of danger, a danger that nobody can say is past.  It seemed to be more critical some time ago, but one never knows. In these matters it is the thing that you do not expect will happen that actually happens, and very often the thing you think will happen does not happen.  It would be very wrong for us to calculate on one thing or the other.  Wisdom in our case suggests that we should calculate on the worst, that we should prepare for the worst. If we prepare for the worst and try to do our best to meet the worst, then we can hope it will not happen.  If it happens it will not strike us unprepared. If we keep on hoping for the best and the worst should happen, then we would be unprepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the international situation, there is no use in pretending that I can give any secret information or that I can give a better picture to Deputies than they can get from the newspapers.  Again, the best information may be completely misleading. We do from time to time get information <Col N="691" /> of a certain type, but the Government would be making a very big mistake were it to rely upon that, depend upon it as an excuse for not taking the steps that should be taken by people who realise they are in a critical situation.  I believe we are; I believe the world has been in a very critical and dangerous situation, in danger of war for a considerable time past.  It was that very strong consideration of our responsibility here for the defence of our people, seeing that if there was a European war we should not be taken unawares&mdash;that was the immediate reason for my sending the despatch out of which the negotiations began.  It was quite clear, as regards the position of a Government here if the ports were to continue to be occupied by British forces, that it would be quite a different position from the position in which they will find themselves if these places were not occupied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>What about the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the beginning, the Six Counties remain the cause of friction between Great Britain and ourselves.  It is a separate matter.  I would not suggest for one moment that in a debate on external affairs it was not an appropriate matter to raise.  When we are dealing with Great Britain we are dealing with an external affair and there is no doubt in regard to any negotiations or dealings we may have with Britain the question of partition is bound to arise.  It was a British Act of Parliament that was responsible, in the first instance, for partition and, according to British law, Northern Ireland is a part of the general State; although there is a certain separate Parliament in the Six Counties, they still regard it as a part of the State&mdash;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Therefore, in so far as we are dealing at any time with Great Britain, that must obviously be a primary matter of consideration and a fact that must always be at the back of the minds of any people who are trying to <Col N="692" /> bring about better relations between the people of this country and Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin asked for some information as to what had taken place at the Conference.  I made it quite clear that from the beginning to the end the importance of this matter was stressed, so far as the Irish delegation was concerned. That it did not have any effect so far as the ultimate Agreement was concerned, is clear from the face of the Agreement itself, in which that matter is not mentioned.  Whether it had any other effect, I am not in a position to know.  The British Government had first-hand information of the situation as we saw it, both from the point of view of our people who are held in that area against their will and who are suffering there, and also from the point of view of the relations between the two countries as a whole. That fact has been stressed.  These aspects have certainly been stressed. They were certainly stressed by the delegation and it is not the delegation's fault if a full realisation has not been brought home to the minds of the people who were negotiating with us.</P>

I know so far as a majority of the Irish people who are living in this island are concerned, they want to have a united Irish State.  Of that I am certain.  I do not think I could usefully go into that question of partition any further.  That it will be the aim of this Government to do everything that it is in its power to end that situation, I can assure the Deputy.  I feel that that is equally true no matter what Government sits on these benches.  That the removal of that remaining obstacle to good relations must remain the primary purpose of every Government here is apparent <Col N="693" /> to everybody.  More than that on behalf of this Government or any other Government that may be present on these benches, I can hardly say except to add that the Government will use every opportunity that comes its way to promote the achievement of reunion in this country.</P>

However, that is a matter for another <Col N="694" /> place.  It is an important matter.

      <P>Be it so.  To be absolutely positive, I would have to look up the notes to try to get something definite.  I am almost as certain as I can be, without written confirmation, that that aspect of the matter was discussed, that under Proportional Representation there was a certain principle which would have given representation to the present minority in the North, and that they were deprived of that.  I am almost certain of that, but I would not be quite certain without having some written confirmation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming back to the question of defence, in the conditions in which we find ourselves the question of national defence is of primary importance. <Col N="695" /> Until this question of the forts had been settled it was not easy to get any satisfactory line upon which one could go.  I pointed out the dilemma in which the Government necessarily found itself as long as the forts on these ports were in British occupation. I do not know if it is necessary to remind the House what the dilemma was.  Perhaps, as there may be some new Deputies here, it would be no harm to repeat it.  The position was this: First of all, it was not merely the occupation of the ports that was the important thing.  These Articles of the Treaty of 1921 definitely gave Britain the right to make a claim for other facilities&mdash;not merely to occupy these ports but for any facilities she might require for the defence of Britain and Ireland by sea.  If war broke out and the British Government made demands in accordance with the terms of that Treaty, my belief is that any Government that would accede to these demands would immediately forfeit the confidence of the majority of its own people.  The Government would find itself in this position, that by acceding to the demands it would alienate the sympathy of the people which a Government needs to have in a crisis such as war.  If, on the other hand, it refused to accede to the demands that might be made under the terms of that Treaty, then you had a danger of immediate hostilities between this State and Britain.  There you had in one case a danger at home, an internal danger, if the Government took cognisance of the Articles of the Treaty and acceded to the claims in accordance with it or you had a danger of war or conflict with Britain if you did not accede.  Now, these Articles of the Treaty have gone.</P>
    <P>There was another aspect of it too that perhaps I should refer to.  It is this that whatever chance there was of an outside State recognising the neutrality of this country if we had the ports, there would be no likelihood of their recognising it if our ports and harbours were being used on one side.  The enemies of Britain in such circumstances would have a further reason for refusing to recognise our neutrality.  Suppose our <Col N="696" /> people desired to be neutral, there was a grave chance of that desire being frustrated so long as the ports were in occupation of the British or so long as she had these rights under the Treaty. That brings me to the question of neutrality.  I think that our people do not differ from the people of any other part of the world in their desire not to get into a war if they can keep out of it.  I think it is a very natural desire to avoid all such wars.  Modern wars are not luxuries.  They are not things that people desire to have. People will only get into a war if they are forced to do so, if every possible means of avoiding it fails.  I think we can take it as a general proposition, true of our people as of every other people, that we do not wish to get into a war if we can keep out of it, and that it should be a part of our general aim to keep out of war if we can and not to get into war if we can keep out of it.  Assuming other things were equal, if there were any chance of our neutrality in general being possible, we would probably say that we want to remain neutral.  I do not know that you can follow that up by saying in any war but, in general, our desire would be for neutrality as far as possible.</P>
    <P>When I said some time ago that neutrality did not seem in modern circumstances to be possible for a State, what I meant to say is this, that neutrality requires not merely the desire on the part of the State that wishes to be neutral, but recognition by the opposite party of that desire and of that fact. The trouble is that States are not willing to recognise neutrality if a refusal to recognise it gives them any advantage whatever.  We had States that did not desire to take any active steps in the last war, which took no initiative and no active steps, and yet they were not treated as neutral by Powers which were strong enough to ignore the fact that the States in question wanted to be neutral.  If I wanted to be more accurate in the expression of what I said, I should have said that the trouble in modern times in that neutrality is not recognised, that you want to have a recognition of neutrality, and not merely the fact that the State in question desires to be neutral and does <Col N="697" /> not desire to take any active participation.</P>
    <P>I think that, when considering this question of defence, we ought to distinguish carefully between the constitutional position and the position that facts may bring us into.  Constitutionally, I want every Deputy to realise that we have no commitments, we can keep out of war, we can be neutral if we want.  There is no constitutional obligation on us, so far as I can see, not to remain neutral.  I think our position in that regard differs in no wise from the position of Canada, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa.  The heads of Governments in these States have very definitely stated that they cannot be committed to war and cannot be committed in advance to take any action, except whatever action may at the time be considered right and advisable by the Parliament in all the circumstances of the time. We are exactly in that situation.  There are no advance commitments on us to take any side in a conflict that may ensure or any action whatever, except such as, at the time, may commend itself to Parliament.  In other words, the Parliament of that date, in these circumstances, will be completely free.</P>
    <P>It is very important for us to realise that that is the situation which we hold exists.  There may be, as there can be on other grounds, States that may wish to ignore that position and will do so, not because there is a really good case that they can make, but because they will want to ignore it; just the same as any State that wants to ignore the neutrality of another State, wants to benefit by the ignoring of it, will naturally try to get some excuse for the ignoring of it.  Constitutionally then, we are perfectly free, and it is actually written into the Constitution what our position is to be.  I will give the reference in a moment when I get it.  At any rate, the position is this, that war cannot be declared except by the Government and the Parliament; that war cannot be entered into except with the consent and sanction of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>If we are clear about the constitutional position we can come down now and consider what are the facts in which we may find ourselves.  What are they?  It seems to me, in the first <Col N="698" /> place, that we have to consider the general policy of defence from attacks from any quarter and I think we may divide these into two&mdash;an attack in which Britain would be attacking us and an attack upon us to which Britain would not in any way be a party.  If Britain should attack us for one reason or another we shall have to defend ourselves against Britain as best we can.  Just as we had to try to secure our freedom and our rights in the past by engaging in conflict with Britain, if such a thing should happen in future, we shall have to do the same and we have got to be, as best we can with our resources, in a position to make it unprofitable for Britain to do so.</P>
    <P>I believe that such a thing is not going to happen.  I think that with the progress of events and the direction in which we are travelling, and in which the world is travelling, that is not likely to happen.  But I have nothing to say to anybody who says &ldquo;It may happen and, therefore, you have to think of it in your general defence.&rdquo;  To meet that possible contingency which may be in some people's minds we shall have to keep that at the back of our minds in planning our defence generally.  If people think: &ldquo;Well, you are too small a Power, and if Great Britain should attack you again you will not be able to succeed,&rdquo; all I know is that there are 750 years of history to show, at any rate, that we have not simply sat idly by and allowed our rights to be taken absolutely with impunity. We have done our best to try to secure our rights, and I can only say that I hope that that particular thing is finished, and that in future, in so far as our defence plans are concerned, if such an occasion arose we were not going to find ourselves in a position in which Britain was going to be one of the Powers or States that were making an attack upon our rights or liberties.</P>
    <P>That position, of course, is complicated by the existence of Partition, and if Partition were solved and we were a united Irish State here, I would say that that possibility would merit far less consideration than it does at the present time.  The same <Col N="699" /> thing will be true for Partition and the effect of Partition in regard to the other alternative which I am going to talk about.  The other alternative would be one in which Britain was not the attacker, but one in which our rights, or liberties, or interests generally were being attacked by some State other than Britain.  We have to ask ourselves: will Britain be neutral in such a case?  Would Britain just stand aside and allow us to be attacked by an outside State?  If the attack were to go certainly to the point in which a foreign Power was likely to get possession of our territory from which they would be in a position to menace British interests or rights, either immediately or at a later time, there is no doubt that Britain would have an interest and an immediate interest because of her geographic position and not because of any association of a political character which we might have with her.  The fact that there is a certain association at the present time means that, possibly, that consideration is likely to be reinforced. Therefore, it is more likely that, if we should be attacked by an outside State, Britain would, if she felt that she was going to be affected by the result, be interested in giving to us any aid that we might ask.</P>
    <P>Would we ask it?  Again, it would depend on the circumstances.  It would depend upon whether we thought it advisable to act alone or not.  If we considered that we had an advantage in acting alone we would act alone in all probability.  But, we might be perfectly certain that if we wanted it in such a case British aid would be forthcoming&mdash;not in our interests.  I am not pretending for a moment that States act in these cases from altruistic reasons.  Sometimes they do, but such cases are rare. Generally, they do so for some immediate selfish interest.  That is true of us as it is of other States.  I am not saying of other States what I would not say in the main, and using general terms, of ourselves.  Consequently, if we are going to be attacked by an outside State we may be able to&mdash;I think it is not unreasonable that we should&mdash;if we wanted it, <Col N="700" /> count on assistance.  And, if we are going to plan our defences, we can plan from the point of view of meeting that situation&mdash;the second alternative that I am proposing&mdash;not alone, but with assistance.  Naturally, if we had a great Continental power attacking use we would recognise that we would need such assistance, because of ourselves we probably would not be able, in fact I think it is almost certain to meet frontal and a straightforward attack from any foreign State.  All that we could do with that foreign State is what we could do with Britain if she attacked us&mdash; do the best we could, making up our minds that if it was going to take generations of further struggle to get that foreign State out, that then our people would have to consider doing it.  But that we would be successful in the first instance, unaided, I do not think is likely.</P>
    <P>In dealing with defence, it is facts, in so far as we can get them, that are going to count, and we would be very unwise, when dealing with a serious matter of this sort, to try to deal with it on any other basis.  I think it was Deputy Mulcahy who pointed out the danger of trying to deal with a matter of this sort by appealing to feelings that were natural in other circumstances. That would be quite wrong, very unfair and unjust to our people. It is because I do not want to have any misunderstandings that I have been stressing, as much as I have, the fact of our constitutional and other freedom, because it is true that we are considering this from the point of view of Irish interests.  I believe it would be true, no matter what differences there may be in our own views with regard to what is wise and reasonable, that the matter would be approached from that point of view by every member of the House.</P>
    <P>Well, then, if we are going, in the circumstances that I have been talking about, to get assistance from Britain, or to have circumstances to meet in which we can only win and secure our freedom by getting that insistence, commonsense dictates that we should try to provide in advance so that that assistance would be of the greatest possible benefit to us.  If, in order to <Col N="701" /> do that, the consultation which Deputy Davin mentioned was necessary and advisable, then such consultation would be held by us.  I think that not to do it would be to lose advantages which we could have in meeting a possible danger, and I do not think that we could, in a matter of this serious importance, afford to throw away any advantages.  If, for instance, by consultation we should know what steps the British were going to take in such a case; if we were going to be attacked and the British, whose interests in such circumstances were going to be affected by it, were going to assist, a knowledge of their plans in such a case would be of very great importance, naturally, because we should, in anticipating what might happen, prepare our plans accordingly.  If it is necessary to have an organisation here which would be able to take the utmost possible advantage of that, then we should strengthen our organisation so that we could do it.  I am talking now in general terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence is here, but the fact is that it is only recently that we have got a new situation, and that we have been able to get down to these matters in the way that we were anxious to get down to them.  So far as the Government is concerned, we have not had before us a considered policy with regard to some of these items, because of the fact that it will, of necessity, depend very largely on the advice which we may get from the technical side.  But this Government, anyhow, is going to get all the assistance that it can from any direction in the case of the circumstances which I have outlined as possible. All you can do is to try and provide for possible contingencies, and, of course, it is those that seem to be immediate and dangerous that will occupy our attention at first.  As I have said, I am speaking in general terms. I am not giving the House at the moment&mdash;the time will come for that&mdash; the greater detail which I think the House would be entitled to expect if a longer time had intervened between the coming in of the new conditions and the present moment.  However, I think we can usefully go along the lines that I have been going on, and see <Col N="702" /> what they would suggest that we should do.  I have already said&mdash;the matter has not arisen&mdash;that, in my opinion, if a consultation would put us in a better position to meet the danger that we might have to meet, then I think there should be consultation.</P>
    <P>The next thing is, what part do these ports, which we have just taken over, play in the general scheme of defence? Again I have to answer by telling you that I do not know, because a general defence scheme, from the military point of view, has not yet been worked out. But I can say now&mdash;I have said it before&mdash;what, as a layman looking at this, I would be very tenacious about.  If the experts put something of a contrary character before me, I would be very tenacious of my own view.  These ports are obviously points controlling trade routes which could either be attacked or interfered with.  Consequently, any power that was anxious to get possession of them, if there was a big world conflict, or if there was any power that was anxious to get possession of our territory at all and was prepared to face the consequences, it would have to think of these as points that would be especially useful to it.</P>
    <P>I suppose they would be useful and, therefore, a point of temptation to a power that was going to ignore our rights and we should consider it important to have them so equipped that we would be in the position to deny that power.  Of course, if a power lands anywhere in your country it can get around from the land side to your ports as well as from the sea but these are objectives which would, naturally, occur to an outside power engaged in a conflict in which control over trade routes might be of importance. We regard them as such and the most effective preparation to enable us to deny them to a foreign power should be made.  Whether that is best done from the sea side or from the land side, I am not in a position to say at the moment but that they are important points and that, therefore, it would be a mistake for us to leave them undefended, is a thing to which I hold.  I also hold to keeping them equipped and useful from that point of view&mdash;that we might be <Col N="703" /> attacked either because a foreign power wished to get possession of our territory or wished to use our territory as a base for attack on Great Britain. It would not matter why they came once they got possession of our territory. It might not be easy to get them to withdraw and our purpose should be to keep them out.  From the point of view of getting assistance and making that assistance of the greatest possible value, I think we ought to keep these ports and arrange for their defence, so that, in that particular second alternative they would be of the greatest possible value.  As to how they should be equipped, that is a matter rather for the experts than for me or the members of this House.  I am talking only in general terms but I think Deputies will agree that these ports are important because of their geographical position and, therefore, are prizes which a State attacking us would like to secure.  We should, therefore, put ourselves in the best position we can to see that they do not secure them and that they are of the greatest possible value so long as we are able to hold them.  The defence of our country, as a whole, has to be considered and how far these forts will fit into our general defensive scheme I am not in a position at the moment to say.  Whether there must be modernisation of the equipment there, I cannot say.  I had never been in the interior of these forts until within the last few days.  I was in one of them the day before yesterday and in three of them yesterday morning.  Our officers have not, I think, been in them, either, until quite recently. Therefore, what is to be done in regard to them will have to be worked out. They must fit into the general, national defensive scheme.  If somebody says that these forts or harbours are not going to offer defence for the Shannon or for Galway I say that so far as direct defence is concerned that is quite true but how, indirectly, they may be able to affect the defence of the Shannon and Galway is another matter.  It may be necessary for us to see that these points are not open and to consider now they should be defended.  In all these defence plans, <Col N="704" /> there is the fundamental consideration that the nation numbers only 4¼ million persons and that we, in this part, account for only 3 millions.  Our resources are limited and, no matter how well we try, we cannot make certain that our defences will be adequate.  It is almost certain that our best defences would be inadequate from the point of view of complete protection.  Taking that fact into consideration, we have to go as far as we think our resources will permit.  If our plans are wise and good, the farther we go the more certain we are that we shall not be attacked because the more expensive we make it for any possible enemy to attack us the less likely we are to be attacked.</P>
    <P>We, here, shall differ as to the amounts that are available and the amounts it is reasonable to vote for this purpose.  Again, that matter will be determined very largely by the technical, defensive plans put up to us.  If we had a plan prepared and were able to obtain reasonable security by the expenditure of an additional £250,000, I do not think that the House would deny the country that measure of protection for the sake of an extra expenditure of £250,000.  What the sum will be, I cannot at the moment say.  All I can say is that we have provided the amount that is likely to be expended in the present year.  We have provided in the Budget for an extra £600,000.  The use of that money will be dealt with when the Minister brings forward his detailed Estimates. What the ultimate cost of our defences is going to be, I cannot say.  It will probably differ from year to year according to the circumstances and according to the needs of the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not I have gone sufficiently into this matter for the present purpose.  I have been able to deal only with general principles. I think that that is all I could be expected to do on this Estimate.  What I have said will give a general indication of what my mind is on the matter and what, I am satisfied, the general attitude of the Government is in regard to these questions.  The details will have to be dealt with on the Estimate itself.  I should like, before I end, to stress what I have <Col N="705" /> said&mdash;that any steps we are taking will be taken not because there are commitments of any kind&mdash;because there is none&mdash;but solely because they are, in our opinion, in the interests of our own country.</P>

      <P>I do not know what may result finally from this, but the Government must, in the first place, go into this matter and examine it in detail in a manner which we have not been able to do up to the present and, so far as it is possible, to arrive at a public policy.  I agree with the Deputy that this is a matter of very great seriousness and that it is one in which there should be the utmost frankness.  There should be no hiding away of the essentials.  There may be certain things which, from the military point of view, it is essential should not be made public&mdash;not because we did not want our people to know them but because people other than our people who should not know about it would know about it.  But I think that in so far as it is practicable the Government will be very anxious to get assistance from other Parties in the House.</P>

      <P>There were one or two small points which I raised and with which I think the Taoiseach intended to deal.  There were also one or two questions of bigger issue.  Of the smaller, one was who accredits our Ministers to foreign States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other question was the general question of our external policy.  On that I should like a little more definiteness.  I will admit straight away that the Taoiseach has, to a certain extent, disarmed me by the number of times he said &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo; and a number of times he said he had no policy <Col N="706" /> when he came down to the concrete. That does tend a little to disarm me. The Taoiseach made it quite clear from our written Constitution what the purely Constitutional position was.  But he said that facts were something different.  I had made that distinction myself when I spoke.  What I ventured to devote all my attention to were the likely facts.  I took it for granted that we should like to stay out of any future war, but I directed attention to the things that were likely to happen.  I gathered from the various speeches of the Taoiseach and especially the one on the 29th April that the most likely way in which we could be involved in war was not by any attack from Great Britain.  I admit that is out of the question, but I do not think either that any foreign power is likely to attack us for our own sake.  But I think it is highly likely that we may be involved in the war&mdash;that was the position taken by the Taoiseach on the 29th April&mdash;owing to what I may call our geographical position.  On that day Deputy Dillon put this question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Did I understand the Prime Minister correctly when I believed him to have said that if we continued to send foodstuffs to Great Britain in time of war that it would be folly to pretend that we could maintain our neutrality?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reply of the President on that occasion was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it would be so in fact.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I think that can be expanded. To get food into Great Britain directly would almost inevitably be the cause of our being involved in war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do admit that we are not committed to any policy except we think that policy is wise&mdash;in the best interests of the country.  The Taoiseach again and again repeated that the only thing that would govern our conduct would be what would be good in the interests of this country. What I am anxious to get from the Taoiseach is a statement of what he thinks would be a wise policy and what would be good in the interests of this country.  Has the Taoiseach made up his mind as to what a wise policy would be?  He told us again and <Col N="707" /> again that we are free to adopt what is a wise policy.  What I was anxious to get was whether the Taoiseach had made up his mind in the contingency what would be a wise policy.  We were facing the prospect of a European war a short time ago.  The Taoiseach hinted that once a war was on it would be rather late in the day to consult about measures.  Admitted we are not committed to consultation except we think it wise, am I to assume that the Taoiseach does think it wise to have consultation? Admitted that he need not do it if he does not think it wise, does he think it wise to have consultation?  Does he think it wise to have a plan of co-operation beforehand?  He indicated in the course of his speech that in a certain contingency, namely that we would be attacked, Great Britain would come to our aid.  Would it be wise then to start consultation beforehand in order to know where we were? Again, there is this one question which I admit the Taoiseach has prevented me from asking by saying he did not know, that is what the cost would be. He says he does not know and that is quite true.  Let us look on this matter of defence in this way: Either that we stand alone or that we stand in co-operation with another power, namely Great Britain.  I ask does the Taoiseach think that £600,000 a year is any real contribution to defence if we stand alone in case of attack?  I do not think it is or ten times that sum.  Therefore, I must take it, unless the Estimates jump up very much, that the question of consultation and co-operation must come up for decision very quickly.  I admit that it is a matter of extreme importance.  I am not at all anxious to make a debating point, but this matter is of great importance for the country.  I want now to know definitely whether the Government has made up its mind definitely on the policy it is going to pursue from now on in what, after all, is the most likely contingency why our defence forces should be called into action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad of any liberties the Chair can give to either side on this matter because I do think it will help to clarify the situation on both sides, if we clear our views as to what is the most important matter we could discuss.  Now we are discussing this matter for the first time in a set of circumstances in which we can get down to bed-rock for the future.  I am sorry to say it is not as far as I would like it to go because of the disturbing factor of Partition which disturbs everything we are considering here.  I will deal with the general argument we have been using already.  I quite admit that my analysis of the possibilities was defective to this extent.  Besides the two that I mentioned there was another one in which Britain was attacked but in which our interests were so obvious in the matter that we should consider, though not the direct means or object of attack, that we were directly concerned. I should also consider that as one of the alternatives because assuming that the people of this island were free, that Partition was out of the way, there is hardly a doubt that having settled our difficulties with Great Britain as regards our independence, we would see here a continuance of that situation, a continuance of our independence and the fact that Britain recognises that independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if you look at the map of the world, or the map of Europe, and think of a completely free and independent Ireland in relation to that map, there is no doubt that the island of Britain would be a natural shelter between us and attacks from the Continent.  So long as Britain was there as a shelter, and so long as she was not attacking us herself and was sufficiently strong to be a shelter between us and an attacking state, we, therefore, would have an interest in seeing that that sheltering position was maintained.  Consequently, there are <Col N="709" /> circumstances in which a direct attack upon Great Britain, even though it was not a direct attack upon us, but which might remove from us the shelter or protection that we had up to then, would be a matter of serious importance to our people.  In our general plans, therefore, we might have to take that possibility into consideration also.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that these two are really only one aspect of the same thing in practice, and that is that, in practice, it would mean that we should have plans so as to enable the Government of the day, taking its decision in the circumstances of the day, to be in a position to have the utmost preparation made.  As I say, these two aspects of it are really one, namely, that of being able to see how Britain and ourselves, if we were co-operating, would have the most effective combination or co-operation. I can see, from the arguments that are put forward in that respect, that it would be of very great importance indeed that each country should have a fair idea of what the other's plans were under these circumstances, and that it is very hard to get that knowledge without consultation in advance.  The Deputy asked me whether, as a fact, we had made up our minds in that regard.  I have to answer him &ldquo;No,&rdquo; because there are other aspects of that question which would have to be considered before we would finally make up our minds in the matter.  Consultation might connote something different from what the facts are, and might involve consequences, too, which should be considered in that regard before one's mind was definitely made up.  As I have said the Government as a Government has not considered definitely its final plans, because sufficient time has not intervened to enable us to have the reports of our experts considered.  That is one general aspect of the question which has been raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to food and what, in fact, would be our attitude in that connection, again we are very slow to commit ourselves in advance, because I think that, whilst we should make plans to meet contingencies, we ought not to commit ourselves in advance to policies <Col N="710" /> in regard to these certain contingencies, because to the extent you are doing that, to that extent you might be depriving Parliamentary Government of its proper liberty.  However, that we should make our plans to meet these contingencies is certain, and as far as commitments are concerned, we should not enter into them except where they are absolutely necessary if our plans are to be made satisfactorily.  Now, with regard to the question of food: suppose a country regarded our sending of food to Britain, or our continuing our ordinary peace-time trade with Britain, as being inimical to their interests in war, and that they regarded the disruption of that trade as being essential to them, I suppose they would do as other powers have done in recent wars; that is, they would ignore any position we might have taken up in regard to neutrality and do their best to disrupt that, either by warning us, so to speak, that if we continued that trade, such-and-such would be the consequences, or, without warning, they would simply attack that trade and disrupt it by simply attacking our ports or whatever vessels would be carrying on the trade or attacking any other lines of communication that, inland, might be leading up to that trade.</P>
    <P>Well, I think our people would insist on the right to continue their ordinary peace-time trade with another country, and if we were strong enough to do so, I think we would resist any such attack; but a modern war is not a thing to be engaged in lightly, at any rate, and one has to balance very carefully the losses which would result from a war with the other losses which might result, and the Government of the day might very well say: &ldquo;Very well, leaving questions of principle aside, the loss of our trade is such-and-such, but if we engage in a war to defend our trade we are probably going to lose a great deal more.&rdquo;  The Government of that day might have to hesitate as to the line it would take in such a case, but I would take it that in general the natural disposition of any Government and any people would be to defend their ordinary rights.  They would have to weigh the costs, however, and that should not be left out of consideration. Ordinarily, however, as a people carrying <Col N="711" /> on our peace-time trade, if we were attacked we would naturally defend ourselves, and the moment you engage in defence it is necessary that you should make it as effective as possible.  Very often, as is well known, the most effective form of defence is a good attack. Accordingly, in such a case, the Government of the day, or whatever Government had the responsibility, might have to take action, but at any rate, whatever might be the decision of the Government of the day and in the circumstances of the time, the duty of any Government, before the time, is to make provision so that the necessary defence could be put up.  Consequently, this Government, at any rate, I can say, in considering that matter, would try to make plans in advance so that the Government of the day would find itself prepared and equipped with plans to meet a situation of that sort.  I do not think the Deputy would expect me to go much further into the matter at this moment.</P>
    <P>Well, then, with regard to consultation, and with regard to plans, I have indicated what our general attitude is, and before final decisions are taken we will have to know more from our experts as to what these things might involve.  The final question I have been asked is: what are the terms of our passport?  There will be no change whatever made in the passport.  Our external relations and our associations with the States of the British Commonwealth, as the Deputy knows, are determined in the Constitution.  First of all, the power to have these relations is fixed by an Article in the Constitution. Just at the moment I forget what Article it is, but, as I am quoting from the Constitution, I may say that I now have the one about war&mdash;the Article to which I referred in general terms.  It is Article 28, and it is on page 58 of this copy of the Constitution which I have here.  Section 3 of Article 28 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;War shall not be declared, and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is sub-section (1) of Section 3. Sub-section (2) of the same section says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" />&ldquo;In the case of actual invasion, however, the Government may take whatever steps they may consider necessary for the protection of the State, and Dáil Eireann, if not sitting, shall be summoned to meet at the earliest practicable date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the two sub-sections that deal with war.  Now, with regard to the question of a passport, I have said that the terms have not been changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister read from one, because I have not seen one for some time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, the terms have not been changed.  Our external relations are governed by Article 29. Our associations with the States of the British Commonwealth are governed, first of all, by the fact that we have these powers under Article 29. Article 29, Section 4, sub-section 1, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The executive power of the State in or in connection with its external relations shall in accordance with Article 28 of this Constitution be exercised by or on the authority of the Government&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>so that the executive power is exercised by or on the authority of the Government&mdash;&ldquo;and</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of the State in or in connection with its external relations, the Government may to such extent and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law, avail of or adopt any organ, instrument, or method of procedure used or adopted for the like purpose by the members of any group or league of nations with which the State is or becomes associated for the purpose of international co-operation in matters of common concern.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the general enabling power, enabling laws to be passed to make any arrangements that are necessary for procedure in regard to external relations of a certain type.  That has been implemented, or rather it was in accordance with an Act that had already been passed, which may be <Col N="713" /> regarded, if you like, as implementation of it in a certain direction. Section 3 of that Act&mdash;it is the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936&mdash;says:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said that owing to the importance of this matter I had a question to ask.  For instance, we vote moneys allowing Deputies to go to inter-Parliamentary Unions, and the question inevitably arises as to what our general defence policy is.  I wonder would I be right if I epitomize it as follows: First, we have constitutional provisions which prevent our armed forces or our people from partaking in war without a resolution of Dáil Eireann; secondly, we have no defence commitments with any country, not even with Great Britain; third, our general policy, as far as European conflicts are concerned, in the Continent of Europe at any rate, is one of non-intervention; fourth, if the territorial integrity of our country was threatened by a foreign enemy we might expect and we would welcome the co-operation of Great Britain in repelling such an aggression; fifth, if our important trade with Great Britain was interfered with by a foreign enemy we would expect and we would welcome the assistance of Great Britain in protecting our trade; sixth, because of those important considerations we have, without prejudice, constant consultation with Great Britain; and seventh, we believe that if Great Britain were engaged in a conflict in which we were standing neutral she still would expect the facilities of our ports, and we believe that our trade in connection with her is of such value as to warrant that she should get them.  I ask is that a fair epitome of what our defence policy is?</P>

      <P>I do not think it is, in this sense, that the Deputy goes further than I would be willing to go in taking decisions now with regard to what a Government might do afterwards. &ldquo;Welcoming&rdquo; and &ldquo;Expecting&rdquo; are words which I think are <Col N="715" /> appropriate to an exact situation.  If we should go on the basis of planning, on the basis that that might possibly be and would be likely to be the attitude of the Government of the day, then I agree, but I do not think it would be right that we, apart from the circumstances of the day, should try to negative&mdash;as it would be to a certain extent&mdash;that freedom which we should like the Government of the day to have.</P>

We are concerned at the moment not with giving pledges or promises or anything of that sort to anybody.  We are concerned with the very simple matter of making the most effective defence plans we can.  If the Deputy says that we, in making our defence plans, should consider that as a possible, and, in fact, if he wishes to go further, a likely attitude of the Government of that day, then I would say it is all right.</P>

      <P>The reason was that, at the moment that this was done by an outside body, we were trying to press that situation elsewhere, to make it quite clear that the defence situation, from the point of view of this Government, was an impossible one, and that we were anxious to clear matters up and get down to bedrock.  This whole defence question is still more complicated by the fact that we have this Partition.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,136 be granted to complete the sum <Col N="717" /> necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for a Contribution towards the Expenses of the League of Nations, and for other Expenses in connection therewith.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A gives particulars of the contributions towards the expenses from Member States to the League of Nations.  The expenditure is met by contributions from the different States on a unitary basis of calculation.  The contribution to be made by Éire represents ten units out of a total of 932 units.  The contribution attributable to the cost of the International Labour Organisation is borne on Vote 67.  The total contribution from all Member States in 1938 is 29,416,883.75 Swiss francs, of which Éire will contribute 315,124.75 Swiss francs.  Of the amount contributed by Éire 315,124.75, a sum of 81,907.90 Swiss francs is attributable to the cost of the International Labour Organisation.  Sub-head B provides for travelling and incidental expenses. The provision under this sub-head is to meet State expenditure in connection with the attendance of a delegation at the General Assembly of the League, which will be held in September, and any expense which may arise in connection with special conferences called to consider important questions. Sub-head C deals with the loss on exchange and is required to bridge the difference between the par value of the Swiss franc and the current rate. In general, during the year which has elapsed since the House was last asked to pass the Vote for the League of Nations, two Assemblies have taken place, the first, a special Assembly held last May to admit Egypt to membership, at which we were represented by our permanent delegate.  In September and October, 1937, there was the ordinary 18th Session of the Assembly which was attended by an Irish delegation.  The General Assembly and its committee was largely taken up with two or three questions of very great importance to the maintenance of general peace in the world.  These questions related especially to the civil war in Spain, to the conflict of interests in Palestine, <Col N="718" /> and the trouble which was and is still taking place in China.  The Irish delegation took an active part in these deliberations.  On the question of non-intervention in Spain, they opposed a proposal which seemed likely to entail the cessation of the non-intervention policy there.  With regard to Palestine, our view that no solution involving the partition of that country should be sanctioned in any way by the League of Nations was duly put on record.</P>
    <P>Regarding the ordinary day to day activity of this country as a member of the League, I need only tell the House that we are allowing no practical opportunity to pass of doing our share in the social and economic war of the League. During the past year our contribution to that work has been somewhat greater than usual.  We obtained for Ireland a seat on the newly constituted and very important permanent commission now sitting known as the Advisory Committee on Social Questions.  This position will enable us to co-operate in, and, no doubt, influence to an extent the great humanitarian efforts of the League of Nations, particularly so far as they affect the welfare of women and children.  Finally, as the House will recall, we have recently become parties to some of the International Conventions sponsored by the League.  I refer, in particular, to the convention regarding the suppression of the traffic of women of full age and to the Broadcasting Convention to which our accessories have just been formally notified. As to the larger question of the League itself, what the future is to be, and what our attitude is, I do not think there is enough definite matter to make it the basis of a special discussion.  I indicated a couple of years ago what our attitude was likely to be if the question of a re-organisation of the League took place, and we are awaiting certain negotiations now going on in regard to the future of the League.  I do not think anything has emerged that would enable us to see the future in any definite way.  In general, we think we should not take any special action, in the hope that something positive may result from these deliberations, in which we could actually participate, as we <Col N="719" /> may then be in a position to try and have them moulded in a way that would seem best from the point of view of our own interests, and in the general interests of the world and co-operation towards world peace.  I am sorry the position is so indefinite and vague that I can only recommend the House to adopt a certain policy and to do whatever ought to be done in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is, as everybody in the House knows, a very great change in the situation as regards the League of Nations from what it was, say, five or six years ago, and I think we should not do anything at the moment which would prejudice our liberty to act in accordance with what we regard as wise, if any propositions are put forward for reconstitution of the League or remodelling it.  I think it is wise to hold on to what is there at any rate and not by any action of ours do anything which would weaken the League any further.  The position, however, is by no means satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping once more, Sir, that the Taoiseach, having broached the general question, might have indicated on what lines his mind was travelling.  He spoke in reference to a reform of the League, that it would be useful and commendable we should be there to take our part in the remodelling of the League along the lines that we desire and which were best to forward the interest of our own country and also best to improve the international relations.  I thought that was an introductory sentence and that he was going to tell us along what lines he wanted the League to reform, because I think it is of supreme importance. At the very close he referred to the fact that the League was not now in the position that it was six years ago&mdash;I think that was the term he mentioned. That is quite true, and for that I do not know whether to blame the enemies of the League or the friends of the League.  I can never make up my mind which of them was the more responsible&mdash;those who are continually carping at the League and its failure to carry through certain things, to live up to the highest possible ideals, carping <Col N="720" /> at the League because it was not perfect, and those who wanted the League to be about 100 years ahead of the time.  It is extremely difficult to know which of those two sets of opinion was the more responsible for the League not now being in the healthy position it was six years ago.  It was for that reason that I was hoping the Taoiseach would indicate along what lines his mind was travelling when he spoke of the reform of the League.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a strong demand in certain quarters for reform of the League in the sense of strengthening the powers that the League already has and the using of such powers, undeterred by the fact that it is really the exercise or the attempted exercise of powers of that kind that is largely responsible for the position in which the League finds itself at the moment.  I know it is easy to condemn the League at the present moment because of its powerlessness. But such condemnation of the League does not improve the international situation.  Because the League is not able to do everything that its admirers would like it to do, and that it is far from perfect, that does not mean that it is useless.  The Minister referred to the useful social work&mdash;when he says social matters I presume he is not referring to the social in another sense of the words&mdash;and also the valuable health work that is being done.  That alone would almost justify the existence of the League. As I mentioned, I think, on a previous occasion, even the fact of bringing a number of Powers together to discuss matters is useful.  It is quite true that the League was not able to enforce sanctions, but the fact that there was even that discussion at Geneva and that there was division of opinion there &mdash;I am not speaking of the formal Vote &mdash;and the recognition that certain things could be attempted, but beyond that it was dangerous to go&mdash;some people forget that that itself may have stopped a European war on that particular occasion.  Therefore, although the League and its recent history has been disappointing, I should be very sorry if we left it.  It is not perfect. It is not at the moment growing in strength or respect.  There are certain <Col N="721" /> dangers, grave dangers, I will admit, there at the present moment; but we do not make these dangers any smaller or we should not make them any smaller by withdrawing from the League.  There are certain dangers. There is the danger undoubtedly that the League may become not a League of Nations but a coalition of certain Powers.  I can say that the friends of the League in certain countries in Europe, and not so very far away from this country either, are doing a great deal to damage the League in that sense.  They are trying to turn the League into a combination of Powers against certain other Powers.  About these certain other Powers I have no delusions whatsoever, and about one or two of them I have had occasion on an entirely different situation from this to speak about 12 months ago. There are certain big Powers in Europe, in the centre and the east of Europe, between which I see very little difference.  Yet I think it is a wrong thing&mdash;this aligning and this effort to align the League on the side of one set of Powers.  I raise that because I think it is a very practical question.  I think it is a matter to which our representative at Geneva might have his attention especially called.  Our representative at the assembly might dwell on that point, that there is that danger.  I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that there is that particular danger that the League is now almost formally and officially becoming an alliance of certain Powers against certain other Powers.  That is not its function, and, as I say, the people that are doing most damage to the League in that respect are those that put themselves up as being the greatest advocate of the principle of the League of Nations.  They are making it exceedingly difficult for those who believe in the League to continue in their belief in the League because they are using the League either for an idealism that fails to take account of facts or else they are using the League for what I might call Party politics, using the word in the biggest possible sense, or, as the phrase is now, for or against a certain ideology.  It is a danger, and I think it is useful that we should be <Col N="722" /> there, small as we are, to try to help, because sometimes small nations find by experience that by a lead of theirs they can stir up the others&mdash;especially if they repeat the attack one or two years.  I found that myself in dealing with the question of economic control. The first year I do not think I had a single supporter.  The next year I had half the League with me.  Hence I think it useful to stress this danger as one to which I would like our representative's attention specially directed.</P>
    <P>The other thing I am afraid of is that some people are much too anxious to pull the League into everything.  It is desirable that the League would be strong enough to enforce international obligations.  But it is not strong enough.  It has neither the moral authority nor the physical authority to do that.  And do not blame the League for that.  Blame us here, and Great Britain and France and Germany and Russia, and every other nation, for it. It is no good pretending that the League has all the original sin.  It is because we and every other one of us uses the League for his own ends. Every nation there looks after its own interest first and foremost, even in the League of Nations.  There was a time when the League of Nations was obviously run by one Power, but even so, it was doing useful work.  That control was not too blatant.  I am afraid it has now become just a little too blatant, and if the friends of the League have their way, will become more blatant still, so that any chance of a real League will be out of the question.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, a couple of the questions in which the League&mdash;failed, shall I say?  On the Abyssinian question it failed, because public European opinion was not ripe enough.  The League and the friends of the League wanted the League to do things, and there was no real international moral sense behind them.  That moral sense does not exist in Europe, and speaking of Europe I mean the world.  It does not exist in the world at the present time, and you have to rely on force alone.  That is a weakness.  That makes the danger of going too quickly all the greater.  And if the League on that occasion did what some people thought the League ought to have done&mdash;went <Col N="723" /> to the length of war&mdash;let us clearly see what that meant.  It meant that a League of Nations founded for the express purpose of preventing European war could not carry through that purpose without causing European war! Its very raison d'être was gone in the attempt to assert it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a great deal of the criticism of the League is due to the people who expect too much from it &mdash;and I am speaking now my personal opinion merely.  If there is to be a reform I should prefer that we should advance slowly rather than try to advance ahead of international public opinion which I am convinced hardly exists.  As I pointed out before, it has taken centuries to get respect for the ordinary law within any country, hard work, hard hitting on the part of Governments; centuries with colossal failure time after time and yet the thing has been done.  But behind that use of force there was always a sense of moral obligation, the condition that the Government had a definite moral authority.  Let us remember that does not exist where the League is concerned. All we are anxious, therefore, to get is a working instrument which at the beginning may be able to do very little.  I am convinced that a portion of its failure is due to the fact that they are attempting too much.</P>
    <P>Take the other instance that happened the other day.  Technically, I suppose, the League could get out of it.  There was the invasion of Austria. We all have our views, some very strong and very definite, on that particular piece of policy.  Austria was a member of the League of Nations. Technically, of course, there was nobody there to appeal to the League. Technically, the Schusnigg Government had resigned and handed over its authority to somebody else, and, therefore, there could be no appeal.  Again, surely it was quite clear there could not be an appeal because things internationally had come to such a pitch that an appeal was out of the question and would have been useless.  Austria had to stand alone.  The League could be appealed to, but what could or would the League do?  Again, it is not <Col N="724" /> the League that is to blame, but the individual Powers.</P>
    <P>I personally approve of the waiting attitude.  I do not know that there is anything to be done at the moment, but I should like that we should have a definite line as to the developments we should like to see occurring there, and I should like our representative to be made aware of the dangers that undoubtedly are there at the moment of developing along lines that can only lead to the final damnation of the League.  There are withdrawals from the League, but I do not think we ought to follow that line.</P>
    <P>It is an attempt to preserve European peace.  You may say it has three-quarters failed.  Well, for the remaining quarter I still hold we ought to back it up.  There is useful work to be done, and there is useful work being done by the League.  If our representative is not there, the League might do certain work of which we might not approve.  The Taoiseach referred to health work and social work.  It is easy to get international conventions there to which we might have strong moral objections, and in that sense it is useful to have an individual there to represent our point of view.  Our delegation from the very start has always taken up a very definite line on these matters.  We should not let these things go by default by coming out of the League.  That is my attitude towards the League itself.</P>
    <P>There is one other question which perhaps the Taoiseach might answer. I saw that our representative at Geneva was present, across the lake, at Evian at a conference.  What line are we taking up at that International Conference meeting at Evian?  I see that it has now adjourned to London. Have we a policy on the matter at all, or were our people there simply in the capacity of observers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the general question as to what lines we are thinking on, in general we are thinking on the same lines as the Deputy, so that in that matter there is no difference of opinion between us. As to the question of holding on to the League at present and trying to use the League as best we can for the purpose <Col N="725" /> for which it was originally intended, in so far as it was possible to do it, that has been our aim, and in so far as it is not possible to do it completely, we are anxious to make the best of the situation; so that from the point of view of staying on and doing the best we can, we are again at one with the Deputy.  We are also at one on the question of the general lines that we will have to take if there is to be a change in the League; that is, that there is no use in trying to strain the League by undertaking obligations which we know human nature will not accept at the moment when things are not ripe for acceptance.</P>
      <P>I wonder if we will ever get a situation in which the selfishness of nations will be overcome by anything except force?  Unless you have to think on the lines of the super-State, or something like that, I do not think that you are likely to make progress in that direction.  The only time they seem prepared to do that is when they realise, even from the point of view of selfishness, what a modern great war means.  When they realise that the alternative to taking certain actions, may involve sacrifice on the part of individual States, and when they may recognise that failure may mean sacrifice on a much greater scale elsewhere, only then can we make progress.  I am afraid we are all narrowly selfish in certain matters and we are not sufficiently wise to be selfish in a farsighted way.</P>
      <P>If my wishes were to determine the way that the League might go, it would not be undertaking obligations which would put too great a strain on individual members.  I think too great a strain was put on them.  That was the position in regard to Abyssinia, although it was a clear case.  Others may not agree with me, but my view is that it was a clear case.  Probably if the ultimate strain was put on the individual members, they would have broken down under it.  Perhaps in the long run it is just as well, from the point of view of the League members in general, that the full strain was not put upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other matter, I think I already adverted to that in a speech which I made in Geneva.  I <Col N="726" /> refer to the danger of the League becoming a coalition of powers with certain purposes against a coalition of other powers with different ideals.  As the Deputy pointed out, that would be fatal to the League and anything we can do to prevent that happening, will be done.  The third point is in regard to the Evian Conference.  Our representative went there.  We see a situation in Europe, which is a ghastly one from the point of view of certain people, and if anything could be done by international co-operation to remedy that, I think it would be a thing our nation should participate in, in bringing to a head.  Again, you have the difficulty of what can you do?  What could each individual nation do? There you are up against the difficulty that some of the nations that would like to see it done are not in the position to do anything effective, and those who are advocating something to be done, unless they are themselves prepared to do that something, are not likely to be listened to with much attention. I would say at the moment that our representative has not got very much beyond the observation stage&mdash;as an observer.</P>
    <P>If, as the discussions develop we see any way in which we could assist, I can only say that the Government would be very glad to give it its most careful attention and, if it is possible to do anything, we would be prepared to come forward with proposals here for the implementation of any scheme to which we would agree or in which we would be in any way directly or immediately involved as a partner. The presence of our representative there is an indication of general goodwill, a general desire to see that situation remedied, if a remedy can be found and, in so far as our situation here would make it possible, to contribute in any way practicable towards a solution.  Therefore, I think the most accurate way to describe the position of our representative there up to the present, is really as an observer, to see if there is any development to which we could contribute in any forward way.  His presence there is an indication of our appreciation of the situation and of our desire to try to find a remedy for it.  As I said at the <Col N="727" /> outset, I do not think anybody who examines the situation can regard it otherwise than as ghastly for millions of people.</P>

      <P>I should like, with your permission, Sir, to put a question to the Chair.  On the occasion of the entry of Russia into the League of Nations, the Taoiseach made a speech in which he made reference to the position of religious liberty in Russia, and for that he was justly applauded at the time.  I should like to know if, as Minister for External Affairs, he can disclose whether there has been any improvement, or was the hope he expressed then merely a pious hope.

      <P>I cannot say, as far as I have been made aware, that there has been any special improvement in the situation.  In fact I have tried to get inquiries made.  I have made representations, if not directly, almost directly, to representatives of that country about the situation, but the facts were disputed, and I have no means of convincing the people who took a different view of it, that the facts, as we saw them, were correct. However, I think, in general, the position is that there has been no improvement from that point of view.</P>

      <P>If I might say so, I would suggest that the Deputy should talk to Deputy O'Sullivan, because this is a thing which Deputy O'Sullivan was anxious to find out from me, whether <Col N="728" /> for instance, my mind was travelling in the same direction as that of Deputy Gorey.  There was a time, I will admit, when I was thinking very much on those lines but, from my observations in Geneva, I had to consider how obligations of that kind would be met in various countries, how, for instance, our people would meet them.  We had an example at the time the Abyssinia question came up.  When you bring it home to the exact time at which your own country will be asked to use its own forces to carry on a movement of that sort, when you proceed to that point, you perceive the difficulties.  If we are going to reform the League at the beginning, it will not be on the lines of strengthening all the old sanctions, but rather weakening them. There are two points of view.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has one.  That of Deputy O'Sullivan and the policy of the Government is framed on another.  I think that it would require a long time to go into that question.  I would prefer if that point had been raised at the beginning, and I would have repeated what I had said in a previous debate.  If the Deputy is interested in my view of the matter, he will find it in the debate of the 19th May, 1937, when I discussed that particular matter.  If he wants more than he will find there, he might discuss it with Deputy O'Sullivan, who has indicated very fully the lines on which my mind has been travelling as Minister for External Affairs.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £1,114,914 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1939, chun an Airm agus Chúltaca an Airm (maraon le Deontaisí áirithe i gCabhair) fé sna hAchtanna Fórsaí Cosanta (Forálacha Sealadacha); chun costaisí áirithe riaracháin ina dtaobh san; <Col N="729" /> agus chun costaisí maidir le coinneáil príosúnach áirithe sibhialta.</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,114,914 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1939, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts; certain administrative expenses in connection therewith; and expenses in connection with the custody of certain civilian prisoners.</P>
    <P>This estimate for the year 1938-39 was framed last November and December and it was to meet the situation that could be anticipated at that time. Since then, owing to the Agreement arrived at with the British Government, the situation has altered radically and to meet the new circumstances a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced later on providing for the expenditure of £600,000, mentioned by the Minister for Finance in his Budget and by the Taoiseach since. This Estimate, therefore, is for the normal expenditure that was anticipated when the Estimates were being prepared at the end of last year. Comparing this estimate with that of 1937-38, there is not a very big difference. It shows an increase of about 29 officers, 43 cadets and 300 other ranks in the regular Army.  There is a slight decrease in the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve of 325 due to the cessation of recruitment for that particular arm.  There is an increase of 500 in the class &ldquo;A&rdquo; reservists attributable to the transfer of men whose service with the regular Army has expired.  For the coming year, it provides for an establishment of Volunteer Forces of 300 officers, 8,000 first line volunteers, a recruitment for the first line of 1,500, 3,000 second line volunteers, and 300 third line volunteers, making a total of 13,100.  Anybody who looks at the financial side of the Estimate will see that there is a net increase of about £76,000. There was, in fact, a gross increase of £115,000 but that is offset by certain deductions amounting to about £49,000, which bring the net increase to £76,000.</P>
    <P>These increases are due to an increase <Col N="730" /> in the strength of the regular army&mdash;the 300 to which I referred&mdash;an increase in the cost of maintenance, an increase in the number of civilians and the rise in the cost-of-living bonus, and lastly, the purchase of stores.  The first two factors&mdash;the increase in the strength of the personnel and the high cost of maintenance, are responsible for about £57,000.  The third factor, the increase in the office personnel and in the cost-of-living bonus, is responsible for about £14,000, and the increase in the purchase of stores for about £40,000.  As regards the purchase of stores, it should be noted, in connection with the sum of £151,000 provided under sub-head P, in respect of warlike stores, that last year there was a carry over of £69,000 for stores which although ordered in due time could not be delivered within that year.</P>
    <P>In October last we gave effect to the Defence Forces Pension scheme, and the situation in regard to the Army is changed radically by that scheme.  Up to now an officer or soldier joining had no pension rights.  With the coming into operation of that scheme, an officer or soldier in addition to his pay will be entitled at the end of a period of 20 or 21 years to a pension.  That scheme was before the Dáil and was discussed, and since then we had occasion to look for a number of recruits. We only wanted a few hundred, but there are about three times that number coming forward.  So that I think the present conditions of army service and conditions of pension are acceptable to a very much bigger number of men in the country than actually we want to recruit.</P>
    <P>There are certain things that I expected some Deputies would want to refer to on the occasion of the Army Estimates, but from what I can hear of the debate on External Affairs, they have already been discussed. Also they would be more appropriate when discussing the Supplementary Estimate that it is necessary for the Dáil to sanction for the expenditure of the additional £600,000 which is anticipated.  That Estimate will be brought before the Dáil as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>To an extent the question of defence has been discussed this year in connection with External Affairs.  To a very great extent that was helpful, but to a certain extent, so far as I am concerned, it led to mental confusion.  We have had this evening two rather contradictory statements.  Taken in conjunction with the Budget statement, we had a third.  The whole Budget debate, so far as it referred to the new Vote of £600,000, both from the Government and these benches, implied that that expenditure was in one manner or another connected with the taking over of the forts, their equipment and their modernisation.  That was a perfectly reasonable point of view.  It was not contradicted.  In fact, I think some Government speakers justified it on the grounds of modernising the forts.</P>
      <P>This evening we had a statement from the Taoiseach that the £600,000 asked for had nothing to do with the ports, that it was an ordinary development of our defence forces.  We are entitled to know from the Minister for Defence which way it is.  I admit that when this specific Supplementary Estimate comes up we will probably get a fuller statement.  But, even at this stage, in discussing our defence policy we are entitled to know whether that sum is making provision for new conditions or whether it is normal development.  If it is normal development and unconnected with the ports then it should be indicated here in the normal Estimate.  There are apparently, either different points of view between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence, or there is no joint consultative effort.  I do not care which way it is.  If it is normal development, it should be here.  If it is new expenditure in connection with the ports, there is nothing either to be ashamed of or afraid of in making that statement.  But Deputies, who are asked as representatives of the people to vote the money, are certainly entitled to know what it is for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, further, in his statement to-night told us that there was an obligation on all Governments to make adequate provision for defences within their means, and the more <Col N="732" /> critical the conditions were the more ample the defence should be and the more money should be expended for that purpose.  That certainly is a sound statement.  But it is a strong indictment of the Minister for Defence on the Government for the last six years.  Things have changed this year. For the last six years we were regarding Great Britain as our enemy... She is now our friend.  I welcome that. It is a big improvement in the atmosphere. It makes our existence less critical.  During the last six years, England and Italy were on the point of war.  Europe was like a dynamite heap with a lot of children running round with lighted matches.  Peace has more or less been made between these two great countries.  The position of Europe, so far as we can see it, is less critical now, by far, than it was during the last five or six years.</P>
    <P>But let us return to the Taoiseach's dictum, that when things are critical then our defence must be most complete and we must spend more money. Apparently, our policy is this: that we begin to spend big money when things get less critical, that we begin to spend more money when the relations between ourselves and a powerful neighbour are relations of peace rather than the bitter relations of war.  We are further told that our new expenditure is connected in no way whatsoever with the recent Pact and understanding with Great Britain.  Nevertheless, because the European state of affairs is more pacific, because we have made peace with an ancient enemy, because our neighbourly relations are better, we are asked to spend considerably more money.  That is nonsense. So much is it nonsense, that I do not believe that either the Taoiseach or the Minister would have that stuff believed by any Deputy sitting behind him.</P>
    <P>If our new expenditure on the forts and the further development and expansion of our Army arise out of facing up to our national obligations and are developments arising out of our new relations with Great Britain and the Government's acceptance of the Commonwealth position and Commonwealth responsibility, then I welcome it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> But if we are to spend enormous sums of money merely because the position is less critical, and there is no other case made, then that demand should not be made on the pockets of the people.  If this country is to stand alone as a tiny isolated unit in a warmad world every sane man knows this, that it does not matter whether you spend £600,000 more or £6,000,000 more you cannot defend this country as a tiny isolated unit with a population of 3,500,000 people, and you might as well save your money and enjoy life as long as you are here.  European Powers are spending, each of them, hundreds of millions of pounds annually on defence. You cannot defend any point from any country in Europe by a defence expenditure of two, three or six million pounds, or compete in an armament race or in a defensive war with nations that spend hundreds of millions.  If our policy is that we are going to stand alone, and absolutely alone, the most reasonable defence policy for us is absolute disarmament, relying, perhaps, on such a bent reed as the League of Nations and our own helplessness rather than on a defence force that can be produced by an expenditure of, say, £2,000,000 a year.  If, on the other hand, arising out of the recent Pact, the new atmosphere and the new recognition of the trading interdependence of this country with the neighbouring island, there is a joint idea of keeping the road open, of defending the trade routes&mdash;if there is a facing up to the fact that, no matter what the position was in 1908, in 1938 one of the two neighbouring islands cannot be regarded as a unit for the purpose of defence&mdash;that is all to the good.  Two neighbouring islands nowadays are one unit for the purposes of defence.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows, even people not conversant with military men or military minds, that two little islands lying side by side nowadays have got to be regarded as one for the purposes of defence.  The peoples of both countries have to realise and face up to that. We had from the Taoiseach this evening a kind of desire to face up to facts, a kind of desire or a half-desire to be frank with the Dáil, but we had it <Col N="734" /> limited and curbed all the time by that kind of characteristic reluctance to face up to any words: to things that are sentimentally objectionable.  It is sentimentally objectionable to people in this country, to every nationalist in it irrespective of Party badge, to find ourselves, even in the defensive sense, operating our army with their navy, or our army with the British army. But, because it is sentimentally objectionable, is no reason why we should shirk facing facts.  The position of the Government is this: that they are facing the facts but they are ashamed to state it.  They are doing the thing but they are ashamed to give it a name.  They are in the position of the man who eats an onion but objects to the smell off his breath.  If you eat the onion you have got to have the smell.</P>
    <P>I believe that the defence of countries and the security of peoples are of the utmost importance to all nowadays, and no matter whom you have got to co-operate or ally yourself with, you first of all have to take into consideration common interests, and trading interests of interdependence. I am not dealing with political matters such as membership of the Commonwealth or anything like that.  We are depending on England for many things. She is depending on us for food.  We are relying on England for the raw materials for our industries and on her to a great extent for manufactured goods.  If her trade routes are blocked our lines of supply are cut.  If we are to look after the security of the people in this country, then we have got to do it in co-operation with some country that has a navy.  The Minister for Defence knows this much: that an island without a navy, in terms of defence, is a joke.  Switzerland might as well have a navy and no army&mdash;a purely inland country&mdash;as for any island to talk in terms of defence with an army, no matter how big, and no navy.  The first and obvious line, and the only sensible line for defending an island is from the first point of attack at sea&mdash;to keep the invader away.  You may make it expensive and dear for an invader to land or after he has landed, <Col N="735" /> but to rely on an army to defend an island is so much nonsense.  If things were otherwise in 1921 than they were, and if we could afford to spend one, two or three million pounds, common sense would have dictated that the first one, two or three million pounds would have gone on some form of coastal defence rather than on an army.  Internal conditions directed that we should first establish an army.</P>
    <P>An army is important and valuable. It is important to make it expensive for a force to go further after landing or to remain after landing, but that is merely the second phase in any sensible defence policy for an island.  The first is a navy, and if we cannot have both an adequate navy and army, then the obvious thing is to make arrangements with some country that has a navy: with some country that has common interests with ours, that is relying on us for something that is vital, and whose interest it would be to continue to get that something that is vital. Great Britain wants our food in times of peace.  She wants it more so in times of war.  Food from this country is practically vital to Great Britain in time of war.  Her navy is there, and the obvious thing is to use it.  If we are going to use it, then co-operate with them and make the use of it speedy, efficient and harmonious.</P>
    <P>Now, I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister is doing that; that that is the plan, the policy and intention of the Government.  If it is, why be afraid to say it?  We are not modernising ports and increasing the efficiency of forts for the sake of having soldiers potting at seagulls.  Everyone of us knows that an odd fortified fort, here and there, at four or five points of an island, is worthless from the point of view of land defence and worthless from the point of view of an army on land.  If you are going to rely on that type of coastal defence, co-operating only with an army inland, then you have got to fortify the coastline all round, as some countries have to do&mdash;not just a spot here and a spot there.  If our coastal defence policy is based on co-operation with a fleet at sea, co-operation with a navy, then the obvious and the commonsense thing is <Col N="736" /> to fortify the stronger harbours because you have a navy with which to co-operate.  That is what we are doing but we are either afraid or ashamed to say so.</P>
    <P>There are pleas about co-operation between Parties.  If there is ever to be co-operation, the first thing there should be co-operation on is the security of the State and the safety of its people.  But you cannot have co-operation based on evasion.  You cannot have co-operation in blinkers. Nationally, the line which I am suggesting the Government is taking is just as objectionable to the nationalists on this side as it is to the nationalists on that side.  Away back through the pages of history, our fathers and grandfathers suffered just as much at the hands of the British as any Deputy opposite.  If we allowed the liver to guide our actions, we should be bellowing hatred for Britain for the rest of our lives.  If we made our passions subordinate to our common sense, we should be doing that.  But we believe that, as Deputies, we have got to face facts and we propose to face up to these facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister is coming here asking for money.  The Taoiseach says that that money is for one purpose.  The Minister for Finance says it is for another purpose.  The Minister for Defence says &ldquo;mum.&rdquo;  He merely told us that we should be informed later what the money was for.  That money is voted already.  It was voted then on a case made, that case being that it was new expenditure in connection with the forts.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach to-night indicated that there is no connection between it and the forts.  Is the position that we were asked to vote the money without the Government knowing what the money was for?  The Taoiseach was put a clear-cut question: &ldquo;Are you or are you not going to co-operate with the British navy in the defence of this country in the event of war?&rdquo;  He answered, with characteristic evasiveness: &ldquo;When, and if, that war comes along, then we will decide.&rdquo;  No child over seven years of age would accept that as a satisfactory answer from a child of eight years.  We are supposed <Col N="737" /> to take that as a satisfactory answer from the head of the Government.  If that be the mind of the Government, what is it that they are proposing to do?  They are proposing that they will spend this money first, that they will drive their hand deep into the trousers pocket of everybody, that they will expend all the money on armaments designed for co-operation with a navy, but that they will not even decide that that is their policy, or admit that that is their plan, until the bombs of war are bursting over our cities and towns. Does not the Minister know, whether the Taoiseach said that or not, that every sane defence department in the world makes its plans years in advance, formulates its policy, possibly, decades in advance, and that the country that waits to make its plan and formulate its policy until the big guns are belching death&mdash;that that country goes under quickly and deserves no better end?  I had hoped that, with the new international atmosphere between this country and Great Britain, with the representatives of both Governments and both armies joining in toasts, with certain types of speeches being made in certain constituencies where the imperialist vote was strong, that, at last, the Government was coming to reason, at last, they were facing up to facts.  But they are neither facing up to facts nor coming to a state of reason if they think that even a docile majority in this House is so thoroughly irresponsible, so thoroughly reckless of their responsibility to their constituents, that they are going to vote hundreds of thousands of pounds without knowing what the money is for. That is too much to expect even of the docile followers of the Government.  I have used many hard words with regard to them.  I have brought many a charge against them, but I would not charge them with being so thoroughly irresponsible, so capable of disregarding their responsibilities to their constituents that they would walk in here in response to the crack of the whip and vote away hundreds of thousands of pounds of the people's money without knowing what it was for.  It is the pig-in-the-poke policy&mdash;&ldquo;Give us the money now and in a few years we shall let you know what it was for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> It is at least excusable that the Taoiseach, in dealing with the Vote for External Affairs, would not, or could not, go fully into even the broad outlines of defence expenditure, but it is equally apparent that that obligation is on the Minister.  According to the Taoiseach, we propose this year to increase our defence expenditure by £600,000, and, according to him, if I understood him properly, that has no connection with the ports or the forts. Why are we doing it so?  Are we in a more critical position than when our relations with Great Britain were bitter?  I will repeat what I have said in case I misunderstood the Taoiseach.  I understood the Taoiseach in his remarks this evening to say that the £600,000, which it is proposed to raise according to the Budget, had no connection with new liabilities in relation to the forts or the ports, that it was for the expansion of our defence forces generally, and not a sum required arising specifically out of the Agreement and the taking over of the ports.  I was proceeding to argue from that that if there was no connection between the £600,000 and the taking over of the ports, there must be some other reason for increasing our expenditure this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say there was no connection.  What I said was that this was a sum provided over and above to meet the new situation in regard to defence.  As to whether some of that would be needed for the ports or not, I certainly did not suggest that it might not be so used.  I said that I did not know.  It is there to cover it, but it has not arisen, using the Deputy's own words, specifically in regard to the ports.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be hair-splitting with the Taoiseach or anybody else.  The word &ldquo;specifically&rdquo; seems to be the whole sentence.  Everything seems to turn on that word.  We are not children.  If we are to ignore the port side of things, we are incurring new expenditure of at least £600,000 because of some other new circumstances, because our relations with Britain are friendlier, because the European situation appears to be <Col N="739" /> easier than it was.  It is the kind of a picture that I am not prepared to accept&mdash;that we are spending nearly £1,000,000 more because we have made peace with a country which was regarded an enemy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So that we will not appear to be splitting hairs or arguing at cross-purposes, may I say that I thought I had made it clear that we were seriously perturbed about the defence situation long before November, but in November we came to a point at which we said: &ldquo;We shall have to get on to this and know the basis on which we are going to work.&rdquo;  If we had not made the Agreement we would probably have to be looking for a larger sum of money to meet the new situation.  I do not know whether it would be more or less, but we would have to envisage a situation in which there would have to be an expansion of defence.  It may have been on a different foundation, but we certainly would have to expend money for defence if we had no Agreement.  With the Agreement we have a new situation which does not relieve us from the dangers.  It is, of course, still a fairly indefinite figure.  It was a sum introduced without any close itemised bill, so to speak, indicating to a nicety so much for this and so much for that. It was a rough sum which we felt was necessary to cover the various aspects of defence that we could foresee, and in them the question of the ports.  If the ports required all of it, it would be available; if they required only portion, that portion would be available; and if the ports required none of it, the whole of it would be available in other directions.  That is really the situation, and I do not wish the Deputy to be arguing on a false basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I have followed the latest statement of the Taoiseach, it is to the effect that, last November, the Government made up its mind that further expenditure on defence was required.  I take it that these Estimates were not prepared prior to last November, and yet there is not a penny in this Book of Estimates, which was prepared subsequent <Col N="740" /> to November, to indicate any increased defence.  I do not believe the Government was entirely negligent of its responsibilities for the last six years.  What occurred last November to make the position of the country more critical than, let us say, the previous November?  One thing that happened in or about that time was that endeavours were being made to improve relations between Great Britain and Italy.  Those relations had been the chief powder magazine for a few years previously, and yet, at a time when, so far as the man in the street or the Deputy in the Dáil was concerned, things appeared to be improving, the Government suddenly made up its mind that there had to be vastly increased expenditure because the country was insecure.  That was at a time when all appearances indicated an improvement, but it was not included in the Estimates for the year which were not completed in November. It was, however, included in the Budget which came along immediately after the Pact with Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be frank on this point, and I will repeat what I have said in order to show that I am not hedging.  I regard isolated ports here and there on an island as being vital for co-operation between land and sea. If there is a reasonable policy or plan for co-operation in matters of common defence, because, as I said before, I look on the two islands as inter-dependent to a very big extent, commercially and geographically, one unit for purposes of defence&mdash;between our forces in those ports and any navy &mdash;let me put it that way to make it easy&mdash;of sufficient strength to provide an adequate sea force outside, no matter how objectionable it would be sentimentally, I would give the Government every penny they would ask and I would say: &ldquo;At last you are proceeding along, healthy and sound lines with regard to the security of the country and the safety of the citizens.&rdquo; But if you propose to spend as much as one penny on a port without any understanding or co-operation with any naval power, then that expenditure of one penny is unjustifiable and there is no defence for asking the people to put it up. <Col N="741" /> I say that the other policy, accepting the fact that there is neither a commitment nor an understanding, would be nationally as objectionable to me as to the people on the opposite benches, but it would at least be sound, and because of its soundness I would support it, and more if it were wanted. I have, however, come to a stage in ordinary affairs and in public affairs at which I am not prepared to vote money for a pig in a poke.  If we have to face up to our responsibilities over here, the more so should the Government face up to its responsibilities. They should not shy at enunciating the policy or plan or idea and having shied enunciating the policy or plan or idea, having shirked that then come to the Dáil and ask for the money for causes unknown, for reasons not specified.  Now with regard to some details in connection with the Army to which I would like to call the attention of the Minister, a publication appeared in some of the papers lately with regard to retiral conditions for officers.  I do not know whether it was official or unofficial, authorised or unauthorised.  Perhaps the Minister would put me right on that point.</P>

The message that came back here was that such copy was not available. I mention that because, possibly, I may be incorrect in my references to the age limits.  I am speaking from memory, from my recollection of a thing I saw in the newspapers some time ago.  The only point I am about to make is this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that these retiral regulations can be justified seeing they are on a par with those in the British, French or German armies.  If our conditions here were similar to those in the British, French or German armies then I would say what is good for one is good for another and what is fair <Col N="742" /> is one case is fair in another case. But I think the Minister lost sight completely of this fact&mdash;I think the Taoiseach will realise that it is a point worth considering&mdash;our Army grew up out of certain conditions.  Certain people were generals, certain people were privates.  The span in years between general and private was not a span of five years.  They were pretty much the same age.  There was not a grey head in the whole of the Army.  There was the bloom of youth on all; brown and black hair, no matter how many pips on a man's shoulder.  They were all the same age 16 or 17 years ago.</P>
    <P>Since that time there have been squeezes, purges, and demobilisations. In accordance with the new conditions less and less money was expended and the Army shrank.  It is mainly true to say that the best in age and rank were retained.  But the span in years between those at the very top and those of the lowest commissioned rank was still the same, namely a few years. Obviously with an Army being purged, reduced and restricted, officers were going month after month and year after year.  In that set of circumstances there was no opening, no opportunity for as much as half-a-dozen promotions per annum.  No matter how good a captain was, no matter how well trained he was, if he were a captain of the fibre that could be a field-marshal in another army, the opening was not there to promote that man and he is still a captain.  There were certain promotions, welcome promotions, made from lieutenant to captain.  Speaking from memory, in ten years or if you like to go as far as 14 years, I think it would be correct to say that there were not 50 promotions from captain to higher rank. The ordinary promotions through the Army that exist in other armies with similar retiral provisions to ours are not there.</P>
    <P>Now those men are rapidly approaching the danger mark of 45 years of age where they get kicked out in the world, merely because they are 45 years; not because they are not competent and not because they are not highly trained.  Speaking as an outsider, I say that it is no injustice to <Col N="743" /> any other line in the Army to mention that far and away the most highly trained line in the Army is the line of captains, because they have been junior officers for some 16 or 17 years. Most of them being junior officers they have had to do every course of instruction from the more or less amateur courses that we used to have some years ago to the highly academic type of course that has been held since the whole school has been run as a special military school.  These officers have done every course and they have remained captains.  Others because of their seniority have been exempted from many of the courses.  But the most highly trained line is the line of captains.</P>
    <P>In other armies it is normal to put out a captain at the same age as ours because if he reaches that degree of seniority in years without being promoted there is something wrong.  He has been inefficient; his conduct has not been above reproach or he has failed to pass certain standards and tests.  Again, if you come to the rank of major, if a man has been so many years a major and a man has been a certain age without getting to the line of colonel he goes.  That is a pretty fair system so far as opportunities for promotion are available.  It is a brutal system if opportunities for promotion are not there.  I am not debating, I am speaking with a very vague and rusty knowledge of the figures.</P>
    <P>I generally do note Army promotions in the newspapers.  I have seen ample promotions from second lieutenant to lieutenant and from lieutenant to captain.  But promotions from commandant up are as rare as a white blackbird. There may have been more than I state.  If so, I take the official figures.  I can give the Minister evidence from one service with which I was intimately associated&mdash;the Army Medical Service.  In the year 1922-1923, we had 29 dental officers&mdash;qualified dentists.  They were young men then. They were well qualified.  They had two lieutenant's pips on their shoulders 16 years ago.  Twelve of these seized one opportunity or another to get out. The other 17 are lieutenants still and <Col N="744" /> they will go out in a year or this year under that Order, because they have reached a certain age.  There was no promotion in the Army Dental Service since the year 1922.  In the year 1922-1923- or it may have been in the year 1923-1924, one man was taken and made a captain and he is a captain still.  All the rest are lieutenants.</P>
    <P>The Army has been normal for some years back.  Is it fair play to those 17 lieutenants, qualified professional men, 16 or 17 years after they joined that they are still lieutenants? Is it not simply inhuman to say to these men &ldquo;because you are lieutenants still; because you are married now and have children and because you stuck to the Army when others left you will have to go out in a couple of years' time; you have lost civilian opportunities, you are just beyond the age for any appointment and you can exist not on the pension of a professional man but on the pension given for the pips on your shoulders.&rdquo;  I already stated a case and a sound and true case against the principle of pensioning officers or men on any other basis than their pay.  At that time I stated that following the pension regulations the next step would be the retiral regulations.</P>
    <P>Now we have grievances unremedied, and all the harm that could be done to at least one group of officers and men&mdash;officers and men on special rates of pay, pensioned, not according to their pay, but according to their rank. We have the ranks still down.  We have the pension down because of the rank, and now, one of these days, we are going to fire these men out of the Army because of their rank.  It is fair play that I am looking for, and nothing else.  The Minister is not prepared, nor is anybody in his Government or in his Party prepared, to say that justice has been done to that group of dental lieutenants, who were dental lieutenants in 1923 and who are dental lieutenants still.</P>
    <P>Now, I am only speaking of a group with which I had a certain close association.  The reply may come, as it did before: &ldquo;Why did not you promote them when you were there?&rdquo;  The answer is that all the time I was there I was trying to hold a few men in. <Col N="745" /> Hundreds were going out every morning. The Army had got to be reduced from 60,000 or 70,000 down to 5,000 or 6,000.  With men going out every morning, that was not the time you could get an opportunity or a chance of promoting anyone.  The Minister has done one proper thing since those days: He has ensured that the lowest rank&mdash; at least within 12 months&mdash;of doctors in the Army Medical Service would be captains.  That is quite a proper thing. It is the normal procedure in other armies that after six months' probation they either leave the army or become captains.  The same applies to dentists in other armies.  Here, however, they were ignored, and they are still lieutenant dentists.  There is no difference between the professional qualifications of an army doctor or army dentist.  It is merely that their numbers were small, and because of that they were overlooked.  That is the charitable view and I hope that, having called attention to it in what I might describe as a noisy way, that particular grievance will be rectified.</P>
    <P>With regard to the retiral regulations, I would urge on the Minister not to take anything and everything that is dished up to him.  Very often, in great Government Departments, there is an inclination to look for a headline elsewhere&mdash;in some other country similarly circumstanced or similarly placed.  Anybody taking up the British retiral regulations might say: &ldquo;Those are the British retiral regulations, and should they not be good enough for us?&rdquo;&mdash;forgetting that conditions are different.  At first sight, one would be inclined to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to that question, but it must be remembered that conditions are totally different and will be so for the next 20 years, or certainly, say for the next ten or 14 years.  The avenues for promotion and the opportunities for promotion were not there for the last 17 years.  It was quite the reverse.  Men were going out as redundant.  Remember, officers could not get their gratuities, they could not get two or three years' pay, as the case might be, in lieu of pension, except they were regarded as redundant.  A lenient view was generally taken, so that a man coming out without a pension would get his gratuity, but because of <Col N="746" /> that lenient view it meant that you could not promote anybody else to fill his place, because one file would be calling the other file a liar&mdash;one file would be contradicting the other.  We were letting men go for 15 years, and no others could be promoted.  Conditions outside the Army were responsible for that state of affairs, but no matter what the cause was, that was so.  Now these men are to be fired out at an early age because they have not been promoted.  I say that there should be some modification in that regard.  You might easily exempt or exclude from the terms of that regulation, let us say, people who were in before 1925, or 1924, or before a certain date, and special consideration could be given to their age, rank, and efficiency.  I understand that there are provisions in that regulation for extending the Army life of an officer in certain special services by ten years.  These are services where the officer, in the professional sense, may be regarded as a qualified man.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was drafting that regulation, did anybody call his attention to the fact that it is only a span of years ago since the commanding officer of every one of those special services was a major-general?  The commanding officer of every one of those special services to-day is either a major or a commandant&mdash;that is, four ranks down on top; but what about the fellow below?  How could he hope for promotion? The whole thing was being driven down like a concertina, on top, so that there was no hope of any junior officer ever getting his head above that of his neighbour.  Those were the conditions that prevailed, rightly or wrongly, and because they prevailed, the family men, the professional men and, what is worse still, the men who have no profession, are to be fired out at an age when they are just too old for everything and not young enough to make a new start in a life with which they have not been familiarised in the past.</P>
    <P>On the face of it that regulation, particularly when studied in conjunction with the pension regulation, is inhuman to the extent of brutality.  I do not believe you would get either or <Col N="747" /> both of them approved by any group of officers anywhere in the world if they understood the conditions that prevailed in this Army for the last 15 or 16 years.  Now, I do not believe there is a serious intention on the part of the Minister or the Government to do either a brutal thing or an unjust thing.  I would ask them if, having looked into the thing again in the light of the history of the Army, the conditions under which people had to serve, and the absolute impossibility of there ever being as much as one promotion&mdash;certainly not a number worth mentioning&mdash;they are satisfied that, in view of the past and in view of the impossibility of making promotions, either of two things will be done.  I would ask that the Minister, first of all, call for a return of all officers showing the number of years they have been in their present rank, their conduct sheets, their official tests and examination records during those 15 years.  If he finds they have been, say, more than 12 years in one rank, that their conduct was good, that their record card showed efficiency, that their college test showed ability, I would ask that he will do either one of two things: that he will either alter the retiral regulation or that he will forthwith, even if it makes a certain line redundant, promote all such officers to the next higher grade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told by the Minister for Finance and by the Taoiseach that a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced at a later date to provide for the abnormal expenditure on armaments which was foreshadowed in the Budget.  It may, therefore, be desirable to postpone the discussion on the wisdom or otherwise of that expenditure until such time as we see the Supplementary Estimate and have a detailed statement in support of it.  There are one or two administrative matters which I should like to raise on this Estimate, because they come within the ambit of the Minister's jurisdiction.  There is quite a substantial number of married soldiers resident in quarters on the Curragh Camp.  Their wives and children reside there with them, and, <Col N="748" /> accommodation is provided for them by the Army authorities.  Up to 1929 I understand it was the practice of the Army authorities to charge a rent of 5/3 per week for what was a kitchen and two bedrooms&mdash;the kitchen might be described as a kitchen-living-room&mdash; but in 1929 a new Order was introduced increasing the rent for that type of accommodation from 5/3 to 10/6.</P>
      <P>If the accommodation was regarded as value for 5/3 up to 1929, I cannot imagine what set of circumstances justified the Army authorities in increasing the rent by 100 per cent., especially for accommodation of such a limited and unsatisfactory kind.  Not only was the rent increased in those cases, but where the soldiers whose time had expired sought to reattest in the Army, they were reattested on a lower marriage rate than formerly obtained.  Those who were accepted and reattested not only were paid a reduced marriage allowance but found their rents increased by 100 per cent. I do not know on what grounds the Minister for Defence can seek to justify a rent of 10/6 per week for three rooms in a rural area such as the Curragh Camp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of those people found the rent so hard to pay that they sought to evacuate the married quarters provided for them at that rent and tried to get cheaper accommodation outside. When they sought better accommodation at a lower rent they were told that if they left the quarters on the Curragh Camp their marriage allowance would be stopped from them. When they tried to get away from the Minister for Defence as a rack-renting landlord, they found that the Minister &mdash;I do not say the Minister personally, but the Minister officially&mdash;retaliated by saying: &ldquo;Well, if you cease to be my tenant I will pay you no more marriage allowance.&rdquo;  It is difficult to justify conduct of that kind on the part of anybody, but it is particularly difficult to justify it when you find a State Department, which ought to be the embodiment of justice, resorting to methods that ought to bring a blush of shame to the worst landlord in the State.  I do not know whether or not the Minister is conversant with the <Col N="749" /> procedure, but as a Deputy for County Kildare, I do know that there is a very considerable volume of discontent on the Curragh Camp amongst the soldiers and their wives because of the high rents charged for the limited and unsatisfactory accommodation at the Curragh.  I think it is time the matter was investigated.  In the County Kildare adjoining the Curragh Camp, you can rent a labourer's cottage with three rooms, or four rooms in some cases, with half an acre of ground, for 2/6 per week.  The accommodation is better and healthier than that provided in the Curragh Camp.  The Minister will not allow the wives of soldiers and their families to occupy a labourer's cottage, if they can get a labourer's cottage, unless they are prepared to relinquish the marriage allowance which is their sole means of sustenance. That is obviously a matter which should beget the sympathetic consideration of the Minister, and I hope he will undertake to look into it in order to remedy this grievance.  It is patently unfair that soldier A, with a wife and four children living on the Curragh Camp in three rooms should pay 5/3 per week for that accommodation, while soldier B, living in the flat next door, pays 10/6 for precisely the same type of accommodation.  I do not think it can be justified, and I should like the Minister to look into the matter with a view to remedying not merely the anomaly but the injustice which has arisen from the decision of 1929.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the matter which has been touched upon by Deputy O'Higgins, that is the issue of the recent Army Retirements Order. I have been told that the regulation is virtually a copy of a similar British regulation providing for retirements at similar ages and in similar circumstances, but I think the conditions which operate in the British Army and in Britain generally are entirely different from the conditions which operate in our Army here and in this country generally.  Under the Order I understand that lieutenants will be required to retire at 45 years of age, and that captains will be required to retire at 48 years of age.  One could understand a lieutenant in Britain or a captain in Britain being required to retire <Col N="750" /> at 45 or 48 years of age, firstly, because through the military colleges, they entered the Army at the age of 18 or 20 years, and immediately obtained a commissioned rank.  A lieutenant in the British Army at the age of 45 may have 27 years' service in that Army.  A captain in similar circumstances may have 30 years' service in the British Army.  But here we recruited our Army under revolutionary conditions, and many of the people who became lieutenants were 28 or 30 years of age before they were appointed as lieutenants. Many of them did not become captains until they were well over 30 years of age.  In 1922 and the years immediately following, many of those officers were forced to postpone the question of marriage because of the abnormal situation in the country at that period.  The result of that state of affairs is that you had men entering the Army, obtaining a commissioned rank late in life, and marrying at something above the normal marrying age for persons in their position.  Now, approaching 45 or 48 years of age, they have a young family dependent on them, or boys and girls who still have to be educated.  In those circumstances, the Order visualises that they must retire at 45 or 48 years, irrespective of their domestic circumstances, irrespective of their responsibilities, irrespective of what hardship is imposed on them by retirement under such circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that the officer ranks are not composed of the same type of people as comprise the officer ranks in the British Army.  In Britain the Army is selected as a career, maybe by a public-school boy belonging to a well-to-do family, with a private income, whose army pay is only a secondary consideration.  He may be prepared, at any time, to relinquish the army appointment and provide for himself with his private income.  In our Army the officers have no private income.  Their pay is their sole means of subsistence and the sole means of making provision for their families, and before we apply an order which, apparently, is identical with an order applicable to the British Army, we should recognise that there is a <Col N="751" /> vast difference between conditions here and the conditions operating in the British Army.  I know some of the officers serving in the Army, and this year, next year or the year after, many of them will be approaching from 45 to 48 years of age, when they will be required to retire.  They have young children who will not be able to work for many years.  Having borne the brunt of service in the Army for the last 15 years, they will now be turned adrift with a pension that is only a fraction, and not a big fraction, of their present pay as lieutenants and captains.  One could understand the application of a regulation of this kind if these people went into the Army at 18 or 20 years of age, but it is very unfair that those who went into the Army and got commissioned rank when well above the normal age should be required to retire when they reach 45 or 48 years of age, particularly in view of the heavy domestic responsibilities that confront them.</P>
    <P>Of course I should prefer if the Minister, recognising the abnormal circumstances in which these officers were originally recruited, would, in the case of those with long service, postpone the application of the retirement order until they could serve a longer period, and consequently be enabled to provide for their young children and to earn a higher rate of pension.  It would be all right to apply a regulation of this kind if these officers were recruited to commissioned ranks early in life.  As that is not the position of officers affected by this regulation, I urge the Minister to consider the matter sympathetically.  If it is not possible to do that as a general measure some special consideration should be given to the cases of officers whose domestic circumstances are such that their discharge on retirement from the Army, even with the pensions to which they are entitled, will for many of them be accompanied by real hardship and privation.  Deputy O'Higgins spoke of certain men in the Army whom he described as dental lieutenants, and he made the case that they should not be discharged.  While I do not want to detract from the case made for these people, I do not want the Minister to imagine that the merits <Col N="752" /> of this case rest solely on the submission he made.  The persons the Deputy mentioned are gentlemen with professional qualifications, and they can easily adjust themselves to civilian life and offer their professional qualifications for sale to those who require their services.</P>
    <P>I want to speak for another type of officer, the person who has no professional qualifications and who was attracted to the Army by the events of 1918-1922, or the events of the subsequenty year, who have no trade or profession such as those to whom Deputy O'Higgins referred, and who now, if thrown out of the Army at 45 or 48 years of age, will find it impossible to adjust themselves on anything like favourable terms to civilian conditions of life.  Many of these men have no definite profession; many of them have actually no trade that they could follow. Many are persons who merely had a reasonable competence or some occupation which was sacrificed when they went into the Army.  At that difficult age they will find themselves compelled to search for employment anywhere they can get it, feeling convinced all the time that they are never going to be able to command, in the present circumstances of the labour market, anything like the same income to which they had been accustomed during the last 15 years.  I join with Deputy O'Higgins in asking the Minister to reconsider the application of that order to officers who are likely to be affected by it in the next ten years, in the hope that if he cannot make a general modification of it, he will, at least, make such modification as will meet the worst cases of hardship that will arise under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking about another Vote, I think the Taoiseach laid particular stress upon the words &ldquo;adequate defence.&rdquo;  What did he mean by &ldquo;adequate defence&rdquo;?  Adequate defence can only be tackled if we are to repel a particular form of attack. Are we in this country ever likely to be attacked because we are Éire?  If we are ever going to be attacked it is because of our geographical position, and because we are, whether we like it or not, part of the British Isles, or, if you like, part of the British Commonwealth. <Col N="753" /> There are only five or six Powers that are ever likely or able to do that.  One can visualise the possibility that America, Japan, Russia, Germany, Italy or France might think it worth while to attack this island in some form.  When the Taoiseach talks of adequate defence he must have meant adequate defence from one of these Powers, and that defence this State could not provide.  It would be utterly impossible to do so.  All the man power and all the monetary power here would not go a hair's breadth towards providing adequate defence in such a contingency.  There is no use in fooling or talking about the matter in the way it was talked of here to-day.  I never remember a debate in which there was more make-believe, more getting away from the real issue, as to what should be done by an efficient nation and by an efficient Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forts that were referred to are to be modernised to meet modern conditions. I take it that forts like the Swilly are meant, behind which a navy could hide in safety.  We will never have a navy to lie behind those ports. It is utterly ridiculous to suggest that we here should start a navy that those ports would accommodate.  Therefore, those ports are meant to accommodate some other navy or some shipping of some other State outside this country, and we may as well acknowledge the fact.  There is no use going down to these places and saying &ldquo;we must do something.  Whether it is good spending or bad spending we will have to do something.&rdquo;  It is either meant to be adequate defence or it is nothing, and nobody is going to stand for waste of money without expert knowledge of what is going to be done by particular allies of ours, or those who are likely to be allies of ours in future.  It cannot be adequate except it meets their requirements, and to meet their requirements it cannot be done without consultation with them.  The Taoiseach must remember that for the last 16 years the British have not expended a penny on those particular fortifications, not a penny.  Are they up to date to-day?  Will they serve the purpose to-day as effectively as they could serve it 16 or 20 years ago, when they were <Col N="754" /> put into their present form of defence? What is likely to be the point of attack if you are ever attacked?  Is it from the sea or is it from the air, or in what way?  Modern attack and modern warfare are different things even from what they were in the last war.  Adequate defence, even from England, would have to be some form of defence besides port defence and defence in the sea. Aerial defence would seem to me to be the only possibility with regard to any European attack.  That is my opinion of the form it is going to take, and God knows what it will be in ten or 20 years' time.  But there is no use spending money to put in repair something which is obsolete, out of date, putting good, live money into dead contracts.  I want the Taoiseach to think what are the requirements, think intelligently of them, to consider what particular defence that he thinks is likely to be required, and what form attack is likely to take on this country.  If he does not do that, then it is money badly spent.</P>

As regards the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; that the Deputy has been playing with so much, I used the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; in exactly the way he wishes it to be used.  I laid stress on that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what the Taoiseach said and in no line of it did he give any indication that this defence was going to be <Col N="755" /> partly put up by our allies.  There was not one mention that England or Britain would help us.  If it is defence for them&mdash;and it is going to be defence for them&mdash;then I say they should bear 99 parts of the expense, and if it is going to be adequate defence in no other way can it be adequate.  I want some plain talking here in the beginning. If there is going to be money spent let it be well spent and do not spend it for the mere purpose of spending it.  Therefore, I say if you are going to give any meaning to the words &ldquo;adequate defence&rdquo; at all it must be only that sort of defence that would be considered adequate by Britain if she is going to help us, and that cannot be done without plain consultation with Britain. We ought not to be cowards here.  We should face it.  We ought not to be cowards because a certain phrase or form of words is used.  We should face the situation and say plainly what we mean because we are not able to deceive the people, except a very few ignorant people in this country, Personally, I would support in every way doing our portion of the defence of this country as part of the British Commonwealth.  We make no secret of that on this side of the House.  I certainly make no secret of it and I do not think the Taoiseach should make any secret of it either. It is outside of the question that we are ever going to be attacked by Britain itself.  That is outside of the question.  If they wanted to attack us we could not of ourselves put up adequate defence against them.  If we want to put up adequate defence against any other power it can only be in conjunction with Great Britain. I want that to be stated.  Be honest about it and have the courage and not be playing to that particular mentality that is let loose in this country.  That is all I want.  We do not stand over, spending the money of this country merely for the form of spending it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas Chinn-Chomhairle, I rise for the purpose of asking a few questions in connection with this defence scheme and the taking over of the forts in Cork harbour.  We <Col N="756" /> were all very pleased to witness the sight of these forts coming under the control of the Irish nation but, as always, some little thing, some grievance arises and in connection with this I would like to ask the Minister for Defence if the services of maintenance staff of tradesmen and workers who were employed by the British in Camden and Carlisle and also in Spike, which have been dispensed with by the British authorities before their evacuation, will be available and used by the Irish authorities.  Those people live in the little village of Crosshaven, just beside the forts I named, and their way of living for a number of years has been through employment in those forts.  Now, as I have said, their services have been dispensed with and I would like to ask the Minister if provision will be made for their re-employment under the present Administration or, if not, if the full staff will not now be required, then I would suggest to the Minister that compensation of some form should be available for such services they have given, either from the British authorities or in some other form. Many of those men have given very long service to the British authorities. They have during that time received, of course, regular employment but at the same time they have spent their money and supported their families in that village of Crosshaven.  Now there is no opening for them because, just like some of the cases we mentioned here awhile ago of the officers in the Army, these men have given many years of service and will not be able to compete in the open market even if they got that chance but the chance is not available because in those places in which they live the opportunities are not such as will absorb their services.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider their case and see if those men can be reemployed or, if not, probably some provision could be made for them now while the thing is hot and while, probably, the final negotiations have not been completed.  They are our own citizens.  They are all Irishmen and they have been employed there, but they are, I think, worthy of consideration. I do not know if the case has <Col N="757" /> been brought to the Minister's notice but I have had representations made to me from several of these employees and I am putting their case now to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I also have had representations made to me by men who, in my opinion, have a better claim on this nation's gratitude, men who refused to convey armed troops during the Tan war and who, on that account, were dismissed, who lost their livelihood, I might say, for a number of years because they were patriotic enough not to convey armed troops during the Tan war.  Those men are now available to be taken back into the services from which they were driven.</P>
      <P>We also have a number of men who were dismissed periodically, up to the last three years, from civilian services in those forts because of what were known as republican sentiments.  I consider that those men have a better claim on the Irish nation than the men for whom Deputy Hurley has been pleading.  Lists of those men, the positions which they held and the reasons for their dismissal will certainly be placed in the hands of the Minister for Defence.  I hope when that is done that those men will be reinstated because of their service to this nation.  They have far better claims than many others. As Deputy Hurley says, there are men being displaced now.  I say that their claim lies with the nation which they served.</P>

      <P>Listening to this debate this evening on the Estimate for Defence, it occurred to me that perhaps it might enlighten the situation if we looked at the position of small nations as a whole in Europe to-day and saw how far we, through the recent action of the Government, have improved our position, so far as our position in connection with defence is concerned.  It is my own belief that the position has been improved to this extent, that, considering the Estimate for Defence, we now have to recognise the fact that we are in those categories of nations that are not primarily the prey of great nations during time of war.  Under the Treaty we were placed in the position that we were very definitely in the categories of nations <Col N="758" /> that are peculiarly susceptible to attack, that are liable to be attacked by one great nation fighting another great nation for its own purposes, and attacking that great nation through the small nation.</P>
      <P>I am not speaking of the Treaty in the sense that I wish to make a point of it.  It simply so happened that, arising out of the Treaty, we were placed in the categories of nations within Europe that have suffered as a result of attacks made upon them by great nations.  The Great War was caused by the rivalries of great nations for various markets, and particularly the rivalries in the steel market.  The actual cause of the War was due to circumstances that arose in countries that were in the category of this country before the Agreement, countries in which there was some doubt as to their freedom of expression, some doubt as to whether they had not made some convention with other countries which would place them in the position of not being neutral.  That would apply in particular to countries like Serbia and Morocco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Great War had various effects on the small nations of Europe.  It crippled great Powers and created great bitterness among those nations that were defeated.  It created new States with minorities in which, again, there was a doubt as to the sovereignty of the State, a doubt as to whether its Government represented the people as a whole; and there were left untouched certain smaller democracies. It is very interesting to note at present that the dangers of war lie peculiarly within countries in which there is some doubt as to their fundamental position of neutrality.  The countries that are being attacked by those Powers that are ambitious and anxious to re-establish their position are countries where a doubt exists as to whether the Government represents the people as a whole.  There are examples in the new States where there were minorities formed by the Commission which formulated the Treaty of Versailles, countries in which there is financial influence, influencing the military policy of the country, such as the Balkan countries and the countries <Col N="759" /> which have definitely made military conventions with other countries, such as we had prior to the Agreement with England.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable fact that the countries placed in the same position as ours have not been endangered in any way by the events of the past year, and are still particularly free from attack of any kind.  I have in mind countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Holland.  Some of these countries touch at vital points the larger nations, and yet in many cases these nations have sworn they will never attack them.  Under the present Agreement, now that Clauses 6 and 7 of the Treaty are removed, we are entering the position of those smaller democracies that are free to express their own defence policy, to make the alliances they may desire to make, and no great Power would dare to attack them except under great stress because of the fact that any great Power so doing would increase the enmity of neutral countries and would endanger its position in time of war.  For example, if in a great war Germany were to attack Denmark, she would immediately arouse the hostility of neutral countries, because Denmark is free, she has no military engagements with large Powers, and in other respects it would be disadvantageous for the greater nation to molest her.  There is no question, no matter what might be the policy of the German Government, they would consider it only in the last resort good tactics to undertake to attack Denmark in time of war.</P>
    <P>Under the present Agreement we have achieved that position, a position which many Deputies are trying to deny the importance of.  They are trying to deny that it has a great effect on our future relations with England and the world in general.  In actual fact the position in time of war, although it may appear to have been entirely removed by reason of certain things that have taken place in the last year, has been tremendously altered. Large nations rivalling other nations and intending to attack them in time of war will refrain from doing so where there is no doubt as to the sovereignty of the nation and as to its free position. <Col N="760" /> They fear that the result will be that countries previously neutral may attack them.  It is a great triumph for this country that we have reached the position of those small democracies that are free from entanglements of that kind.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that we cannot make an alliance if we consider it right to do so.  If we retain the position that we are free, so long as we desire to be free we remove ourselves from the orbit of nations peculiarly attacked in time of war.  Deputies who look at the question from a large point of view and study the diplomatic history of Europe during the last 20 years can clearly distinguish the two types of small nations.  There are those types which, either through bankruptcy or a necessity for borrowing or through bad government or other reasons, have had to make entangling alliances, and as the result of being the prey of great nations are distinguished clearly from the other nations which would invariably be left free in time of war.</P>
    <P>We have to be realistic about this, because that position at any time might be altered.  It is only a matter of degree to say Denmark is freer from influence on the part of Germany in time of war than Rumania is because she has maintained her independent position.  But the question of degree might be a question of the difference between war and peace.  If these Estimates are looked at from the large point of view it will be more easy for Deputies to appreciate the difference between what, for example, Deputy Gorey had in mind when he was speaking, and what the Taoiseach had in mind when he was speaking.  That position of being free to determine the nation's attitude in time of war is one that has been of enormous value in preserving the peace of small nations in Europe during the past ten years. It is a position which this country should be proud to have achieved through the recent Agreement.</P>
    <P>There, again, I do not wish to appear to lack realism in this debate.  There is no question that it does not mean that we shall not be liable to attack, but it does definitely alter the degree in which we are liable to attack.  The <Col N="761" /> only bar to that is the fact that the country is partitioned, the fact that there is still any doubt as to the sovereignty of the whole island, that there is still any doubt as to what is the opinion of the people of the whole of Ireland.  When unity is achieved, we shall have reached the position of the smaller nations who have kept free from entangling alliances and who, as a result, are in a far more secure position to-day than at any time during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>It may be said that it would pay Denmark to open her ports to Germany or some other large Power in case of war, as in any event she would be finally involved if any of these large Powers should consider it necessary to use her ports.  Her position is precisely the same as ours.  She prefers to reserve her decision, taking whatever action may ultimately be advisable in any given set of circumstances.  It seems to me that that is the position we are in.  For that reason, I should like to defend the present Estimates of the Department of Finance on those grounds, that we have changed our position in a fundamental manner, to the great advantage of this country, and that, to a great degree, we have improved the prospects of remaining at peace in a time of great international conflict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. T. Linehan Mr. T. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently Deputy Childers is an optimist, because, first of all, he said that under the Treaty we were peculiarly susceptible to attack.  He gave us a variety of reasons, all obviously arising from a study of modern European history, as to why the position of this country had improved during the past 12 months.  He was not quite so optimistic at the end of his speech as he was in the beginning, because he qualified his remarks at the end by saying the difference now was that the degree of our danger from attack had been mitigated.  He made, to my mind, the rather peculiar point that we were now raised into the position of Denmark or the other Scandinavian nations which are not likely to be attacked by great Powers such as Germany and Italy or any other Power, because if any of these countries were attacked <Col N="762" /> it would create a revulsion of feeling amongst other neutral countries against the attacking Power.  I should like to agree with Deputy Childers on that point but I cannot.  Whether or no we have improved our position as compared with the position we held under the Treaty, I cannot visualise the position that Deputy Childers hopes for. I do not believe that in the strict realistic sense of the word &ldquo;war&rdquo;, there is the slightest difference in our position.  If there were a European struggle to-morrow morning, in which Great Britain were engaged with any of the other Powers&mdash;Germany, for example&mdash;does anybody think that if it is good business, from a warlike point of view, for Germany to attack this country or to use this country as a base of attack against England, that they will be prevented from doing so by the London Agreement?  Does anybody think that if Germany attacks this country, even though now we are supposed to be less susceptible to attack owing to what has happened during the last 12 months, we shall find the other neutral nations&mdash;Denmark, Switzerland, Holland, Norway, and Sweden&mdash;rallying to the Irish cause?  I wish I could believe it, but I do not think it is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have got to make up our minds that if we are going to be involved in a major European conflagration, we are just as likely to be involved in it to-day as we were ten years ago. If Great Britain were involved in a major European war, does the Deputy seriously suggest that this country is not likely to be attacked by any major European Power who wishes to utilise this country as a base of attack on England, or who wishes to attack this country because it would be, what might be called, a neutral ally of Britain's, from the point of view of supplying Britain with foodstuffs, by reason of the recent Agreement?  I believe that what has happened in the case of Deputy Childers is that he has made too intensive a study of the theoretical points of warfare without considering the practical effects of an outbreak of war.  I do not believe that there is any Government on the Continent who if they declared war on England would hesitate to send their <Col N="763" /> air squadrons over Dublin as quickly as they would send them over London, who would hesitate to send them over Cork, Galway or any of the larger towns in this country, simply because the Government of Eire had taken some action in the last 12 months which, according to Deputy Childers, has made this country less susceptible to attack.  Personally I cannot see that there is any likelihood of that.  I wish I could agree with Deputy Childers that we had reached the position as a result of which we were less susceptible to attack now than we were a year ago. I am very much inclined to agree with Deputy Gorey that no amount of money spent in this country, having regard to our peculiar geographical position, will put this country into a proper state of defence, into the state of defence that would be necessary in a European war, unless there is some co-operation with a larger European nation that would be an ally of ours.</P>
    <P>Passing from that and coming back to the Estimate&mdash;I do think that neither my speech so far, nor that of Deputy Childers has been particularly relevant to the Estimate&mdash;Deputies will notice that in the Vote under the sub-head of P (1)&mdash;Protection of Civil Population against air and gas attack &mdash;a sum of £1,000 is provided.  On the Estimate for Public Works there was a token Vote for equipment, and on that Vote I raised the point as to whether any serious consideration had been given to the liability of this country to damage from air attack in case of European war.  It is perfectly evident now&mdash;in my opinion it cannot be doubted&mdash;that if these ports are going to be modernised, if these ports are going to be made modern machines of war, we are far more susceptible to attack than we were a year ago.  If these ports are going to be put into the position of being modern efficient machines of war, they are very likely to be targets of attack for any European country that wishes to raid, with her air forces, this coast or the coast of Great Britain.  To provide a sum of £1,000 in this Estimate for protection purposes seems to me to be merely dealing with the position something on the lines of &ldquo;a <Col N="764" /> penny wise, a pound foolish.&rdquo;  If we are going to take adequate precautions against air raids, particularly in our larger cities, we might as well do the job properly and I do not think that the Minister would suggest that the sum of £1,000 is anything like an adequate provision, even to review the position of protection from air raids in the event of war.  I should like to ask the Minister what actually is being done or is it merely intended to have an examination of the position in view of some future developments in air raid protection in this country?</P>
    <P>There is another sub-head in the Estimate to which the Minister may have referred in his introductory speech but I am afraid, if he did so, I did not hear him.  Under the heading of AA&mdash;Custody of Civilian Prisoners&mdash;the estimate is £1,628, &ldquo;being the amount required to provide for expenses in connection with custody of civilian prisoners convicted under the provisions of the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, 1931.&rdquo; There was no Estimate last year for that.</P>

      <P>I also wish to refer to the policy of the Department of Defence.  Four years ago a number of people in the National Army reserve were dismissed from the reserve, particularly in the year 1934, and on the discharge forms they were stated to be discharged with character good and <Col N="765" /> everything else excellent.  The reason given for the dismissal was that their services were no longer required.  It was a remarkable coincidence that a number of reservists were dismissed in every county during the same period and that every one of these reservists happened to belong to a particular organisation.  They had not been convicted of any crime or even convicted before a summary court, but suddenly one morning there was delivered to them by post a document stating that they were being discharged from the reserve, that their character was good, and the work they had done excellent, but that their services were no longer required.  It was an amazing coincidence that every one of these reservists was a member of a particular organisation at that time&mdash;the League of Youth.</P>
      <P>The Minister was questioned in this House time and again as to the reason for dismissing these reservists, and he gave the same answer every time, that their services were no longer required, despite the fact that their character was good and their Army record was good.  The Minister in that very year had embarked on a scheme of recruiting, but he could not keep reservists of good character, and whose work in the Army and record had been excellent, because he did not require their services any longer.  It was perfectly obvious that these reservists were dismissed or removed for purely political reasons, because of their association with the League of Youth at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may justify his attitude, and I might agree with him, if his attitude in 1937 and 1938 was the same as in 1934.  If it was the policy of the Minister that reservists or members of the Army were not to take part in political activity in any form, I could see the justification for that.  If the Minister still holds to that policy, I would be inclined to agree with the Minister.  But the reason I raise these cases to-night is that the Minister has changed that policy, that the Minister has created a new force, and that he has permitted and his Party encourages the members of that new Volunteer force to become active political partisans in their districts; that they <Col N="766" /> act as secretaries of cumainn, as secretaries of executives, and as polling agents and sub-agents for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I ask the Minister, in view of the fact that reservists were dismissed from the reserve of the National Army in 1934 for association with a political group, the League of Youth, how does he justify the continuance of members of the new Volunteer force and officers of the force as active political partisans and paid political agents?</P>
    <P>I would agree with the Minister if it was a case that what was the rule for one was to be the rule for all.  But the Minister was harassed for a whole year with questions as to the reasons why these reservists were dismissed in 1934, and he gave no other answer than that their services were no longer required. He has permitted to grow up in one branch of the Army to-day an entirely political force, because the members of the force are encouraged to be political partisans.  The members of that force are well known and active members in every constituency of the Fianna Fáil Party, and I ask the Minister now, if it were wrong in, 1934 to be a member of a political group, why is it right for a member of the Army to belong to a political group in 1938?  If the Minister is satisfied that he was wrong in 1934, and that these reservists should not have been dismissed for participation in political activity, will he reinstate these reservists now, and make up to them the monetary and other losses they suffered by being dismissed in 1934 before the Minister changed his mind as to what was proper political activity in the Army?  A number of people in this country suffered very heavily through the Minister's action.  It is not the best thing in the world to be looking for a job in this country or in England, or anywhere else, if your only recommendation is a discharge from the Army because your services were no longer required.  It is as much as to say that you were kicked out.  If the members of the new Volunteer force are entitled to participate in political work, it is due to these reservists that the Minister should reinstate them now, because he was wrong in dismissing them in 1934.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> There is another point which I should like to make.  Everyone who has spoken from the Government Benches either on External Affairs or the Defence Estimate, has talked about the need for increased money for the Defence services.  It was mentioned in the Budget statement and in a vague way by the Minister to-night that we might get a Supplementary Estimate. It makes me say, &ldquo;God be with the good old times, and the grand old days when the present Minister for Defence would get a stroke if there was one extra shilling spent on the Army.&rdquo;  It is not merely a question of the new Agreement or the new forts, or anything else, that has made the present expenditure necessary for the Army. When the Minister looks at his own Estimate he must be sighing after the good old days when he did not want an expenditure of £1,100,000 on the Army, because in his present Estimate &mdash;forgetting altogether the new Agreement and the new forts and Spike Island and Berehaven and Lough Swilly&mdash;there is an increase in the Estimate this year over 1929 of £400,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. S. Brodrick Mr. S. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to sympathise with Deputy Corry this evening. I suppose the speech he made is the shortest speech of his life, and the one appeal he made was to relieve the unemployed.  With the advance of this State, and after we have been told that we have complete independence in this country since the day before yesterday, the one thing Deputy Corry could appeal for was to relieve the unemployed, and his speech lasted, I think, about three minutes.  If we look back to the time when Deputy Corry was in his heyday on these benches, shouting about the Republic and &ldquo;not to budge an inch,&rdquo; or even to the last year since he went over to the other benches, we will find that he made very long speeches on the Army Estimate when it was discussed here.  It is very sad that, after coming from Cork and the taking over of the forts there, his speech to-day should last less than three minutes.  Then we had the Taoiseach this evening telling us about these forts.  He went in and out <Col N="768" /> and twisted about and back again. One would imagine that if we were to be attacked in this country we would be warned beforehand and be prepared for that.  There was his reference to being allied with Britain.  Deputy Mulcahy put six questions.  The questions were not answered by the Taoiseach, but he agreed with the Deputy's answers to the majority of them.  The Taoiseach made a speech lasting well over an hour.  Deputy Mulcahy's six questions and answers summed up the whole position, and the Taoiseach agreed with the majority of them.</P>
      <P>With regard to these forts, we would like to know what is to be the cost of defending them.  The sum of £600,000 has been mentioned for the four forts. That is the south-west coast from Cork to Donegal.  We are a bit interested in the West.  We have a very open coast.  There is an old base at the Killeries.  I am informed that it is quite easy for six British man-of-war vessels to get into the Killeries, remain there, and get out again in safety.  If we are serious about defence we will have to be up and doing, and we ought to know what the cost is going to be and for whom we are doing it.  Then there is the Shannon. You have the coast from Galway to Donegal.  Warfare has changed very much since these forts were built 129 years ago.  One would imagine, listening to what is being said at the present day, that if war were to be declared on Britain or on this country, those forts would be utilised as they were when first erected.  But look at what is happening in Spain.  I have seen it stated that since the war started there, over 500 aeroplanes have been brought down on one side alone. One would imagine from the talk that we hear in regard to the defence of this country and the forts that we have taken over, that if the country is attacked it will be attacked by the people who attacked it 129 years ago when the forts were erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is silly to be making the boasts that we have to listen to, that we have got more independence inside the last two days than we had six years ago.  Then we had this thing of flag-waving, taking down one flag and <Col N="769" /> putting up another.  I do not think it was the duty of the Minister for Defence to take over these forts.  I think it was the duty of the General in charge of the Army to take them over and have no more about it.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know something about the erection of flags on public buildings during the last few weeks. They have been erected on Civic Guard barracks.  I would like to know if the structures that have been put up are to be of a permanent nature, and out of what fund the cost is to be borne.  I would also like to know something from the Minister for Defence about his visit to Collins Barracks a few nights ago&mdash;on Monday night, according to a report in the <i>Daily Express</i> in its issue of yesterday, which I have here.  It says: &ldquo;Twelve miles away, in Collins Barracks, Cork&rdquo;&mdash;this refers to the taking of the forts&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Frank Aiken, Éire's Minister for Defence, called for three cheers for the King.&rdquo;  This is the gentleman who 12 months ago said there was nothing but a republic for this country.  Is that the teaching that the Irish Army are going to get?  Is that what men fought and lost their lives for in the last 16 years? The Minister for Defence is the very same man who was the cause of these men losing their lives for the one word &ldquo;republic,&rdquo; and to-day he is shouting, over the men who lost their lives, three cheers for the King, in an Irish barrack.</P>

We want to be straight over this, to know where we are and what we are paying for.  I also wish to know, what is the Irish Army being brought up for?  We have Irish-speaking battalions.  You cannot have a <Col N="770" /> nation without a language.  The Minister in charge of that force asked it, in English, to say: &ldquo;Three cheers for the King.&rdquo;  No wonder, because he got plenty of support at the last election from the King's supporters.  Were it not for that there would be a different tale to tell.</P>
      <P>When we are dealing with wars, I would like to know what was the result of the little war we had lately.  I am sorry Deputy Brennan is not here, but perhaps Deputy MacEoin may be able to tell us something about it because, I think, it was fought in his area.  This is the war that ended a few days ago between the &ldquo;Blues&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Reds.&rdquo; All that I could see was that the &ldquo;Blues&rdquo; won.  They have always won. They won 15 years ago, and won again a few days ago, I am told.  Leaving that aside, I want to know what was the cost of that little war.  I do not see any provision for it here in the Estimates.  It is rather funny to be mobilising men, and then to be saying that there is no sign of conscription in the country.  At the same time, I am informed that before a lorry driver can get a job to take beet to the factories in November next he will have to be able to show that he drove one of those lorries at the manoeuvres during the last ten days.  I would like to know from the Minister if that is a fact.  I hope it is not a fact.  If it is a fact, it is most unfair that men should be taken away from their civil employment in this country during the busy time, and be told that they will not get employment in the lean part of the year in driving beet lorries unless they have served during the manoeuvres.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  We have those manoeuvres and we are told that we are taking over these forts for the defence of the country.  Are we to have a navy?  I would like to know what advantage it is to this country to have a movement of 3,000 men around the country, hiding in woods and so forth, and having pretended battles.  I would like to know if, when we have manoeuvres again, the troops will engage in the new phase of war that the Taoiseach expects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I want to refer to, and that is the position of men asked to retire from the Army.  I think the Order that has been made is most unfair, asking men who have arrived at the age of 51 to retire from the Army.  What is the idea of it? Surely, a man at 51 or even 60 years of age is an active man.  It must be remembered, too, that those who are being asked to retire from the Army at 51 were men who joined it at a time when their services were of benefit to the country, and when men were needed.  They have certain commitments after their service of 20 years in the Army and after their service in the I.R.A.  It is most unfair to be treating these men as the Minister for Defence proposes to do.  Certain men will not be put out because the Minister cannot get men to replace them.  That refers to certain services like the engineering and medical services, but it is most unfair that the ordinary officer should have to go out at such an age.  As Deputy Corry has come back to the House, I may mention one sub-head on which he will probably support me.  I refer to A (3), which deals with the expenses of equitation teams at horse shows inside and outside the country.  That item amounts to about £3,000 per year.  Some years ago, we were told that these teams were going to the different countries &ldquo;like circuses.&rdquo;  I should like to know from the Minister what expenses these men get.  I believe their expenses are insufficient. They have earned a good name for the horse-breeding industry of this country since they started <Col N="772" /> travelling about ten years ago.  They are a credit to the country notwithstanding Deputy Corry's description of them as circus people.  These men are entertained in other countries and they have to do some entertaining themselves in return.  From what I can learn, their allowance is insufficient for this purpose.  I ask the Minister to consider the allowance of sufficient expenses to these teams.  As a result of their work, people abroad are more anxious to get Irish horses than ever they were.  Were it not for these teams, we would not have that position.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brodrick has referred to the allowance to officers who go on these tours to various foreign countries.  A gentleman was in with me yesterday and he specially referred to that matter.  He said that these officers, who have done a lot for this country, who have placed us to a great extent on the map and who have increased the market for Irish horses abroad, have nothing but their pay on which to rely.  The allowances given them were, he said, so very small that they had nothing left by which they could entertain other officers.  They are, therefore, unable to accept any invitations.  That is not a nice position in which to find oneself.  They cannot accept invitations because they are unable to give any return.  That is a matter which the Minister might consider.  It is rather important to these officers.</P>

      <P>I want to pass a comment on Deputy Linehan's statement, that people who were members of the League of Youth had been discharged from the Army.  I want to correct that statement slightly by saying that certain members of the Army were discharged because they were suspected of being members of the League of Youth.  Not in 50 per cent. of the cases in which these discharges took place were the officers members of the League of Youth. They were suspected of being members and the Minister did not take the ordinary, equitable view that they should be asked to show cause.  They were suspected of membership on the report of some twopence-halfpenny club, composed of a chairman, a <Col N="773" /> treasurer and a secretary, and then they were dismissed.  I would not at all disapprove of the Minister's action if the proper course were followed. If a man was a member of the League of Youth and had been warned and if he remained a member, the Minister would be entitled to dismiss him, but I challenge the Minister's right, or the right of anybody else, to dismiss a person on mere suspicion.  In those cases, where the persons dismissed were not members of the League of Youth, they should be restored to their positions and given the pay and emoluments to which they are entitled. I demand that, not as an act of charity but as an act of simple justice. I am aware of, at least, 15 cases in the towns of Athlone and Longford in which persons were suspected of being members of the League of Youth while they were not members of that organisation.  They may have voted for me, or for some Fine Gael candidate at a local election or for a Labour candidate.  Because they may have allowed their tongues to wag a little bit too freely&mdash;even the Ministers have been known to let that happen&mdash; they have to suffer this penalty.  In equity, they should be restored to their positions.  Investigation should be made in the cases where the persons concerned were not members of the League of Youth and were not guilty of any misconduct and justice should be done them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is customary to ask on this Vote what happened the munitions factory. We have had surveys by engineers. Cars have been employed to carry the Minister for Defence, Army officers and civil servants down to certain districts to see whether proposed sites would be suitable for such a factory. Yet there seems to be no advance.  I should like to know what exactly has happened.  Is the Minister satisfied that it is better to take the British manufactured stuff after all or is he going to take French, German or Italian stuff?  We are entitled to know that.  I should like to know what amount of money was spent on these surveys and whether the land was found suitable or not.  It has been a great scheme for the last three or four years to send out an inspector to look <Col N="774" /> at ground for the purpose of doing something.  When an election came on, the people concerned were told that the Government was going to take the land and treat them well for it.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the permanent Army Act.  I suppose that is relegated to the list of promises made to be broken.  I should like to know where exactly that promise has gone.</P>
    <P>I suppose we have to adapt ourselves in that respect to British traditions, and that there must be an annual Army Act setting out that it shall not be lawful for his Majesty to have an armed force without the consent of the Parliament, Lords and Commons.  Is that where we are?  It may be all to the good that the Taoiseach should not have a permanent force which he could order to do as he directed, but that he has to get the sanction of Parliament each year for it.  There may be a sound argument for that, but I should like to know the view the Government takes in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Lord Mayor of Cork has made a very important case with regard to civilians who have been, or are likely to be, discharged following the taking over of the ports.  Deputy Corry has said that they should be compensated by the Government they served, but I think he might leave that alone.  I do not think it comes very well from him, because if that were followed out&mdash;but I will say no more on that matter. There is an important feature of this matter in that these people have technical knowledge and can be of use to the Government here.  They can be just as valuable as the civil servants who were taken over.  I am not blaming the Government for taking them over, if it is in the interests of the State.  I do not know the South as well as I know the North&mdash;I, unfortunately, had to go up to the North a few times, and I know a little about it&mdash; but I am personally aware that there are technical experts in Dunree fort in Lough Swilly who would be of very great service to this country.  They are civilians, and when taking over these ports I think the Government should take them over too, and not leave it to the British Government to re-employ them or compensate them.  They are <Col N="775" /> some of the responsibilities which the Government must take over.  They are taking over the assets, and I think they should take the responsibilities as well.</P>
    <P>There are several other points on which I should like to comment, but there has been some considerable discussion and I do not want to dwell on these matters at too great length.  I should, however, like the Minister to say that a definite policy of defence has at last been drawn up, or if it is the intention of the Government to have a national defence plan.  I think the time has arrived when it should be realised that the question of national defence is not the obligation, the responsibility or the right of any particular Party.  It is the responsibility of us all because if the Government start on some mad-cap scheme, it is not they alone who will suffer, but all of us, as in the case of the economic war.  Therefore, they should take the leaders of the Opposition, both Labour and Fine Gael, into their confidence, explain to them exactly what their defence programme is and get an agreed programme with them, so that no matter what change of Government takes place, the defence of our country will be a matter for us all.  I put that to the Minister as a very important point and unless he decides upon it soon and avoids this political conflict over a matter which affects us all, he will not be doing a good day's work for the country.  When he does so, he will be doing a good day's work and we can then look on the question of national defence as something which affects everybody and in which everybody should take a part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to inflict myself at great length on the House.  I regard this whole situation from the point of view of national defence rather ridiculous.  Neither the Minister nor any member of the Government has given us any idea as to what the defences of the country are to be in future.  Some of the Deputies opposite talked about modern European conditions and about bringing us into line with them.  I wonder how we are to come in line.  I wonder is it realised how this country is situated <Col N="776" /> on the map in relation to other countries. I am sure the Minister knows better than I do that under present conditions, we have not got a hope of defending ourselves in an European conflict.  The Taoiseach has said that these Estimates were prepared last November and he said that none of the money was specifically intended for the ports or the forts.  I wonder what is the reason for all the extra expenditure for defence, and what are we going to defend.</P>
      <P>We started a couple of years ago an oil refinery at the North Wall; we have an air base on the Shannon; and now we have taken over three ports or forts.  I suppose it is generally accepted that if there is a war, Britain will be in it and we must take it that, after the last Agreement, we shall be in it.  What is going to be our defence? Are a few hundred extra men going to help us?  Are a few thousand gas-masks going to help us?  Are these forts going to help us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These forts are to-day what they always were&mdash;a protection for British lines of shipping, and a protection, perhaps, for British submarines in times of war.  That is what they are going to be in the future.  I should like to hear from the Taoiseach, or from the Minister, what those forts are intended for, if not to protect shipping of some kind or another in times of war.  I quite agree that we should have agreement with some other Power if we are to protect ourselves in future warfare, but I am not agreeable that we should defend ourselves against every Power in Europe.  I do not agree with the voting of money for the defence of this country against every Power in Europe, big and small.  If, however, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence can put up a scheme under which we shall cooperate with some other Power in Europe&mdash;I do not care whether it is England or any other&mdash;I am agreeable to the spending of money on it; but this whole idea of more money for defence, without any idea of defence, is a &ldquo;skite.&rdquo;  Who will defend Dublin, who will defend Limerick and the West of Ireland?  Where will the air-bases be&mdash;the bases that will defend our forts?  What about the guns of <Col N="777" /> these forts?  Those guns are no good unless you modernise them.  They are fit only to fire blank shells.  When you have paid for the new guns, what use are they to the rest of the people of this country, from Berehaven to Donegal, or from Clifden to Dublin?</P>
    <P>The people on the Government Benches talk of protection against war, the defence of our people, and about neutrality.  These are the things they have been talking about.  What hope have you of defending yourselves in times of war?  What hope have you of maintaining neutrality in times of war?  Mere sentiment will not feed or protect the people of this country in any way.  I am glad that the green, white and gold is now flown in Spike Island and Berehaven.  But what good will it do?  It did not do much good when flown on Dublin Castle 17 or 18 years ago.</P>
    <P>The thing we have now to consider is the future scheme of defence.  How are we going to defend ourselves in the Twenty-Six Counties?  Are we going to make everybody in the street who is drawing unemployment benefit, or everybody who is earning 30/- or 40/- a week, pay for these defences?  Are these people to be made to defray the cost of erecting these defences?  Then in the end we have no proper defences. I would like that there would be some cohesive plan of defence formulated. If there is such a plan it must be thought out in co-operation with some other country.  That is the point I am putting to the Minister.  Lacking this well-thought-out plan, how can the country protect itself?  I am certain that Ministers in their own minds know that.  I would like to know from them with what country they intend to co-operate?</P>
    <P>I do not want to recall the things said or the statements made by Ministers in the past 16 or 17 years.  So far as defence is concerned, I will be pleased if there is any kind of co-operation with the British or indeed with any other people.  I do not like this Vote, but there is no use opposing it.  It is indeed ridiculous to have this Vote now moved by the Minister in view of the attitude he and his Party have taken up in the <Col N="778" /> past 15 or 16 years.  To think of it is surprising, awful and terrible after what they have done.  It is astonishing that at this hour of the day, after all these years, these men can stand up and say: &ldquo;We want so much money to defend&mdash;not the Republic about which we have been talking all along. but&mdash;the position we now hold in the Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is one matter in particular to which I wish to draw the attention of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence.  The Minister some time ago made an Order for the retirement of Army officers on reaching a certain age.  The age, I think, was 47 or 48 years.  I had in my own mind certain views about the Minister's attitude when I read that Order.  But perhaps I misjudged him and that he really did not see the full implications of that Order.  If the Minister will throw his mind back to about 20 years he will realise that most of the Army officers affected by his Order were men who came into the Army at a very ugly time.  After a few years numbers of these officers were pushed out because of redundancy, inefficiency, or for some other reason.  The Army was then being reduced.  Those officers who remained had nearly all pretty good records in the years from 1916 to 1921. Some of them may, perhaps, be a little older than others.  All of them worked in Sinn Féin or in the Volunteers, and men who worked in Sinn Féin sometimes had very good work to their credit.</P>
    <P>I do not hold that one man is a bit better than another because he may have more courage than the other; but I do hold that the men who worked in Sinn Féin have just as good a right to recognition as those who used the gun.  Numbers of those who are affected by the Order are people who came into the Sinn Féin movement from 1916 onwards.  They came into the Army when the job was not a very nice one.  At the time too there was uncertainty as to the future.  No one could tell what Party or Government was to be in power.  However, these men came into the Army, did their work, struggled on and remained there since.  A great number of them have <Col N="779" /> now reached the age of 47 or there abouts and, according to the Order, they are to be fired out.</P>
    <P>A very serious thing in this connection is that in the last three or four years a number of men have been brought into the Army.  I do not want to cast any aspersion on these men.  I know some of them well.  These men were put in charge of the Sluagh. There is no limit of age in their case at all.  But the men who helped the Party opposite and our Party before 1921 are now going to be thrown out with only about two-thirds of the pension that they would be entitled to if they had retired in the ordinary way. I wonder are the Minister and the Taoiseach going to stand for that?  I am not going to cast aspersions on anybody.  I want the past forgotten but I want justice done to those men who helped the country from 1916 to 1922, who came into the Army at that time and are in the Army still.  These men are not very likely candidates now for any job outside.  Indeed I think the worst recommendation one could have in looking for a job is that he served this country from 1916 to 1922 and then served in the Army afterwards. I have repeatedly heard it said that that is the very worst recommendation a man could have when looking for a job.  I now appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Defence to reconsider the Order about the demobilisation of these men. Numbers of these officers thinking that their jobs were stabilised have got married and in this way have certain commitments.  They thought that whatever Government came into office they would not be thrown out until they had served the period of years that would entitle them to a full pension. These men could not have held their positions in the Army under the last regime and under the present regime only that they were thoroughly efficient officers.  Under all the circumstances it is a mean thing to throw them out now.  That would be all right in the case of armies like the British or French or German Armies that have been stabilised for centuries.</P>
    <P>In this country we had no stabilised army until lately.  It is, I think, a <Col N="780" /> terrible shame that the Order published by the Minister should be made whereby men who were fully competent and have fine records are cast aside. Perhaps the Minister made that Order without advertence to all the circumstances. He may have made it with the best intentions in the world, but if, in view of what we are now putting before him, he continues to put this Order into force, the only conclusion we can draw from it is that the Minister and his advisers have decided to get rid of officers who came into the Army in 1922. If he continues that Order I am afraid I will have to make up my mind that he has decided to get rid of these men who entered the Army in 1922.  These men, as I have already said, are thoroughly efficient.  They are in close touch with the rank and file of the Army.  If the Minister is adamant about firing these men out I will have to make up my mind that he is doing it to get rid of the men who joined the Army at the inception of this State.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this matter, Sir, I asked the Minister for Finance to-day the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If he is aware that the farmers in the County Longford whose lands adjoin the River Camlin have suffered severe losses for the past three years owing to the conditions of that river; that a memorial on the question was submitted by certain Deputies from the constituency two years ago; and if he can give an assurance that the work will be undertaken within the next few months, as this time of year is the most suitable for it, and great loss will be avoided if the work is completed before the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that question I got a reply which, to say the least of it, was very unsatisfactory. In his reply, the Minister admitted that a petition was signed and submitted by the Longford County Council in November of 1935, and he <Col N="781" /> also admitted that the further memorial, referred to in my question, was received in July, 1936.  He then goes on to say, in his reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Petitions for drainage schemes are dealt with by the Commissioners of Public Works in the order of priority, and it has not yet been found possible to arrange for an engineering examination of this proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is a very positive statement in itself.  In other words, he gives us to understand that the reason this proposal has been held up was due to the fact, first, that its position in the order of priority had not been reached, and, secondly, that the engineers had not yet been able to examine it.  Then, in the last paragraph of his reply, he sets out that there is a decision to set up a Drainage Commission to investigate the whole question of arterial drainage in the country, and he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The further investigation of petitions for drainage schemes under the 1925 Act has been deferred pending the findings of that body.  Consequently, no progress can at present be made with the Camlin River petition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there are two answers to the one question&mdash;one saying one thing and the other saying the other.  Surely, I am entitled to know, before I proceed much further, which of the two answers is the correct one?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they do contradict one another, but I am sure I cannot assist the Parliamentary Secretary to change his opinion.  However, here are the facts.  This is a river running <Col N="782" /> from one end of the County Longford to the other, right across through the centre, and it is one of the most agriculturally industrious parts of the county, inasmuch as the farmers there are all very small farmers and hardworking people, and their land&mdash;and in the case of a great number of them, the whole of their land&mdash;lies along the river.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago&mdash;before I was born, I suppose&mdash;an Arterial Drainage Board was set up there to carry out this arterial drainage scheme, and it functioned very effectively for a number of years, up to about 1926 or 1927. From that onwards, there was a campaign for non-payment of rates, non-payment of land annuities, and non-payment of drainage rates, and the result was that this Arterial Drainage Board, for one reason or another, broke up.  That is the easiest word I can put on it, although there are several other words I could put on it. It broke up through many causes, but I think the chief cause was the campaign for the non-payment of drainage rates.</P>
      <P>My submission is this: that when a local authority like that, for one reason or another, whatever it may be, ceases to function, there is a statutory obligation upon the Government Department concerned to take steps to make it function.  If a county council refuses to carry out certain statutory obligations with regard to poor law services, health or things like that, the Minister for Local Government and.  Public Health will immediately appoint a commission and compel that local authority, by way of mandamus or in other ways, to carry out that work, but, while the Office of Public Works has such authority, they will not exercise it.</P>

My information is that there is, and I shall try to get it for the Parliamentary Secretary, but, not being paid £1,000 a year for the job, I think it is <Col N="784" /> rather a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary to look into it than for me.</P>

      <P>Your lawyers and mine may differ, but my information is that you have&mdash;perhaps not a statutory obligation, but that you have a right which you could exercise if you so desire.  Anyhow, the fact remains that the Longford County Council, which is the premier body in the county, as we are told, sent in a petition to the Board of Works to do this particular thing, and they sent in that petition, as the Minister informed me, in 1935.  Several people whose interests were involved&mdash;that is, the farmers in the district&mdash;felt that the local authority were not moving fast enough, and they called in the two Parliamentary representatives for the County of Longford.  We submitted a further petition to the Office of Public Works and to the Minister for Finance, to the effect that this was a most desirable and necessary work, and pointing out the hardships that were being imposed on these people.  Now, several times&mdash;I do not want to say that I did it officially&mdash;but several times I have mentioned it, and there was always the excuse that no engineer was available to make the survey.  I am told now that that is so&mdash;that no engineer is available&mdash;and, secondly, that the whole question has been referred to a commission.  In the meantime, however, the banks of the Camlin are overflowing, thousands of acres are being flooded, and the poor farmers' hay, oats, turf, and everything like that, are being swept to the Shannon even to-day.  I admit that the weather is better to-day than when I put down the question, but the losses there are immense, and there is no doubt that, if the Parliamentary Secretary were to decide on an expenditure of anything from £5,000 to £8,000, very important and effective work could be carried out, and that that expenditure could be saved in one year to the farming community in that district.  £8,000 may not be much to the Office of Public Works, but it is a huge amount to those poor unfortunate people living <Col N="785" /> along that particular river.  I submit, Sir, that the answer of the Minister for Finance is ineffective, puerile, and shows that they have no intention whatever of dealing with this problem, although, remember, it has been made an issue at three elections; votes have been sought for by members of the Government Party and by independent members of Fianna Fáil who said that if they were elected the Camlin river would be drained within a month.</P>

      <P>I do not, Sir, because if I tried to renew an election war with the Parliamentary Secretary I would certainly get the worst of it. Never wanting to start a battle which I could not win, I will not take that particular line.  This is a very important matter.  I see Deputy Victory in the House, and I am sure he will agree with me in urging on the Parliamentary Secretary the absolute necessity of dealing with this problem immediately. Leave politics out of it altogether, because unfortunately the people who are living in that district are on both sides; they are Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and we cannot change them.  In the interests of the whole lot, I think Deputy Victory will agree with me that this is most essential work, and that this answer is not satisfactory.  I think Deputy Victory will join with me in urging the Parliamentary Secretary not to take this particular line, but to take steps to deal with the work at an early date.  There is a good deal of unemployment in the district, and it would relieve the agricultural community there to an extent that cannot even be estimated; it will be of very great benefit to them.</P>

I am very much interested in this drainage scheme.</P>

      <P>I am a Parliamentary Secretary, not a prophet.  I always like to be able to say the nice, kindly and satisfactory thing, but the facts have to be faced, and the facts, briefly, are as follows: The trustees upon whom the management of this district was placed ceased to function in 1932.  The validity of their election was questioned, and the objection was sustained. There was an attempt to make arrangements for the election of new trustees, but the drainage ratepayers &mdash;the people who were interested, the people who were being harmed by anything that was not done&mdash;by a majority voted against the appointment of drainage trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for the present position, therefore, rests on the drainage ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the legal position. The Office of Public Works has no statutory control in the matter, nor without the co-operation of the drainage ratepayers, which they have refused to give, have they any powers or machinery for resurrecting the defunct board.  That is the actual position. The responsibility for the neglect is due first to the trustees of that board, and second to the drainage ratepayers, who have refused over a period of years to set up any other trustees in their place.  I am told that this thing would cost somewhere about £8,000 and would produce a new heaven and a new earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At least it would leave a nice earth behind it.  We did make a rough estimate in 1926, and the figure for merely cleaning up the district then was £13,000.  I am not responsible for that estimate, but I have had experience of examining estimates made at that period.  I know what has happened since, and I know that £8,000 is not going to touch it; I wish it would. At any rate, when the ratepayers are asked to pay either the £8,000, the £13,000, or the very considerably larger sum which, mainly through their own neglect, has accumulated in this matter, they may not be so enthusiastic about it at all.  We do know that they have refused to set up trustees even to maintain the existing works.  If this were only one problem, if this were the only case in which this kind of thing had occurred and produced this kind of consequence, then we would undoubtedly say: &ldquo;Very well; we will find some way out of it,&rdquo; but unfortunately it is typical of a good many cases in which the drainage ratepayers have definitely refused to carry out their responsibilities, with consequences of this character, and have refused&mdash;even when we have tried to induce them to do so&mdash;to put into effect the machinery which the law does allow for the purpose of their repairing any defect of that kind in their previous conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of those questions have accumulated, and some general solution of them will have to be found.  That general solution, I hope, will be found by the Drainage Commission.  The Drainage Commission will have some very difficult problems to deal with, of which this is just one of a number of typical problems where people do want certain benefits and do not want to pay for them, where people have certain machinery for doing things and do not want to operate it, where people have allowed things to get into a certain state of neglect and refused to take the means provided under the existing law for putting it right.  It is because I think that in saying this I am benefiting all those who are interested in really solving those problems, as distinct from complaining about existing conditions, that I have <Col N="788" /> spoken in this way.  It is not that the people on the Camlin have done any worse or neglected matters any more than a good number of other people. I hope that out of the Drainage Commission will come that report which will enable matters of this kind to be dealt with.  The Deputy may take it that if anything could be done on the Camlin, relative to the other obligations that we have to other places, we would be very anxious to do it.  We may take it that any help which can be given now or in the future will be given, but nothing can be done now.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept a good deal of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.  I am grateful to him for some of his remarks, but not for others.  May I ask if he would undertake to refer this, as one of the first cases, to that Commission to examine? Secondly, I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that for practically 30 years this board carried out its functions very effectively, and that it was in 1932 it collapsed.  I want him in particular to note that year, because there was a considerable amount of activity for non-payment, not only of land annuities but rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; a very important year in the history of this country.  In regard to this matter I have had an estimate made by an engineer. I did not pay him, unfortunately, but I asked him if he could give me any idea of what it would cost to sink, widen and clear the brows of the river from the Shannon to its head, a distance of about 25 miles.  He gave me an estimate of £8,000.  Of course it is not so much the amount of stuff that is in the bottom of the river as the amount of growth, trees and everything like that lying over it.  To-day you are doing admirable work in cleaning up drains and rivers of one type or another in the countryside, but that is bringing down more water into that particular river, which in its choked condition cannot take it.  The immediate expenditure of £8,000, even as a measure of temporary relief, would allow water which is at present held up to get away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I submit that it would be much better to spend £8,000 upon the work to be done on the Camlin river than to spend £8,000 on the other rivers and passes during the coming year.  An amount that is now paid as unemployment assistance could be saved if men were put to work clearing up the river until September. That would result also in much better value being got for that money.  There are many unemployed in that area of County Longford, and I submit that if <Col N="790" /> the money now being paid as unemployment assistance were spent on that work it would be well spent.  There is no use bringing the water down to the river when it cannot get away.</P>
